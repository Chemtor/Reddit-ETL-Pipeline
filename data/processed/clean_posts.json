It’s that kind of position where I’m not really adding much value, but I’m also not bothering anyone.After 4 months of grinding leetcode and modern system design to get my technical skills back up to candidate standards, I now have some options to consider.Scenario A (Current Job):- TC: ~$260K- Company: A non-tech company with an older tech stack and lower growth potential (Salesforce, Databricks, Mulesoft)- Role: Overseeing mostly outsourced engineering work- Perks: On-site child care, on-site gym, and a shorter commute- Drawbacks: Less exciting technical work, limited upward mobility in the near term, and no title bump (remains an individual contributor)Scenario B:- TC: ~$210K base not including the fun money equity. - Company: A tech startup with a modern tech stack and real technical challenges (Kafka, Dbt, Snowflake, Flink, Docker, Kubernetes) - Role: Title bump to manager, includes people management responsibilities and a pathway to future leadership roles- Perks: Startup equity and more stimulating work- Drawbacks: Longer commute, no on-site child care or gym, and significantly lower cash compensationWould love to hear what you’d pick and why.",

I thought it was a great way to get off the dev treadmill and write mostly SQL day to day and it turned out I was really good at it, becoming a tech lead over the next 18 months. I'm trying to go back to dev now. So much stuff as a data engineer is completely out of your control but you're expected to just fix it. People constantly question numbers if it doesn't match their vibes. Nobody understands the complexities. It's also so, so hard to test in the same concrete way as regular services and applications.Data teams are also largely full of non-technical people. I regularly have to argue with/convince people that basic things like source control are necessary. Even my fellow engineers won't take five minutes to read how things like Docker or CI/CD workflows function.I'm looking at a large pay cut going back to being a dev but it's worth my sanity.

Even if there aren't any legitimate reasons, what are your devil's advocate arguments against using them?Maybe I am, indeed, the one who is crazy here since I'm interested in getting the thoughts of actual humans rather than ChatGPT, but... I've encountered quite the gamut of warehouse designs over the course of my time, especially in my consulting days. During this time, I've come to think of primary keys as \"table stakes\" (har har) in the creation of any table. In all my time, I've only encountered two outfits that didn't have any sort of key strategy. In the case of the first, their explanation was \"Ah yeah, we messed that up and should probably fix that.\" But, now, in the case of this latest one, they're treating their lack of keys as a legitimate design choice. This seems unbelievable to me, but I thought I'd take this to the judgement of the broader group: is there a good reason to avoid having any primary keys?I think there are ample reasons to have some sort of key strategy:* Data quality tests: makes it easier to check for unique records and guard against things like fanout.* Lineage: makes it easy to trace the movement of a single record through tables.* Keeps code DRY (don't repeat yourself): effective use of primary/foreign keys can prevent complex \\`join\\` logic from being repeated in multiple places. * Not to mention general \\`join\\` efficiency* Interpretability: makes it easier for users to intuitively reason about a table's grain and the way \\`join\\`s should work.I'd be curious if anyone has any arguments against the above bullets or keys in data warehouses, specifically, more broadly.Full disclosure, I may turn this discussion into a blog post so I can lay out my argument once and for all. But I'll certainly give credit to all you r/dataengineers.",

        "content": "Dear Fellow Data Engineer,I've been doing data for about 15 years (mostly in data analytics and data leadership - so not hardcore DE, but had DEs reporting to me). Recently, I joined a company that tries to build data models with full star schema normalization, as it was a transactional database.For example, I have a User entity that can be tagged. One user can have multiple Tags.They would create * the User entity* the Tag entity, which only contains the tag (no other dimension or metric)* a UserTag entity that references a many-to-many relationship between the twoAll tables would be SCD2, so it would be separately tracked when the Tag was first recognized and when the Tag has changed.Do you think this approach is normal, and I've been living under a rock? They reason that they want to build something long-term and structured. I would never do something like this, because it just complicates simple things that work anyway.I understand the concept of separating dimensions and fact data, but, in my opinion, creating dedicated tables for enums is rare, even in transactional models.Their progress is extremely slow. Approximately 20 people have been building this data lakehouse with stringent security, governance, and technical requirements (SCD2 for all transformations, with only recalculated IDs between entities) for over two years, but there is still no end-user solution in production due to slow velocity and quality issues.",

After a lot of effort, I got an offer from a known consulting company. The role was labeled as Data Engineer, and it sounded like the kind of step up I had been looking for — better tools, better projects, and a brand name that looked solid on paper.Fast forward ~9 months, and honestly, I regret the move almost every single day.There’s barely any actual engineering work. The focus is all on meeting strict client deadlines (which company usually promise to clients), crafting stories, and building slide decks. All the company cares about is how we sell stories to clients, not the quality of the solution or any meaningful technical growth. There’s hardly any real engineering happening — no time to explore, no time to learn, and no one really cares about the tech unless it looks good in a PPT.To make things worse, the work-life balance is terrible. I’m often stuck working late into the night working (mostly 12+ hrs). It’s all about output and timelines — not the quality of work or the well-being of the team.For context, my background is:•~3 years working with SQL, Python, and ETL tools ( like Informatica PowerCenter)•~1 year of experience with PySpark and Databricks•Comfortable building ETL pipelines, doing performance tuning, and working in cloud environments (AWS mostly)I joined this role to grow technically, but that’s not happening here. I feel more like a delivery robot than an engineer.Would love some advice:•Are there companies that actually value hands-on data engineering and learning?•Has anyone else experienced this after moving into consulting?Appreciate any tips, advices, or even relatable experiences.",

        "author": "roey132",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Continuing my latest post about vibe coding as a data engineer.in case you missed - I am trying to make a bunch of projects ASAP to show potential freelance clients demos of what I can make for them because I don't have access to former projects from my workplaces.So, In my last demo project, I created a daily patch data on AWS using Lambda, Glue, S3 and Athena.using this project, I created my next project, a demo BI Dashboard as an example of how to use data to show insights using your data infra.Note: I did not try to make a very insightful dashboard, as this is a simple tech demo to show potential.A few takes from the current project:1. After taking some notes from my last project, the workflow with AI felt much smoother, and I felt more in control over my prompts and my expectations of what it can provide me.2. This project was much simpler (tech wise). Much less tools, most of the project is only in python, which makes it easier for the AI to follow on the existing setup and provide better solutions and fixes.3. Some tasks just feels frustrating with AI even when you expect it to be very simple. (for example, no matter what I did, it couldn't make a list of my CSV column names, it just couldn't manage it, very weird.)4. When not using UI tools (like in AWS console for example), the workflow feels more right. you are much less likely to get hallucinations (which happened A LOT on AWS console)5. For the data visualization enthusiasts amongst us, I believe making graph settings for matplotlib and alike using AI is the biggest game changer I felt since coding with it. it saves SO MUCH time remembering what settings exists for each graph and plot type, and how to set them correctly.Github repo: [https://github.com/roey132/streamlit\\_dashboard\\_demo](https://github.com/roey132/streamlit_dashboard_demo)Streamlit demo link: [https://dashboarddemoapp.streamlit.app/](https://dashboarddemoapp.streamlit.app/) I believe this project was a lot easier to vibe code because its much smaller and less complex than the daily batch pipeline. that said, it does help me understand more about the potential and risks of vibe coding, and let's me understand better when to trust AI (in its current form) and when to doubt it's responses.to summarize: when working on a project that doesn't have a lot of different environments and tools (this time, 90% python), the value of vibe coding is much higher. also, learning to make your prompts better and more informative can improve the final product a lot, but, still, the AI takes a lot of assumptions when providing answers, and you can't always provide it with 100% of the information and edge cases, which makes it provide very wrong solutions. Understanding what the process should look like and knowing what to expect of your final product is key to make a useful and steady app.I will continue to share my process on my next project in hope it can help anyone! (Also, if you have any cool idea to try for my next project, please let me know! i'm open for ideas)",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm currently working with a medallion architecture inside Fabric and would love to hear how others handle the **raw → bronze** process, especially when mixing **incremental and full loads**.Here’s a short overview of our layers:* **Raw**: Raw data from different source systems* **Bronze (technical layer)**: Raw data enriched with technical fields like `business_ts`, `primary_hash`, `payload_hash`, etc.* **Silver**: Structured and modeled data, aggregated based on our business model* **Gold**: Smaller, consumer-oriented aggregates for dashboards, specific departments, etc.In the **raw → bronze** step, a colleague taught me to create two hashes:* `primary_hash`: to uniquely identify a record (based on business keys)* `payload_hash`: to detect if a record has changedWe’re using Delta Tables in the bronze layer and the logic is:* **Insert** if the `primary_hash` does not exist* **Update** if the `primary_hash` exists but the `payload_hash` has changed* **Delete** if a `primary_hash` from a previous load is missing in the current extractionThis logic works well *if* we always had a full load.But here's the issue: our source systems deliver **a mix of full and incremental loads**, and in incremental mode, we might only get a tiny fraction of all records. With the current implementation, that results in **95% of the data being deleted**, even though it's still valid – it just wasn't part of the incremental pull.Now I'm wondering: One idea I had was to **add a boolean flag** (e.g. `is_current`) to mark if the record was seen in the latest load, along with a `last_loaded_ts` field. But then the question becomes: **How can I determine if a record is still “active” when I only get partial (incremental) data and no full snapshot to compare against?**Another aspect I’m unsure about is **data retention and storage costs**. The idea was to **keep the full history of records** permanently, so we could go back and see what the data looked like at a certain point in time (e.g., *\"What was the state on 2025-01-01?\"*). But I’m concerned this could lead to **massive storage costs over time**, especially with large datasets.How do you handle this in practice?* Do you keep historical records in Bronze or move history handling to Silver/Gold?* Do you archive older data somewhere else?* How do you balance auditability and cost?Thanks in advance for any input! I'd really appreciate hearing how others are approaching this kind of problem or i'm the only Person.Thanks a lot!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey guys. I recently completed an ETL project that I've been longing to complete and I finally have something presentable. It's an ETL pipeline and dashboard to pull, process and push the data into my dimensionally modeled Postgres database and I've used Streamlit to visualize the data. The steps: 1. Data Extraction: I used the Fotmob API to extract all the match ids and details in the English Premier League in nested json format using the ip-rotator library to bypass any API rate limits.2. Data Storage: I dumped all the json files from the API into a GCP bucket. (around 5k json files)3. Data Processing: I used DataProc to run the spark jobs (used 2 spark workers) of reading the data and inserting the data into the staging tables in postgres. (all staging tables are truncate and load)4. Data Modeling: This was the most fun part about the project as I understood each aspect of the data, what I have, what I do not and at what level of granularity I need to have to avoid duplicates in the future. Have dim tables (match, player, league, date) and fact tables (3 of them for different metric data for match and player, but contemplating if I need a lineup fact). Used generate\\_series for the date dimension. Added insert, update date columns and also added sequences to the targer dim/fact tables.5. Data Loading: After dumping all the data into the stg tables, I used a merge query to insert/update if the key id exists or not. I created SQL views on top of these tables to extract the relevant information I need for my visualizations. The database is Supabase PostgreSQL.6. Data Visualization: I used Streamlit to showcase the matplotlib, plotly and mplsoccer (soccer-specific visualization) plots. There are many more visualizations I can create using the data I have.I used Airflow for orchestrating the ETL pipelines (from extracting data, creating tables, sequences if they don't exist, submitting pyspark scripts to the gcp bucket to run on dataproc, and merging the data to the final tables), Terraform to manage the GCP services (terraform apply and destroy, plan and fmt are cool) and Docker for containerization. The Streamlit dashboard is [live here](https://pldashboard.streamlit.app/) and [Github ](https://github.com/karthikgarimella37/EPL_Fotmob)as well. I am open to any feedback, advice and tips on what I can improve in the pipeline and visualizations. My future work is to include more visualizations, add all the leagues available in the API and learn and use dbt for testing and sql work. Currently, I'm looking for any entry-level data engineering/data analytics roles as I'm a recent MS data science graduate and have 2 years of data engineering experience. If there's more I can do to showcase my abilities, I would love to learn and implement them. If you have any advice on how to navigate such a market, I would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you for taking the time to read this if you've reached this point.

        "content": "After months of research and testing after i had a project to classify data into categories of a large 10m records dataset in [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lk78ub/the_nightmare_of_de_processing_free_text_input/), and apart from that the data had many typos, what i only knew is that it comes from online forms which candidates type their degree name, but many typed some junk, typos, all sort of things that you can imagineTo get an idea, here is a sample of the data: id, degree 1, technician in public relations 2, bachelor in business management 3, high school diploma 4, php 5, dgree in finance 6, masters in cs 7, mstr in logisticssSome of you suggested to use an LLM, or AI, some recommended to check Levenshtein distanceI tried fuzzy matching and many things, so i came up with this plan to solve this puzzle:1. Use 3 layers of spelling corrections using words from a bag of clean words with: word2vec, 2 layers of Levenshtein distance2. Create a master table of all degrees out there over 600 degrees3. Tokenize the free text input column, the degrees column from master table, crossjoin them and creacte a match score with the amount of matching words from the text column against the master data column4. To this point for each row it will have many cnadidates, so we're picking the degree name in which has the highest amount of matching words against the text column5. The output of this method tested with a portion of 500k records, and with 600 degrees in master table, we got over 75% matching score which means we found the equivalent degree name for 75% of the text records, it can be improved by adding more degree names, modify confidence %, and train the model with more dataThis method combines 2 ML models, and finds the best matching degree name against each lineThe output would be like this: id, degree 1, technician in public relations, degree in public relations 2, bachelor in business management, bachelors degree in business management 3, high school diploma, high school degree 4, php, degree in software development 5, dgree in finance, degree in finance 6, masters in cs, masters degree in computer science 7, mstr in logisticss, masters degree in logisticsI made it as a Python library based on PySpark which doesn't require any comercial LLM AI APIs ... fully open source, so that anyone that struggles with the same issue can use the library directly to save time and headachesYou can find the library on PyPi: [https://pypi.org/project/PyNLPclassifier/](https://pypi.org/project/PyNLPclassifier/)Or install it directly`pip install pynlpclassifier`I made an [article ](https://medium.com/@hamzahbdeveloper/introducing-pynlpclassifier-correct-the-spelling-and-categorize-large-free-text-input-data-using-da1a93408f30)explainning in depth the library, the functions, and an example of use caseI hope you found my research work helpfull and that can be useful to share with the community.",

My biggest issue/question would be the idea that specifically majoring in data engineering would make me less versatile compared to a computer science major. It would be nice to get some additional thoughts before I commit entirely. Also, the reason I am interested in the field is I enjoy programming, but also like the idea of going further into statistics, data management etc.",

        "content": "TL;DR We’re in the parking industry, running Talend Open Studio + PostgreSQL + shell scripts (all self-hosted). It’s a mess! Talend is EOL, buggy, and impossible to collaborate on. We're rebuilding with open-source tools, without buying into the modern data stack hype.Figuring out:* The right mix of tools for ELT and transformation* Whether to centralize all customer data (ClickHouse) or keep siloed Postgres per tenant* Whether to stay batch-first or prepare for streaming. Would love to hear what’s worked (or not) for others.\\---Hey all!We’re currently modernizing our internal data platform and trying to do it without going on a shopping spree across the modern data stack hype.# Current setup:* PostgreSQL (\\~80–100GB per customer, growing \\~5% yearly), Kimball Modelling with facts & dims, only one schema, no raw data or staging area* Talend Open Studio OS (free, but EOL)* Shell scripts for orchestration* Tableau Server* ETL approach* Sources: PostgreSQL, MSSQL, APIs, flat filesWe're in the parking industry and handle data like parking transactions, payments, durations, etc. We don’t need real-time yet, but streaming might become relevant (think of live occupancies, etc) so we want to stay flexible.# Why we’re moving on:Talend Open Studio (free version) is a nightmare. It crashes constantly, has no proper git integration (kinda impossible to work as a team) and it's not supported anymore.Additionally, we have no real deployment cycle, we do it all via shell scripts from deployments to running our etls (yep... you read that right) and waste hours and days on such topics.We have no real automations - hotfixes, updates, corrections are all manual and risky.We’ve finally convinced management to let us change the tech stack and started hearing words \"modern this, cloud that\", etc... But we’re not replacing the current stack with 10 overpriced tools just because someone slapped “modern” on the label.We’re trying to build something that:* Actually works for our use case* Is maintainable, collaborative, and reproducible* Keeps our engineers and company market-relevant* And doesn’t set our wallets on fire# Our modernization idea:* Python + PySpark for pipelines* ELT instead of ETL* Keep postgres but add staging and raw schemas additionally to the analytics/business one* Airflow for orchestration* Maybe dbt for modeling / we’re skeptical* Great Expectations for data validation* Vault for secrets* Docker + Kubernetes + Helm for containerization and deployment* Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring/logging* Git for everything - versioning, CI/CD, reviews, etc.All self-hosted and open-source (for now).# The big question: architectureStill not sure whether to go:* Centralized: ClickHouse with flat, denormalized tables for all customers (multi-tenant)* Siloed: One Postgres instance per customer (better isolation, but more infra overhead)Our sister company went full cloud using Debezium, Confluent Cloud, Kafka Streams, ClickHouse, etc. It looks blazing fast but also like a cost-heavy setup. We’re hesitant to go that route unless it becomes absolutely necessary.I believe having one hosted instance for all customers might not be a bad idea in general and would make more sense than having to deploy a \"product\" to 10 different servers for 10 different customers.# Questions for the community:* Anyone migrated off Talend Open Studio? How did it go, and what did you switch to?* If you’re self-hosted on Postgres, is dbt worth it?* Is self-hosting Airflow + Spark painful, or fine with the right setup?* Anyone gone centralized DWH and regretted it? Or vice versa?* Doing batch now but planning for streaming - anything we should plan ahead for?* Based on our context, what would your rough stack look like?We’re just trying to build something solid and clean and not shoot ourselves in the foot by following some trendy nonsense.Appreciate any advice, stories, or “wish I had known earlier” insights.

        "content": "Hello everyone, I have been hired at a startup where I claimed that I can revamp the whole architecture. The current architecture is that we replicate the production Postgres DB to another RDS instance which is considered our data warehouse. - I create views in Postgres - use Logstash to send that data from DW to Kibana- make basic visuals in KibanaWe also use Tray.io for bringing in Data from sources like Surveymonkey and Mixpanel (platform that captures user behavior)Now the thing is i haven't really worked on the mainstream tools like snowflake, redshift and haven't worked on any orchestration tool like airflow as well. The main business objectives are to track revenue, platform engagement, jobs in a dashboard. I have recently explored Tableau and the team likes it as well. 1. I want to ask how should I design the architecture?2. What tools do I use for data warehouse. 3. What tools do I use for visualization4. What tool do I use for orchestration5. How do I talk to data using natural language and what tool do I use for that Is there a guide I can follow. The main point of concerns for this revamp are cost & utilizing AI. The management wants to talk to data using natural language. P.S: I would love to connect with Data Engineers who created a data warehouse from scratch to discuss this further Edit: I think I have given off a very wrong vibe from this post. I have previously worked as a DE but I haven't used these popular tools. I know DE concepts. I want to make a medallion architecture. I am well versed with DE practices and standards, I just don't want to implement something that is costly and not beneficial for the company. I think what I was looking for is how to weigh my options between different tools. I already have an idea to use AWS Glue, Redshift and Quicksight",

But in order to use these nifty metadata UIs, the Snowflake analysts must use a role that has been transferred OWNERSHIP of the objects. Unfortunately, having OWNERSHIP also allows these analysts to drop, create and alter objects which are inappropriate privileges for most of them. Also, transferring ownership of Snowflake objects to many new roles is complicated and can effectively break views for end users and change our \"future\" role assignments. I wish there was a METADATA privilege that was dedicated to allowing the creation and management of object metadata, but there isn't. Does anyone know of a work-around?

        "content": "I am building a Liquibase foundation for one of our repositories and have a couple of questions in mind. I went through the official 'best practices' page multiple times, Liquibase forum and other pages, but still can't get complete answers. I am using community edition + PostgreSQL. I am a backend engineer, not a DB person.1. >Unless you are grouping several changes as a single transaction, we strongly encourage you to specify only one change per changeset. This approach makes each change \"atomic\" within a single transaction.I understand the reasoning behind this: some DBMS, including Postgre I use, auto-commit DDL statements such as *createTable, createTrigger,* so if I have multiple DDLs in a single changeset and error happens on the later one, Liquibase does not mark the whole changeset as \"RUN\", but because every successful DDL is going to be auto-committed, this creates a conflict whenever I retrigger the update.What is unclear to me is if I should **ALWAYS** create single 'atomic' changesets for DDL operations? I do createTable that should have a Foreign Key index so the next command would be createIndex on that FK. Logically, createTable and createIndex should be considered as a single operation so it makes sense to group them. But because they are DDLs, should I split them up?2. I am following Liquibase recommendation to have a separate changelog for rerunnable (runOnChange = true) logic such as functions / triggers. That is going to be similar question to #1. Because my trigger/function declarations have DROP IF EXISTS or CREATE OR REPLACE, I could group them under the same changeset. But is it correct? databaseChangeLog: - changeSet: id: periods-log-trigger author: XYZ runOnChange: true changes: - sqlFile: path: db/functions/periods-log.function.sql - sqlFile: path: db/triggers/periods-log.trigger.sql rollback: - sql: sql: DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS periods_log_function()3. Back to table and its trigger. createTable has auto-rollback out-of-the-box. Because trigger does not make sense without a table, when table is dropped, trigger is dropped automatically. Although I still need to drop the function used in the trigger.Because createTable and trigger changelog are two separate changesets, how should one manage rollback? Do I always need to write a rollback for trigger even though it is going to be dropped if table is dropped?Thanks everyone!",

Its running basic filters over 1B rows in 50ms (single node, no indexing), it’s currently outperforming ClickHouse by 10x on the same machine. I’m curious if this is interesting to people? I’m thinking this may be useful for:* real-time dashboards* lookups on pre-processed datasets* quick queries for larger model training* potentially even just general analytics queries for small/mid sized companiesThere's a (very minimal) MVP up at [www.warpdb.io](http://www.warpdb.io) with playground if people want to fiddle.

        "author": "backend-dev",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "What is a good approach when you want to insert an audit record into a table using dbt & Snowflake? The audit record should be atomic with the actual data that was inserted, but because dbt does not support Snowflake transactions, this seems not possible. My thoughts are to insert the audit record in the post-hook, but if the audit record insert fails for some reason, my audit and actual data will be out of sync.What is the best approach to get around this limitation.I did try to add begin transaction as the first pre-hook and commit as the last post-hook, but although it works, it is hacky and then locks the table if there is a failure due to no rollback being executed.EDIT: Some more infoMy pipeline will run every 4 hours or thereabouts and the target table will grow fairly large (already >1B rows). I am trying strategies for saving on cost (minimising bytes scanned, etc).The source data has an updated_at field and in the dbt model I use: select from source where updated_at > (select max(updated_at) from target). The select max(updated_at) from target is computed from metadata, so is quite efficient (0 bytes scanned).I want to gather stats and audit info (financial data) for each of my runs. E.g. min(updated_at), max(updated_at), sum(some_value) & rowcount of each incremental load. Each incremental load does have a unique uid, so one could query from the target table after append, but that is likely going to scan a lot of data.To mitigate against having to scan the target table for run stats, my thoughts were to stage the increment using a separate dbt model ('staging'). This staging model will stage the increment as a new table, extract the audit info from the staged increment and write the audit log. Then another model ('append') will append the staged increment to the target table. There are a few issues with this as well, including re-staging a new increment before the previous increment was appended. But I have ways around that, but it relies on the fact that audit records for both the staging runs and append runs are correctly and reliably inserted. Hence the question.",

        "author": "warleyco96",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,I'd love to get your opinion and feedback on a large-scale architecture challenge.**Scenario:** I'm designing a near-real-time data platform for over 300 tables, with the constraint of using **only the native Databricks ecosystem** (no external tools).**The Core Dilemma:** I'm trying to decide between using **Delta Live Tables (DLT)** and building a **Custom Framework**.My initial evaluation of DLT suggests it might struggle with some of our critical data manipulation requirements, such as:1. **More Options of Data Updating on Silver and Gold tables:** 1. **Full Loads:** I haven't found a native way to do a Full/Overwrite load in Silver. I can only add a TRUNCATE as an operation at position 0, simulating a CDC. In some scenarios, it's necessary for the load to always be full/overwrite. 2. **Partial/Block Merges:** The ability to perform complex partial updates, like deleting a block of records based on a business key and then inserting the new block (no primary-key at row level).2. **Merge for specific columns:** The environment tables have metadata columns used for lineage and auditing. Columns such as first\\_load\\_author and update\\_author, first\\_load\\_author\\_external\\_id and update\\_author\\_external\\_id, first\\_load\\_transient\\_file, update\\_load\\_transient\\_file, first\\_load\\_timestamp, and update\\_timestamp. For incremental tables, for existing records, only the update columns should be updated. The first\\_load columns should not be changed.My perception is that DLT doesn't easily offer this level of granular control. Am I mistaken here? I'm new to this resource. I couldn't find any real-world examples for product scenarios, just some basic educational examples.On the other hand, I considered a model with one continuous stream per table but quickly ran into the \\~145 execution context limit per cluster, making that approach unfeasible.**Current Proposal:** My current proposed solution is the reactive architecture shown in the image below: a central \"router\" detects new files and, via the Databricks Jobs API, triggers small, ephemeral jobs (using `AvailableNow`) for each data object.**My Question for the Community:** What are your thoughts on this event-driven pattern? Is it a robust and scalable solution for this scenario, or is there a simpler or more efficient approach within the Databricks ecosystem that I might be overlooking?https://preview.redd.it/znq1swylp3ef1.png?width=5661&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f7a4d4ac35f7803c4aa1576a7f70d5cc641429aThe architecture above illustrates the Oracle source with AWS DMS. This scenario is simple because it's CDC. However, there's user input in files, SharePoint, Google Docs, TXT files, file shares, legacy system exports, and third-party system exports. These are the most complex writing scenarios that I couldn't solve with DLT, as mentioned at the beginning, because they aren't CDC, some don't have a key, and some have partial merges (delete + insert).Thanks in advance for any insights or experiences you can share!",

        "content": "Hi,When trying to Google for the tools matching my usecass, there is so much bloat, blurred definitions and ads that I'm confused out of my mind with this one. I will attempt to describe my requirements to the best of my ability, with certain constraints that we have and which are mandatory. Okay, so, our usecase is consuming a dataset via AWS Lakeformation shared access. Read-only, with the dataset being governed by another team (and very poorly at that).Data in the tables is partitioned on two keys, each representing a source database and schema from which a given table was ingested. Primarily, the changes that we want to track are: 1. count of nulls in columns of each table (an average would do, I think; reason for it is they once have pushed a change where nulls occupied majority of the columns and records, which went unnoticed for some time :smiling_face_with_tear:)2. changes in table volume (only increase is expected, but you never know)3. schema changes (either Data type changes, or, primarily, new column additions)4. Place for extended fancy reports to feed to BAs to do some digging, but if not available it's not a showstopper. To do the profiling/reporting we have the option of using Glue (with PySpark), Lambda functions, Athena. This what I tried so far:1. Gx. Overbloated, overcomplicated, doesn't do simple or extended summary reports, without predefined checks/\"expectations\";2. Ydata-profiling. Doesn't support missing values check with PySpark, even if provided PySpark dataframe it casts it to pandas (bruh). 3. Just write custom PySpark code to collect the required checks. While doable, yes, setting up another visualisation layer on top, is surely going to be a pain in the ass. Plus, all this feels like redeveloping the wheel. Am I wrong to assume that a tool exists that has the capabilities described? Or is the market really overloaded with stuff that says that it does everything, while in fact does do squat?",

        "content": "Hi everyone,Bit of a newbie question for all you veterans.We're transitioning to Microsoft Fabric and Azure DevOps. Some of our Data Analysts have asked about version control for their SQL queries. It seems like a very mature and useful practice, and I’d love to help them get set up properly. However, I’m not entirely sure what the current best practices are.So far, I’ve found that I can query our Fabric Warehouse using the MSSQL extension in VSCode. It’s a bit of a hassle since I have to manually copy the query into a `.sql` file and push it to DevOps using Git. But at least everything happens in one program: querying, watching results, editing, and versioning.That said, our analysts typically work directly in Fabric and don’t use VSCode. Ideally, they’d be able to query and version their SQL directly within Fabric, without switching environments. From what I’ve seen, Fabric doesn’t seem to support source control for SQL queries natively (outside of notebooks). Or am I missing something?Curious to hear how others are handling this, with and without Fabric.Thanks in advance!Edit: forgot to mention I used Git as well, haha",

There's a webinar coming up on July 23 at 10am PT about relational graph transformers.The speakers are Jure Leskovec from Stanford (one of the pioneers behind graph neural networks) and Matthias Fey, who built PyTorch Geometric.They'll be covering how to leverage graph transformers - looks like they're focusing on their relational foundation model - to generate predictions directly from relational data. The session includes a demo and live Q&A.Could be worth checking out if you're working in this space.

        "content": "We're trying to get away from our legacy DE tool, BO Data Services. A couple years ago we migrated our on prem data warehouse and related jobs to ADLS/Synapse/Databricks. Our app to app integrations that didn't source from the data warehouse were out of scope for the migration and those jobs remained in BODS. Working tables and history are written to an on prem SQL server, and the final output is often csv files that are sftp'ed to the target system/vendor. For on-prem targets, sometimes the job writes the data directly in.We'll eventually drop BODS altogether, but for now we want to build any new integrations using our new suite of tools. We have our first new integration we want to build outside of BODS, but after I saw the initial architecture plan for it, I brought together a larger architect group to discuss and align on a standard for this type of use case. The design was going to use a medallion architecture in the same storage account and bronze/silver/gold containers as the data warehouse uses and write back to the same on prem SQL we've been using, so I wanted to have a larger discussion about how to design for this.We've had our initial discussion and plan on continuing early next week, and I feel like we've improved a ton on the design but still have some decisions to make, especially around storage design (storage accounts, containers, folders) and where we might put the data so that our reporting tool can read it (on-prem SQL server write back, Azure SQL database, Azure Synapse, Databricks SQL warehouse).Before we finalize our standard for app integrations, I wanted to see if anyone had any specific guidance or resources I could read up on to help us make good decisions.For more context, we don't have any specific iPaaS tools, and the integrations that we support are fine to be processed in batches (typically once a day but some several times a day), so real-time/event-based use cases are not something we need to solve for here. We'll be using Databricks Python notebooks for the logic, unity catalog managed tables for storage (ADLS), and likely piloting orchestration using Datbricks for this first integration too (orchestration has been using Azure up to now).Thanks in advance for any help!",

Unfortunately, Infosys doesn’t allow us to switch streams once assigned.I have some development background and even interned at Amazon as a Software Development Engineer, where I worked with Java on real-world projects. I’m really passionate about development and worried that continuing in Big Data might limit my growth and motivation.So here are my questions:1.If I stick with the Big Data stream for now, is it possible to switch to a full SDE role (either within Infosys or in another company) after 1-3 years?2.Has anyone here made a similar switch from Big Data/Analytics to Development? How difficult was it?3.What skills should I keep brushing up on while working in Big Data to stay prepared for a development role?",

Found bugs 10x faster.Real game is the changer though: learning to read other people's code. Started with open source and realized I couldn't navigate large codebases at all. What works:1. Follow execution path, not file structure 2. Read tests first (they show intended behavior)3. grep for function calls, not just definitionsBeen practicing code explanation with Beyz for job prep. Makes you realize programming is 80% reading, 20% writing.Other underrated skills:1. Git reflog (saved me more than Stack Overflow)2. Actual regex knowledge 3. Using debugger breakpoints instead of print statementsWhat \"basic\" skill took you embarrassingly long to learn? Mine was realizing console.log doesn't scale past toy projects.",

        "author": "planesforstars",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Last year, I found myself in a familiar cycle: I'd watch a tutorial, follow along perfectly, feel like a programming genius... then completely freeze when faced with a blank editor and a real problem to solve. I knew the syntax. I could explain concepts. But I couldn't *build* anything meaningful without a step-by-step guide.Sound familiar? I've come to call this the competent imposter phase - where you understand enough to recognize good code, but not enough to produce it independently.# The Gap No One Talks AboutI've noticed a pattern in programming education that no one seems to address directly: there's a massive cognitive leap between understanding code and generating it. It's like knowing all the rules of chess but having no strategic intuition. You know how the pieces move, but you can't see the patterns that make a good player.After months of frustration, I decided to approach this problem systematically. Here's what I discovered works:# 1. Reverse Engineering > TutorialsInstead of watching more tutorials, I started downloading open-source projects that were *just* beyond my skill level. Not massive frameworks, but small utilities with 300-1000 lines of code.The process: Run the program to understand what it does Read through the code without judgment Delete small sections and try to reimplement them Gradually expand what I deleted until I could recreate substantial portionsThis forced me to think like the original developer rather than just consuming their finished work.# 2. The Tiny Feature TechniqueOne of my breakthroughs came when I stopped trying to build complete applications. Instead, I focused on adding tiny features to existing code:* Take a simple calculator app and add a history feature Add dark mode to a static website Implement a simple search function in a list appThis approach gave me the scaffolding to work within while still requiring creative problem-solving.# 3. Deliberate Debugging PracticeI started intentionally breaking working code, then fixing it. This might sound counterproductive, but it taught me to read error messages properly and understand how the pieces fit together.I'd introduce a bug, wait 24 hours (so I'd forget exactly what I changed), then come back and fix it. This simulated the real-world experience of debugging unfamiliar code.# 4. The Explain It To A Beginner TestAfter implementing something, I forced myself to write an explanation as if teaching it to someone who just started coding. This revealed gaps in my understanding that weren't apparent when I was just following along with tutorials.If I couldn't explain a concept clearly, I knew I needed to revisit it.# 5. Embracing Uncomfortable ToolsI noticed I was avoiding certain technologies because they felt intimidating. For me, this was working with APIs and asynchronous code.So I created a rule: at least once a week, I'd work on something that made me uncomfortable. Not to master it immediately, but to reduce the anxiety around it.# The Mental Shift That Changed EverythingThe biggest change came when I stopped thinking of programming as knowing things and started seeing it as figuring things out.Experienced developers aren't successful because they've memorized everything - they're successful because they've developed robust mental models for approaching new problems. They know how to break down complex tasks, research effectively, and test their assumptions.# My Practical Advice1. **Create a Learning Project** \\- A single, evolving project you keep enhancing as you learn new concepts. Mine was a personal book tracking app that grew from a command-line tool to a web app over 6 months.2. **Code Review Yourself** \\- After completing something, wait a week, then review your own code as if it was written by someone else. Be critical but constructive.",

Wow, I would NEVER have thought of how to do this, but once I saw the code it looked super easy. If someone walked me through how to do this in English, like \"define array, define object, write for loop for array, write conditional to check object for current word, and if it's in the array increment the word's count in the object by one, but if it's not then input the integer \"1\" for that word in the object because it's the first time it's occurred in the array...\" I'd be able to do it. But to think of that myself? Absolutely no chance. I'm completely unable to \"think like a programmer\". They're right, thinking like a programmer IS the hard part.",

        "author": "ShlomoCh",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So I'm a relatively new teacher at a high school (15-17 y/o's), and I teach programming. The subject only has one 40-minute class a week per group, **with no option for giving them homework or anything outside of class hours**.I first learned programming with Unity and C#, and that's what I want to try with them. I think static typing and having an interface is a good way to teach programming, and game dev simply sounds more fun. I tried it already for a few months last year, it didn't really work out, it was too confusing for them. But I still want to give it a shot. (Especially now that I'm actually going to have a fucking projector so they can see my screen). (Hopefully). (Yes this is not a very high-budget school).The idea is to teach them the very basics C# (variables, conditionals, functions, maybe arrays and loops), and have them play with the basic Unity components (sprites, colliders, rigidbodies, and basic GUI). No OOP (except to interact with components). No 3D. No fuss. But even that sounds like too much for our restrictions, with my limited experience.So, how would you approach giving a class like that? I don't know if this is the right place, but I really don't know where else to post this.I'm not married to the idea of Unity or gamedev though, I'm open to suggestions. But it has to be something interactive and graphical so they're interested. Bear in mind these are high-schoolers, most of them aren't interested in programming, and the class is only there to kind of teach them how computers work and how to think systematically.Some other things I've thought of:* Tkinter: don't love the idea of dynamically-typed Python, and not that engaging* Godot: interface more confusing than Unity's imo* Pygame: even if it's simpler, no GUI at all is arguably way harder* Arduino: really cool idea and easier programming, but obviously we'd need Arduinos, which we don't have, and emulators like TinkerCAD just aren't the same* Java forms on NetBeans: not that engagingI'd love to hear any insight or suggestions whatsoever, especially if any of you have been teachers.",

I tried out C and yes it was fast and light but my goodness it was hard.Im assuming C++ would be fine as well?I dont know maybe you guys know.I want to create games.I want to build desktopAt this point I just need something to pass the time. I went through psychological therapy and recently surgery so I cant physically move excessively at the moment.Please dont delete this I just want to ask for an advice. I dont have any Exp in computer science.I play games as a hobby.I just need something as a leisure like me learning Japanese at the moment.Thank u \\.( ^_^ )./ Edit : Hey guys Just wanting to update you. First off, Thanks for all of the help you guys provided. I'm still reading a lot of them and very sorry if I can't reply on all of it.Second, I decided to stick to C# and check the waters again and probably give it a week and if not I'm switching to Python and if that still sucks like someone commented just stick with C.Now the IDE, I can't use VStudio cause I'm using Mint. I used jetbrains before but my oh my that IDE is so laggy in my Computer ( I told you computer is ass! ). A lot of people commented on Vim & Neovim. Now, I know those two are good and maybe you can also include LazyVim but I am just a beginner. I don't even know how to use a library let alone customising Vim to make it in a IDE. So Im at VS code at the moment.A lot of you guys are too good for me xD.Vim is nice cause you don't really need to use a mouse whenever you code. It will be a lot faster just using the keyboard but it has steep learning curve y' know just like playing Dark souls. It takes a while and I just want to learn a language before I can jump to Vim.I know this edit is a long ass speech of drama but I really appreciate the help!",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I have been using Codefinity for a few weeks and wanted to share my honest review. Overall, I think Codefinity is a pretty solid platform for beginners. The interface is simple, and the lessons are broken down into small steps that make it easy to follow along without feeling overwhelmed. I really like that you can write and test code directly in the browser, which saves time switching between different tools. The built‑in AI assistant has also been helpful when I get stuck or need a quick explanation, and that feature makes the learning experience feel more interactive than just watching videos or reading articles.That said, there are some things to keep in mind. The pricing is not very clear at the start, and you only see some details after signing up. A few lessons in the beginning feel too basic if you already have some knowledge, but they do get more interesting as you move forward. I wouldn’t say it is perfect, but it has kept me motivated to practice regularly, which is something I struggled with on other platforms.Just to clarify I’m mainly using it to learn Python and get a stronger foundation in programming before moving on to data analysis and maybe web development later.I’m curious to hear from others who have tried Codefinity for a longer time. Did you find that the content goes beyond beginner level and really builds useful skills? Do you think it’s worth continuing with, or are there better platforms out there for someone looking to grow step by step? I would appreciate hearing your experiences. Thanks!",

        "content": "I am 24 and have an associate's degree (2 years) in Computer Science. I've been working as a developer in a non-tech company for 4 years making 78k CAD. I am now thinking about going to university and even already got accepted. I wasn't able to get a loan, so if I decide to go, I will most likely have to spend all my savings on tuition for the next 4-5 years. I love studying and am genuinely interested in getting a formal education. However, the cost of the degree (30-40k CAD) and the prospect of working full-time while studying full-time and spending all my money on surviving really freaks me out. I am also planning to move to another city in a year and would have to transfer universities. The reason why I wasn't able to get student loans is because my partner (who is also a developer) makes waay more money and it puts our household above the threshold for getting loans. But we split our bills 50/50 and he is not planning to pay for my education or all of our bills obviously.So I am wondering, is it even worth the sacrifices to get a bachelors degree in CS? I def want a better paying job and want to be a better develop. I do work on side projects occasionally, but they are mostly small front-end projects. I would say I struggle studying by myself sometimes because there are so many resources and paths and I get lost. I also have imposter syndrome and don't feel very confident as a develop, I hoped that getting a degree would help with that.TL;DR: I already work as a develop but don't feel confident and want to get better and get a better paying job. Is it worth perusing a bachelors degree in CS?",

Sometimes I hear people say that after a while referrals and years of experience and the like are all that count. Do you feel like personal projects have been useful for getting new jobs after two years or so past graduation? Maybe a large fullstack project that actually gets users would work but I'm into coding for the coding :grinning_face_with_sweat:Edit: Are side projects only particularly useful if they're directly related to the job you're applying for? Is a really cool working compiler essentially useless for a backend role? Will your cool NeoVim plugin elicit only blank stares during a fullstack interview? (Okay the latter might be harder to sell than the former but the question stands)",

        "content": "**NOTE:** I made that post in r/Unicode as well, but as that community is both small and not programming related, I'm posting here to have more chances to get an answer.I am trying to implement code for Unicode and, I was just checking the [available codes](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/) and while everything was going well, when I reached to the 4-byte codes, things started pissing me off. So, I would expect that the latest codes will not be defined, as Unicode has not yet used all the available numbers for the 4-byte range. So for now, I'll just check the latest available one and update my code in new Unicode versions.Now, here is the bizarre thing... For some reason, there are undefined codes BETWEEN sets! For some reason, the people who design and implement Unicode decided to leave some codes empty and then, continue normally! For example, the codes between [adlam](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/#adlam) and [indic-siyaq-numbers](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/#indic-siyaq-numbers) are not defined. What's even more crazy is that in some sets themselves, there are undefined codes. One example is the set [ethiopic-extended-b](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/#ethiopic-extended-b) which has about 3 codes not defined.Because of that, what would be just a simple \"start/end\" range check, it will now have to be done with an array that has different ranges. That means more work for me to implement and worse performance to the programs that will use that code.With all that in mind, unless there is a reason that they implemented it that way and someone knows and can tell me, I will have my code consider the undefined codes as valid and just be done with it and everyone that has a problem can just complain to the Unicode organization to fix their mess...",

I don't know if this context is really that necessary, but just in case it helps!I just built a Wildfire Simulation Project ([Muna-Louis-Nwugo/wildfire\\_simulation](https://github.com/Muna-Louis-Nwugo/wildfire_simulation)) that is intended to be purely educational since I'm not delusional, I know most insurance simulations are much better lol. That being said, I did try my hardest, and it is my first project. Oversimplified, my System uses fire science equations, a grid representing terrain, and some custom graph traversal algorithms to predict how a fire spreads across different terrain under different conditions, allowing the user to select a starting position and fire-start position to start the simulation. I posted it on LinkedIn but like, nobody really cared enough to actually look at it and give me feedback lol.I'm hoping I'd find people here willing to critique it. I am not planning on building it out again, my next step is a multi-agent disaster response simulation, but I feel like any advice on how I could have made this project better would help me in the long runThank you!",

However, I am struggling to find roles that I feel I would be suited for. I know that what I like is more low-level stuff (specifically C++), and that I don't really have any interest in web development or working in the traditional \"big tech\" companies, which I feel like are the dominant hiring fields for new grads. I think embedded systems would be a good fit for me, or possibly programming for telecom (though maybe that's also just embedded systems?). I will have a few decently-sized resume projects under my belt by graduation, and one will hopefully be done by the end of the summer for earlier application deadlines. I'm also interested in AI, but more of the mathematical/backend stuff (i.e. being one of the people working on PyTorch itself or developing new models, not just using PyTorch to create a CNN or something).So, my questions: What kind of things should I be looking for as I search for job postings online? When I'm looking for alumni from my school to connect with, what kind of roles should I be looking for them to have? What skills should I be developing over the next year to get a position like the one I want? (Also, any other general advice from people who have been on a similar path is appreciated).",

The **client** sends an HTTP request to **my server** with credentials. 2. My server does validation/processing. 3. Then it makes an HTTP request to Supabase (signup/login endpoint). 4. If Supabase returns a JWT, the **server should send it back to the client**.This is the high level design of how things would work, removing the additional steps and etc..Now here’s where I’m stuck:>I thought I would need correlation IDs or session tracking or something, but now I’m learning maybe the HTTP protocol handles that automatically — but I’m not 100% sure how.Can someone explain this? Does each HTTP request automatically maintain its response pipe or connection, even if there are multiple users? Do I need to manually track which request came from who? Thank you in advance",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I've been programming for around 2-3 years and I'm currently doing Linux Kernel programming at my internship.The way i started CS (and fell in love with it) was by self-studying Berkeley's CS61a in my senior year of high school. I liked it so much that I switched my major and college just to study CS.My 13 year old brother has recently been interested in programming, mostly because he's intrigued with how a computer works (same reason that made me start CS). He asked for some advice to start, and my plan was this:First, a university (not bootcamp) intro course. I was thinking CS61a but it will probably be too difficult, so maybe CS50x or MIT's intro class (I read SICP so I could help him). Second, at the same time, a quick guide on Lua or some language that will allow him to mod games, or maybe PyGame. I'm skipping Scratch as he wants to actually write code. Another option would be starting with Scheme (the language), as after learning basic Python I read up The Little Schemer and SICP which were crucial to my development as a Computer Scientist.How does all that sound? I like the idea of the uni course over other methods as it's structured, more difficult, they focus on the fundamentals, and I could probably help him if certain parts are too difficult. For those with kids who wanted to learn CS, what did you guys do? Would an intro uni course be too difficult? Also, how did you guys learn CS? I only know of my journey so I'm curious to hear about others.Thanks",

I'm looking to animate some text: specifically, I want to input a string, and I want a program that will output an animation (in whatever form, I don't really mind at this stage) that shows that text being drawn **as if it was being written by hand**. So, for example, if I input the letter \"b\", I want an output animation that shows the vertical line of the \"b\" being drawn from top to bottom, then the circle of the \"b\" being drawn clockwise. See, for example, the animation [here](https://www.kanshudo.com/blog/kanji-animations) for the kind of effect I want to achieve.I'm aware that this means I might have to specify how each glyph of a certain font should be animated individually and so on, but I'm still lost on how best to do it. Surely the creators of these kanji animations did it line-by-line rather than frame-by-frame. But, if I'm honest, I don't know the first thing about how TTFs work or how to output animation in any reasonable format. Can anyone advise? Any sensible language is fine. Thanks.",

I don’t have much technical knowledge yet, I’m still learning the basics of JavaScript and web development but I wanted to learn by building something real. So I came up with an idea called **SafeSign++**, which I’m trying to build as I learn. The idea is to make a browser extension that can help prevent online fraud like phishing, fake KYC forms, and credential theft by giving users real-time warnings when they’re doing risky things like entering passwords, uploading documents, or clicking suspicious links. I also want to create a simple backend that collects reports about scammy websites and gives each site a kind of “trust score” based on how many users flagged it. I’m honestly not sure how feasible or practical the idea is, or if I’m completely off track so I’d really appreciate any advice, feedback, or criticism from the community (or even roasts lol), especially around feasibility, gaps in the idea, or suggestions for what I should read, learn, or improve. This is my way of learning by doing, and I’d be grateful for any help.If anyone has resources, beginner-friendly guides, or thoughts on how I could actually make the detection/warning parts work in a real browser extension, I’d really appreciate it.**TL;DR**: I’m a beginner learning JavaScript & web dev, trying to build a browser extension (SafeSign++) to warn users in real-time about scams and phishing.

        "title": "Four steps to improving your learning from tutorials",
        "author": "Paxtian",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "There's a lot of talk about being stuck in Tutorial Hell, and I agree, it can definitely be a trap. However, you can get much more out of tutorials if you do more than just simply follow along and do what they tell you to do. Here are my recommended steps to improving what you take away from tutorials, regardless of what you may be trying to learn.First: Follow the tutorial, but stop regularly. After each new concept is introduced (that you're not yet familiar with), whether that's a function, API, keyword, whatever, as soon as the concept is introduced, jump to a Notes document (wherever you happen to take notes: Notepad, CherryTree, Word Doc, Google Doc, whatever it is), and write down the name of the thing. Once the tutorial finishes with that concept, pause it. Go look up whatever it is in the relevant documentation. Read the documentation on that thing. In your notes, write down (in your own words) what you understand about that concept under it: how it's used, arguments, when you used it, what you understand the documentation to mean, etc. Continue in this way until you finish the tutorial. Reread all your notes once the tutorial is over.Second: Do the tutorial again. But start completely fresh. This time, when you get to each new concept, pause the video and try to finish that section completely on your own. Refer to your notes as necessary. If you can't get it working, go back to the tutorial and watch it and do it the way it says. If you make a mistake, revise your notes so that they more clearly explain the concept. If you get it right, rewatch that section of the tutorial and see if your predicted way of getting it to work is the same, or if you did it in a slightly different way. If you did it differently but it still worked, make note of this as an alternative way that also worked. Once the tutorial is over, reread all your notes again.Third: Use each concept from the tutorial in a completely independent way. If you learned 30 concepts, make 30 micro projects focused on those concepts. Use them for something completely different. If two or more concepts depend on each other, combine them as needed. But review the docs and see if they can be used independently, or combined in different ways. Fourth: Do a big, similar project completely on your own that uses the concepts you've learned but in a different way. Review your notes and the documentation as necessary. If you do future tutorials, jump right to the second step: as you do them, rather than following along mindlessly, for each new concept, try to do it on your own. As a new concept starts to be introduced, pause it and try to think about how you'd do it. If you can't, review your notes and see if anything jumps out. If there's still nothing, treat it as going back to the First Step, and watch the tutorial and update your notes, review the documentation, etc. Otherwise, have two parallel projects going: the way this new tutorial does it, and the way you'd do it. For the \"your way\" version, keep it going with your way as long as you can, even if it diverges significantly from the \"tutorial way\" version. If at some point your version just won't work anymore, delete it, copy the tutorial version over, and make that one the new \"your version\" and proceed on with trying to do it your own way. And of course, keep updating your notes as you go, revising and updating and reviewing the documentation as needed. If an existing concept is added to, update it. If new concepts are introduced, add them. Once this new tutorial is done, repeat the third and fourth steps, but with the twist of trying to make a full project that combines both the stuff you learned from previous tutorial(s) and this new tutorial.",

I'd also want to make some basic games with it! Im thinking of making simple projects if i can.So the main purpose of this post is to explore the good resources for learning C! probably doesnt need to be too advanced because i previous programming experience was scratch and i sucked. thank you!",

To be eligible for the final exams (Matura), I need to complete a project for an organization (e.g., my school) or a company. The requirements are:* A time investment of 150+ hours* A completed project* Sufficient depthFor my project, I’m thinking of building a trading bot (with different algorithms, sentiment analysis, etc.), but I’m not sure if I have enough knowledge to complete it. I have basic knowledge of algorithms (search algorithms), classes, interfaces, enums, etc. My understanding of machine learning is also basic—I have created a CNN from scratch and with TensorFlow.So my question is: Is it realistic to complete such a project, or do I need to simplify it?If you have other project ideas, please let me know!

I’m also doing my summer internship there now. They offered me a good environment to learn and grow, the people working there were very nice and patient.The thing is that the company uses their own internal framework for backend, it's fast, the clients are satisfied with it , I found it easy to use (it also helped me develop the skill of decoding and understanding others' code, learning more about software architectures, proposing some changes...) but I'm worried that because I'm not using more common technologies like React, Django, Spring, etc., I might be hurting my chances when I apply to other jobs in the future especially if I do my end of studies project at the same company.Do you think that this might a disadvantage when applying for other jobs after graduation ?",

Is there a better way to achieve the same results, especially since it means you have drill down function calls and pass it forward, which can become a bit annoying to do?

I have been applying like crazy and finally got an interview with a company, and I thought that “Finally, I might land this job as I cleared 4 rounds”. But bro, this one totally broke me.Here’s how it went:1. **HR call** – pretty standard.2. **Online assessment** – did well - JavaScript, node.js, SQL questions and 2 LeetCode questions3. **Home Assignment** – spent DAYS on this. I built a full-stack review dashboard for customer reviews approval by manager and integrated it with their main website to match the UI/UX (not their production app, just matched exact same UI and CSS and made a separate page to show it working).. Added other features also. Discussed it in-depth with the CTO (1-hour technical discussion).4. **Follow-up Round** – 1-hour technical with the CTO. For this round, he asked me to implement OpenAI API for text analysis of reviews and auto-suggestions based on customer feedback. I thought it went well as he was happy with my work and told me to prepare for next round.5. **Final Boss The CEO Round** – I was asked a system design question (LLD) around 3rd-party APIs. I started explaining my thought process.... then he just abruptly ended it with a \"have a nice day\" after 15 minutes. No feedback. No explanation. Just gone.No idea what went wrong. After the interview, I was sitting on my chair, totally numb and thinking that I just spent 20+ hours building a working AI tool for you and in just 15 minutes got a sweet rejection.I am so much drained and frustrated. That home assignment alone took so many days. I researched and studied so many things for the assessment. Today, I feel burned out and feel like leaving the software industry. Don't know when this cycle of unemployment will end. :loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face::tired_face:Anyway, just needed a place to vent this out.Thanks for reading.

These AI agents would not just automate coding, but also perform broader tasks like negotiations and decision-making—mostly for other AI agents.He aims to deploy the **first billion AI agents by the end of 2025**, with **trillions more to follow**, suggesting a sweeping automation of roles traditionally handled by humans. No detailed timeline has been provided.The announcement has implications beyond just software engineering, but it could especially impact how the tech industry views the future of programming careers.",

At big tech it is well understood that AI is a tool and the true magic comes from person + machine. Remember that software is written for people using a human readable language. It will forever serve humans and will require human operators. AI will never fully replace you.Experienced folks also tend to lose motivation and become bitter over time. New grads will always deliver a wave of fresh energy and competition. With a good blend of naïveté and starry eyed optimism, you’re a hot commodity. Like a vampire, company needs annual new blood to keep innovating. FANG will always have new grad hiring programs. Lastly, this is still a golden age for software. The responsibility for a software engineer would evolve to take on more breadth. CEOs won’t suddenly add “prompting software to do shit” on their schedules. It will still be you bringing that software to life.If you love the field, love the course work, you should still be very excited about the prospects of this career.",

        "content": "I'm a backend engineer at a (well funded) startup, helped out with the interview process recently. We wanted to fill these 3 roles: backend, devops, and data engineering. I was surprised at how quickly we were able to wrap it up.Couple of observations:__You're actually pretty cooked if you don't have networking skills.__We received 500+ applications across all the 3 roles in just one week, which seemed crazy for a seed stage startup in a niche industry. Even after filtering them for (a) location (given lots of people from abroad or other cities were yolo applying) (b) relevant experience (have they worked with the same stack before?) and (c) school (least weight but obviously relevant), we had about \\~50 quality candidates, or about \\~15 for each role. Quick 30 min intro + technical verbal call with them filtered down the pool to \\~5 per role. We then did more in-depth technical interviews.Funnily enough, out of the 3 that ended up getting hired, 2 were recommended internally by other coworkers (we have a referral bonus to incentivize them + wanted to hire people who have previously worked with someone on the team who can vouch for their skills) and 1 was hired because they cold DM'd the CEO on twitter (with a surprisingly comprehensive memo on how they'd improve our platform and their relevant experience). So yeah, 500+ applications only to hire people we already kinda knew._If you're getting into CS_: Attend hackathons/conferences, network aggressively during your internships, contribute to popular open-source projects if only to expand your connections, stay in touch with people from your school and former colleagues, hit up your network to reach out if they've a role you'd be a fit for, take initiative and cold DM people. Whatever it takes to build your network and get your foot through the door.__AI slop has fried the brains of a lot of new grads.__Look, I like cursor/claude code as much as anybody else and have no shame in admitting it has boosted my productivity a ton. But interviewing people has made me _very_ glad I graduated before LLMs took off.This is because a lot of candidates were either (a) blatantly cheating during the interview using some sort of AI tool (could tell from their eye movement and/or how they arrived at the correct answer but couldn't justify how they got there at all) OR (b) didn't have the intuition you'd expect from a software engineer who has spent years coding by throwing stuff at the wall and looking things up (\"learning how to learn\").I'm personally starting to think AI is a net negative for new grads in that it both nerfs your reasoning muscles (unless u know how to use it properly, i.e as a resource to speed up your learning process wrt core concepts, instead of a black box u mindlessly copy + paste from) AND also forces employers to put higher weight on credentialism (prestige of your school/internships/full time jobs/networking) given the rampant amount of cheating it enables during a remote technical interview.Wouldn't be surprised if in-person interviews became the norm again, which is unfortunate because that would reduce the amount of economic mobility available to someone w/o much experience who say went to a no name school and lives in the middle of nowhere.Good luck!",

        "content": "*tl;dr: Title,* [Diagram Here](https://imgur.com/a/5THOIEU)*. 5 YoE, no FAANGs. I have a B.S. in CS + Bio from Berkeley. Primarily Healthcare SWE experience. Job market is not that bad for Senior SWEs. TC >$100k + Fully Remote. I'm a US Citizen.*I always see the doom and gloom from this sub regarding layoffs and the struggles of people finding a job and wanted to add a counter-story. I got laid off from my job on July 14th. It was an absolute gut punch and all of my worst fears came true. I saw all the posts from people with years of experience struggle with finding a job and thought I was absolutely screwed going into the market. Thankfully, either I have a really good skill set or people are being overly pessimistic (though it is most likely a combination of both.)I do think that there is still merit to the doom and gloom though. When looking for a job, there were barely any new grad, entry level, or junior level job postings. Most of the jobs that I saw started at senior and made their way up but it seems that the market for mid and senior level roles is still relatively healthy. Almost every position that I interviewed for was hybrid, with a good chunk being 5 days a week in person. A very small minority were fully remote.As for how I went about that job search, the day I got laid off I got an invite to a \"Mandatory Meeting\" with my boss + some random person that I didn't know at exactly 9AM. I knew then it was over and immediately started polishing my resume and applying to every company that I could think of. I went directly to the career page and found jobs that I thought that I was qualified for. I may have applied to every company that I can think of, but I only applied to roles that matched my skillset. Every single job that I applied to was either directly on the company page or LinkedIn jobs sorted by last 24 hours.I did NOT use any AI - this includes auto-apply software or even tuning my resume. Everything was done by hand, manually by me. The only \"automation\" that I did was sign up for a [greenhouse.io](http://greenhouse.io) account so that my name, email, and other info was autofilled by them.The first 48 hours was the hardest because it was just sending applications into the void without knowing if it would yield anything. Then starting Wednesday that same week, I started getting interview requests and stopped applying to new jobs. I did not ask my network for any references as I was not desperate yet.For context, I am in the San Francisco Bay Area and work in the biotech industry (and if you're on r/biotech, biotech is equally screwed as tech, if not more.) The job I got is in the healthcare field but unrelated to the job I previously had. TC is a nice bump up from my previous position but I will not share it since people in real life know what my Reddit handle is (but I can say that it is more than $100,000 but less than $1,000,000.) I have 5 years of experience as a Software Engineer in various healthcare companies ranging from small startups to large companies with both a CS and biology degree from UC Berkeley.Of course, this is just one data point. YMMVTo those still hunting, good luck.",

        "content": "I work in a team where the majority of devs are contractors from India, except for me (I’m based in LATAM) and the lead developer who’s in the US. I’m the most recent dev to join the team.At the beginning, I noticed people didn’t offer opinions when the lead dev spoke, and I assumed it was fear. This guy curses during dev meetings when he sees weird stuff (usually some weird requirement from product), so I thought everyone was just intimidated.But as time went on, I realized the lead dev isn’t an ogre, he just lacks social skills. And honestly, I think there’s a lack of trust in the contractors. These guys, they do the bare minimum. Clean code practices is like an alien concept. Magic numbers in conditionals, functions scattered all over the place, no deletion of unused code, functions names not describing what they do. It’s a mess. Something that should take a day takes three, just because you have to go through the messy code or refactor first, which I think it’s only me who does it anyways.I’ve mentioned my concerns like the usage of magic numbers and only the lead dev reacts. The rest stay silent. They rarely answer questions unless I tag them in the message. It feels like they’re just taking advantage of the fact that the lead dev is a workaholic who works weekends and oversees everything. I get just doing your job and collecting paychecks, but I can’t understand this level of laziness. It’s crazy.I want to push more for clean code practices, but I don’t want to create an uncomfortable situation for anybody, specially if things seem to be working out they way things are now. The lead dev does care, but he’s got too much on his plate and is focused on shipping. He’s the only one reviewing PRs, I understand why he may let things slide. If I’m going to start reviewing PRs and putting more time into raising the quality bar, I want to make sure management sees it.On one hand, I’d love to just keep things chill and cash my check. On the other, it’s frustrating working in this mess and seeing the laziness. Not sure how to move forward. Anyone been in a similar spot?",

If you're a junior, please know it's mostly hype.Now, jobs are indeed harder to come by, but that's because a lot of us (especially in crypto) are comparing to top of market a few years ago when companies would hire anyone with a keyboard, including me lol. (I am exaggerating / joking a bit, of course).Truth is you need to ask yourself: where else can you find a job that pays 6 figures with no degree only 4 years into it? And get to work in an A/C environment with a comfy chair, possibly from home too? Oh, and also work on technically interesting things and be respected by your boss and co-workers? And you don't have to live in an HCOL either? Nor do you have to work 12 hour days and crazy shifts almost ever?You will be hard pressed to find some other career that fits all of these.EDIT: I've learned something important about 6 hours in. A lot of you just want to complain. Nobody really came up with a real answer to my “you will be hard pressed…” ‘challenge’.",

They share articles on companies who have already implemented AI agents alongside regular employees and every team meeting the discussion is about how we can future proof our careers.Since the time I’ve come here, I’ve not had senior managers show interest with me learning any technical skills - like cloud and all. There’s such a strong feeling everything will be taken over by AI but at the same time I feel like my team members aren’t very strong technically where we can even properly identify best practices without AI that I feel AI isn’t going to make that process any better.Has anybody else faced these issues? Is this a company culture problem or am I not doing enough to “future proof” myself. I don’t even know what to learn at this point. I am trying to take some courses to upskill but I also am lost as to what exactly to learn next.",

I honestly cant stomach it. I became a dev to solve problems... use my knowledge and experience to provide value, this just... isn't it anymore. I'm making 155k a year right now, and I know that any switch is going to cause that to plummet, I'm okay with that.

There are some things that I definitely could improve upon, but I never thought it would warrant a PIP. I'm unsure if I'm being managed out or if it's a legitimate performance plan to help me out.

I am planning to apply for research internship positions after starting my PhD.Do companies—especially FAANG companies— prefer younger candidates for research positions?",

        "content": "*posting on behalf of friend as they don't have enough karma*I graduated from a T10 CS college 7 months ago with BSMS in CS and now I feel like my chances of landing a new grad role is over. I have been working extremely hard grinding leetcode, focusing on personal projects, and practicing interviews. I applied to at least 500 jobs and only got called for an interview from 6. Even when my interviews went well, there was always someone better in their eyes. I went to college in a different part of the country, so I don't really have access to those resources anymore. Worst part is how recruiters react when they hear I've been unemployed for 7 months: they either scoff and outright ghost. These all have been taking an extreme toll on my mental health. I've had a few resume reviews 4-5 months ago and all I got were \"it's not you but the current market or \"your profile is extremely strong, keep applying\" but it's only gone downhill from there. I had 4 internships at prestigious companies and all ended with excellent final reports but no return offers due to budget cuts. I'm sending cold messages on LinkedIn constantly but no one responds anymore. All my friends have started ghosting me as well so I can't ask for referrals from them. I can't express how depressed I've been watching all of my peers working at FAANG while I'll be happy to just take any SWE/ML job. I'm happy for them but also upset as I have no idea how to get help. The last call I got from a recruiter, she outright asked me why I don't have a job yet in an extremely condescending manner although that requisition was for someone who graduated within the last year.I'm also a US citizen, so I don't think immigration/visa issues are relevant.I just don't know what to do anymore. If anyone has tips on expanding my network, getting referrals, or anything really, I'd really appreciate it.Tldr; 7 months since graduation and no prospects of new grad roles. Losing all hopes and mental health is in the gutter. Would appreciate advice on building network or anything that'll get me out of this deep pit.",

He estimates it would take at the very minimum one year, most likely two years, to get the AI tools capable of even helping us efficiently. Not even to take over our code protection. However, he gave us advice that we should present ourselves as AI experts right now. He said we could do that by learning how to use the AI tools to take over small tasks as much possible and teaching others to do the same.So the question is, where do I go from here? Based on these estimates, I could stay at that FAANG company for a few more years and then job hop to a company that hasn’t migrated to AI software. But I also want job security- well the little that is possible in this field. It seems like being a SWE isn’t sustainable long term with the AI migration.

        "content": "Hi all, I’m trying to choose between two job offers and would appreciate your input. I am currently located in the suburbs of Los Angeles. Remote or hybrid work is not available in either offer.Offer 1: \\- **49 miles** one way commute (I think about 1.5 hrs drive in LA traffic) \\- b2b saas company \\- The company is very interesting and uses a much more modern tech stack \\- The team is larger and the company has mostly younger employees, culture feels more vibrant \\- Connected well with the CTO and COO and other team members during my onsite, very cool people \\- Feels like energetic, youthful environment \\- The main downside is the long commuteOffer 2: \\- **32 miles** one way commute (I think about 1 hr drive in LA traffic) \\- aerospace industry, a manufacturing company and the software I work on would be for internal use. \\- The company uses super old tech stack (php, mysql) \\- Company environment feels old, like 90s office vibe \\- The team is smaller, and I would have more responsibilities \\- During onsite interview with the director, I felt like he was inattentive and little bit disrespectful \\- There would be less support. No one to ask questions so I would need to figure things out on my own, but I guess that means more potential for impact? My main dilemma: Would you prioritize a shorter commute and more responsibility (but a less appealing tech stack and environment), or a longer commute for a job that seems like a better culture and tech fit? Any advice or personal experiences would be really helpful!",

New England tends consist of the following for tech jobs:\\- Defense industry (I am not particularly interested in defense work long term)\\- Manufacturing with legacy systems and limited technology work.\\- Legit tech companies with Boston offices that seems to tend to hire from the best of the best of schools (Harvard, MIT, Tufts, Northeastern, etc). My Hilbilly degree from Keene State is weak in comparison.I feel like I would have more buying power moving somewhere with more affordable housing and less gatekeeping for small State schools. Maybe I am being naive, but having a degree from a \"Northen school\" may put me in advantage in places like the Research Triangle in North Carolina or Atlanta Georgia.Things are getting unstable at my job and I am considering working at a job, such as manufacturing QA (I currently work in Software QA since 2022) for a year or so, while I save up some money to plan my exit and allow some time for the overall market to get better. I currently make about 62k a year, but I've seen Manufacuring QA post jobs that pay 85k a year or even more. Thoughts?",

        "content": "Hi all!I know the market is abysmal at the moment, but I'm trying to get into the tech/CS industry. A little background, I have a Bachelor's degree in CS and I graduated in 2021. I was unemployed for a little over two years due to having to take care of my family + my own mental health issues. Since then, I've had a full-time job in the biopharmaceutical industry. I don't do anything with tech or CS really at my current job, besides a little bit database management (Not that I'm writing the SQL or anything). I've been working here for almost two years now. I mostly work on the equipment in our lab and do a good amount of troubleshooting/small engineering stuff on the robotics in the lab. I'm kind of burning out of this place and don't like my current job too much. I want to break into the tech industry. It doesn't have to be a SWE position or anything, just something tech-related or CS adjacent.I was wondering what steps I can take in my situation to start learning again and be ready to apply to CS Jobs? I honestly forgot like 95% of what I learned about programming and my other CS courses from just not doing it consistently since I graduated, but I would be willing to take online courses or put in a lot of time to learning again. Unfortunately, I don't have any internship experience related to CS as I switched to CS later in my college career and just rushed to finish the degree in a shorter time so I wouldn't have to take out more in student loans.Where do you think a good starting point is to get back into it? What kind of projects can I make that would help me stand out? And is there a larger demand for full-stack engineers or data analysts in the healthcare/biopharma industry? Trying to decide between focusing on statistics/data analysis using Python, PowerBI, Tableau, etc versus learning full-stack development with Java as backend and Javascript for front-end? Any input or advice is appreciated, thank you :)",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi all,I graduated in Winter 2024 from a T15 school with a BS in Computer Science. The job market was tough, but after about 5 months of applying, I landed a new grad role. I'm currently working in a cloud infrastructure/devops position, mostly focused on tools like Terraform, Ansible, and CI/CD pipelines. It's solid experience, but there’s very little actual coding involved. The only other work experience I have was an internship last summer where I built automation tools in Python, but not specifically SWE. I’ve also included some personal and academic backend projects on my resume, but that doesn’t seem to be enough so far to get traction for software engineering roles.Ultimately, I want to pivot into a backend engineering role, where I can focus more on building systems and writing software. I'm grateful for the opportunity I have, but I’m trying to plan out my next steps so I can move in the direction I actually want. From what I've heard, there are no pivot opportunities into dev teams internally as those teams are now offshore. Coincidentally, I am also starting an online, part-time CS masters degree in the Fall. Given how the market is, and since I've had no real work experience in backend, would it be better to apply to internships or full-time roles?",

This was the first company that I could go to office since all the other jobs were remote work. Unfortunately, they closed our division after two years.5.

Today I had a performance review and they said my performance dropped and it seems like I’m on the edge of being fired (they didn’t say this is our final warning or anything)s I had a rough period but still at the end of day, if the company says it is my fault, it is.Maybe it is me or them, but I’m really thinking that I should just quit all of this and start working something else.

I am now thinking about going to university and even already got accepted. I wasn't able to get a loan, so if I decide to go, I will most likely have to spend all my savings on tuition for the next 4-5 years. I love studying and am genuinely interested in getting a formal education. However, the cost of the degree (30-40k CAD) and the prospect of working full-time while studying full-time and spending all my money on surviving really freaks me out. I am also planning to move to another city in a year and would have to transfer universities. The reason why I wasn't able to get student loans is because my partner (who is also a developer) makes waay more money and it puts our household above the threshold for getting loans. But we split our bills 50/50 and he is not planning to pay for my education or all of our bills obviously.So I am wondering, is it even worth the sacrifices to get a bachelors degree in CS? I def want a better paying job and want to be a better develop. I do work on side projects occasionally, but they are mostly small front-end projects. I would say I struggle studying by myself sometimes because there are so many resources and paths and I get lost. I also have imposter syndrome and don't feel very confident as a develop, I hoped that getting a degree would help with that.TL;DR: I already work as a develop but don't feel confident and want to get better and get a better paying job.

I also explained that my previous company I'd been with for many years had still given me raises during the recession 2007-09 because \"its a hard time not just for us, but also for you, and we want our people to know they will be rewarded for good performance and hard work\".

I've been extended an offer for a job in Woodland Hills, CA. The problem is the hiring manager asked me what my expected salary is. The range on the job posting is 90k-135k. It seems like California, especially that area, is really expensive to live in. How much should I ask for just as a cost of living increase? All advice is welcome.",

        "author": "tempaccount00101",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Going to graduate with BS in CS soon from a no name university. I have developed a love for CS theory, specifically in anything related to reducing latency and increasing throughput. For example, distributed systems, compilers, parallel computing, high-performance computing, DSA, core OS, DB internals, CPU architecture.I'm going to be working at Meta as a SWE. Even though I'm joining at E3, I have heard many horror stories of the WLB at Meta so I already have the expectation that I will be working 50 hours per week. Hell, I have seen posts on here that might be exaggerating, but people are claiming to be working 60+ hours per week at Meta. I haven't been team matched yet since they're doing bootcamp this year for E3.With that being said, I have done some quick back-of-the-envelope calculations and I believe if I pursue a Master's part-time, I will only have 15 hours left in my week in total for leisure (e.g. girlfriend, gym, hobbies unrelated to CS). Also, this might put a strain on my performance at work and promo speed, which is very important to me. Moreover, if I focus on work and promo speed, depending on what team I am on I am thinking since I'm in big tech where scale matters, I might already be learning about distributed systems, compilers, and the rest of my interests on the job itself without having to do a Master's. I would lose the actual credential of a Master's degree but I would probably (hopefully) have more impact, greater performance and bonus, less risk of layoff, faster promo speed, etc. at work to offset this. Furthermore, I would use 3-4 years of my early/mid 20s on further schooling, but I'm also not the type to want to party hard all night long or something like that.However, I also see some benefits. For one, I will only pay a total of like $2000 for the entire Master's program. Meta will cover the rest. It's GaTech's OMSCS. Additionally, when I am older, I think it might be fun to become a sessional instructor at my undergrad, which requires a grad degree. I also did some research in undergrad, and I feel like doing a Master's program might potentially open up more opportunities for research in the future. On that note, I'm also interested in the opportunity that this might open up to move into quant dev (not quant trader, researcher, analyst, or any of the \"true quant roles\"). My areas of interest are related to quant dev I believe, and I personally find finance very interesting so I think it might be a good fit. But I also don't think that GaTech OMSCS is a target program for quant firms, so regardless of whether I pursue this or not that door might just be closed.TL;DR: should I do Master's if I already have big tech full-time job lined up? Cons is mostly time commitment which might strain work performance. Pros are potential opportunities a Master's might open and I would genuinely be interested in the content, or at least I loved studying CS in undergrad.",

Around here, most government jobs will hire directly from school, with private companies being more selective — usually only hiring diploma grads if they’re already very strong technically. Unfortunately bridging in did not occur because of the hiring freeze in the gov right now.It's become clear that getting a solid industry job, is a lot harder these days without a CS degree. The bootcamp/self-taught path (even if it's associate degree) rarely works anymore unless you're exceptional.That said, I enjoy the field (I genuinely like math, I like coding (just not obsessed)) and want to build a long-term career out of it. I am considering going back for a full CS degree with co-op. My goal is to use the internships to build industry experience in the private sector and hopefully open doors to better opportunities such as eventually staff/principal SWE at private companies or even BigTechWhat does everyone think?

        "content": "So, I feel I am in a unique situation than most. I have about 6-8 years experience (doing range to prevent d*xxing) and have currently 2 gaps of 6-9 months each between jobs. I am working at my third job right now, but everything indicates I may be losing that one possibly soon as well. So now three gaps are at risk.I would say average job tenor was about 2-3 years each jobs (except this one, still here a little under 2 years now).I quit my first job because it was super toxic, like I was having health issues because of it. Second gap is due to a layoff, but I was really doing well at that job. This one seems to be a downturn in the company as well. I was doing fine at job based on ratings.I just don't know how to overcome to bias that seems to come with this. I can not lie on my application about timelines, because every job I have taken asks for a background check. Sure, I found my current job with 2 gaps on application, but I don't know about three.I don't care about the gaps financially, I have savings to last for it. But there does seem to be some bias against this. I know I was pressed by one recruiter who specifically treated me like I was hiding something due to the gaps. As if I was a poor performer who kept losing his job. I also sometimes wonder if that is why I wasn't getting some responses back on jobs. Only reason I have my current job is mainly because of a connection I had.So, how do I handle this? What can I do to prevent his being an issue?The job market is horrible right now, even for an experienced dev like me. I have thrown a few applications out there and usually would at least get a recruiter calling me, nothing. There is nothing wrong with my application. I've already had it reviewed and it worked fine in my last job search (that was even without a job at the time. I still have my job right now). Granted, I only did a few to test the waters though. But I would at least expect a call back on one.Does anyone have advice on this specific topic? I feel frankly worried I need to change careers here soon.",
