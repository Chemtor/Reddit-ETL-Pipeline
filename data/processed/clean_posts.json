        "author": "rocketinter",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "In this opinionated article I am going to explain why I believe we have reached peak Spark usage and why it is only downhill from here.# Before SparkSome will remember that 12 years ago [Pig](https://pig.apache.org), [Hive](https://hive.apache.org), [Sqoop](https://sqoop.apache.org), [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org) and MapReduce were all the rage. Many of us were under the spell of [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org) during those times.# Enter SparkThe brilliant [Matei Zaharia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateizaharia/) started working on Spark sometimes before 2010 already, but adoption really only began after 2013. The lazy evaluation and memory leveraging as well as other [innovative features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0Tisli7zn4&t=97s) were a huge leap forward and I was dying to try this new promising technology. My then CTO was visionary enough to understand the potential and for years since, I, along with many others, ripped the benefits of an only improving Spark.# The LoosersHow many of you recall companies like [Hortonworks](https://hortonworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Webinar.HDP2_.20131112.pdf) and [Cloudera](https://www.cloudera.com/about.html)? Hortonworks and Cloudera merged after both becoming public, only to be taken private a few years later. Cloudera still exists, but not much more than that.Those companies were yesterday’s [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com) and they bet big on the Hadoop ecosystem and not so much on Spark.# Hunting decisionsIn creating Spark, Matei did what any pragmatist would have done, he piggybacked on the existing Hadoop ecosystem. This allowed Spark not to be built from scratch in isolation, but integrate nicely in the Hadoop ecosystem and supporting tools.There is just one problem with the Hadoop ecosystem…it’s exclusively **JVM based**. This decision has fed and made rich thousands of consultants and engineers that have fought with the [GC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)) and inconsistent memory issues for years…and still does. The JVM is a solid choice, safe choice, but despite more than 10 years passing and Databricks having the plethora of resources it has, some of Spark's core issues with managing memory and performance just can't be fixed.# The writing is on the wallChange is coming, and few are noticing it ([some do](https://nolanlawson.com/2024/10/20/why-im-skeptical-of-rewriting-javascript-tools-in-faster-languages/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). This change is happening in all sorts of supporting tools and frameworks.What do [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/), [Deno](https://deno.com), [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs) and the Linux kernel all have in common that no one cares about...for now? They all have a Rust backend or have an increasingly large Rust footprint. These handful of examples are just the tip of the iceberg.Rust is the most prominent example and the forerunner of a set of languages that offer performance, a completely different memory model and some form of usability that is hard to find in market leaders such as C and C++. There is also Zig which similar to Rust, and a bunch of other languages that can be found in TIOBE's top 100.The examples I gave above are all of tools for which the primary target are not Rust engineers but Python or JavaScipt. Rust and other languages that allow easy interoperability are increasingly being used as an efficient reliable backend for frameworks targeted at completely different audiences.There's going to be less of \"by Python developers for Python developers\" looking forward.# Nothing is foreverSpark is here to stay for many years still, hey, Hive is still being used and maintained, but I belive that peak adoption has been reached, there's nowhere to go from here than downhill. Users don't have much to expect in terms of performance and usability looking forward.On the other hand, frameworks like [Daft](https://www.getdaft.io) offer a completely different experience working with data, no strange JVM error messages, no waiting for things to boot, just bliss. Maybe it's not Daft that is going to be the next best thing, but it's inevitable that Spark will be overthroned.# AdaptDatabricks better be ahead of the curve on this one. Instead of using scaremongering marketing gimmicks like labelling the use of engines other than Spark as *Allow External Data Access*, it better ride with the wave.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I’ve benchmarked it. For use cases in my specific industry it’s something like x5, x7 more efficient in computation. It looks like it’s pretty revolutionary in terms of cost savings. It’s faster and cheaper.The problem is PySpark is like using a missile to kill a worm. In what I’ve seen, it’s totally overpowered for what’s actually needed. It starts spinning up clusters and workers and all the tasks. I’m not saying it’s not useful. It’s needed and crucial for huge workloads but most of the time huge workloads are not actually what’s needed.Spark is perfect with big datasets and when huge data lake where complex computation is needed. It’s a marvel and will never fully disappear for that.Also Polars syntax and API is very nice to use. It’s written to use only one node. By comparison Pandas syntax is not as nice (my opinion). And it’s computation is objectively less efficient. It’s simply worse than Polars in nearly every metric in efficiency terms.I cant publish the stats because it’s in my company enterprise solution but search on open Github other people are catching on and publishing metrics.Polars uses Lazy execution, a Rust based computation (Polars is a Dataframe library for Rust). Plus Apache Arrow data format.It’s pretty clear it occupies that middle ground where Spark is still needed for 10GB/ terabyte / 10-15 million row+ datasets. Pandas is useful for small scripts (Excel, Csv) or hobby projects but Polars can do everything Pandas can do and faster and more efficiently.Spake is always there for the those use cases where you need high performance but don’t need to call in artillery. Its syntax means if you know Spark is pretty seamless to learn.I predict as well there’s going to be massive porting to Polars for ancestor input datasets.You can use Polars for the smaller inputs that get used further on and keep Spark for the heavy workloads. The problem is converting to different data frames object types and data formats is tricky. Polars is very new.Many legacy stuff in Pandas over 500k rows where costs is an increasing factor or cloud expensive stuff is also going to see it being used.",

        "content": "Hey All,I've had an incredible year and I feel extremely lucky to be in the position I'm in. I'm a relatively new DE, but I've covered so much ground even in one year.I'm not perfect, but I can feel my growth. Every day I am learning something new and I'm having such joy improving on my craft, my passion, and just loving my experience each day building pipelines, debugging errors, and improving upon existing infrastructure.As I look back I wanted to share some gems or bits of valuable knowledge I've picked up along the way:* Showing up in person to the office matters. Your communication, attitude, humbleness, kindness, and selflessness goes a long way and gets noticed. Your relationship with your client matters a lot and being able to be in person means you are the go-to engineer when people need help, education, and fixing things when they break. Working from home is great, but there are more opportunities when you show up for your client in person.* pre-commit hooks are valuable in creating quality commits. Automatically check yourself even before creating a PR. Use hooks to format your code, scan for errors with linters, etc.* Build pipelines with failure in mind. Always factor in exception handling, error logging, and other tools to gracefully handle when things go wrong.* DRY - such as a basic principle but easy to forget. Any time you are repeating yourself or writing code that is duplicated, it's time to turn that into a function. And if you need to keep track of state, use OOP.* Learn as much as you can about CI/CD. The bugs/issues in CI/CD are a different beast, but peeling back the layers it's not so bad. Practice your understanding of how it all works, it's crucial in DE.* OOP is a valuable tool. But you need to know when to use it, it's not a hammer you use at every problem. I've seen examples of unnecessary OOP where a FP paradigm was better suited. Practice, practice, practice.* Build pipelines that heal themselves and parametrize them so users can easily re-run them for data recovery. Use watermarks to know when the last time a table was last updated in the data lake and create logic so that the pipeline will know to recover data from a certain point in time.* Be the documentation king/queen. Use docstrings, type hints, comments, markdown files, CHANGELOG files, README, etc. throughout your code, modules, packages, repo, etc. to make your work as clear, intentional, and easy to read as possible. Make it easy to spread this information using an appropriate knowledge management solution like Confluence.* Volunteer to make things better without being asked. Update legacy projects/repos with the latest code or package. Build and create the features you need to make DE work easier. For example, auto-tagging commits with the version number to easily go back to the snapshot of a repo with a long history.* Unit testing is important. Learn pytest framework, its tools, and practice making your code modular to make unit tests easier to create.* Create and use a DE repo template using cookiecutter to create consistency in repo structures in all DE projects and include common files (yaml, .gitignore, etc.).* Knowledge of fundamental SQL if valuable in understanding how to manipulate data. I found it made it easier understanding pandas and pyspark frameworks.",

The input is around 30k rows. Output is the same because there's no filtering or aggregation; just creating new fields. No collect, count, or display statements (which would slow it down). The main thing is a bunch of mappings I need to apply, but it depends on existing fields and there are various models I need to run. So the mappings are different depending on variable and model. That's where the for loops come in. Now I'm ***not*** iterating over the dataframe itself; just over 15 fields (different variables) and 4 different mappings. Then do that 10 times (once per model).The worker is m5d 2x large and drivers are r4 2x large, min/max workers are 4/20. This should be fine. I attached a pic to illustrate the code flow.

I don't find my experience very rewarding given that it's a project that lasted 4 years.I don’t do real-time processing, no AI, no “fancy” stuff.Even unit testing, I do very little if at all, because everything happens in BigQuery and I've never really seen the point of testing Python scripts that just execute SQL queries that have already been tested manually.Sometimes I feel like I'm just getting data from point A to point B, cleanly.And I wonder: is this “just that”, the job? Or have I missed another level?Do you feel this too?Are we underestimating this work, even though it is essential?And above all, how do you find meaning or progress in this kind of context?Thank you in advance for your feedback.",

That experience really excited me, so I started learning Python on my own. That’s when the idea of switching to IT—or something related to programming—began to grow in my mind.Maybe if I had been less insecure about the whole IT world (it’s a BIG challenge), I would’ve started earlier with the path and the courses. But you know how it goes—make plans and God laughs.Right now, I’ve already started taking some courses—introductions to Data Analysis and Data Science. But out of all the options, Data Engineering is the one I’ve liked the most. With the help of ChatGPT, some networking on LinkedIn, and of course Reddit, I now have a clearer idea of which courses to take. I’m also planning to pursue a Master’s in Big Data.And the big question remains:Is it actually possible to switch careers?I’m not expecting to land the perfect job right away, and I know it won’t be easy. But if I’m going to take the risk, I just need to know—is there at least a reasonable chance of success?",

Because it enables building data applications in the browser with a drastically simplified stack. Usually accessing iceberg requires a backend, often with full spark processing, or paying for cloud based OLAP. Icebird allows the browser to directly fetch Iceberg tables from S3 storage, without the need for backend servers.I am excited about the new kinds of data applications than can be built with modern data formats, and bringing them to the browser with hyparquet and icebird.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi there, I've been thinking about the current generation of data catalogs like DataHub and OpenMetadata, and something doesn't add up for me. They do a great job tracking metadata, but stop short of doing what seems like the next obvious step, actually helping enforce data access policies.Imagine a unified catalog that isn't just a metadata registry, but also the gatekeeper to data itself:- Roles defined at the catalog level map directly to roles and grants on underlying sources through credential-vending.- Every access, by a user or a pipeline, goes through the catalog first, creating a clean audit trail.Iceberg’s REST catalog hints at this model: it stores table metadata and acts as a policy-enforcing access layer, managing credentials for the object storage underneath.Why not generalize this idea to all structured and unstructured data? Instead of just listing a MySQL table or an S3 bucket of PDFs, the catalog would also vend credentials to access them. Instead of relying on external systems for access control, the catalog becomes the control plane.This would massively improve governance, observability, and even simplify pipeline security models.Is there any OSS project trying to do this today?Are there reasons (technical or architectural) why projects like DataHub and OpenMetadata avoid owning the access control space?Would you find it valuable to have a catalog that actually controls access, not just documents it?",

        "content": "Hey folks,So I have this query that joins two table, selects a few columns, runs a dense rank and then filters to keep only the rank 1s. Pretty simple right ?Here’s the kicker. The overpaid, under evolved nit wit who designed the databases didn’t add a single index on either of these tables. Both of which have upwards of 10M records. So, this simple query takes upwards of 90 mins to run and return a result set of 90K records. Unacceptable. So, I set out to right this cosmic wrong. My genius idea was to simplify the query to only perform the join and select the required columns. Eliminate the dense rank calculation and filtering. I would then read the data into Polars and then perform the same operations.Yes, seems weird but here’s the reasoning. I’m accessing the data from a Tibco Data Virtualization layer. And the TDV docs themselves admit that running analytical functions on TDV causes a major performance hit. So it kinda makes sense to eliminate the analytical function. And it worked. Kind of. The time to read in the data from the DB was around 50 minutes. And Polars ran the dense rank and filtering in a matter of seconds. So, the total run time dropped to around half, even though I’m transferring a lot more data. Decent trade off in my book. But the problem is, I’m still not satisfied. I feel like there should be more I can do. I’d appreciate any suggestions and I’d be happy to provide any additional details. Thanks. EDIT:This is the query I'm runningSELECT SUB.ID, SUB.COL1FROM ( SELECT A.ID, B.COL1, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY B.ID ORDER BY B.COL2 DESC) AS RANK FROM A LEFT JOIN B ON A.ID = B.ID AND A.SOME_COL = 'SOME_STRING' ) SUBWHERE RANK = 1",

All my*scriptsl* were using Faker but always extended with some additional usecase. This is how I ended up writing [glassgen](https://pypi.org/project/glassgen/). It generates synthetic data, sends it to a sink and is simply configured by a json config. It can also generate duplicates in the data (if you want) and can send at a defined rps (best effort). Happy to hear your feedback and hope you find the library useful. Thanks",

        "content": "HelloI need a sanity check.I am educated and work in an unrelated field to DE. My IT experience comes from a pure layman interest in the subject where I have spent some time dabbing in python building scrapers, setting up RDBs, building scripts to connect everything and then building extraction scripts to do analysis. Ive done some scripting at work to automate annoying tasks. That said, I still consider myself a beginner.At my workplace we are a bunch of consultants doing work mostly in excel, where we get lab data from external vendors. This lab data is then to be used in spatial analysis and comparison against regulatory limits. I have now identified 3-5 different ways this data is delivered to us, i.e. ways it could be ingested to a central DB. Its a combination of APIs, emails attachments, instrument readings, GPS outputs and more. Thus, Im going to try to get a very basic ETL pipeline going for at least one of these delivery points which is the easiest, an API.Because of the way our company has chosen to operate, because we dont really have a fuckton of data and the data we have can be managed in separate folders based on project/work, we have servers on premise. We also have some beefy computers used for computations in a server room. So i could easily set up more computers to have scripts running. My plan is to get a old computer up and running 24/7 in one of the racks. This computer will host docker+dagster connected to a postgres db. When this is set up il spend time building automated extraction scripts based on workplace needs. I chose dagster here because it seems to be free in our usecase, modular enought that i can work on one job at a time and its python friendly. Dagster also makes it possible for me to write loads to endpoint users who are not interested in writing sql against the db. Another important thing with the db on premise is that its going to be connected to GIS software, and i dont want to build a bunch of scripts to extract from it.Some of the questions i have:* If i run docker and dagster (dagster web service?) setup locally, could that cause any security issues? Its my understanding that if these are run locally they are contained within the network* For a small ETL pipeline like this, is the setup worth it? * Am i missing anything?",

Model level is good to start but we'll need both.Has anyone found good ways to manage this?I'd love to hear about any tools, workflows, or best practices that are relevant.Thanks!",

For now, we have to run the query processing engines outside Cloudflare. [https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-catalog/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-catalog/)I find this exciting because it makes easy for beginners like me to get started with data engineering. I remember how much time I have spent while configuring EMR clusters while keeping an eye on my wallet. I found myself more concerned about my wallet rather than actually getting my hands dirty with data engineering. The whole product line focuses on actually building something and not spending endless hours in configuring the services.Currently, Cloudflare has the following products which I think are useful for any data engineering project.1. Cloudflare Workers: Serverless functions.[Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)2.

Here's some context for the images below:1. Scale of data is many terabytes to a few petabytes uncompressed. Largely sensor data. 2. Data is initially generated and stored on an air-gapped network. 3. Data will be moved into a lab by detaching hard-drives. There, we will need to retain some raw data for regulatory purposes, and we will also want to perform ETL into an analytical database/warehouse. I have a lot of time to refine these before implementation time, and specific technologies are flexible. but next week I wan to present a *reasonable* view of the types of solutions we might use.

I worked for that company for almost 3 years and unfortunately, got close to no applicable experience. They had previously outsourced their data engineering so we faced constant roadblocks with security in trying to build out our pipelines and data stack. In short, most of our time was spent arguing with security for reasons we needed access to data/tools/etc to do our job. They laid our entire team off last year and the job search has been brutal since. I’ve only gotten 3 engineering interviews from hundreds of applications and I’ve made it to the final round during each, only to be rejected because of technical engineering questions/problems I didn’t know how to figure out. I am very discouraged and wondering if data engineering is the right field for me. The data sphere is ever evolving and daunting, I already feel too far behind from my unfortunate first job experience. Some backend engineering concepts are still difficult for me to wrap my head around and I know now I much prefer the analysis side of things. I’m really hoping for some encouragement and suggestions on other routes to take as a very early career data professional.

        "content": "Hey all! Over the years, I’ve worked at companies as small as a team of 10 and at organizations with thousands of data engineers, and I’ve seen wildly different philosophies around analytical data.Some organizations go with the \"build it and they will come\" data lake approach, broadly ingesting data without initial structure, quality checks, or governance, and later deriving value via a medallion architecture.Others embed governed analytical data directly into their user-facing or internal operations apps. These companies tend to treat their data like core backend services managed with a focus on getting schemas, data quality rules, and governance right from the start. Similar to how transactional data is managed in a classic web app.I’ve found that most data engineering frameworks today are designed for the former state, Airflow, Spark, and DBT really shine when there’s a lack of clarity around how you plan on leveraging your data. I’ve spent the past year building an open-source framework around a data stack that's built for the latter case (clickhouse, redpanda, duckdb, etc)—when companies/teams know what they want to do with their data and need to build analytical backends that power user-facing or operational analytics quickly.The framework has the following core principles behind it:1. Derive as much of the infrastructure as possible from the business logic to minimize the amount of boilerplate2. Enable a local developer experience so that I could build my analytical backends right alongside my Frontend (in my office, in the desert, or on plane)3. Leverage data validation standards— like types and validation libraries such as pydantic or typia—to enforce data quality controls and make testing easy4. Build in support for the best possible analytical infra while keeping things extensible to incrementally support legacy and emerging analytical stacks5. Support the same languages we use to build transactional apps. I started with Python and TypeScript but I plan to expand to othersThe framework is still in beta and it’s now used by teams at big and small companies to build analytical backends. I’d love some feedback from this communityYou can take it for a spin by starting from a boilerplate starter project:[ https://docs.fiveonefour.com/moose/quickstart](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/moose/quickstart)Or you can start from a pre-built project template for a more realistic example:[ https://docs.fiveonefour.com/templates](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/templates)",

This is especially problematic since some of our data (like blocks and transactions) needs to be available in real-time, with query latency under 100ms.To manage this better, we’re considering separating our ingestion strategy: keeping batch ingestion into ClickHouse for historical and analytical needs, while finding a way to access fresh data in real-time when needed — particularly for the GraphQL layer.Would love to get thoughts on how we can approach this — especially around managing real-time queryability while keeping ingestion efficient and stable.",

        "content": "Hello dear people! Been dealing with this very interesting problem that I'm not 100% sure how to tackle. A local forum went down some time ago and they lost a few hours worth of data since backups aren't hourly. Quite a few topics were lost, as well as some of them apparently became corrupted and also got lost. One of them included a very nice discussion about local mountaineering and beautiful locations which a lot of people are saddened to lost since we discussed many trails. Somehow, people managed to collect data from various cached sources, computers, some screenshots, but mostly old google, bing caches while they worked and webarchive. Now it's all properly ordered in pdf document but the thing is the layouts often change and so does resolution but the general idea of how data is represented is the same. There's also some artifacts in data from webarchive for example - they have an element hovering over text and you can't see it, but if you ctrl-f to search for it it's there somehow, hidden under the image haha. No javascript in PDF, something else, probably colored, no idea.The ideas I had were (btw PDF is OCR'd already):&nbsp;- PDF to text and try to regex + LLM process it all somehow?- Somehow \"train\" (if train is a proper word here?) machine vision / machine learning for each separate layout so that it knows how to extract data&nbsp;But I also face issue that some posts are for example screenshoted in \"half\", e.g. page 360 has the text cut out and continue on page 361 with random stuff on top from the archival's page (e.g. webarchive or bing cache info). I would need to also truncate this, but that should be easy.&nbsp;- Or option 3 with those new LLMs that can somehow recognize images or work with PDF (idk how they do it) I could maybe have the LLM do the whole heavy load of processing? I could pick up one of better new models with big context length and remembrance, I just checked total character count, it's 8.588.362 characters or 2.147.090 tokens approximately, but I believe the data could be split and later manually combined or something? I'm not sure I'm really new to this. The main goal is to have a nice json output with all data properly curated.&nbsp;Many thanks! Much appreciated.",

        "author": "Hoppingcrow_",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi y’all. A little background on my situation: I graduated with a BA last year and am planning on attending law school for my JD here in Canada in fall 2026. Getting into law school in Canada is really competitive, so as a backup plan, I’m considering starting an additional degree in data science in case law school doesn’t work out. My previous degree was almost completely free due to scholarships, and since I’m in the process of joining the military I can get a second degree subsidized. I already have a BA, so I would like to use elective credits from my previous degree toward a BSc if that’s the route I take. The only issue is that a lot of Canadian universities don’t allow you to transfer credits from previously earned degrees. Because of this, I’ve been looking into less prestigious but equally accredited school options. My concerns are mostly about co-op opportunities, networking, and how much school reputation influences your earning potential and career growth in this field. I know that law is pretty much a meritocracy in Canada, but the alumni connections made through your university can mean the difference between tens of thousands of dollars per year. Ideally, I want to go to a school that has strong co-op programs to gain experience, and would potentially want to do an honours thesis or project. I’ve spoken to some people in CS and they’ve recommended I just do a CE boot camp, or take a few coding classes at a community college and then pursue a MS in data science. I don’t like either of these suggestions because I feel that I wouldn’t have as strong a theoretical background as someone who completed a 4 year undergrad degree. Any insight would be really helpful!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello,We have a source system that is only able to export data using a \"start\" and \"end\" date range. So for example, each day, we get a \"current month\" export for the data falling between the start of the month and the current day. We also get a \"prior month\" report each day of the data from the full prior month. Finally, we also may get a \"year to date\" file with all of the data from the start of the year to current date.Nothing in the data export itself gives us an \"as of date\" for the record (the source system uses proprietary information to give us the data that \"falls\" within that range). All we have is the date range for the individual export to go off of.I'm struggling to figure out how to model this data. Do I simply use three different \"fact\" models? One each for \"daily\" (sourced from the current month file), \"monthly\" (sourced from the prior month file), and \"yearly\" (sourced from the year to date file)? If I do that, how do I handle the different grains for the SCD Type 2 DIM table of the data? What should the VALID\\_FROM/VALID\\_TO columns be sourced from in this case? The daily makes sense (I would source VALID\\_FROM/VALID\\_TO from the \"end\" date of the data extract that keeps bumping out each day), but I don't know how that fits into the monthly or yearly data. Any insight or help on this would be really appreciated.Thank you!!",

I feel like my company's practices are very sloppy and I am the only one that cares. We dont have good environment separation as many DE's do dev in a single snowflake account that is pointed at production AWS where there is PII and PHI. The level of access is concerning to me not only for leakage, but this goes against the best practices for development that I've always known. I've started an initiative to build separate dev,stage, prod accounts with masked data in the lower environments, but this always gets put on the back burner for urgent client asks. Looking for a sanity check as I wonder, at times, if I am overthinking it. I would love to know how others have dealt with access to production data. Do your DE's work in a separate cloud account or separate set of servers? Is PII/PHI allowed in the environments where dev work is being done?",

Unfortunately, none of these can handle the larger data we have with a reasonable amount of RAM. They can do the processing and write to disk without partitioning, but we get OOM when we try to partition by day. I've tried a few workarounds such as partitioning by year, and then reading the yearly files one at a time to re-partition by day, and still OOM.Any suggestions on how we could implement this, preferably without having to migrate to a distributed solution?",

Then before going to silver, check if recoeds are following the data shema, are constraints met (f.e. values within specified ranges, formatting of timestamps etc). If there are records which do not meet these rules, i was thinking about putting them to quarantine. My question, how to quarantine them? And if there are faulty records found, should we immediately alert the source or only if a certain percentage of records are faulty?Also should we add another column in silver 'valid' which would signify if the record is meeting the table schema and constraints defined? So that would be the way to use this column and report on % of faulty records which could be a part of a DQ dashboard?",

To me, these classes were very easy and I understood what was going on. I'd just need to take a few weeks to refresh my memory (which I plan to do through an Udemy course/reading textbooks).What I don't understand is... how the heck does programming even work? What the hell is happening?Like, how do people do things to somehow turn their code into a GUI on the screen? How does the text pop up? How can I manipulate the pixels on monitor to make my own GUI? I wasn't taught anything about this stuff and it feels like the programming I was being taught was extremely shallow. I can code a binary tree, I know about pointers and classes, but that's about it. I could make text based stuff, but how do I study the code on a deeper level? I know I could probably just import a GUI library and use it, but I don't want to just use a library, I want to understand how this technical stuff (that my school didn't teach) works.Are there any resources on how I can learn how computers work on a deeper level?Sorry for the newbie rambling. It's very scary to me.",

When it's someone with many years of experience, I get it—but it's not always the case.I notice that I’m especially slow when dealing with new technologies. I sometimes feel like my colleagues judge me for this. Maybe they underestimate the work involved, or maybe it really is easier for them. Either way, I can’t help but wonder if they're right to think I’m just... slow.What hits me hardest is that after spending days stuck on something, once I finally figure it out, I look back and think: “That really shouldn't have taken me so long.” Of course things seem easier in hindsight, but I can’t shake the feeling that maybe I am the problem and should be improving faster.I’d love to hear from other software engineers: did you go through this too?

I was super excited to transfer just one hour away because the program has project-based classes, and that was exactly what I was looking for. After a tough and competitive admission process, I was finally able to get into the program. It felt like a huge achievement, especially given how competitive it was.Last fall semester, I was given a project that was honestly much harder than anything I had worked on before. I started experiencing a lot of imposter syndrome, and to make things worse, I realized I really struggle with public speaking—something that became a big challenge during group presentations. Even though it was tough, I stuck with it as much as I could until the final weeks of the semester. But then, I completely panicked and ended up skipping the final presentation, ignoring both my teammates and professors.As a result, I ended up failing the course and got kicked out of the CS program. Now, I’m back at home, feeling completely stuck and unsure what to do next. I can’t help but regret the way I handled everything, especially the missed opportunity. I know I let my fear and lack of confidence get the best of me, but I don’t know how to move forward.I guess I’m asking for advice from anyone who’s been in a similar situation or just has some perspective on what my next steps should be.

For example if I have a function that’s supposed to take the factorial of a number, on paper I’ll write down how if there’s an input of 6, it should multiply 1 by 6 then go into a 2nd recursion layer to multiply 6 by 5, and so on.

        "content": "I started learning Python at the beginning of the year and originally started with online compilers like replit and glot.io, changed over to Pycharm due to limitations with the freemium online versions and being unable to use inputs correctly, and have really been enjoying the IDE so far. It comes with a preinstalled linter so its easy to spot mistakes etc, but i still need to make the corrections. It also has a debugging tool which i still struggle to use though. This week i started learning html and started using VS Code. So far so good, but i will admit the autocomplete function is kinda rubbing me the wrong way. It feels fantastic in the moment that i dont have to completely type it all out and that when closing a starting element off it will auto add the closing element, eg section detailsBut damn im not gonna lie, i can see how this could make me lazy. Sure its productive and a cool functionality. But... I just cant shake the feeling that it might not be good (esp as a beginner). And i see how this can translate to AI and potentially forming bad syntax habits. So yeah, was wondering what IDE or text editor you all use, why, and what quirks/functions do you guys love or hate. Can be for any programming languages or markup languages.",

That is simply how I understood it so I made a post in case there might be others.I often see comments on posts, asking how to learn programming, saying not to use AI.Although I am definitely no professional programmer myself, I have done quit a lot of learning (python, c#, and lately c++). I have always heeded this advice and have steered far away from using AI to learn how to code. Until the last couple of weeks.... and I have completely changed my mind about the subject.I still think it is a bad idea to have AI write up some copy-paste code as this definitely is not the best way to go about learning. Struggling a little and trying to get the code working yourself is what will cement the knowledge. But what I have been doing is submitting my code snippets to the AI after getting it to work and prompting it to analyze my code and suggest possible improvements. I then try implementing the suggestions and repeat the process.I feel this has vastly upgraded my programming skills, learning to implement fail safes, better error handling, better edge case handling, and being overall more robust. Still by no means am I any form of 'great' programmer yet but using Ai in this way has helped me progress a lot faster.So, in my opinion there is no problem with using AI to help you learn, the problem is in how we decide to use it. Just my two cents.",

I’ve been practicing and taking Udemy courses in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for about a year now, maybe a little more. I’ve managed to get a decent grasp of both technologies. I can create a static page using HTML and CSS, and I can add a bit of interactivity with JavaScript and understand it somewhat. Of course, I’m not capable of building a large application yet, but I understand a lot more than when I first started.Lately, I’ve been feeling insecure and anxious, wondering if maybe it’s already too late for me to pursue this. When I look for junior jobs, there seem to be literally none.I really enjoy the fact that I can see what I create — like building a page, an accordion, a navigation bar, or dynamically hiding or adding something. Being able to actually see what I make is something I love.My plan B would be to quickly take some fiber optics classes and move towards networking, but I don’t think it would take me as far.Is it already too late for me to get into web development? 33yr old btw ;(",

I personally think they go against what people study in programming, as if making the manual coding lessons less useful with tools that enable people to develop projects with minimal to no coding. But that's just my opinion only knowing little of the concept so I stand to be corrected.But I am wondering, like other major developments in technology, are no-code and low-code concepts worth accepting and applying? If they are, what are good platforms/tools to start with? How would this benefit someone looking forward to a career in tech?",

        "author": "hello_aaron",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi everyone,I hope you’re all doing well. I’m reaching out because I’m struggling with a severe lack of focus and productivity, and it’s been weighing on me for nearly a year. Let me share my story and explain where I’m at – I’d really appreciate any guidance or experiences you can share.Background: In 2021, I got my first desktop from my brother, and I was instantly hooked on computers. I spent hours exploring, learning, and diving into coding. I started with C, moved to C++, and fell in love with programming. It was exciting, and I was learning something new every day. In 2022, I joined a Computer Science Engineering program as a direct second-year student. This was the peak of my productivity. I was coding 10+ hours a day, building web development projects with Python and JavaScript, and even mastering the MERN stack. I was so focused that I’d code through the night, feeling like coding was my entire world. My hard work paid off – I became one of the top coders in my college, and my peers recognized my skills. I built a strong portfolio and improved my resume, aiming for a developer jobProblem: Things changed in my final year (2024). I started feeling depressed, demotivated, and lazy. I couldn’t focus on learning new skills or even maintaining my existing ones. While my peers were landing interviews and jobs, I struggled with aptitude tests (which I hadn’t prepared for, as I was so focused on coding). Sitting down to work on my laptop became a challenge – I just felt unmotivated. Despite this, I pushed through, and my past hard work paid off: I landed the highest-paying job at a major MNC in my college. I’m proud of this, but the problem persists. Now, with my degree wrapping up in the next 2-3 months, I want to use this time to improve myself, but I can’t focus on anything. I’ve lost the drive to learn new languages or build projects. Worse, I’m experiencing back pain from too much screen time, which makes me avoid my laptop altogether. I suspect I’m addicted to high-dopamine activities like gaming and YouTube Shorts, which make it impossible to start anything productive. My mind feels like it’s rejecting coding and my laptop for no clear reason.I’ve attempted every productivity strategy. I desperately want to be that person again who could code all day without distractions, but I feel stuck. This has been going on for almost a year, and I’m worried about starting my job in this unmotivated state. Has anyone else experienced this shift from being passionate and productive to feeling unmotivated and unable to focus? How did you overcome it?I’d love to hear your experiences, suggestions, or even just know I’m not alone in this. Thank you so much in advance for your help!",

If I decide to make coding a job, I need to start making bigger projects, and also I just want to make a bigger project than just poker from the terminal.I've always wanted to make a game, mainly because I really like video games.

        "author": "krcyalim",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I'm not sure if this is the appropriate subreddit, but I tried asking in r/computerscience, and they removed it, saying it was off-topic. I honestly don’t know how this doesn't qualify, since I’m trying to understand a conceptual difference.Anyway, here's my question.I got the structure of the `Memory` chip from GitHub. Everyone seems to be using the same implementation, and it works fine in simulation without any errors: CHIP Memory { IN in[16], load, address[15]; OUT out[16]; PARTS: DMux4Way(in=load, sel=address[13..14], a=loadram1, b=loadram2, c=loadscreen, d=loadkbd); Or(a=loadram1, b=loadram2, out=loadram); RAM16K(in=in, load=loadram, address=address[0..13], out=ramout); Screen(in=in, load=loadscreen, address=address[0..12], out=scrout); Keyboard(out=kbout); Mux4Way16(a=ramout, b=ramout, c=scrout, d=kbout, sel=address[13..14], out=out); }Now, based on this design, I expected the following code to read a value from the keyboard and store it into `RAM[1]`: (loop) @24577 D=M @1 M=D @loop 0;JMPHere's my reasoning:* `@24577` sets the A register to 24577.* That value is passed to the Memory chip as the address.* The most significant bits (bits 13 and 14) are both 1, so according to the HDL, the `Keyboard` chip should be selected.* So `out` should reflect the keyboard's output.* Then `D=M` loads the keyboard value into the D register.* `@1` sets A to 1, and `M=D` writes the value to RAM\\[1\\].Now, here’s my confusion: How is this different from the following? (loop) @24576 D=M @1 M=D @loop 0;JMPBoth 24576 and 24577 have the same top two bits (13 and 14 = 11), so shouldn't they both route to the keyboard? Why would one work differently from the other if the given chip structure is true?edit: in the code section some parts were typed as “u/…” instead of “@…” . I fixed them. Sorry about that.",

        "content": "I've been working as a software engineer for several years, mostly focused on backend development. Besides interviewing myself once in a while for practice, I've also been involved in interviewing candidates at my company.After enough exposure on both sides of the table, something became pretty clear to me: Being able to solve problems isn’t what sets you apart. Explaining them is.Solving a question correctly is important, of course. But what really stands out is how clearly and naturally someone can walk others through their thought process. It’s not about over-narrating or reciting a rehearsed script. What makes a difference is:Framing your approach in simple, accessible terms Surfacing trade-offs before you're even asked Staying steady and unfazed when edge cases come up, as if you already thought about them Because of this, I gradually adjusted how I prepare for interviews, even casual ones. I still solve problems as usual, but now I also practice summarizing the solution in one or two clean sentences, basically a \"30-second version\", then being ready to dive deeper if needed.Sometimes, I’ll use a tool that offers multiple solution paths and points out which parts are worth verbalizing, not just coding. It’s helped me avoid slipping into the \"just code it\" mindset.Curious if others have similar experiences. How do you practice improving the communication side of problem-solving, especially without sounding overly scripted?",

I'm not opposed to going the FT employee route but, due to my current position as being quite remote and based a long way from central / western timezones, I am concerned that the odds would be quite heavily stacked against me during applications, vs junior developers who are already based on the doorstep of hiring companies or at least in more accessible timezones.Is freelancing a viable first gig in 2025, or should I prioritize FT employment?

I barely am able to code and when I code, I need to check countless times on how to write specific commands or even very general basic ones. I feel how the pressure and difficulty is getting into my head when I need to program for a project and I cannot deal with it very well. I try to visualize my code in my head but I cant. I lose focus where what is suppose to happen or I cannot even built a code in my head that solves the most simple problem. I have a lot of self-doubt and I just cant deal with it anymore. I used to be the smart kid in school and a smart adult nowadays but when I compare myself to the other students in my course, I feel trashy and I feel like theres a big wall of missing understanding that keeps me away from reaching the potential and skills they did. I try many times to just pick everything up and learn it but every time I just fall to my knees, feeling simply overwhelmed.I dont want to use AI to write my programs, doing that led me to not practise enough honestly. I should also mention that I have Azbergers, so tho I think very logical, I am basically screaming internally everytime I see code because I cannot for the love of god visualize code in my head for some reason. Have you guys experienced similar things? Any suggestions how to improve? Maybe its important to say that my struggles are all focused around Java; tho I learned languages like SQL or HTML, Java is the only one I suffer a lot.

At the moment, for example, I am trying to get better at Python. I learned to code on curly bracket languages, so a lot of that (brackets, semicolons, etc) is still a bit of muscle memory. So, just practicing writing Python syntax has been helpful.I've been using Boot.Dev. They don't have an app, but the mobile experience on their website isn't terrible. I've reached the point where I have to pay to go forward. Which I have no problem doing, the value is there, but I thought I would ask and see if there are better mobile-first options before I do.",

        "author": "Hazjut",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "TL;DR:After years of chasing a tech career that never paid or stabilized, I am leaving for a career that can support a family and offer real security. I still love tech, but I had to move on to survive.I thought tech would be the future I built my life on. It didn’t work out.I chased a tech career for years, but it never came together. Ironically, I made the equivalent of around $80k a year in the military before I even had a degree, and some years a bit more. After graduating, despite years of effort, I never made over $80k again. After unstable contracts, low pay, no benefits, and rising living costs, I found a different career starting around $140k total comp and quickly climbs toward $200k and beyond, offering real retirement options and meaning that tech never did for me.I started coding for fun at 16, back in 2006. It was not rare, but it was far less common than it is today. When college came, I should have taken on debt and jumped into tech earlier. But I saw loans like credit card debt, and my family did too. We did not understand grants or aid. I was the first in my family to pursue a degree. Instead, I joined the military to pay for college.While serving, I started taking tech seriously. I built projects, took classes early, and did well both academically and physically. I am a combat veteran. After leaving, I moved to a major west coast city, earned a degree from a respected state university, and started trying to build a tech career.I completed two internships at large tech companies, but after graduating around the time layoffs began sweeping the industry, I could not find work for about a year. When I finally broke in, I spent the next few years grinding through mostly contract roles, including development, support, and program management, at two FAANG companies. Most paid well under $80k, with no benefits. Even working over 40 hours a week, I was barely surviving. And it left me drained trying to find new work throughout those three years while I worked over 40 hours. I had eventually applied to thousands of jobs even though many were targeted applications. It was consuming my life with no benefit.Over the last few years, I interviewed for about 20 roles, but nothing stuck. Pay stagnated, inflation rose, contracts ended, interviews were canceled mid-process because of layoffs and outsourcing. I did not want to leave tech. But eventually, the cost of living made it impossible to stay. I am starting a family and I want to buy a home, and the path I was on in tech could not support either.I needed something meaningful I could rely on for career growth and stability. That is when I turned to law enforcement. It shares some overlap with the military in structure, though it is not the same. For me the constant deployments were the only thing I didn't enjoy, and this is the closest I could find that felt similar without needing to travel overseas constantly. It felt like a better fit for the life I needed to build.Now, I am starting my new career. In many major west coast cities, law enforcement compensation surprisingly matches or beats the tech roles I once chased. Retirement comes in your early 50s if you want it, without penalty. I plan to use my GI Bill for a master's degree and eventually specialize in areas like police forensics. It is already improving my quality of life.I am mourning the career and identity I once imagined. But I am hopeful about what lies ahead. This path will eventually give me the freedom, disposable income, and stability to return to tech on my own terms, whether that means building my own product, starting a company, or, if nothing else, creating open-source tools that still have real impact. It may not look like the dream I once had, but it might be a better one.For now, it is another opportunity for someone else who loves this field the way it demands. I am finally choosing a path that fits me, and I do not regret it.",

        "content": "I just want to put a disclaimer: I am not saying FAANG or Big Tech sucks. It has its pros, but it also has its cons. Same with non-tech companies. But looking back on my years in the industry.. I just want to reflect on my experience and post about it.When I was just starting out, I thought I had it all figured out. Like so many others in this sub, I had one goal drilled into my brain: FAANG or bust. I thought if I was not at a top tech company or at least something adjacent, I was failing. That prestige, that resume clout, that salary, it was all that mattered.Fast forward to today. I am at a FAANG-adjacent company, something people would brag about on LinkedIn, and honestly I am exhausted. I am not even talking about having a busy week tired. I am talking about chronic, soul-sucking, life-flattening exhaustion. Every day feels like running a marathon at a sprinter's pace. There is an endless barrage of Slack messages, Jira tickets, unexpected urgent meetings, and late-night pings that just need a quick review. Every quarter feels like another round of brutal performance reviews where you are judged against metrics that seem to move the second you get close to hitting them.Even my friends who made it into the actual FAANG companies are not living the dream. They are constantly worried about the next round of layoffs. They are stuck in environments where one minor mistake can tank their rating and put their career at risk. Some are taking anxiety medication now. Some do not even enjoy coding anymore, something that used to be their passion. It has been hard to watch.And then there are my other friends.The ones I used to quietly judge. The ones who went into banking tech, insurance companies, healthcare systems, government contractors. The so-called safe non-tech companies.When we catch up, the contrast is hard to ignore. They work 20 to 30 hours a week. They log off by 4 PM, laptops closed until the next morning. No emergency production issues in the middle of the night. No hyper-aggressive performance reviews. No constant fear about the next reorg or layoff. Their companies are profitable and stable and not reacting to every market fluctuation with mass job cuts.They are happy. Genuinely happy.They have hobbies. They go hiking. They build side projects for fun. They go to the gym without feeling guilty. They spend time with family, with friends, with themselves. They are not worried about falling behind because their companies are not built on a culture of constant comparison.When I look at them now, I see peace. A peace I forgot was even possible in this industry.I was so obsessed with winning early on that I did not realize how much I was sacrificing along the way. My health. My happiness. My actual life outside of work. I thought prestige would make it all worth it, but you cannot deposit mental stability into a bank account. You cannot get back the years of stress you burned through trying to chase a logo on a resume.I am proud of what I have achieved. But if I could go back and tell my younger self one thing, it would be this: ***Prestige is not everything. Stability and happiness matter more than any brand name ever will.***To anyone out there grinding away and feeling miserable but telling themselves it will all be worth it once they get to the next step. Please remember that you are allowed to choose a different path. You are allowed to choose yourself over the brand. It is not giving up. It is winning in a different way.",

A lot of them were advertising and boasting that their (bootcamp grads) were becoming productive in a few weeks, while it took university grads 1 year to become productive (based on market research). Does it actually take that long?I've also heard stories that a surprisingly large number of fresh grads can't even solve fizzbuzz.I find all of this stuff so puzzling. Say that you graduated with a degree in CS. Maybe you have one fullstack CRUD app to your name as a personal project, and maybe you did a team project in school where you used git and worked with a team of people where you made a technical toy project that required some problem solving, no fancy UI or anything like that.What is realistically that difference between this person and someone who has 2-3 years work experience as a developer that also have to learn a new tech stack? I can't really see why the new grad would necessarily be worse, or not given a chance. To me it mostly comes down to IQ, personal ability, personality, communication skills etc. Sure, in an application process its hard to give the \"new grad\" a chance. But if you give them an interview at least they can show their personality/how they think about things. I've also heard that everyone is saying that there's 1000 applicants for every job, that's why people with 0 experience get 0 interviews. But how is that even possible, and wouldn't it eventually even out? If there's 20k available jobs, and 20k available candidates, some jobs aren't being filled. I guess new grads are just so incredibly bad that the loss of hiring them is way bigger than not having a filled position?Also how does AI play into this? Is juniors just so bad that any senior just automatically does the job now with AI 10x as fast? So there's no need for juniors?",

My salary is so low for where I live, I live paycheck to paycheck and around half of my paycheck goes to just apartment rent, and the rest to food and living and bills and then the rest of what is left to savings The company is hiring and just hired some new junior software devs, and one of them was there for around 2 months but 3 weeks ago, got fired for not performing. Through the loop I found out he was being paid $14,000 a month which is $168,000 USD… I feel that I put so much effort in and the company has benefited a lot from projects I have worked on and then also had the chance to lead yet my salary is just $4500 a month after taxes in the area I live in, but new devs are getting paid more than doubleI also feel really bad because I discovered an engineer that has been around even longer than me is only making $45,000! even though he has been here probably since the start of the company began. that to me is absolutely crazy I honestly don't know how he survives There is also a sort of becoming more toxic environment from the higher ups, perpetuating a negative and cutthroat culture to perform and rush things as quick as possible I did have trouble in this job market getting a job and am grateful that I was able to get experience, however I am now feeling very undermined right now for the amount of effort I have been putting in and am ready to job hop, and have been applying around and have 2 other companies interested, one of them which the starting pay is $160,000. The other job is for $80,000 which is just a little more of what I am making right now, neither are even offers yet but I am now ready to leave after finding this information out I would love any tips from anyone on how to schedule and do interviews when you have a full time job(that you are planning to get out of because they seem to love not treating their employees humanely)",

Interview with both founders -- but separately, so two different meetingsI got rejected at the 6th and final stage.The feedback was that my technical expertise was spot on but that I didn't communicate the impact I had on previous teams well enough. I find this somewhat perplexing since I did give concrete examples with data on systems and projects I lead -- involving architecting, designing, and implementing. I recall something one of the founders said in our chat: \"We want missionaries not mercenaries\" -- so perhaps I didn't seem devout enough to join, who knows. It's a bummer because overall it was a substantial time sink and I felt like I got along really well with everyone I'd be interfacing with on a daily basis -- plus the role and responsibilities seemed like a perfect match for me.

I did a take home assignment, needed to add fizzbuzz logic onto a premade appIn the first tech interview I had to set the starting/default amount (of the input) to 10. In the live coding one, they wanted me to refactor the fizzbuzz function. But it was also mainly communicating what stuff does! Which is really cool cause I had to do that a lot in my previous roles, doing tech demos every once in a while I was told by friends that they wanted to do this to see if I could actually program and didn’t rely off of AI.

And with how fast AI and automation are evolving, it feels like the future is more fragile than most people admit.Because of that, I’ve been thinking about how to start building real independence early:1.Side skills that could turn into freelance work.2. Small projects that could eventually generate income streams outside of employment.3. Financial strategies to lower dependence on a paycheck.I’m not planning to quit my job or anything crazy. Just want to start laying bricks while the sun is shining, instead of waiting for a storm.Curious:1. Has anyone here started building their \"Plan B\" while still working full-time?2.

There’s a weird idea floating around that these senior developers and tech leads are born with some genetic advancement that makes their brains better at coding. I highly doubt that. I think they’ve just had years of experience. Software development is learned over time, it’s not something you’re just born good at. If this were basketball, ok this guys born with genetics that make him 7 feet tall. If this were football, ok this kid was born to be 260 pounds at 16 years old. But software development? That’s like… just being exposed too and practicing a tech stack repeatedly.If your new grad is failing or not getting hired, let’s exclude new grads who genuinely just don’t want to be software developers or can’t work in an environment without freaking out and punching someone. They’re not who I’m talking about. Since the bare minimum requirement to even have a seed to grow into a good developer is the ability to break down complex problems, patience, persistence, and willingness to learn, I think the vast majority of people can grow into good developers. But people need structure, exposure, and practice with a consistent stack before you make judgement calls on their overall lifetime ability to excel in technology.Basically, I’m babbling, but new grads who want to be software developers being incompetent isn’t the problem here. I think it’s more likely just market demand, lack of onboarding structure and documentation, unreasonable expectations for a new graduate skill level.",

We recently got a new developer on our team from a different team in the company, so he has little context/knowledge of our application or the data flow.He was assigned a bug fix for a feature that I had implemented several months back so he's been coming to me for questions. The bug fix is a one line change. When he first picked up the ticket, he pinged me asking for some context/info. I provided him a detailed explanation of the flow and even pointed out how very similar bugs in the past have been fixed (the same solution as the one liner). I basically gave him everything he needed except for straight up telling him exactly what line to change. He's been working on this ticket for 4 days now.At what point do I step in and just tell him what to change? It feels like I would be kinda micromanaging him at that point but maybe I'm just looking at this wrong idk",

BUT, I am early in my career, and I would love to 'survive' for 1-2 years, as it would look great on the resume and lead me towards a good career trajectory. In all honesty, I am completely leaning towards accepting this offer, but I still wanted to post on this subreddit and hear opinions, discussions, warnings etc. Thanks!",

I’ve also worked with AWS and have decent CI/CD experience. On paper, it feels like I should be getting interviews—but I’m not. I suspect my resume might be holding me back, but there’s more to it.Lately, when I try to code or prep, my mind just goes blank. Maybe it’s burnout, maybe imposter syndrome, maybe just stress from being unemployed. Either way, I’m trying to get back on track and become a viable candidate again—but I’m not sure where to start.So my questions are:- What can I do to rebuild my confidence and focus?- How do I make myself stand out in a crowded job market?- What makes someone a “strong candidate” today, beyond just tech stacks?- Any tips on resume improvement, or even where to get real feedback?Any advice would mean a lot right now.

I graduated in the fall semester of 2014 and have been working as a developer for 7 and a manager for the last 4 years.Recently I began applying for jobs as an engineering manager. I have to say it’s been though in our side as well. While the amount of call backs I get is very high the amount of jobs for this level are also very low. I have applied to a mixture of companies from Fortune 50, to Fortune 500 in all sectors from Fintech to healthcare.I have had maybe 32 conversations with recruiters. I have a very specific requirement. I do not want to manage an overseas team especially if I have to go the office 5 days a week to do it.Out of those 32 conversations only one company Capital One had me managing developers in the USA. Every single other company was in India EVERY single other company. Sometimes I would get a mix where there would be 2-8 US devs just doing high level architecture design then handing the work over.I thought about the Capital One job and I reached out to a contact at there and he told me pretty much the whole team was basically here on H1B visas including the other engineering managers. I’ve been around long enough to know how bad monoculture work environments are especially with H1B’s AND stack ranking so I declined that job as well.I have to be honest with you guys. I am going to need a job soon. I have been trying my best not to contribute to this outsourcing mess especially when it’s denying opportunities to people like me who came from bad social economic backgrounds and a no name school and was blessed to get a junior role where I could grow.I been reaching out to my network and it’s the same everywhere. Whole teams are getting replaced. I have friends that used to work normal hours waking up in the middle of the night to jump into sprint planning meetings. I got people crying and hugging their employees as their entire in office team is laid off then they have to drive into the office everyday just to hop on zoom calls with people in Argentina.If we don’t get some legislative solutions for this I think our sector is going to go the way of manufacturing. You are going to be telling your kids about how you used to work a tech job right out of college for a good wage.",

I didn’t get to make any mistakes in this short tenure yet, but I imagine if I did, then he would come up with a speech about how breaking things is the way of innovation or some other nonsence. This manager was recently promoted into his role after being an individual contributor for a long time at this company, so I imagine it’s not out of the ordinary that he still doesn’t have a hang of things.

        "content": "Hey everyone,I'm a 31M with about four years of software engineering experience. I spent my first year working as a consultant and have since been working as a fullstack engineer, with a heavy focus on backend engineering.Currently, I'm at a large tech company — maybe a step or two below FAANG — but it's a name most people would recognize. Lately, though, I've been feeling stagnant. I'm still classified as an entry-level engineer in terms of pay and title, even though I'm consistently performing at a level or two above that. (That's not just my opinion — both my manager and two technical mentors have told me this.)For example, as a Level 1 engineer, I'm technically supposed to be mostly taking tickets, relying on senior engineers for clarification, and developing technical depth in one main language. In reality, my day-to-day work involves starting and completing projects independently, defining requirements while working with outside stakeholders, implementing new technologies into our tools, and even managing a contractor. There’s a big gap between my responsibilities and my official title.Some extra context: since joining my current role, my company has gone through two rounds of layoffs, and my team has been moved under two different organizations (so I've had two different skip-level managers). Although no one has explicitly said it, I suspect that promotions are being slowed or avoided to cut costs, especially since the current job market makes it less likely that people will leave. Promotions *have* happened elsewhere in the company, but not on my team.That said, if I didn't enjoy my job, I would just risk it and leave. But the truth is, I actually like it. My boss is supportive, my work-life balance is solid, and the benefits are good. The only real issue is that my career growth — specifically my title and pay — feels stuck. Technically, I'm still learning and working on interesting problems, so in that sense I’m not stagnant.I'm looking for advice on what to do next. Stay patient and hope things change? Look for a new opportunity elsewhere? Thanks!",

It was never a large team to begin with, 5 developers plus my manager, managing ecommerce platforms, data, internal business applications, b2b systems, AI services, etc.Last year we lost one developer who was frustrated by the direction we were going. Her position was never filled, instead they hired a developer from India in an adjacent team, to focus on software for the warehouse. Then one developer was moved to a specific niche dealing with our internal Microsoft integrations. Now finally, another developer is being removed from my team. They carried a lot of weight because they were one of those \"say yes to everything\" work 16-hour day folks. However, now they are being completely removed from our area of the company and reassigned. I'm left with 1 other developer and he is very junior.In 1 year, I've gone from a 5 person team to a 2 person team, and yet no expectations have been adjusted. I am being told that I should take on all the responsibilities of the developer that's now being moved, while maintaining my current responsibilities, compensating for the 2 developers that left last year who were never filled, and on top of all that with the company breathing down my neck wanting to start no less than 5 new major projects.And my manager is acting like everything is completely normal and seems to have no concept that this is completely impractical. I have asked for more staff for a year but it's falling on deaf ears, even when projects that were supposed to take 4 months ended up taking us close to a year. At the very least I have been asking for the opportunity to pair-program and work with some of the more senior developers that have left or are being reassigned, and yet the company cannot make time for that. There's always an excuse, some other \"more pressing issue\" that I have to focus on before training can happen.I feel like I'm being set up to fail and I have no idea how to plan for this. I am obviously looking for other jobs, but this is the worst market in a long time. I have some financial cushion, but I don't want to quit because of how the Economy is looking. That said, if I don't quit it feels like I will really quickly be backed into a corner where I am being asked to work insane hours to address even a portion of the responsibilities that are being laid on me or have to be constantly explaining why things are delayed and all blame put on my shoulders.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hello. I'm a programmer in a tech startup that develops IoT devices for on-water activities as well as a companion app for them. Due to the nature of our usage case, we sometimes have to operate in bad network conditions: the internet bandwidth may be small, the link between smart trackers and user's phones may be unstable.. etc.. A binary protocol is such a good fit for this situation: saves the bandwidth, allows to have a unification between TCP and Bluetooth comms, works great on low-ram IoT devices. My first look went into Protobuf of course, as it slowly shapes like a new \"JSON of binary world\". But when I started digging deeper, I discovered that it has multiple big downsides and I can easily fix them if I make my own proto (spoiler: I made it).1. The generated code is HUGE (especially in Dart which is used for frontend).2. It doesn't support classes inheritance. Inheritance can be bad in some cases, but if inheriting a class with some common fields halves the codebase size, I do want to have that option.3. Some features like Enums are replaced by strange stuff like int consts (again, Dart code looks even worse)4. That whole stuff with optionals and fallback defaults isn't reliable: if it's a backwards compatible protocol, the fields have to be explicitly nullable without any fallback values.5. You can just make a bitfield for null values at the start of the message, and by doing so, you can get rid of the field headers (id + type) entirely: the id doesn't exist because fields are sequential, the type is known in schema. If receiver schema is old and transmitter has sent some unknown fields, these fields are always at the end of the message, so you can just skip these bytes.And so what I did is I actually wrote a protocol myself, and tested it for a while. Now, even though I still love it, my mind keeps thinking about the following problem: if and when the time comes to hire more people, how do I explain this tech stack to them? Protobuf is a well-known thing, we can just put it as a requirement and be okay. But what about in-house solution? Also, if we need to add another programming language the our system, the protocol has to be implemented by someone.Now I'm doubting if I should continue working with our in-house protocol, or switch to Protobuf. My questions are:1. Is an average developer ready to learn custom binary protocols?2. In other companies using binary protocols, how popular is it to write a custom one and how do employees feel about using it?3. Am I the only one to be unhappy with Protobuf and do I get something wrong about it?",

        "author": "thefox13guy",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I've been a programmer professionally since the late 00s. I'm in Portland, which is just a mid-sized market, but still has plenty of tech jobs. I've worked at small startups as the first or second full time dev, some mid-sized companies, and FANG. I've been through a few acquisitions and survived many layoffs.Well, I was recently laid off for the first time from a mid-sized, B-tier tech company that I was having a great time at, so I am out there applying again. It was due to the typical offshoring trend and I was grateful to have survived a few rounds of layoffs and wasn't too worried. I've never had a hard time getting responses from local companies, and probably most of the time I would get interviews, and most interviews I would get an offer. But this time is different.I've applied for about two dozen companies (hybrid or onsite, haven't expanded to remote yet) and gotten almost no response. I think I am more than qualified for them and am perfectly fine with the compensation and all of that (ie, I wasn't just randomly blasting applications out there, I was picking things I genuinely wanted to do). 2-3 companies sent me a rejection based on my application, I've talked to 2-3 recruiters, and had one \"onsite\" interview. So let's just say I've gotten any response at all from about 25-30% of the companies I sent applications to. This is much lower than I'm used to.Here is the thing: I'm starting to wonder if having been at FANG and Big Tech (even though it was B-tier) most recently has hurt my chances. Just a few years ago I would've thought that having FANG would be a huge benefit for job hunting. And the 2-3 recruiters I've talked to seemed to like it, like it would make me a more marketable candidate.But after the one onsite interview, I started to question that for the first time. I was prepared for a technical interview with maybe some behavioral, but the interviewer asked me quite a bit about FANG. I was surprised and got the feeling they thought negatively of it, like asking me about certain projects and responding with, \"So, you're saying you just wrote some Java?\" with a tone that they were downplaying what I did there.Don't get me wrong. Everything at FANG wasn't very impressive. The whole thing is mostly a joke (esp. the LeetCode interviews and corporate Kool Aid) and FANG tends to be a grindhouse for new grads who otherwise have no other experience, not a bunch of math geniuses writing crazy algorithms. But prior to that interview I didn't stop to think if I should mention it in my work history; it seemed obvious that I should. Now I'm starting to wonder all sorts of things like maybe companies are gonna think I'll ask for hundreds of thousands, that I only know how to do \"Big Tech non-sense\", or that I'll be a hard to work with.Do any hiring managers or ex-FANG have any thoughts on this? Seeing as how I am just looking for a local tech job where I can get work done and enjoy my time with the team, maybe I should just remove it from my work history?",

With the job market being this rough, many people end up taking jobs they aren't necessarily passionate about (stepping stones) but they can't just immediately leave to not be flagged as a job hopper. *BTW, I'm thankful for having a job. I know it's tough out there.* How can they make the most of these opportunities?For example, what if the job uses a completely different tech stack than what you've worked with throughout your career, or even worse, historically the market don't want this tech stack, or if the role is different (i.e. transitioning from backend to frontend heavy fullstack), or you're not interested in the domain (i.e. insurance)? If you plan to stay in this job for at least 3 years while waiting for the job market to improve (if it ever does), how can you make the most of the situation?In my experience, becoming a domain expert and the goto person in a part of the system it's what makes you grow within an organization. However, becoming an expert requires time and effort, and both of these have an opportunity cost.So knowing that time is finite and I can just study so much while keeping all my other adult responsibilities, should I focus on becoming an expert in this new tech stack and domain to take ownership and grow, in detriment of my original stack, knowing that my original stack is still evolving and requires ongoing study, and that I might never use this new stack again?",

I am currently 23 and I was hired last year at General Motors in Michigan in the TRACK program where I currently work as a test engineer mainly working with controls and very little software, I mainly do personal projects at home. My base salary is 86k with a 10% bonus per year that can change based off factors. I have a job offer at Honeywell for 104k base no bonus in Phoenix, AZ, as an Electrical Engineer 2 in military avionics. I was told its a mix of hardware and software for this role. My goal for my career is to get into software preferably at a tech company as I enjoy coding and know the pay is better. I work on side projects and plan on getting certifications and such to help appeal to those tech companies hopefully soon. I know I will prefer Phoenix in terms of location but I am unsure of what might be better for my career. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

I want to move to game dev but I don’t know the first thing about it. I don’t love developing, I just kind of like it, but when I first started I think I really did love it and now I just feel like I’m on autopilot and I suck at what I do. Not enough to get fired, and I’ve still gotten a few raises but at the end of the day I don’t enjoy it and I’m not good at it. Would moving to game dev be a bad idea? It’s something I’m genuinely interested in and I think I would start loving this again if I was working on something I actually cared about.

However we had a meeting and I was really surprised at how much people are using AI just in day to day work. I'm talking copy and pasting emails into chatGPT to write responses, or using chatGPT to write up a script for morning standups. These sort of things seem out of place to me, maybe it's the changing of times but if you don't know how to respond to an email or can't tell me what you did yesterday without an AI it feels like you should have failed the recruitment interview. I'm not sure if this is something everyone is doing now.So just wondering how much are you using AI day to day and what's it for ?",

        "content": "Hi everyone,I'm a relatively new developer about to leave my first non-internship role for a significant pay increase. I currently work at a local Fortune 500 company's office making ~$85k/year, and have been here for almost a year. I've accepted an offer as an SDE-1 from one of the major tech giants for approximately double my current salary. The new offer is in the same city, so thankfully I don't have to handle moving logistics along with everything else here.I have received e-contracts that I've clicked \"sign\" on (not sure how binding these are?), and their background check is currently underway. I have *not* been introduced to my manager or gotten team match confirmation yet, but I've heard that this can often take until a week before your start date at this specific company. Technically the offer could still be rescinded, but I think that's fairly unlikely.My start date at the new company is June 9th, and I have a pre-planned europe trip the last half of May. I'm trying to decide between three options:1. Resign now: Give my full two weeks' notice, finish cleanly, then enjoy my vacation and an additional week completely job-free before starting the new position.2. Resign after vacation: Return from my trip and immediately submit my resignation, giving slightly less than two weeks for documentation and handover. This approach would also eliminate any risk of the offer being rescinded while I'm already unemployed.3. Sandwich notice period with vacation: Resign one week before vacation, and offer to work one more week after I get back. This would give them a long time to decide what to do, and would hopefully let the background check clear before I give them notice of my departure. The downside is mostly that this would feel kind of weird to me, but maybe it's more normal than I think?What would be the most professional approach in this situation? Any insights from those who have navigated similar transitions would be greatly appreciated. This is the first time I've ever quit a job, so I'm a little lost and anxious here.",

For us internships are mandatory. You cannot graduate without an internship. You cant even pass to the next year without a summer internship.Internships are part of your grade. The first year internship is called Initiation Internship or Observation Internship (at least one month). The second year internship is called Technical Internship (at least 2 months). And for the Final year, its a 6 month internship that start in January (half of the academic year is just the internship no classes), called PFE ( Projet Fin Etude), which translates to End of Education Project.You supervisor has to give you like a grade on a form supplied by the school. At the start of the academic year. You have to present what you did at the internship in front of a panel of professors. And the the final one PFE internship project is a pretty big deal. You have to defend your work/project like a thesis in front of the panel. If you fuck up, you wont graduate.Now dont get me wrong our system is utter shit in many aspects. But at-least you usually have a pretty solid CV showing real world experience.And I think this applies to all our schools not just Engineering.",

Job market was rough for international students, and big tech wasn’t hiring, but I was fortunate enough to get a return offer from my internship at a mid-sized company. I was doing ML research and modelling work in a lab before my job but I’m now working in the ML Platform/MLOps team.Work involves building big data platforms, data drift monitoring, IAC, optimizing CI/CD pipelines, model deployment, Docker, load balancers, async programming, and building semantic search engines.Stack: Python, PySpark, AWS, Databricks, Docker, Pulumi, asyncio.Fully remote, good WLB, $118k base + $50k~$60k RSUs over 4 years with a bulk of it vested towards the end. Grateful to have something stable in this economy. But the compensation doesn’t increase much in the long run in my company compared to big tech and its always been my dream to work at a big tech like google.A few questions:1. ML work here in my company is mostly calling LLM APIs which I find boring. One of the main reasons why I switched to MLOps. If you are an MLE at a big tech how does your work look like? If I pivot, I’d want to focus on Information Retrieval/RecSys.2. I enjoy the engineering side more. Should I stay in ML Platform roles or move toward more traditional MLE roles?3. How’s ML Platform Engineering for long-term career growth? 4. Should I stay a year more and try for SDE 2 equivalent roles at FAANG/big tech? ( I will have 3 YoE by next march including my internships and work experience before masters). Hearing bad things about Meta/Amazon WLB and layoffs. How is the scene at other big tech companies?Would appreciate any advice! Thank you!",

I didn't choose to be in COBOL; that's what they trained and assigned me to and I didn't have anywhere else to go to at that time. I could have left and tried to go for a more useful tech stack after 2 years but the pandemic happened so looking for a new job was impossible. When the pandemic ended, I eventually got to move to a different company and do Java development instead.My problem is, I only have 2+ years of professional experience with Java. I've been working for way longer than that but I'm treated more like a mid level developer because my only experience in Java is that long and nobody seems to care about my 4 years of experience in COBOL because to be quite honest, it's a really outdated language. I'm unable to break into the senior developer level in my company because I need more years of experience with Java.To make things worse, I have zero work experience in frameworks, APIs, microservices, cloud development, etc. The Java project I worked on didn't have those, or at least didn't have me do work in those. I never got to work on CI/CD or databases because that's not the task I got assigned to. I got to do side tasks like automation with Excel VBA macros but that doesn't seem to be as helpful for my resume as it sounds.Meanwhile, I see others younger than me get to be 5 years of experience, have experience with things like AWS, microservices, frameworks, RedHat, containers, etc.Did they just get lucky in their projects and I got unlucky? How do I even ask my manager to put me in a project that allows me to gain experience with cloud development, microservices, frameworks, and all that trendy stuff? There is an opportunity in my company that wants COBOL developers and maybe I could make it as a senior COBOL developer but I fear that it's only going to exacerbate my current issue. How does one even navigate this? I feel like I have to choose between catching up in experience as a Java developer or being a senior COBOL developer in a rapidly declining language.",

My ultimate goal and wish is to be a better software engineer and eventually grow to be a senior someday (I am 27 yo and about to finish my CS degree with a data science specialisation)In total I have about 3 YOE, in my previous role I was a fullstack developer working with a Java Spring Boot/Angular tech stack in an agile environment and micro services and it was fun and dynamic but the culture was horrible and eventually burnt me out.Now I am working in the IT department of a finance related company that used to be very small and recently grew since ~1,5 years but in the IT department the processes haven't really adapted yet. Legacy code base with huge theoretical complexity (Java, Spring, Maven, JavaFX) and a web application that is built in Angular (15-17) built by an external service provider with 5-6 developers from that company that have made software for us for the past 15 years. Me and another colleague were hired so they have internal 'back-up' but the communication is difficult, we don't have any project management basically, very waterfall based, barely any structured work, deadlines or planning. We feel lost about the fact that we were hired to help develop software but the circumstances don't help us grow or be better developers. In fact I feel like I am unlearning everything I learnt at uni because I cannot utilize it in the current architecture that is very customized from the general state of the art approaches I've usually been familiar with. We hardly get any support or feedback and it just sucks. Everytime we ask for structural changes and support we have to solve the issues ourselves. We are severly undermanaged and it's really taking a toll on my mental health, work ethic and confidence. I feel kind of depressed to be honest. Everytime I get a spark of hope and optimism and suggest new ideas or ask for more projects or new projects where I can play around and not struggle with the spaghetti codebase, it gets crushed.I love my coworkers and feel comfortable on a personal level. The pay is good and the job is very safe/stable so I feel so guilty and bad about feeling so lost work wise. I really don't know what to do, I am scared to give up the stability this job gives me but I feel like I am capable of more. I feel very safe here but at the same time I feel like I am wasting away the best years of my career by stagnating in a dysfunctional company. What do I do?TL;DR: severly undermanaged and not seeing any possibility to grow and use my skills in current job and feeling guilty about giving up a positive work environment/culture",

        "content": "Before writing, I'm not looking for any \"just give up it's all cooked\" or \"just put the fries in the bag\" etc. I'm aware that the job market in general is not good and even more so if you're a weak candidate like me - the question I'm trying to explore is just what to do from here. I've been struggling with what to do for a couple years since I wasn't able to get an internship, but obviously it's now coming to a head. That being said, this is half-rant half-looking for advice so I'd appreciate constructive feedback.I'm an upcoming new grad, but (aside from a capstone project with a startup and teaching web design), I don't have a ton of marketable SWE skills other than the fundamentals. I was not able to secure a proper internship during my school career, so my only real experience is with the startup, where I mostly helped design the database, user design, and implement some AI functionality.I picked computer science because I felt it was a good balance of security and things that I like. That being, I like tech and problem solving. I was never particularly passionate about software engineering in particular, but I do love debugging and building upon existing projects. But as I approach graduation in a few weeks and hundreds of applications (and some referrals) are now returning rejections, I'm not really sure where to do. And I have already been applying to anything vaguely tech related across the US, but not getting any callbacks, which I'm sure is an indication of my resume strength.I'm feeling lost like I'm sure a lot of other people are. I feel like I'm just losing out to the people who are far more experienced and passionate than me. The response to that would be to work on personal projects and hone my portfolio, but I'm honestly skeptical that would even work. Granted, I haven't put a ton of time into doing so yet as I've been focusing on school and work, so I don't actually know yet, but I see all these super experienced and talented people getting turned down all the time anyways so it's a bit defeating.**TL;DR:** My dilemma is this - I don't know if the best plan of action is just to bunker down and grind out personal projects while continuing to apply everywhere, or instead try to study a related field to try and break in there, which would be basically any role that appreciates a CS degree. Whether that's QA, tech support/IT, data analysis, etc., I think any of them could be engaging work for me still, but I think I would still need to specifically study one of them to get in.If anyone is interested - [here's my anonymous resume](https://imgur.com/a/AZqRh80). If anyone has any tips for improving it, that would be appreciated as well. Thanks all.",

I spent 3 years there until getting hired into a very small startup position as a full stack dev last July.I am approaching my first year in this position and our senior developer is being poached by our biggest client. I am definitely seeing this as an opportunity to sort of usurp his throne and grow into a more senior developer mindset- even if my experience doesn't say I'm senior-ready.With the way the market is right now, I'd think the best play would be to really ride out the position I'm in at the moment especially considering I do not have formal education.I guess I am just seeking wise words/valuable resources to help me get more into this senior mindset.",

        "content": "TL;DR : I have built some projects in ES and SE and liked ES a bit more but find SE to have more opportunities even though it might become so boring and hellish. Didn't try building any ML projects but I think ML jobs will be highly demanded in the future due to the fast progress of AI and what people are saying online (maybe thats just hype).I can't decide between software engineering, embedded systems and machine learning. I like them all and have had experience with some of them but I know that I can't be a jack of all trades.For embedded systems, I have built 2 arduino projects back in high school (currently I'm in my second year of CS uni). First one was a basic project with some LEDs and some code to make the LEDs light in different ways. Second one was a car that follows a black line and avoids obstacles. I really enjoyed and loved it. Though I have no idea what the market is for ES.For software engineering, I have not made any full projects, just some basic terminal projects, like fizzbuzz and some python scripts that automated some tasks for me. I'm currently in the process of making my first uni project (a games library with search and user authentification functionalities). I'm also going to have an internship this summer as a web dev. I enjoyed the small projects a lot, but I don't know how I'll feel about this project by the time I finish it or about the web dev internship. However, I think I have the best chance at this since I'm from a third world country and I think finding jobs in SE would be easier (not easy, just easier).For machine learning, I haven't tried anything yet. I have planned a final project for my bachelors, which is going to be an AI customer support agent (a family member has a business and suggested I try making that tool for their business). I don't know anything about ML, but I know it requires a lot of math, and I've been a math nerd since high school (solved about 1000+ math problems in my last year of high school). I also think that ML will be a \"goldmine\" for those who choose it now because I keep seeing online that ML jobs will be in high demand in the future.I know I'm deciding what I want to do based on my feelings, but I want to choose something that I'm not gonna regret by the time I turn 30. For example, I like some aspects of software engineering, but I do know that many software engineers hate their jobs because of how shit the work environment is in many companies (too many meetings, coding the same shit everyday...etc).What should I base my decision on? Preference? Market state? Opportunities?And how should I know if I actually enjoy any of these (if I should choose based on passion)?I appreciate anybody who took the time to read this.",

        "content": "Hello! I'm a CS grad with 2YoE as a System Engineer and an internship as an SRE, and am looking for jobs in the DevOps/SRE/Cloud Engineering space. I just worked on a personal project that I would appreciate your opinion on. It's an AWS Infrastructure automation pipeline using Jenkins, Terraform and Ansible. Please look at it from the lens of a recruiter/hiring manager and tell me if this is eye catching enough or if I should do something more complex or useful.* Terraform - Starts the EC2 instance using a launch template and auto-scaling group with all necessary attributes attached (Security groups, key-value pair, etc).* Ansible - Logs into the EC2 instance, downloads services and copies necessary HTML and CSS files from my portfolio website into /var/www/html, making it visible from the browser.* Jenkins - Has two pipelines. * 'Create' pipeline * Runs the terraform part to start the EC2 instance, retrieves IP of the new instance using the aws-describe command, and adds it to hosts file for ansible to use it. Then, runs the ansible part to get the website live. * Triggered by a git push * 'Destroy' pipeline * Runs terraform destroy to take down the infrastructure safely. * This is invoked by the 'create' pipeline and runs 15 minutes after it.I did learn a lot about all these tools, credential security and management, automation, etc. Before y'all come at me, I know that some of my choices might seem weird, like - using Jenkins instead of Github Actions, or using Ansible when the entire thing can be taken care of by a user\\_data script, or hosting it on AWS when I can just have it on my .github.io page. I used the tools and technologies because I wanted to learn these tools specifically, as they seem to be more prevalent in job descriptions. I'm open to honest feedback and would love to improve. I love automation and I love building things, so I can do this all over again without an issue.Thank you!",

I’m very lucky to be in a good paying remote gig at the moment. But nothing in tech lasts forever. Would getting an online CS masters degree help my career at this point? Or should I just upskill and build projects instead? I’m tired of being a full stack generalist, and I know the demand for that is decreasing.",

I also worked for two years doing analysis and data reduction using MATLAB.I'd like to prepare ahead of time to strengthen my application and be more ready for the coursework once the program starts.I'm considering taking an intro to CS course, either through WGU or my local community college. Both are online, but I can start the WGU course about two months earlier. The price difference is minimal, around $50.Second, how much CS knowledge is typically expected going into a Master’s in CS?I would like to go into the drone industry where Machine Learning is being used a lot right now.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’m currently working as a junior dev in a fully remote role in the US, with around 1.5 years experience. Yesterday my manager told me that they are going to start requiring us to come onsite for a week every other month. And even though it’s fully paid for and they are supposedly paying for my transportation and stuff, I want to be mentally prepared in case this turns into full onsite mandate. As inconvenient as it would be, I would be able to come to terms with RTO as long as I made enough to reasonably live & save on my own, and if the place that I am relocating to is reasonably populated with some scope of finding a new job if I get laid off. Unfortunately, neither box is checked in my case. I don’t make enough to live and save on my own (I’m only afloat right now because my parents let me live with them and my role is fully remote), and the city that I would be relocating to is tiny and in the middle of nowhere. Tbh I only took this job because the market is really bad for juniors and I desperately need some experience to jumpstart my career. My biggest fears are that if I had to relocate in the future, I would not be able to save and just be living paycheck to paycheck. And the town that I would be living in is tiny and has little facilities, and not close to any larger cities. If I got laid off, there is almost zero scope for other tech opportunities in the area (I’ve checked), and I would have to move away again. It’s also nowhere near my parents or anyone I know, so I don’t have a safety net or people in a reasonable driving distance if things go awry. Almost no socialization opportunities either. But obviously, I need experience and the market is still bad for juniors right now, so leaving means I might stagnate and struggle to find a new role. What would you do if you were in my shoes? Or if you’ve faced something similar, any tips?",
