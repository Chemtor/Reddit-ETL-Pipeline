        "content": "I might come off as complaining, but it’s been 9 months since I started hunting for a new data engineering position with zero luck. After 7 years of doing DE (working with Oracle BI, self-hosted Spark clusters, and optimizing massive Snowflake and BigQuery warehouses) I’m feeling stuck. For the first time, I’ve made it to the final stages with 8 companies, but unlike before when I’d land multiple offers, I'm totally out of luck.What’s changed?Why are companies acting like jerks?Last week, I had a design review meeting with an athletic clothing company, and the guy grilled me on specific design details that felt like his assigned homework; then he rejected me. I’ve spent days working on over 10 take-home assignments, and some looked like Jira tasks, only to get this: “While your take-home showed solid architectural thinking and familiarity with a wide range of data tools, the team felt you lacked the clarity and technical depth to match in the design review meeting.”Seriously? Last year, I was hiring a senior BI engineer and couldn’t find anyone who could write a left join SQL, and now I’m expected to write a query for complex marketing metrics on the fly and still fall short?Here’s what I’ve noticed:* Take-home assignments often feel like ticket work, not real evaluations.* Teams seem to gatekeep, shutting out anyone new.* There’s a huge gap between job descriptions and technical discussions. e.g., the JD and hiring manager were all about AWS Glue, but the technical questions were focused on managing and optimizing a self-hosted Spark cluster on Kubernetes.* Transferable skills get ignored. I’ve worked with BigQuery, Snowflake, Spark, Apache Beam, MongoDB, Airflow, Databricks, GCP, AWS, and set up Delta Lake in my assignment, but I couldn't recite the technical differences between Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake. Nope, not good enough. I got rejected.Do you guys really know all the technologies? Are you some sort of god or what? I can’t know every tech, but I can master anything new. why won’t they see that anymore?I’m tired of this crap! It’s not fair. No one values transferable skills anymore; they demand an exact match on tech stack, plus a massive time spent on prep work: online exams and technical assignments, only to get a “no” at the end.\\-----\\[EDIT\\]I'm not a victim here; I already have a job with decent pay, 17 years of experience, and I want to switch to a better team with a 10% pay cut because I have a shitty boss.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "hey folks, i see a lot of fear of LLMs and i just wanted to say we are doing ourselves a disservice by having knee jerk reactions against it.# The real threat isn’t replacement. It’s displacement.Your work isn’t actually replaceable by autocomplete. But it **looks like it is,** and that’s the problem.LLMs are built to sound confident, not to be correct. They generate fluent, plausible output that gives the *illusion* of competence, without understanding, judgment, or responsibility.So the danger isn’t the model. **It’s your manager thinking you’re replaceable.** Or their manager pressuring them to “do more AI, less people.” Or a CFO using AI as cover for layoffs in a foggy, panic-driven economy.You won’t be replaced by a language model. But you can be **displaced** by the perception that one is “good enough.” The next few years look the same: Industry is adding: memory, tools, multimodal input, even planning— Still out of reach, no clear pathway ahead: **true cognition, self-awareness, reasoning under uncertainty, and grounded understanding.** even today for cognitive restructuring and grounding we use 2k year old methods like socratic questioning - we're nowhere close to solving this.# How you can win this fight Right now, every company is standing in a dense AI fog. No one knows what’s real, what’s hype, or how to use these tools safely.The most valuable roles today? They go to the **LLM navigators** — the people who understand what's possible, what’s coming, and how to steer through uncertainty.It’s the same prestige arc we saw with data 15 years ago. With ML 5–10 years ago. And now it’s your turn.You don’t need to be an LLM expert. But if you’re the one testing tools, forming opinions, stress-testing outputs, and helping others make sense of it all — you’ve already stepped into leadership.**Be the scout.** The one-eyed engineer guiding the blind through this strange new frontier. It’s improv now. The answer is “yes, and…” → Yes, and let’s do it safely. → Yes, and let’s make the most of it. → Yes, and let’s not blow up the business.But “no”? no AI, no experiments, no change? This will get interpreted as “no value.” \"falling behind\" \"missed opportunity\" \"company risk\". And if you’re a blocker, the system will set you free and find a helper.So don’t be a victim. Don’t freeze. Don’t frame it as *you vs. AI.* That’s a losing game.Frame it as: **“I’m the one who understands AI. I’ll help us use it — safely, effectively, and with eyes open.”**That’s who companies want. That’s who they’re **desperate** to invest in. And while you personally as an engineer may not care, this is the **prestige** that data managers in large companies are after - they want to be the person steering the company in AI age, keep job, get promoted, take credit for riding the possibilities out there. It's almost like whitepapers used to be a few years ago. Thanks for coming to my TED talk. I hope this helps you guys keep your jobs.",

Even if there aren't any legitimate reasons, what are your devil's advocate arguments against using them?Maybe I am, indeed, the one who is crazy here since I'm interested in getting the thoughts of actual humans rather than ChatGPT, but... I've encountered quite the gamut of warehouse designs over the course of my time, especially in my consulting days. During this time, I've come to think of primary keys as \"table stakes\" (har har) in the creation of any table. In all my time, I've only encountered two outfits that didn't have any sort of key strategy. In the case of the first, their explanation was \"Ah yeah, we messed that up and should probably fix that.\" But, now, in the case of this latest one, they're treating their lack of keys as a legitimate design choice. This seems unbelievable to me, but I thought I'd take this to the judgement of the broader group: is there a good reason to avoid having any primary keys?I think there are ample reasons to have some sort of key strategy:* Data quality tests: makes it easier to check for unique records and guard against things like fanout.* Lineage: makes it easy to trace the movement of a single record through tables.* Keeps code DRY (don't repeat yourself): effective use of primary/foreign keys can prevent complex \\`join\\` logic from being repeated in multiple places. * Not to mention general \\`join\\` efficiency* Interpretability: makes it easier for users to intuitively reason about a table's grain and the way \\`join\\`s should work.I'd be curious if anyone has any arguments against the above bullets or keys in data warehouses, specifically, more broadly.Full disclosure, I may turn this discussion into a blog post so I can lay out my argument once and for all. But I'll certainly give credit to all you r/dataengineers.",

Thankfully I've never been judged by an AI bot or did any video hiring.That's why now that I've been hiring people I try to design a process that is humane, checks on the actual concepts rather than tools or cs theory and gets an overview of the candidate's programming skills.Now the meat of my rant starts. I see curriculums filled to the brim with all the tools in existance and very few years of experience. I see peopel straight up using AI for every single question in the most blatant way possible. Many candidates mostly cannot code at all past the level of a YouTube tutorial.It's very grim and there seems to be just no shame in feeding any request in any form to the latest bullshit AI that spews out complete trash.Rant over. I don't think most people will take this seriously or listen to what I'm saying because it's a delicate subject, but if you have to take anything out of this post is to stop using AIs for the technical part because it's very easy to spot and it doesn't help anybody.TLDR: stop using AI for the technical step of hiring, it's more damaging than anything",

I manage critical data processing pipelines that, if not handled properly, could cost the company a lot of money. These systems were built internally and never properly documented, not for lack of trying, but because we’ve been operating on a skeleton crew for years. I've asked for help and bandwidth, but it never came. That’s part of why I’m leaving: the pressure has become too much.Here’s the complication:I made the decision to accept a new job the day before I left for a long-planned vacation.My new role starts right after my trip, so I’ll be giving my notice during my vacation, meaning 1/4th of my two weeks will be PTO.I didn’t plan it like this. It’s just unfortunate timing.I genuinely don’t want to leave them hanging, so I plan to offer help after hours and on weekends for a few months to ensure they don’t fall apart. I want to do right by the company and my coworkers.Has anyone here done something similar, offering post-resignation support?How did you propose it?Did you charge them, and if so, how did you structure it?Do you think my offer to help after hours makes up for the shortened two-week period?Is this kind of timing faux pas as bad as it feels?Appreciate any thoughts or advice, especially from folks who’ve been in the “only one who knows how everything works” position.",

Software engineer for 10+ years, switched to data engineering in 2021 after discovering it via business intelligence/data warehousing solutions I was helping out with. I thought it was a great way to get off the dev treadmill and write mostly SQL day to day and it turned out I was really good at it, becoming a tech lead over the next 18 months. I'm trying to go back to dev now. So much stuff as a data engineer is completely out of your control but you're expected to just fix it. People constantly question numbers if it doesn't match their vibes. Nobody understands the complexities. It's also so, so hard to test in the same concrete way as regular services and applications.Data teams are also largely full of non-technical people. I regularly have to argue with/convince people that basic things like source control are necessary. Even my fellow engineers won't take five minutes to read how things like Docker or CI/CD workflows function.I'm looking at a large pay cut going back to being a dev but it's worth my sanity.

        "author": "Kukaac",

        "content": "Dear Fellow Data Engineer,I've been doing data for about 15 years (mostly in data analytics and data leadership - so not hardcore DE, but had DEs reporting to me). Recently, I joined a company that tries to build data models with full star schema normalization, as it was a transactional database.For example, I have a User entity that can be tagged. One user can have multiple Tags.They would create * the User entity* the Tag entity, which only contains the tag (no other dimension or metric)* a UserTag entity that references a many-to-many relationship between the twoAll tables would be SCD2, so it would be separately tracked when the Tag was first recognized and when the Tag has changed.Do you think this approach is normal, and I've been living under a rock? They reason that they want to build something long-term and structured. I would never do something like this, because it just complicates simple things that work anyway.I understand the concept of separating dimensions and fact data, but, in my opinion, creating dedicated tables for enums is rare, even in transactional models.Their progress is extremely slow. Approximately 20 people have been building this data lakehouse with stringent security, governance, and technical requirements (SCD2 for all transformations, with only recalculated IDs between entities) for over two years, but there is still no end-user solution in production due to slow velocity and quality issues.",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I need some honest guidance from the community.I was previously working at a service-based MNC and had been trying hard to switch into a more data-focused role. After a lot of effort, I got an offer from a known consulting company. The role was labeled as Data Engineer, and it sounded like the kind of step up I had been looking for — better tools, better projects, and a brand name that looked solid on paper.Fast forward ~9 months, and honestly, I regret the move almost every single day.There’s barely any actual engineering work. The focus is all on meeting strict client deadlines (which company usually promise to clients), crafting stories, and building slide decks. All the company cares about is how we sell stories to clients, not the quality of the solution or any meaningful technical growth. There’s hardly any real engineering happening — no time to explore, no time to learn, and no one really cares about the tech unless it looks good in a PPT.To make things worse, the work-life balance is terrible. I’m often stuck working late into the night working (mostly 12+ hrs). It’s all about output and timelines — not the quality of work or the well-being of the team.For context, my background is:•~3 years working with SQL, Python, and ETL tools ( like Informatica PowerCenter)•~1 year of experience with PySpark and Databricks•Comfortable building ETL pipelines, doing performance tuning, and working in cloud environments (AWS mostly)I joined this role to grow technically, but that’s not happening here. I feel more like a delivery robot than an engineer.Would love some advice:•Are there companies that actually value hands-on data engineering and learning?•Has anyone else experienced this after moving into consulting?Appreciate any tips, advices, or even relatable experiences.",

In there, we have resources that are spin up by business analysts, data analysts and project managers. There is no clear traceability for the resources as they weren’t deployed using iaac and instead directly on aws console, just imagine a crazy amount of resources like S3, EC2, Lambdas all deployed in silos with no code base to trace them to projects. The only traceable ones are those that are deployed by the data engineering team. My question is, how should we be dealing with the clean up for this environment before we commence with the set up of data warehouse? Do we still give access to the different parties or we should revoke their access to govern and control our warehouse? This has been giving me a big headache when I see all sorts of resources, from production to pet projects to trial and error things in our cloud environment.",

I’m familiar with the general concepts of data validation and cleaning, but up until now, I’ve only applied them on relatively small and simple datasets.This time, I’m dealing with multiple databases and a large number of tables, which makes things much more complex. I’m wondering: is it possible to automate these data quality checks and the cleanup process before promoting the data to the silver layer?Right now, the only approach I can think of is to brute-force it, table by table—which obviously doesn't seem like the most scalable or efficient solution.Have any of you faced a similar situation?

What's more, I've only had experience with medium-complexity projects. I don't think I ever really worked with big data. That's why I decided to ask you about it, because my view may have some negative bias.Where I've worked, I've used a lot of ready-made solutions on well-known platforms, such as Databricks, GCP and Azure (including Fabric). With each passing day, I feel that I've picked up many ready-made things. The connectors are ready, the platforms are ready and some already offer options to optimize automatically. Not that it's a bad thing, because this abstraction makes work easier and allows us to focus on what's most important: modeling, security, scalability, data quality, etc.However, even that makes me a little worried about my future in the profession. The platforms are going to offer more and more pre-assembled configurations. What will be left to challenge me in the profession? Sometimes I see myself as a doer of the same things and less of a creator... I've sent out a few CVs recently and haven't had many replies, so it could be that I'm actually taking a rather pessimistic view.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I come from a self taught background, and have been in my F200 “Data engineer” role for about a year. I started in GIS for a couple years in the public sector, teaching myself Python, SQL, and OOP. Automated some stuff in ArcPy, tinkered using trial and error. At the time, didn’t really know what unit testing was or best practices, just scripting things I can run manually to automate work or calculations.Then through a combination of skills I built and connections I got a BI job for a year or two, again in the public sector, building more skills in power bi, sql, and python to load data into sql. Learned more about reusability, but didn’t really fundamentally understand software development. We were a shop where my manager or other people on the team didn’t really want to learn beyond what was necessary, and I was just figuring things out through trial and error again as the only guy who was motivated. No unit testing or anything there either. I didn’t even really know about best practices or unit testing until my current job.Fast forward, through other connections I got a referral to a F200 company where tech is not the product. Got the job as “data engineer”. Ever since joining I feel like a total failure. We have one person on the team younger than me who has been there a couple years, is whip smart, initiates convos with the business, and is already promoted to senior. Everyone else is 10+ year seniors. My problems are the following:- Upon my hire, the tech lead was a total asshole, denigrating my abilities via passive aggressive behavior, destroying my confidence. He has since left. I went to my manager about it and at one point let some tears out saying I feel like I was doing a bad job, and I feel like they no longer respect me. We no longer have 1:1s or talk about anything really while he still talks regularly to the rest of the team- My technical intuition is nowhere near as strong as my peers, and I often need hand holding in solution design- I make dumb mistakes and am not as attentive to detail as I feel I should be, occasionally rushing my work due to feeling like if I don’t I’ll be found out as a fraud - An example of this is manually editing a bunch of JSON, where with no way to test it across a couple hundred lines I had a few typos- I am the only “BI” guy in my org, everyone else is stronger in software engineering. Everyone. Our team is based on developing a new data platform and reporting solution, but everything from the app to the data pipelines feels out of my depth, seeing as my background is in developing much lower level solutions. Our org is all CRUD devs. I’ve never even written a unit test, and most of my work has been SQL pipelines or reporting- I don’t give a shit about the domain (by this - I mean the business, not DE). I thought the money would make me care, and I still kind of try, but I don’t have the fire to go and seek out knowledge beyond what I need to for my current tasksNobody has told me I’m doing poorly directly but I’ve had conversations about my lack of attention to detail with one of my peers, just being warned to take my time and have it done right.I guess it’s just the constant comparing myself to not only my teammates but everyone around me. I feel like the village idiot. My first jobs had a mentality of “let’s figure it out together”, despite a lack of desire to really go beyond to learn more than necessary. Now, the pressure to deliver is higher, and I feel woefully behind. I also struggle to be motivated. I guess I’m just looking for advice from anyone who has felt out of their depth in early-ish career.",

        "content": "TL;DR We’re in the parking industry, running Talend Open Studio + PostgreSQL + shell scripts (all self-hosted). It’s a mess! Talend is EOL, buggy, and impossible to collaborate on. We're rebuilding with open-source tools, without buying into the modern data stack hype.Figuring out:* The right mix of tools for ELT and transformation* Whether to centralize all customer data (ClickHouse) or keep siloed Postgres per tenant* Whether to stay batch-first or prepare for streaming. Would love to hear what’s worked (or not) for others.\\---Hey all!We’re currently modernizing our internal data platform and trying to do it without going on a shopping spree across the modern data stack hype.# Current setup:* PostgreSQL (\\~80–100GB per customer, growing \\~5% yearly), Kimball Modelling with facts & dims, only one schema, no raw data or staging area* Talend Open Studio OS (free, but EOL)* Shell scripts for orchestration* Tableau Server* ETL approach* Sources: PostgreSQL, MSSQL, APIs, flat filesWe're in the parking industry and handle data like parking transactions, payments, durations, etc. We don’t need real-time yet, but streaming might become relevant (think of live occupancies, etc) so we want to stay flexible.# Why we’re moving on:Talend Open Studio (free version) is a nightmare. It crashes constantly, has no proper git integration (kinda impossible to work as a team) and it's not supported anymore.Additionally, we have no real deployment cycle, we do it all via shell scripts from deployments to running our etls (yep... you read that right) and waste hours and days on such topics.We have no real automations - hotfixes, updates, corrections are all manual and risky.We’ve finally convinced management to let us change the tech stack and started hearing words \"modern this, cloud that\", etc... But we’re not replacing the current stack with 10 overpriced tools just because someone slapped “modern” on the label.We’re trying to build something that:* Actually works for our use case* Is maintainable, collaborative, and reproducible* Keeps our engineers and company market-relevant* And doesn’t set our wallets on fire# Our modernization idea:* Python + PySpark for pipelines* ELT instead of ETL* Keep postgres but add staging and raw schemas additionally to the analytics/business one* Airflow for orchestration* Maybe dbt for modeling / we’re skeptical* Great Expectations for data validation* Vault for secrets* Docker + Kubernetes + Helm for containerization and deployment* Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring/logging* Git for everything - versioning, CI/CD, reviews, etc.All self-hosted and open-source (for now).# The big question: architectureStill not sure whether to go:* Centralized: ClickHouse with flat, denormalized tables for all customers (multi-tenant)* Siloed: One Postgres instance per customer (better isolation, but more infra overhead)Our sister company went full cloud using Debezium, Confluent Cloud, Kafka Streams, ClickHouse, etc. It looks blazing fast but also like a cost-heavy setup. We’re hesitant to go that route unless it becomes absolutely necessary.I believe having one hosted instance for all customers might not be a bad idea in general and would make more sense than having to deploy a \"product\" to 10 different servers for 10 different customers.# Questions for the community:* Anyone migrated off Talend Open Studio? How did it go, and what did you switch to?* If you’re self-hosted on Postgres, is dbt worth it?* Is self-hosting Airflow + Spark painful, or fine with the right setup?* Anyone gone centralized DWH and regretted it? Or vice versa?* Doing batch now but planning for streaming - anything we should plan ahead for?* Based on our context, what would your rough stack look like?We’re just trying to build something solid and clean and not shoot ourselves in the foot by following some trendy nonsense.Appreciate any advice, stories, or “wish I had known earlier” insights.

The issue is, there’s no open row-oriented data format that lets you use any query engine - Postgres, MySQL, etc. - on the same data directly.The challenge of designing such a format is obvious, and it would take tremendous effort to get mainstream databases to adopt it. The bigger question is: is there even strong demand for such a format? What do you think?Or maybe the question is, should Apache Iceberg support certain extension that allows people to access row storage?",

        "content": "Hi everyone,I work at a large organization that follows the medallion architecture (bronze, silver, gold) for our data lake. We ingest data into the bronze layer from a wide variety of sources: APIs, Excel files, third-party applications, etc. Because of this diversity, we struggle with establishing consistent naming conventions.For example, many datasets don’t have a straightforward business concept like `CustomerSales` or `OrderDetails`. Some are operational logs, others are reference datasets or ad hoc data pulls. This makes it hard to define a universal naming strategy.In the gold layer, we use standard prefixes like `dim_` and `fact_` where applicable, but we often have tables that don’t neatly fall into dimension or fact categories. These are still critical to downstream consumption but are harder to categorize and name.I'm looking for:* Examples of naming conventions you’ve successfully applied in medallion architectures.* Resources or documentation that helped your organization design naming standards.* Tips for balancing flexibility and consistency when working with heterogeneous data sources.Any advice or pointers would be appreciated!Thanks in advance.",

You pay for all tables replicated, even if many are not used now.2) Less flexibility: archiving/access to raw data is tied to Redshift; older/unused data still incurs cost.3) Possible need to manage Redshift partitioning, retention policies, and performance tuning as more data accumulates.I am confused what to use. Directly landing into redshift makes things so much more easier and using it as a data lake and then periodically unloading to s3. If I choose s3, can I store the data in s3 tables instead of csv or parquet and what would be the advantage of it?",

I decided to roll my own instead of using an existing one like Pandera / dataframely because I found that all the features I needed were scattered across several different existing validation libraries. At minimum, I wanted something lightweight (no Pydantic / minimal dependencies), DataFrame-agnostic, and that has a very flexible API for custom checks. I think I've achieved that, with a couple of other nice features on top (like generating a schema from existing data, filtering out failed rows, etc.), so I wanted to both share and get feedback on it!

        "author": "ssinchenko",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "**TLDR:**I’ve been thinking a lot about making graphs first-class citizens in the Open Lakehouse ecosystem. Tables, geospatial data, and vectors are already considered first-class citizens, but property graphs are not. In my opinion, this is a significant gap, especially given the growing popularity of AI and Graph RAG. To achieve this, we need at least two components: tooling for graph processing and a storage standard like open tables (e.g., Apache Iceberg).Regarding storage, there is a young project called Apache GraphAr (incubating) that aims to become the storage standard for property graphs. The processing ecosystem is already interesting:* GraphFrames (batch, scalable, and distributed). Think of it as Apache Spark for graphs.* Kuzu is fast, in-memory, and in-process. Think of it as DuckDB for graphs.* Apache HugeGraph is a standalone server for queries and can be thought of as a Clickhouse or Doris for graphs.HugeGraph already supports reading and writing GraphAr to some extent. Support will be available soon in GraphFrames (I hope so, and I'm working on it as well). Kuzu developers have also expressed interest and informed me that, technically, it should not be very difficult (and the GraphAr ticket is already open).This is just my personal vision—maybe even a dream. It feels like all the pieces are finally here, and I’d love to see them come together.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi, first of all I apologize if this isn’t the right sub to post this, for my English (as it's not my first language), and for any mistakes since this is my first time posting.I'm writing here to ask for advice regarding a decision I need to make between two offers I've received. I'm unsure which one to take, as I’m trying to evaluate how each could benefit me in the future.To give some context, I have a BSc in Computer Science and worked for a year as a Software Engineer. During that time, I became interested in data, so I decided to leave my job and enroll in a Master’s in Data Science, from which I recently graduated. During the program, I was particularly interested in subjects related to Big Data and Cloud, more so than ML and DL. Then I started to see Data Engineering as a great career path, since I think it combines my previous software engineering skills with data, and I’m also quite interested in architecture.Now, about the two offers:On one hand, I received an offer from a tech consultancy focused on data. It’s aimed at recent graduates and includes a short training period in technologies like Scala and Spark, after which you start working on a client project. I like that this offer is very focused on people wanting to pursue a Data Engineering career, which really appeals to me. It also offers full remote work, which I appreciate (although I’d also like the option to go to the office and meet people). From what I’ve seen, over time you can progress toward a Data Architect role, which I also find interesting.However, most of the people who have been part of this program in previous years seem to come from non-tech backgrounds or bootcamps, and managed to get in with minimal justification. In fact, when I got the offer call, they told me I was one of the most qualified candidates they’d seen in terms of education and IT experience, which made me a bit skeptical. Another downside is that this offer pays less than the second one, and I might end up being subcontracted to the same client that the second offer comes from.The second offer comes from a well-known bank in my country. After going through several processes, I was offered the position of \"Data Scientist Analyst\", and they told me I could choose the department that interested me most. I chose the Engineering department because it seemed the most appealing, and they mentioned that they work closely with other Data Engineers and Architects. Even though they mentioned some technologies I’m familiar with (Python, SQL, PySpark, Git, BigQuery, CI/CD), it still feels like the role is more data science–oriented than engineering.The positives are that the bank pays more and has better benefits overall, and it could add some prestige to my cv even if the experience isn’t exactly what I’m looking for. On the downside, I'm required to go to the office 3 days a week, and it’s quite far from where I live by public transport. If I want to drive there, I’d have to wake up very early to avoid traffic and not lose my whole day. Also, from what I’ve read and seen from others working there, the role seems very focused on ML, which doesn’t excite me that much, I actually got Little bit bored of it during the Master’s. But then again, maybe working on ML in a real job is very different from studying it in university, so it might turn out to be more interesting than I expect.That’s why I’m unsure whether I should take the first offer or take a chance on the second one, see if I like it, and if not, try to pivot to a more suitable project/ department or job in the bank, and leave with some experience if it doesn’t work out. I feel like if I reject the bank now, I probably won’t get another chance to work there in the future.So I’m looking for opinions and different perspectives from others, because honestly, I feel a bit lost and don’t really know which path to take since nowadays Data Engineering seems more appealing.Again, sorry because probably I forgot to mention so many details, either way I’ll be happy to answer questions you might have.",

        "content": "Hi everyone,Bit of a newbie question for all you veterans.We're transitioning to Microsoft Fabric and Azure DevOps. Some of our Data Analysts have asked about version control for their SQL queries. It seems like a very mature and useful practice, and I’d love to help them get set up properly. However, I’m not entirely sure what the current best practices are.So far, I’ve found that I can query our Fabric Warehouse using the MSSQL extension in VSCode. It’s a bit of a hassle since I have to manually copy the query into a `.sql` file and push it to DevOps using Git. But at least everything happens in one program: querying, watching results, editing, and versioning.That said, our analysts typically work directly in Fabric and don’t use VSCode. Ideally, they’d be able to query and version their SQL directly within Fabric, without switching environments. From what I’ve seen, Fabric doesn’t seem to support source control for SQL queries natively (outside of notebooks). Or am I missing something?Curious to hear how others are handling this, with and without Fabric.Thanks in advance!Edit: forgot to mention I used Git as well, haha",

        "author": "Adrien0623",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey!I recently joined a new company as their first data engineer. The team had already set up a basic data warehouse, but I see opportunities to improve its scalability and efficiency.In my previous roles, I primarily worked with GCP using BigQuery, Dataproc, and Airflow-managed Spark jobs. I found that stack to be clean, scalable, and cost-effective as a batch oriented pipeline. Now that I’m working in an AWS environment, I’m adapting to a different toolset and architecture.Here’s a high-level overview of the current setup:- Ingestion: Airbyte pulls data from backend databases every few minutes.- Storage & Transformation: A provisioned Redshift cluster serves as the warehouse, with DBT jobs triggered by GitHub Actions.- Consumption: A back-office app queries both Redshift (when joins accross backend services data are required) and the backend databases (for real-time needs).While this works for now, it lacks scalability and clarity. Key challenges I’ve identified:- No data partitioning, due to Airbyte’s current limitations. It's still striking that they don't support it on such important connectors as Redshift or S3...- No clear separation between data lake and data mart, making the warehouse feel disorganized.- Redshift is over-provisioned and underutilized, resulting in high costs for relatively low value.- When backend databases schemas changes (which is frequent), there's often a lot of manual procedure to handle breaking changes.To address this, I’m considering the following changes:- Replace Redshift with Athena + Glue to cut costs and enable a more flexible, serverless architecture—accepting a bit more latency in return.- Eventually replace Airbyte with Spark or Glue-based ingestion, to introduce time partitioning and better control (though some source tables lack timestamp fields, which limits options for now).- Move away from GitHub Actions and adopt a more robust scheduler like Airflow.- Possibly replace DBT with Spark for greater flexibility in the long term.- Add a BI tool connected on the data warehouse to enable self service analysis internally.Given the company expects significant data growth, I’d like to design something more scalable, but still pragmatic and cost effective. For now many people agree the current architecture is problematic, that processes are complex and error-prone and that we have little observability and room for improvements. However due to organization structures I have little impact or decision level on data models, migrations etc. And because many people don't have data expertise or experience it's often hard to make them understand some challenges and why some practices are problematic and not future-proof. So I'd be very grateful to get your view on the following questions to be sure I'm heading in the correct direction:1. Does this current architecture seem suboptimal to you as well?2. Do my proposed changes make sense, or would you suggest a different direction?3. Any other ideas for improving or simplifying the setup?Thanks a lot!",

        "content": "Hi,When trying to Google for the tools matching my usecase, there is so much bloat, blurred definitions and ads that I'm confused out of my mind with this one. I will attempt to describe my requirements to the best of my ability, with certain constraints that we have and which are mandatory. Okay, so, our usecase is consuming a dataset via AWS Lakeformation shared access. Read-only, with the dataset being governed by another team (and very poorly at that).Data in the tables is partitioned on two keys, each representing a source database and schema from which a given table was ingested. Primarily, the changes that we want to track are: 1. count of nulls in columns of each table (an average would do, I think; reason for it is they once have pushed a change where nulls occupied majority of the columns and records, which went unnoticed for some time :smiling_face_with_tear:)2. changes in table volume (only increase is expected, but you never know)3. schema changes (either Data type changes, or, primarily, new column additions)4. Place for extended fancy reports to feed to BAs to do some digging, but if not available it's not a showstopper. To do the profiling/reporting we have the option of using Glue (with PySpark), Lambda functions, Athena. This what I tried so far:1. Gx. Overbloated, overcomplicated, doesn't do simple or extended summary reports, without predefined checks/\"expectations\";2. Ydata-profiling. Doesn't support missing values check with PySpark, even if provided PySpark dataframe it casts it to pandas (bruh). 3. Just write custom PySpark code to collect the required checks. While doable, yes, setting up another visualisation layer on top, is surely going to be a pain in the ass. Plus, all this feels like redeveloping the wheel. Am I wrong to assume that a tool exists that has the capabilities described? Or is the market really overloaded with stuff that says that it does everything, while in fact does do squat?",

Specifically we’re using the column SystemModStamp (only option on Stitch), so everyday we’re just extracting SystemModStamp >= last value. However, an issue arises with calculated field on Salesforce. For example, table A’s X field is just looking up the X field on table B. When we update X field on table B, table B will get a new SystemModStamp but table A won’t. So when we sync the data, table B will have correct data on Snowflake but table A won’t. I have identified 2 potential solutions 1. Full table replication: will have correct data but costly 2. Rebuild Salesforce logic: can use dbt to rebuild the logic but will take too much time Has anyone faced similar issues? What are your solutions? Thank you so much!",

I want to get far away from this process. There is no code review and power bi reports have ton of logic that no one but the analyst knows about. I want to have sql query code review and strict policies on how to design reports. Code review being one of them. We also have analysts write Python scripts that connect to db, write code with logic and then load back into sql database. Again no version control there. It’s really the Wild West. What are yalls recommendations on getting things under control. I’m thinking dbt for SQL or git for Python. I’m also thinking if the data lives in db then all code must be in SQL.",

        "author": "Boltonet12",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Our company is relatively new to using dimensional models but we have a need for viewing account balances at certain points in time. Our company has billions of customer accounts so to take daily snapshots of these balances would be millions per day (excluding 0 dollar balances because our business model closes accounts once reaching 0). What I've imagined was creating a periodic snapshot fact table where the balance for each account would utilize the snapshot from the end of the day but only include rows for end of week, end of month, and yesterday (to save memory and processing for days we are not interested in); then utilize a flag in the date dimension table to filter to monthly dates, weekly dates, or current data. I know standard periodic snapshot tables have predefined intervals; to me this sounds like a daily snapshot table that utilizes the dimension table to filter to the dates you're interested in. My leadership seems to feel that this should be broken out into three different fact tables (current, weekly, monthly). I feel that this is excessive because it's the same calculation (all time balance at end of day) and could have overlap (i.e. yesterday could be end of week and end of month). Since this is balances at a point in time at end of day and there is no aggregations to achieve \"weekly\" or \"monthly\" data, what is standard practice here? Should we take leadership's advice or does it make more sense the way I envisioned it? Either way can someone give me some educational texts to support your opinions for this scenario?",

What validation rules do you need that current tools don't handle well?3. For those using dbt - would you want something like this integrated with dbt tests?4. Is single-node processing a dealbreaker, or do most of your datasets fit on one machine anyway?Happy to answer any technical questions about the implementation.

        "content": "I'm designing an EL pipeline to load data from S3 into Redshift, and I'd love some feedback on the architecture and config approach.All tables in the pipeline follow the same sequence of steps, and I want to make the pipeline fully config-driven. The configuration will define the table structure and the merge keys for upserts.The general flow looks like this:1. Use Airflow’s data_interval_start macro to identify and read all S3 files for the relevant partition and generate a manifest file.2. Use the manifest to load data into a Redshift staging table via the COPY command.3. Perform an upsert from the staging table into the target table.I plan to run the data load on ECS, with Airflow triggering the ECS task on schedule.My main question: I want to decouple config changes (YAML updates) from changes in the EL pipeline code.Would it make sense to store the YAML configs in S3 and pass a reference (like the S3 path or config name) to the ECS task via environment variables or task parameters?Also I want to create a separate ECS task for each table, is dynamic task mapping the best way to do this? Is there a way i get the number of tables from the config file and then pass it as a parameter to dynamic task mapping? Is this a viable and scalable approach? Or is there a better practice for passing and managing config in a setup like this?",

        "content": "We're trying to get away from our legacy DE tool, BO Data Services. A couple years ago we migrated our on prem data warehouse and related jobs to ADLS/Synapse/Databricks. Our app to app integrations that didn't source from the data warehouse were out of scope for the migration and those jobs remained in BODS. Working tables and history are written to an on prem SQL server, and the final output is often csv files that are sftp'ed to the target system/vendor. For on-prem targets, sometimes the job writes the data directly in.We'll eventually drop BODS altogether, but for now we want to build any new integrations using our new suite of tools. We have our first new integration we want to build outside of BODS, but after I saw the initial architecture plan for it, I brought together a larger architect group to discuss and align on a standard for this type of use case. The design was going to use a medallion architecture in the same storage account and bronze/silver/gold containers as the data warehouse uses and write back to the same on prem SQL we've been using, so I wanted to have a larger discussion about how to design for this.We've had our initial discussion and plan on continuing early next week, and I feel like we've improved a ton on the design but still have some decisions to make, especially around storage design (storage accounts, containers, folders) and where we might put the data so that our reporting tool can read it (on-prem SQL server write back, Azure SQL database, Azure Synapse, Databricks SQL warehouse).Before we finalize our standard for app integrations, I wanted to see if anyone had any specific guidance or resources I could read up on to help us make good decisions.For more context, we don't have any specific iPaaS tools, and the integrations that we support are fine to be processed in batches (typically once a day but some several times a day), so real-time/event-based use cases are not something we need to solve for here. We'll be using Databricks Python notebooks for the logic, unity catalog managed tables for storage (ADLS), and likely piloting orchestration using Datbricks for this first integration too (orchestration has been using Azure up to now).Thanks in advance for any help!",

We'd literally spin up EMR clusters just to check if a column had nulls. The cost and complexity meant most teams just... didn't validate data until something broke in production.**What I built:** Term - a data validation library that runs anywhere (laptop, GitHub Actions, EC2) without any JVM or cluster setup. It uses Apache DataFusion under the hood for columnar processing, so you get Spark-like performance on a single machine.**Key features:*** All the Deequ validation patterns (completeness, uniqueness, statistical, patterns)* 100MB/s single-core throughput* Built-in OpenTelemetry for monitoring* 5-minute setup: just `cargo add term-guard`**Current limitations:*** Rust-only for now (Python/Node.js bindings coming)* Single-node processing (though this covers 95% of our use cases)* No streaming support yetGitHub: [https://github.com/withterm/term](https://github.com/withterm/term) Show HN discussion: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44735703](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44735703)**Questions for this community:**1. What data validation do you actually do today? Are you using Deequ/Great Expectations, custom scripts, or just hoping for the best?2. What validation rules do you need that current tools don't handle well?3. For those using dbt - would you want something like this integrated with dbt tests?4. Is single-node processing a dealbreaker, or do most of your datasets fit on one machine anyway?Happy to answer any technical questions about the implementation. Also very open to feedback on what would make this actually useful for your pipelines!",

The data I'm looking for is hotel price and availability. In the past, when building pipelines that fetch data from APIs, I've always done something along the lines of:1. Fetch data, store as raw json in some kind of identifiable way, eg. Hive partitioned folders or filenames comprised of dimensions.2. Do some transformation/aggregation, store in partitioned parquet files.3. Push to more available database for API to query.I'm finding it tricky with this kind of data though, as I can't really partition or store the json in an identifiable way given the number of dimensions, without making a lot of partitions. Even if I could, I'd also be making a parquet file per request, which would also add up quickly and slow things down. I could just put this data directly into an sql database and not backup the json, but I'd like to keep everything if possible.I want the app to function well, but I also want to teach myself best practices when working with this kind of data.Am I going about this all wrong? I'm more of a full stack dev than a data engineer, so I'm probably missing something fundamental. I've explored delta tables, but that still leaves me with a lot of small .parquet files and the delta table would effectively be the raw json anyway at that point.

However, he is still pretty young and doesn't have a computer yet. I am looking for gift ideas that will encourage and tap into that \"coding desire\" but aren't necessarily \"learning to code\" yet. These can be games, books or anything of the sort, maybe even android apps but it would be nicer if it was something physical. So far the only thing i've really thought of is redstone books / guides so he can do some minecraft logic. However, I would prefer something more physical. These don't need to be directly coding related but anything that will stimulate that tinkerer, programmer, problem solving mind. Bonus if it is coding related but I'd settle for something that scratches the programming itch. I know of scratch, but as he doesn't have a computer, I think ill save that one for a little later when he does.edit: Whoa, this blew up fast. Thanks everyone for your answers, there are some great suggestions.. including just getting him a computer (which I agree - but I have to convince his mum on that one first!). I am going to go through everything suggested and see if there's some we can do together and some for him to do on his own. Haven't decided on anything yet but there are some wonderful suggestions, might be coming back to this list for his birthday next year too!",

I have NO IDEA how those \"no-code\" people are even making ANYTHING half useful, maybe it's because they haven't learned how to code so to them all the AI obstacles are normal, but to someone who actually understands what should be happening, it hurts my soul.So, I'm big on the backend, that's what I like doing. I'm fine with making a website, I'm fine with HTML, I'm fine with JavaScript, but you're not catching me writing any CSS and so I let AI do it. \"Style it this way with the color scheme we specified and maintain the same style for the borders that we've been using, and put each element in it's own little border side-by side\". I paste in the CSS and the button is black instead of pink and each element is listed vertically instead of horizontally like I asked it to. And so what do I do? I tell it to please fix it. \"They're not side-by-side, they're being listed vertically, please fix it or tell me what changes to make, here is the broken code\". I paste the supposedly \"corrected code\" and.... nothing is corrected, IT'S STILL THE SAME. I spent at least 8 minutes doing that when I'm sure that if I had learned CSS like a normal front-end developer, I would've been able to solve that problem in 2 minutes max. And you know what the worst part is? The AI will tell you with 100% confidence, \"Oof, you're so close! Here is the corrected version\", and it's not the correct version.Another example, a few days ago I tried to give vibe coding another chance, just for the experience. I installed Cursor and I told the AI exactly what app I wanted to make. I wanted a mobile app that let's users track their water intake, calories, and create workout plans with a calendar in the app, the UI will be built with Kotlin, the backend with Java and the database will be SQLite. Very popular technologies used for mobile development, so it should be easy right? No, the AI couldn't even get past installing Java dependencies. It installed Gradle, but it installed version 4 which doesn't work with Java 21 and so instead of recommending that we upgrade Gradle, it instead recommends that we DOWNGRADE JAVA, to Java 17 WHICH ALSO DOESN'T WORK WITH GRADLE VERSION 4. I ended up giving up like 20 minutes into trying to start the damn project, I swear it was this back and forth of \"seems like this isn't working, should I proceed with ...?\" I press proceed because it seems like a reasonable thing to do and it didn't work, over and over and over again and because I know nothing about Kotlin and Java I didn't even know how to debug the thing, which makes the experience even more frustrating. How does someone who knows NOTHING do this and not go crazy?",

How can people argue like this when there are literally thousands of conflicting opinions online about what should be **basic** OOP stuff?In math, you have a **clear** definition. In geometry, you have **clear** definitions of theorems, axioms, and so on. But in programming? Everything feels so vague, like I’m in a philosophy or theology lecture, not studying a field where precision should be the highest priority.Seriously — **where’s the original source of truth** for this? Something I can point to and say: “Yes, THIS is the correct definition, because that’s what X says.”",

Sure, I could just not use AI, but who is really going to choose to be less productive, especially at work where everyone else is using it?It doesn’t feel the same anymore. The craftsmanship of coding feels like it is dying. I used to spend hours reading documentation, slowly building something through rigorous testing and tweaking, enjoying every part of the process. Now I just prompt and paste. There is zero fulfillment. When people talk about AI replacing programmers, most worry about losing their jobs. That doesn’t worry me, because someone will still have to prompt and fix AI-generated code. For me it’s about losing the joy of building something yourself.Does anyone else feel this way?

I recently dropped my major to a minor despite having only 2 classes left due to the sheer amount of stress it put on me and also not fitting in the box that the department wants me to fit in. At least I'll have a major and a double minor instead of a double major--my other minor incidentally enough is also one of my favorite hobbies. For the record, I am self-taught, and of course there are gaps in my knowledge, but should anyone really care what tools I use or what I do and don't know so long as my own goals are reached? I'm more than willing to learn specific langs, frameworks, or concepts if it means I understand how to tackle a problem better, even if not in a lecture hall trying not to gouge my eyes out from sheer boredom. To be fair, I also freelance, but even still, I absolutely despite making things for the primary purpose of making a profit. Am I rambling or writing a word salad? Probably, I'm a little sleepy right now.TL;DR I like to play with my toys in my sandbox after building them, and I will never understand the culture that if you're wanting to do CS, you better want a job, because apparently people who just do it as a passion or hobby are seen as less valuable or don't have a place in the field (at least that's how I perceive it).

So I stuck with it.But while trying to learn JS, I kept seeing videos and posts saying stuff like “do CS50 first before anything else.” So I started that, and I’m about 3 weeks in now. And honestly... it’s kinda overwhelming. There’s just so much info, and everyone seems to have a different opinion on what you should do or learn first. It’s hard to know what actually matters.My goal is pretty simple: I just want a remote job in some decent western country. Even if it pays minimum wage (like $15k/year in the US or something), that would still be a big deal for me. I live in a third world country, and things aren’t great financially. I really want to help my family out as soon as I can.But yeah, I just don’t know what I should be doing right now to actually get closer to that. People keep telling me I’m young and not to stress but I am stressed. I think about the future too much.

I am now thinking about going to university and even already got accepted. I wasn't able to get a loan, so if I decide to go, I will most likely have to spend all my savings on tuition for the next 4-5 years. I love studying and am genuinely interested in getting a formal education. However, the cost of the degree (30-40k CAD) and the prospect of working full-time while studying full-time and spending all my money on surviving really freaks me out. I am also planning to move to another city in a year and would have to transfer universities. The reason why I wasn't able to get student loans is because my partner (who is also a developer) makes waay more money and it puts our household above the threshold for getting loans. But we split our bills 50/50 and he is not planning to pay for my education or all of our bills obviously.So I am wondering, is it even worth the sacrifices to get a bachelors degree in CS? I def want a better paying job and want to be a better develop. I do work on side projects occasionally, but they are mostly small front-end projects. I would say I struggle studying by myself sometimes because there are so many resources and paths and I get lost. I also have imposter syndrome and don't feel very confident as a develop, I hoped that getting a degree would help with that.TL;DR: I already work as a develop but don't feel confident and want to get better and get a better paying job.

I love to learn, and learning programming, signal processing, NumPy, neuroscience, etc. has been a joy while working on my project. I have lots of ideas in mind for future projects as well. I want to get ahead early so I can contribute to groundbreaking research in the future. The more I learn the more I realize I don’t know, and that makes me want to learn more. I also want to stand out to employers, and hopefully my projects will help with that. I guess I’m concerned whether I’ll regret spending this much time on learning this later in life, considering it will likely be my career, even though right now I enjoy doing it as it gives me fulfillment. I would appreciate advice if anyone has felt similar. Thank you!",

Eventually, I turned it into a short book.A few ideas it covers:* How to evolve a system without turning it into spaghetti* Safer ways to deserialize and construct your data* Turning input validation into something the compiler helps with* Where generics shine — and where they secretly hurt you* Treating time/space complexity as part of the interface contract* Making failure obvious and early instead of quiet and delayedIt’s all freely available — just a public repo on GitHub.If that sounds interesting, I’d be genuinely happy to hear what you think.",

        "author": "mosahel",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello,Just to clarify, I started with programming and all this tech stuff at the very beginning of 2024. I always knew about computers, but never actually owned one until then—so I began with touch typing on January 4, learned HTML, CSS, and basically figured out how to use a computer properly for those first 3–4 months. I had some help from a senior in the summer (May–June) with HTML, CSS, and JS, and it felt pretty intuitive and fun.Then I decided to seriously learn the MERN stack and bought Colt Steele’s Web Dev course in July, which covered HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JS, and VSC (Git, GitHub). But because of academic pressure, I barely coded at all during the final months of 2024—I got wrapped up more in Linux, version control, vim, and stuff like that and actually got pretty good at it. During a gap in November–December, I really enjoyed working with Linux, Lua, and was a Dotfile Engineer for a bit (which was honestly way more my vibe). Then, I learned some Python at a bootcamp in college/university, circled back to JavaScript in March, and then got into React in April/May.I’ll admit, I was really just rushing through React so I could get to backend stuff—I kept getting frustrated with frontend, and after talking with a couple of techie friends (with 7–8 years of experience each), they told me I’d probably be happier and do better if I went into backend, considering how much I liked working with Linux and all. I realized frontend really isn’t my thing: I can tweak things decently, but I can’t design or build from scratch like true frontend devs.So now, I’m currently in my 6th semester of engineering with exactly one year and 28 days left to graduate. I’ve just started learning Java and I’m actually liking it, especially compared to some parts of frontend. In my country, Java also seems to have way better career prospects, and the React/frontend job market is extremely saturated—tons of applicants for every position.Right now, the challenge is I’m just not sure how to organize my next steps. There’s a lot of anxiety because I’m still new, I’ve got 5 backlogs (3 in Maths), and it’s hard to stay motivated or focused when I don’t even know what to prioritize—should I hammer down Java fundamentals, focus on DSA, Leetcode, frameworks like Spring Boot, or work on projects? I really want to make the most of this last year so I don’t end up with no job at the end, but I could use some advice—even just on what to learn, what order to tackle things, or how to structure my study time.If anyone’s been in a similar situation, or has tips for making the most of this final stretch—whether it’s about Java, backend projects, passing those backlogs, or handling the stress of not knowing what’s next—I’d really appreciate any guidance.Thank you!",

That being said, I did try my hardest, and it is my first project. Oversimplified, my System uses fire science equations, a grid representing terrain, and some custom graph traversal algorithms to predict how a fire spreads across different terrain under different conditions, allowing the user to select a starting position and fire-start position to start the simulation. I posted it on LinkedIn but like, nobody really cared enough to actually look at it and give me feedback lol.I'm hoping I'd find people here willing to critique it. I am not planning on building it out again, my next step is a multi-agent disaster response simulation, but I feel like any advice on how I could have made this project better would help me in the long runThank you!",

        "content": "Hey guys!Before I begin, I would like to sincerely thank all of you for taking your time to read and respond to my post - your help truly means a lot to me!Let me start by telling a bit about myself; I'm currently a junior Data Engineer, working in a firm based in the EU - the first job I've ever had since graduating with my bachelor's last summer. I've been with said company for almost 11 months now.Over this past year, I've tasked with single-handedly developing an internal web application. This app includes a range of features - from web scrapers and data preprocessing scripts, to systems for managing and rating external collaborators, and even some AI agents that automate repetitive tasks.The stack I'd chosen to work with is Next.js, FastAPI and PostgreSQL.I won't lie - the journey developing this app has been a tough one. Being fresh out of university with limited knowledge and experience, and the only developer in the whole company meant a lot of trial and error and ambiguity in the beginning. But that challenge has also proven to help me grow as a person. I've learned many things of which I had no idea about before.That said, due to heavy nature of said responsibility and time constrains, I've also relied quite heavily on AI whenever I would hit a roadblock. While it's been helpful, I feel like it made me skip the deeper learning that comes from reading the docs and explore various sites, such as StackOverflow and others. Now, that the app had reached a solid state, I would like to go back and rectify my past mistakes.So now, I'm reaching out to the more experienced devs here:What books, courses, or other resources would you wholeheartedly recommend to someone who wants to deepen their skills, fill in knowledge gaps, and become truly solid - maybe even a \"cracked developer\"? Something that would make me stand out from the rest of my peers as a SWE.Through this job, I’ve discovered a strong passion for Python, backend development (FastAPI) and Generative AI (LangGraph and LLMs' APIs) - so I’d love to also hear your suggestions on these topics on how I can become more proficient, perhaps even share with me some valuable tips.As I've mentioned earlier, being a solo dev - a beginner, nonetheless - often felt like I was missing out on a real growth experience. I didn’t have someone more experienced to learn from, to guide me when I was stuck, or just to point me in the right direction when things got overwhelming. I’m also pretty sure that while building the internal web app, there were better tools or approaches I could’ve used — I just didn’t know about them at the time. That's why I want to change that. I want to become a better dev and, due to the competitive nature of the current market, not get lost with the tide.",

From what I can tell, the most complex thing we’ll be doing is using `UNION` to fetch data from a different table outside the intended query.I'm not super passionate about cyber crimes or hacking. I just need a way to practice a bit more so I can pass. The unit is entirely assessment based, and for the assessment, I’ll have to do it on my own with whatever challenge they give me. So I’m not really looking for documentation, just something I can practice with interactively.Thanks in advance to anyone who can help!",

Or will learning to do it through react native good enough to make the app work on both?",

My main languages are C++, Python and Java.I am having trouble finding coding projects that are challenging but doable. If I think up a program/app idea and try to program it, I end up in way over my head. But, exercises like building out functions, classes, or simple programs does not really scratch the itch to be coding and building something. Doing out planned exercises might teach me something about the language in the end, I do not feel like they're particularly challenging or rewarding.I think my question boils down to: should I be feeling underwater while working on larger projects like a program or app that I came up with? Is that part of riding the learning curve or is it unproductive and I need to do more exercises/simple programs?",

I found this idea interesting and something that can genuinely teach me about both data and software.I have zero knowledge of data mining, machine learning, or NLP right now. I also don’t fully know how a software project is built from tools to coding to design. I have to submit the abstract and literature review next week but haven’t started yet. I’m very motivated to learn all this, and I’m okay starting from scratch I just need some structure.Where should I start as a complete beginner? (Languages, tools, learning order). How do I plan a project like this? (Milestones, steps, tasks). What skills should I focus on to make this useful for my career/resume? Any resource suggestions (YouTube, blogs, GitHub repos, free courses)? THANKS IN ADVANCE.",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I've been programming for around 2-3 years and I'm currently doing Linux Kernel programming at my internship.The way i started CS (and fell in love with it) was by self-studying Berkeley's CS61a in my senior year of high school. I liked it so much that I switched my major and college just to study CS.My 13 year old brother has recently been interested in programming, mostly because he's intrigued with how a computer works (same reason that made me start CS). He asked for some advice to start, and my plan was this:First, a university (not bootcamp) intro course. I was thinking CS61a but it will probably be too difficult, so maybe CS50x or MIT's intro class (I read SICP so I could help him). Second, at the same time, a quick guide on Lua or some language that will allow him to mod games, or maybe PyGame. I'm skipping Scratch as he wants to actually write code. Another option would be starting with Scheme (the language), as after learning basic Python I read up The Little Schemer and SICP which were crucial to my development as a Computer Scientist.How does all that sound? I like the idea of the uni course over other methods as it's structured, more difficult, they focus on the fundamentals, and I could probably help him if certain parts are too difficult. For those with kids who wanted to learn CS, what did you guys do? Would an intro uni course be too difficult? Also, how did you guys learn CS? I only know of my journey so I'm curious to hear about others.Thanks",

Probably too settled down in C-like languages.However, I still want to learn something new. Just for the sake of learning tbh. Since I'll (probably) stick with some personal CLI tools for automation and simple tasks I don't need languages with sophisticated GUI or ML support. Code should be running with little to no effort on both, Windows and Linux (MacOS is nice to have, but not a must)My first idea was to check out Go, since it's syntax and overall featureset seems appealing to me. Same goes for Rust although the borrow-checker is... \"something different\"Question now: Do you have any input on why to go (or not go) whith the one or other language? Might something be more suited for my purposes? Any pros and cons that I might be missing?",

However, I’m unsure what the job landscape looks like for this path:•What kinds of jobs typically involve low-level programming (outside of the usual embedded/firmware developer roles)?•Are there realistic remote opportunities in this field? Or is most of the work tied to physical labs/offices due to hardware access?•Any tips on what kinds of projects or skills I should build to get my foot in the door?I’d really appreciate any advice, stories, or resources from people already working in this space.

Dependency injection. This is as straightforward as it gets. If a manager needs access to a resource, just pass it into the constructor.2. Service location. This is a pattern whereby managers, after initialization, are registered into a centralized registry as pointers to themselves. If another manager needs access to a resource, just request a pointer to the manager that owns it through the service locator.Here's my question: In especially large-scale projects that involve A LOT of communication between its managers, are multithreaded, and especially do unit testing, what is the better approach: dependency injection or service location? Also, you can suggest another approach if necessary.Any help or guidance is absolutely appreciated!",

For some reason though I had this idea in my brain that seemed reasonable enough but I later found out was wrong in some aspects. This idea of mine was that different programing languages are used for different uses because they are better for those specific things. There were problems in my head though with that because I had never seen anyone use python for things like UI and yet a quite common library exists just for that. (Tkinter) I dismissed this as probably someone's collage project that was purely theoretical. Something like how people put doom on calculators. It is not really a feasible option but is just used to say 'we did it'. Later I met an engineer who works with testing equipment for ultrasound devices. The UI he programed was with python. I was so surprised about it because now I think I might have been living under a rock. I later learned about other things like pygame and such but I am still confused. *If programming languages can step out of the 'natural boundaries' of what they were made to be cappapble of doing, then why don't we just use simple languages like python for every use?*",

The development has been going good but we have run into an issue, as follows. Requesting any and all help you guys can provide:**Backend:** Python FastAPI **Frontend:** Flutter **User Authentication:** Firebase **IDE:** Android Studio**Problem Statement:** Our app will be used with a combination of Unique Mobile Number and Unique Email ID, which will create a Unique User ID (through Firebase). We want to make the app as such, that it **CANNOT** be accessed on more than one device wrt to the following conditions:1. App cannot be used at once on more than one device2. If user logs in from an unknown device (not the one it was registered on), then the app's main functionality will be disabled and only view mode will existTo solve this, we did create a logic for generating Device ID, which will help us associate the User + Primary Device combination, but in turn ran into another problem: *The device ID does not stay consistent and changes with Uninstall/Reinstall/Software Updates/etc.****I cannot attach any images here, please text me for the exact scenarios, but here's an example:*** USER A DEVICE ID ON DEVICE A - 96142fa5-6973-4bf5-8fe8-669ec50f7dc5 USER B DEVICE ID ON DEVICE B - 02f81a46-13a6-4b19-a0d6-77a2f8dc95ebUSER A DEVICE ID ON DEVICE B - 02f81a46-13a6-4b19-a0d6-77a2f8dc95eb (ID MISMATCH = DISABLE PARSER) USER B DEVICE ID ON DEVICE A - 96142fa5-6973-4bf5-8fe8-669ec50f7dc5 (ID MISMATCH = DISABLE PARSER)USER B DEVICE ID AFTER REINSTALL - fe77779a-3e1d-4ac4-b4d0-b380b1af98a7 (ID MISMATCH - ASK USER FOR VERIFICATION)It would be of immense help if someone who has worked a similar issue could guide us on how to take this forward!If there's any cooperation needed in seeing the code or having a quick call to discuss further, I'm more than willing to.Thanks reddit!",

I was doing some web-dev for my job also my own business once, But in prebuilt service such as early Shopify and most recently with webflow But i wouldn't call it a real programming exp. it just like UX/UI designing but anyway i quite good at thoseNow, I would say I currently full-time learning programming and aim for programming jobs, I start of with game-dev in Godot for few month then went back to learn basic programming with CS50x (almost finish just Final project ahead) I really like this course learning without much struggleMy current skill say that I can do myself without follow tutorial:Build small platformer game with not much complex systemBuild like a convertor web app with flask/pythonThose are what I aim for CS50 Final projectMy Real question/problem are here:I here at edge of deciding where to go next, My option in mind are1.Get a Master CS degree but it's online Higher education what available in Thai is one associate with Woolf(online uni and it very new), Look into course structure is focus on Web-Dev train you to be like Fullstack Dev at max (This route might be most affordable but i can't say it safest way)2.Go to known Uni in Thailand Look into structure I think will touch more on theory than actual skill set for job ready, But If i go this route it will be harder on budget-side and empty out my pocket at the end, And I might have to do extra job while learning full-time (This one maybe the most uncomfortable)3.Dis the degree and continue game dev journey by myself might be going to be one of the indies building game and skill overtime (This route maybe the most risky way i think but it will be most fun maybe)4.Any other advice is most welcomeWhat i like and don't:\\- I love to aim for programming related job moving forward I admit that starting quite late but i really love it man..\\- Web-dev job, I love the part that working on system like dealing with flask/python webapp but if just Front-end like working on HTML/CSS/JS not into it that much\\- Game-dev also quite stuck in my inner heart, If i can make a good game and have a life with it would be dreamt, Or maybe job but it harder to get in ThaiSorry for too long question here, So what you guy will do if you're in my position...",

It took me roughly 4 weeks to become comfortable with debugging via dev tools, breakpoints, talend, and like executing stored procs etc. This was a massive hurdle, but I can just about 80%-90% of the time find where the code breaks down. This was basically 0% without having to ask for help before. I just have no idea how to solve them without the help of AI or asking for help (which I hate bothering people because it feels like I’m admitting I suck/reveals how novice I really am). I started speed running C#, SQL and Angular courses which makes each day a little easier, but I feel like without being able to write code to fix the problems myself I’m doomed. I don’t want to ruin my chance at this opportunity by not giving it my all. I’m a little older 30+ too and just don’t have the schooling/resume to feel like I’d be considered outside of this current opportunity. I know it’ll take time, but I feel like I’m lost at approaching learning. I’m afraid to use AI because it put me in the position, courses feel too slow/repetitive, and projects feel incomplete-able. I don’t know how to address/fix the problems in general and would like to know maybe if there are terms, topics, or other things I just don’t know are important but could be an 80/20 type thing for me. Things I can really practice or study that will have the most impact. I’m not sure what I’m expecting as answers.

At a conceptual level it makes a lot of sense, but when I'm writing code in practice, I find it easy to get lost in the possibilities. I eat relatively healthy, exercise regularly, and my workspace allows me to give my work my full attention. Is there any material (books, courses etc.) that someone would recommend to train my brain to really understand these complicated concepts?I enjoy coding but have struggled to understand really abstract concepts, open to any ideas on comprehending these. I don't anticipate this being easy and I'm ready to really commit.",

Forced to grind Leetcode for interviews, and when I ask the senior if he had to do this he said “ nah I never had to grind Leetcode to start in 2010.Then one day I put together a soft skill resume with my content/sales/communications skills and got 5 interviews in the first week.I took one company for 4 rounds for a sales guy job 100% commission selling boats and jet ski’s.They were genuinely excited about my tech and content and communication skills.They offered me a job and have a proper mentorship pipeline.I was hanging out with family this last week and my little 3 year old nephew was having a blast. And I just got to thinking…This little guy doesn’t give 2 shits how hard I am grinding to break into tech.Life moves in mysterious ways. I stopped giving a shit and then a bunch of opportunities came my way which may be better suited for me in this economy.Life is so much better when you give up on this BS industry.To think I wanted to grind my way into tech just to have some non-technical PM dipshit come up with some stupid app idea management wants to build.Fuck around and find out.

        "content": "*tl;dr: Title,* [Diagram Here](https://imgur.com/a/5THOIEU)*. 5 YoE, no FAANGs. I have a B.S. in CS + Bio from Berkeley. Primarily Healthcare SWE experience. Job market is not that bad for Senior SWEs. TC >$100k + Fully Remote. I'm a US Citizen.*I always see the doom and gloom from this sub regarding layoffs and the struggles of people finding a job and wanted to add a counter-story. I got laid off from my job on July 14th. It was an absolute gut punch and all of my worst fears came true. I saw all the posts from people with years of experience struggle with finding a job and thought I was absolutely screwed going into the market. Thankfully, either I have a really good skill set or people are being overly pessimistic (though it is most likely a combination of both.)I do think that there is still merit to the doom and gloom though. When looking for a job, there were barely any new grad, entry level, or junior level job postings. Most of the jobs that I saw started at senior and made their way up but it seems that the market for mid and senior level roles is still relatively healthy. Almost every position that I interviewed for was hybrid, with a good chunk being 5 days a week in person. A very small minority were fully remote.As for how I went about that job search, the day I got laid off I got an invite to a \"Mandatory Meeting\" with my boss + some random person that I didn't know at exactly 9AM. I knew then it was over and immediately started polishing my resume and applying to every company that I could think of. I went directly to the career page and found jobs that I thought that I was qualified for. I may have applied to every company that I can think of, but I only applied to roles that matched my skillset. Every single job that I applied to was either directly on the company page or LinkedIn jobs sorted by last 24 hours.I did NOT use any AI - this includes auto-apply software or even tuning my resume. Everything was done by hand, manually by me. The only \"automation\" that I did was sign up for a [greenhouse.io](http://greenhouse.io) account so that my name, email, and other info was autofilled by them.The first 48 hours was the hardest because it was just sending applications into the void without knowing if it would yield anything. Then starting Wednesday that same week, I started getting interview requests and stopped applying to new jobs. I did not ask my network for any references as I was not desperate yet.For context, I am in the San Francisco Bay Area and work in the biotech industry (and if you're on r/biotech, biotech is equally screwed as tech, if not more.) The job I got is in the healthcare field but unrelated to the job I previously had. TC is a nice bump up from my previous position but I will not share it since people in real life know what my Reddit handle is (but I can say that it is more than $100,000 but less than $1,000,000.) I have 5 years of experience as a Software Engineer in various healthcare companies ranging from small startups to large companies with both a CS and biology degree from UC Berkeley.Of course, this is just one data point. YMMVTo those still hunting, good luck.",

Absolutely wrong mentality to have if you want to be good* **No passion**, people that go through bootcamps are just in it for a job.

If you know, you know. Especially with the massive resources online. Even before AI. A bootcamper can't do this, they need to actually be taught and spoon feed everything.

A lot of this is on me. I still struggle with how to take connections of what I do in work to the outside world to study & learn on weekends. I struggle with how to better myself. I have a lot of fear with AI & such, & my biggest goal with SWE is to get better… so I can job hop with confidence or know my future will be ok no matter the company I choose. If you are in a similar boat of being someone who knew nothing about coding when majoring in CS, to now working as a SWE, & later, being good at it, can you share your story, your path? Things you did to get better that worked in specific detail? I so deeply crave the satisfaction of getting better at my job. Doing better. Growing. Being valuable. I have contemplated joining the military at 26 so i can have a bit of job & life security, & im a SWE. Not a good feeling. Anything helps.",

I am happy that CS researchers get paid well and are being recognized, but I wonder if this will now just flood PhD programs with applicants hoping to make it ~~to the NBA~~ , I mean, to a FAANG AI lab.Will the money result in a shift in the ML research job market and programs? I feel like a potential problem could rise where too many CS departments might underfund and underfocus in other research areas outside ML, which I don't think would be good for computer science. And maybe too many people going into ML research just for the money.",

At least for now. But I can tell they are trying to ratchet up how much output they get from me for pay that simply isn't worth the extra demands they want from me. Also, the stories are being pointed and written by a non-technical person. I don't see myself lasting here for more than a year more.All I want is a normal job like I had at the second company I worked out. It was a good culture where workers were open to helping each other do well. No toxic boss or pushing for deadlines that were unrealistic. I do not want FAANG salaries nor do I want FAANG work hours. I just want a normal 8-5 job and log off. No on calls either. No toxic managment and realistic deadlines. I will take a pay cut if needed for this.Where can I find a job like this?

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Basically, my old experienced senior left my org, and a recent graduate, John, was promoted to the senior position. I was an intern when John was hired during Covid, so we had some general interactions but didn't work together on any projects. As a result, I wasn't familiar with his technical skills.After I finished school, I accepted a return offer to my current organization, and I now report to him. I'm getting more and more frustrated with the situation every day. It's baffling because John, who has been here for 2+ years, doesn't even know what a JavaScript template literal is. He also handles our Netlify deployments but only at a very surface level.My biggest frustration is our communication. I believe he is insecure and intentionally gives me vague instructions and then questions why I didn't complete what he calls \"simple tasks.\" His tone and the phrases he uses feel very belittling.For example, he was supposed to deploy a project I had full ownership of to Netlify, but the initial build failed. The first thing he said was, \"It looks like your code failed.\" I had to remind him to add the environment variables. After he tried again and it failed, I gave him a hint about checking the CORS settings. This is some one who is suppose to be a project lead, and handles deployments.Five minutes later, he had to leave, so he gave me a two-sentence, vague instruction before walking away. When he returned, he asked if I had completed the task. I said no, and he asked why I hadn't done it because it was \"so simple.\" I then had to watch him eat his words as he failed to complete the task himself.These minor frictions happens often, and I am tired.I want to leave my current org to go some where else, but it doesn't look good to jump ship only staying after a few month. There is also no other teams that I can transfer to. I would like to get some advice on how to work with John. Should I praise him more? What should I do? Edited: It baffles me how saying a dev with senior title should at least know what a template literal is, or how to add env variables to Netilfy/Vercel equates to me being a junior who is clearly a know it all.

In terms of job availability and security -- I have searched for jobs online and it seems like we're still in a crappy job market for tech jobs. I mostly see senior, architect, and consultant jobs.\\- Why are Salesforce salaries so high? I'm still in shock and awe at how much a Salesforce Dev can make -- it's comparable to traditional software engineering roles. I still have a hard time believing it, it's so wild.\\- Are certifications actually as valuable as they say? I do like that Salesforce has created an upward mobility ladder, in a sense, for their platform. Which is unheard of other than with your typical IT certs like Cisco and such.\\- Has anyone else switched from a traditional software development job and into Salesforce? And if so, how was your experience?\\- Overall, is being a Salesforce Dev still worth getting into? Or should I try to get back into web development?Thank you all!",

I have over 15 job board sites I use daily, so every one hour I'm able to find 8-10 relevant entry-level roles and apply. By the end of the day I have 50-70 jobs applied to. I also avoid easy apply and apply directly on sites.Edit 2: Here is my resume: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16adhrvKm0kb0D_pN9hHNyOuiS30Tti5w/view?usp=sharingSome comments regarding my resume:My resume is a simple Word document. I reduced my bullet points down from five to three to keep things concise and less cluttered, as I was advised. Some of the technologies and tools I listed aren’t part of my projects or internship, but I do know them, I might just be a little rusty since it’s been a while since I last used some.Edit 3: Figured since this is still getting traction that I will write down what are the new changes I've been told to make:1. Contribute to open-source projects2. Bold technologies in projects/internships3. Apply to less jobs, focus on adding cover letter & tailoring cv to roles (+ make a few different CVs depending on what sort of role im targeting such as front-end, back-end, etc)4. Get rid of mthree experience5. Reduce technical skills6. Remove GPA7. Stick to applying locally and not country-wide or cross country because they will filter you out.",

Software Engineer, Software Developer, Automation Engineer, Test Engineer, Embedded Software Engineer... if it involves code, and 60-80% of the keywords apply to my experience, I'm probably applying. I'm applying to both remote (preferred) and on-site roles, especially in major tech hubs. I live in NYC and mostly apply to NYC jobs because i likely get filtered out for a lot of other ones. Absolute nothing. Zero. No interviews. No screener calls from recruiters. I barely even get the automated \"thanks but no thanks\" emails anymore. It feels like my resume is going directly into a trash can.I'm 27 and feeling like my career is over before it really began. I'm open to any and all brutal feedback. Background:* Experience: 2.5 YOE at a hardware/software startup. I was unfortunately part of a layoff due to the company losing major government contracts.* What I Did: I wasn't just a cog in a wheel. I designed and built the company's core application framework from the ground up using Python and PyQt. This app controlled hardware in real-time, managed data, and visualized results. I have a very hands-on, end-to-end background.* Core Skills: * Python: Very strong. Built entire applications, GUIs, data analysis pipelines. * C/C++: Wrote the embedded firmware for all our custom-designed hardware. (which i custom designed PCBs and everything). * SQL (PostgreSQL): Designed and managed the database for all experiment data logging. * Hardware Integration: This is where I might be too \"niche.\" I designed the PCBs (KiCad), synchronized hardware triggers (TTL), and worked with DAQs and many other electrical components. I have experience making software and hardware talk to each other.",

I have followed his code styles / testing strategy to the letter but it is never good enough. He will often just take my PR reject it then post a PR that is 95% the same. Like he will take my PR and make it more \"pythonic\" or better except half the time I don't even understand the point of the changes. Except it shows he did the work. Multiple times during our bi weekly demo meetings he is hyper critical of even the most simple things. He doesnt just do it to me but some others. Last week I demoed something I was proud of I fixed a number of major issues we had and people were impressed except Bob who raked me over the coals about everything before loudly saying what I did was useless as he was going to rewrite all that stuff anyways. Multiple times my manager and my skip have indirectly told him off. Even during meetings he will loudly try to interrupt me and others non stop and basically reframe what I am saying to imply he solved it. He won't talk to me directly, unless he wante something.My first week he basically demanded I do a ton of manual work for him. I had no idea who he was back then so I just said I have been given these other tasks by my manager. But offered to help when I get some free time. He told me I was useless and never responded to any of my questions after that. My manager knows about this, and told me it isn't the first time it has come up. But he cannot do anything about it. A few weeks ago we had our first two day long off-site. Ngl he acted like a high school bully to me and a number of other people. It got so bad that our VP of product told him he was being an asshole. On Wednesday I have been informed I will be having my first 1on1 with our VP of engineering. - should I bring up Bob or will it sound too whiney?- any tips?",

I found a job at a law firm, which I've been regretting ever since I started. There were a lot of red flags when I started. I found out on the first day that I was a contract worker and not a w-2 employee, this was not mentioned in the interview. I also found out a couple days after I started that the job title changed after I interviewed for a business analyst role, I only found out when I looked at an org chart.The attorney has barely said a few words to me and anytime she does it feels like she's just talking at me. I haven't gotten any feedback on anything other than random email replies with the word \"good\". I've had 1-on-1's scheduled but they always never show up or get busy. I always get conflicting instructions, one day she emails me that I need to automate things, the next day I have to justify why programming takes so long. The following day I'm told I need to only do my job title, then the next week she said I stopped programming and need to figure out how to do both.Last week, I was asked to meet with the new HR person who has been firing 2-3 people a week since she started. When I get to her office she told me she wanted to talk about my performance. She said I'm taking too long to finish my programming tasks. She said at her old company they were able to build an architecture, build complete features in 1-2 hours and an entire system in less than a year for all the departments that was even HIPAA compliant. I asked how many developers they had and what was their background. She said there were only 2 people and they weren't even developers but was able to \"just get it to work\". I've been there less than 3 months and already deployed an application that decreased their intake process time by over 75% since they did everything manually in word documents. They think I can develop a replacement for a SAAS they don't want to pay for, but want me to \"figure it out\" when I say it's impossible. I know I need to quit, but how bad does it look on my resume since I've only been working a few months?",

I asked for a significant raise once about 5 years ago because I realized I was paid less than a colleague even though I was the lead. Other than that I usually get the usual 3% salary bump every year, nothing significant.Ideally I would prefer to stay at my job. I like the job, my coworkers and the company. But it's always a challenge to know I could be making that much more (and they also offer 2 more weeks of vacation per year) elsewhere. Both jobs are 100% remote, so no change there.So basically my question is, what is the norm out there? Is it \"too much\" to ask for a significant salary raise again if I asked for one (and got it) 5 years ago?",

No dedicated time for learning, or interval sprint for learning, yet there are hours of learning requirements that basically end up requiring overtime to get done.2. short \"technical onboarding program\" was not useful for what i'm doing on my team3. Don't like my team. mean tech lead, scrum master that blames people. asking questions gets uncomfortable. Tech lead gets very irritable very fast. I’d code and he’d giggle and be like “what are you doing.” Small team. This is the biggest problem. tech lead told me 6 months in “I don’t even know how to help you. Help me help you.” I do all my user stories, communicate blockers, never caused carry over or even a defect. Received multiple certifications. 4. Disorganized leadership. \"everyone in the department do the same amount of points\"(7+). Told me I didn't have to do that since that's for seniors and up, then received bad feedback for not doing that amount of points.5. Seemingly little interest in growing me as a professional or if I even like it here. Getting 60 bucks for a bus ticket to a tech event required a whole written document. Not a lot of social opportunities and I have no time too anyways. Asked to be in specialized training programs for cloud skills and got ghosted as usual. Main focus is how I can use gen ai to do more of their work.6.Still have no goals in workday. Don't know if I'm doing well or not and am afraid to ask at this point. But bright side is I'm learning a LOT, do work with aws, and do code every day. Is this all just normal and should I kinda suck it up and stick with it or would I most likely just be better off somewhere else?I can’t switch teams or managers.EDIT:,oh yeah this is important but I never wanted to do software dev my entire life. I’m getting an mba. Technical leadership is my goal at the moment. I just want a tech basis first, that’s why I have certs in ai and the cloud.

I am quite happy with my choice, but most of the managers discussed this choice with are telling me that AI will come to replace many SWEs and I need to consider this, as if they're saying 'you messed up with this one'.I mean, they're people that do not really come from engineering and spent their life in salesy roles but these words combined with the gloomy outlook I'm seeing here online have me concerned that I should have just swallowed my dislike for business talks and stick to my already privileged position, even if it's not aligned to my liking and the career path I imagine myself pursuing.What do you think?

I think my years as a developer can ease me in to back end better than if I were to have started fresh in my early twenties.This job search and has been extra difficult for me bc I can’t pass interviews. I never make it past the technical leetcode rounds bc I don’t do well with DSA under watchful eyes. But when I’m on the job and in my zone, I am one of the top performers.I am good with talking about high level concepts and understanding, can even talk about systems design.Can I pass interviews by just doing that?I enjoy being a developer but hate whats become of it. I don’t know how to show my strengths bc the process right now is broken.How can I make it?",

        "content": "For context, I am in a junior role that is hourly paid and below average pay. I’m not a software engineer but it’s adjacent. In my job description it says I am part of a rotational training program where I will learn and gain experience on three adjacent teams in the same role, that’s why I accepted. I was put on a team with no manager and where all of the team members are remote offshore contractors. My work entailed receiving written tasks that lacked any context and with that got no training or onboarding. I was told not to talk to the requestors directly. This whole time I’ve been there I’ve basically had no manager. There is no path toward growth. With time my team warmed up to me and would help here and there but the start was extra rough. Two months ago I applied to a full time higher paid role in an adjacent department. The next day after the interview, the hiring manager said my department won’t let me go. No one in my department talked to me. The manager that was there for two months but did no managing, had already left. My tech lead gave a green light. So I assumed the hiring manager was letting me down softly or that there are some company policies, like I haven’t been there long enough. The policies in this company change whichever way suits them btw. Very recently two people in my role left an adjacent team. This team was supposed to be one of my rotations. I have been here long enough to rotate. This team is in person and the manager is a good manager and the people are knowledgeable, so I reached out to join their team. The hiring manager said yes. My tech lead gave a green light. My new manager, who also hasn’t done any managing so far, gave a green light. The HR gave a green light. During my first one on one with my manager I was told “Skip said you will either stay on your current team or will join ‘team that doesn’t exist yet and does work that is not my role’.” I was baffled. When I said “but I want to do my role and rotations are in my job description” my manager gaslighted and told me that the team I applied to doesn’t do my role. Ladies and gents, the titles are exactly the same as mine. I went to HR. HR was also baffled. Obviously I am already applying externally. But I am so upset that my chance to grow in my career was arbitrarily blocked and that now they are blatantly going against policies and my job description. It is very not palatable, I feel that I am an object, and honestly this smells of misogyny.",

I'm at the point where I keep thinking that there's honestly zero point in even trying to get a job in the field because of how unlikely it is. Like I see no reason that given 1000+ applicants to a role, with at least a handful of those being guys that have programmed an entire OS from scratch and went to a top ten school and likely already have experience, the odds of those guys not applying or there being such a small applicant pool that the guy who had a mediocre GPA along with no internships who has farted out a middling personal project to fill out an otherwise empty resume actually gets a role seems almost astronomically low.I doompost here a lot but in my head there genuinely seems to be no real path to employment in the industry (I'm not even talking SWE either, like literally any job that requires a bachelors in CS at all) if you're not exceptional or quite literally apply to every single open position in the country and just move wherever at a whim and hope you essentially win the lottery",

I was unemployed for a little over two years due to having to take care of my family + my own mental health issues. Since then, I've had a full-time job in the biopharmaceutical industry. I don't do anything with tech or CS really at my current job, besides a little bit database management (Not that I'm writing the SQL or anything). I've been working here for almost two years now. I mostly work on the equipment in our lab and do a good amount of troubleshooting/small engineering stuff on the robotics in the lab. I'm kind of burning out of this place and don't like my current job too much. I want to break into the tech industry. It doesn't have to be a SWE position or anything, just something tech-related or CS adjacent.I was wondering what steps I can take in my situation to start learning again and be ready to apply to CS Jobs? I honestly forgot like 95% of what I learned about programming and my other CS courses from just not doing it consistently since I graduated, but I would be willing to take online courses or put in a lot of time to learning again. Unfortunately, I don't have any internship experience related to CS as I switched to CS later in my college career and just rushed to finish the degree in a shorter time so I wouldn't have to take out more in student loans.Where do you think a good starting point is to get back into it? What kind of projects can I make that would help me stand out? And is there a larger demand for full-stack engineers or data analysts in the healthcare/biopharma industry? Trying to decide between focusing on statistics/data analysis using Python, PowerBI, Tableau, etc versus learning full-stack development with Java as backend and Javascript for front-end?

Everyone is focused on AI and data, working with Python, ETLs, BigQuery, and DBT.And in addition to that, they put me in a role of QA even though I don't have any type of experience with Python or QA.I'm pretty unhappy with this decision because it doesn't align with my career goals and experience. I really want to continue working with Java. I brought up my discomfort to my manager during my first week on the project.He told me the priority was getting people onto projects and asked me to give it some time, telling me to keep him updated (he was not clear about these updates).I'm still on this squad and still unhappy. Everything feels very rigid and data-centric. Meanwhile, friends who joined the company at the same time as me are all in squads doing pure Java, React and overall web development.Am I being immature or unreasonable for feeling dissatisfied? Every day seems like a brick to carry.Should I wait another two months and then talk to my manager again? How should I approach him this time?Any advice would be very helpful.",

I did a bit of research, and they seem legit, but here’s the part that threw me off:Before even scheduling any interviews, they insisted on getting a copy of my photo ID.I honestly can’t remember the last time a recruiter asked for that, even after an offer. Has anyone else had this experience? Is this a red flag or just standard procedure for some contracting firms?Would love to hear from others who’ve dealt with Flexton or similar staffing firms.Thanks!",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I started at a company on a dev team a few months ago. This is my first permanent job after completing my master’s degree.Initially, I was welcomed on and had a really great time getting to know people and contribute, and my performance review was “exceeds all expectations” from everyone on my team. My boss indicated that they were seeking to have me transition into a leadership role in the future given that I have a specific background.Fast-forward a couple of months later, and one of the senior devs on my team has become somewhat hostile to me. They started calling out any critiques of my work directly in our Teams channel (that contains some senior company leadership like VPs) and during meetings in a way that I kind of take offense to. EX) “u/ice-truck-drilla seems to have done this wrong.” instead of “u/ice-truck-drilla, this doesn’t look right to me. Can you double check this?”First, I think this should be a direct message, not a company wide blast. Second, when this has happened, so far, the work being critiqued has always been correct. Of course I make mistakes, but these were not. These company-wide callouts have only happened a few times over the past few weeks, and luckily, the technical lead had my back and stated that my work was correct in front of everyone. One time, one of the VPs who was previously a dev mentioned that the work output I presented looked very accurate.I’m not sure what changed but this hostile dev used to be really pleasant to work with. I try hard and work long hours, and it feels like they’re trying to birth a negative reputation for me. Some added context is that this dev recently found out that I am not white (I’m white-passing) and my parents are immigrants. I’m not sure if this is the root cause, but it is something I’ve considered. I do not want to make any waves, and I have been thinking that the job market is way too harsh rn for me to even think about defending myself or bringing this up with anyone. My goal here is to simply prevent this type of rhetoric from hurting my career and reputation.I’m seeking advice on how to handle this situation. Just let it go and roll with the punches, defend myself in the moment, discuss this with someone higher up, etc…",

All of this leaves me feeling like my job is constantly in a broken state: unstable, frustrating, and at times even meaningless.I'm considering relocating abroad, not just for better compensation, but for a healthier work environment. I'm particularly interested in the Nordics due to their reputation for work-life balance, flatter hierarchies, and greater respect for technical expertise.I’d be open to learning a new (human) language if needed, and I’m not currently looking to freelance, since I’d rather be part of a well-functioning team (preferably in the EU).Has anyone here moved from a country with a frustrating dev culture to one with a more supportive environment?

On the other hand, I have family members that work in IT that believe that programming jobs as we know it are basically over.I’m also planning to double major in CS and Applied Math. I’m hoping that the math degree could give me some flexibility and open up other career options in case the CS job market remains difficult, what are your guys thoughts on that?Am I overthinking this?

However, the cost of the degree (30-40k CAD) and the prospect of working full-time while studying full-time and spending all my money on surviving really freaks me out. I am also planning to move to another city in a year and would have to transfer universities. The reason why I wasn't able to get student loans is because my partner (who is also a developer) makes waay more money and it puts our household above the threshold for getting loans. But we split our bills 50/50 and he is not planning to pay for my education or all of our bills obviously.So I am wondering, is it even worth the sacrifices to get a bachelors degree in CS? I def want a better paying job and want to be a better develop. I do work on side projects occasionally, but they are mostly small front-end projects. I would say I struggle studying by myself sometimes because there are so many resources and paths and I get lost. I also have imposter syndrome and don't feel very confident as a develop, I hoped that getting a degree would help with that.TL;DR: I already work as a develop but don't feel confident and want to get better and get a better paying job.

        "content": "I’m a senior software engineer with 4.5 years of experience (recently promoted) and have contributed a lot in my team. I constantly doubt my own understanding and technical skills, which has led to a sense of imposter syndrome. Even with several years of experience, I find myself questioning whether I truly grasp certain topics or if I’m just missing something everyone else understands. I am truly worried if somebody will ask me something during the meetings because of this. I often feel that when I discuss technical topics, the person I’m talking to tends to speak vaguely or there’s some misunderstanding at first. I also wonder if part of the issue is that my thoughts don’t always come across exactly as I intend in English, or maybe I have difficulty understanding vague explanations. Is this something others experience? How do you handle or improve communication in technical discussions to avoid misunderstandings?I also notice that other senior engineers seem skilled, they can answer almost any question on the spot whereas I’m not that type of person. When I’m asked something technical, I usually need some quiet time to fully understand the question, then I look through the relevant files and documentation before I can come up with a good answer. Sometimes I worry this means I’m not as competent, maybe I shouldn’t even be senior engineer in the first place.",

I graduated in May 2025 with a Computer Science degree and 2 internships at smaller companies. I should've gone harder in college and gotten internships at bigger and better companies as I'm floundering currently with other applications. I got hired off return offer from my junior year Machine Learning internship as a Python developer at the same pharmacy. However - 4 weeks into my job and I have not written a single line of code and it's all IT stuff. It is genuinely crushing as I've been applying to other roles and not hearing back shit (while my younger brother is getting quant role interviews lmfao).I have no idea what to do. I would ideally like to pivot to a SWE role in Fintech/Defense, and I've been making projects/doing leetcode in my free time to help me apply but I genuinely feel like the no name companies I've worked for in my past have made me a unserious candidate. Haven't gotten a single interview since May. Has anybody ever been in a similar situation?PS I also never network. This is definitely ruining my odds as I think cold applying is dead for somebody with my shitty experience but it feels like begging",

Nobody knew we were getting acquired besides our CEO at the time. When they told us our new salaries I'm not sure what they were based on since the lead (who actually knows what I do) wasn't involved at all. I wasn't exactly happy with my new salary compared to my coworkers so I spoke with my manager (formerly the lead) and told him I'll take on more work/responsibility so I can get a promotion down the line. So I bust my ass for 1.5 years and finally he tells me he's submitting a request that I'm promoted with the higher ups. Fast forward *8 months*, nothing. Two performance reviews during this time and my manager doesn't really know what's going on, no updates from anyone. So I'm frustrated, burnt out, unmotivated, and feel taken advantage of.My question (skip here):In my search for a new job I have an opportunity at Stripe. Stripe pays twice what I'm paid at Trimble but the internet tells me the wlb and culture there sucks, like Amazon bad. Now I'm fine with occasionally working late but it can't be every day and I can put up with annoying coworkers if I can just focus on my work and don't deal with them much. In contrast I love my coworkers where I currently am, we're all buddies. The culture at our office is amazing, but the work itself isn't always great as I'm constantly helping other teams. So is the pay at Stripe really worth it? Do I just take the leap and see how it goes? I don't want to be miserable at my job but I also want to get paid what I know I'm worth.",

I'm wondering if this will impact my future career growth, as I have options to jump to another company with a more modern tech stack.- most parts are still with the old .NET 4.8 Framework but some parts in .NET core. They have concrete plans for upgrading to modern .NET, but it won't be so soon (around 3 years)- CI CD pipeline using old ass tech, with plenty of environment issues (this has caused me and the team a lot of headaches and time wasted). Not containerised, but plans to be. Modernizations in this area are in the plan as well- Not a huge app, around 10 microservices- Hosted on AWS but not cloud native, still traditional server architecture- Not much scalability concerns- However, the product is highly secure and must pass stringent pentests. So plenty of security concerns- I get to work with and do the modernization, anything from code to infra migrations. Manager is highly supportive of any effort in this area- I get to touch on all areas of the albeit old application, from frontend to backend to devops and security- only one team of devs+QA of around 15 peopleWhat I will miss out on:- Scalability concerns. The product is meant to be low key b2b, there are basic scalability concerns but not big tech level where scalability is top priority.- Cloud native infra: I'm seeing most companies have already left the server architecture behind and adopt cloud native.- It feels bad still using Remote Desktop Connection and windows sucks major ass- Modern devops- Modern tech- Large company things with the big tech feel. I can't put this exactly into words but when your company has an engineering blog there is just this vibe. I feel like I'm missing out.I'd like to know if my concerns are legit. Thanks!",

Thank you in advance!Edit: I should clarify that I am looking at online masters programs that I would be able to do part-time while keeping my full-time job like Georgia Tech's OMSCS or UPenn's MCIT",

Will just share that I am an ex-solo founder with <3 years of experience and non-technical background.* I am a US citizen living in a US tech hub.* I spent approximately 1 month in the job hunt.* Nearly 100% of my interviews were for early-stage AI startups.* Applications were 90% LinkedIn. No cover letters or personalized messages.* Step 1 was typically vetting call from recruiter or an intro from a founder.* Step 2 was typically a technical assessment or take home project.* Step 3 was typically a culture fit or technical discussion (eg. system design).* Step 4 was typically an onsite (culture fit, system design, problem solving).Some reflections:* There is a new wave of AI startup funding, which provides opportunities for people who are willing to learn quickly.* I'm a builder. My chances were significantly higher if there was a take home project involved.* Startups almost never ask LeetCode problems directly.* If startups really like you in one way, they can look past your weaknesses in other areas.* Startups hire quickly. If you vibe well and pass everything, an offer can made very quickly.My advice for anyone interested in working in the startup space for this new AI wave of funding, especially from non-traditional backgrounds:* Try to build your own company. This is literally the saying, \"Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.\" This immediately shows culture alignment. They are looking for people who have tolerated high risk situations.* Practice system design, especially the problem: \"If you're given 10,000 PDF documents, how do you build a chatbot to answer questions about these documents?\" Almost every startup right now is working on some variation of this problem.* Both technical and behavioral questions are assessing your ability to tolerate ambiguity. The biggest mistake for any interview in this space is not spending time to properly understand the problem, which often is purposely made vague. I failed many rounds because of this.",

        "content": "I completed an associate degree in computer programming with co-op, which gave me some government work experience. Around here, most government jobs will hire directly from school, with private companies being more selective — usually only hiring diploma grads if they’re already very strong technically. Unfortunately bridging in did not occur because of the hiring freeze in the gov right now.It's become clear that getting a solid industry job, is a lot harder these days without a CS degree. The bootcamp/self-taught path (even if it's associate degree) rarely works anymore unless you're exceptional.That said, I enjoy the field (I genuinely like math, I like coding (just not obsessed)) and want to build a long-term career out of it. I am considering going back for a full CS degree with co-op. My goal is to use the internships to build industry experience in the private sector and hopefully open doors to better opportunities such as eventually staff/principal SWE at private companies or even BigTechWhat does everyone think? Thank you all!",

I have been trying for months to find a job, but I just can't get any. I've lost the interest and motivation I once had, making it even harder to prepare for interviews.I'm from Mexico, so a master's without experience is less appreciated and makes it difficult to land a first job. After meditating and all of that, I realized I'm just not good at CS, and I have made many mistakes by not doing internships, doing a master's, and so on. I'm interested in doing a PhD because I like research a bit, but I even suck at that.So, now that I know that I suck, I won't succeed in industry or academia because I'm neither brilliant nor outstanding in anything. How can I feel less bad and move on and try to find anything I'm good at?Sorry if my English sucks, I don't think this is a rant, but instead want to know from people who realized too late that this field isn't for them.",

I've been to the final round of a FAANG adjacent company where they explicitly told me it was this that caused them to take a pass on me. There are also not a lot of seniors on my team to learn from. The tech culture is also very outdated - they are not agile, or a dev shop, which makes my career feel limited here. Additionally, my contract is about to end at the start of Nov, with my Director verbally saying they are doing the best they can to get me a 6-12 month contract extension, which is very hard given the government is in the midst of budget cuts. However, I feel very privileged about everything else. I am fully remote, unionized, full time with benefits, and making around $110k a year. I have amazing WLB with almost 1.5 months of paid leave in one form or another, not to mention a pension.I have received my first offer, from a very big, multi-billion dollar Canadian insurance company. What does excite me is they have a big and experienced dev team. They are agile, and use Snowflake and Azure. They have a 4.0 star rating on glassdoor. However, in opposition to the pros of the government jobs, they are half in office which is about a 50 minute car/1.5 hour bus commute from me, each way. They have given me an extremely lowball offer of $72.5k incorporated (meaning I have to pay my taxes, unpaid vacation, no insurance), which according to chatgpt, is equal to about $55-60k a year, almost half of what I am currently making. Job security is no better - it is only for 6 months, with only verbally saying they are very likely to make me into a full time after the 6 months.Chatgpt says that this is an absurd offer, and that it is very much a lowball offer, which I agree, and I would need to ask for $120k, MIN $95k as an independent contractor to even consider it. What would you guys think. At my age of 25, is learning skills/best practices worth such a downgrade in pay/WLB? I have no dependencies/mortgage/debt and I think it would be cool to live in the city as well.",
