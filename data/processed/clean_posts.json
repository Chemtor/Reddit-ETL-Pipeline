Scrum turned to: give me estimation for everything, Dev or PO can change task during sprint because BI development is pretty much unpredictable. And mostly how the F\\*\\*\\* I can give estimate in hours for something I have no clue! Every time developer needs to be in defend position AKA why we are always underestimate, lol. BI development takes lots of exploration and prototyping and specially with tool like Power BI. In the end we are not delivering according to plan but our team is always overcommitted. I don't know any person who is actually enjoying scrum including devs, manegers and POs. What's your attitude towards scrum? cheersedit: thanks to all of you guys, appreciate all feedbacks ... and there is a lot!as I said, I know we are not doing correct scrum but even after proper implementing scrum, if any agile method could/should work, maybe only Kanban",

        "content": "I found out that a new data engineer coming onto my team is making a few thousand more than me (a senior thats been with the company several years) annually, despite this new DE having less direct/applicable experience than me. Having to be a bit vague for obvious reasons. I have been a top individual contributor on my team every year. Every review I've received from management is overwhelmingly positive. This new DE and I are in the same geographic area, so thats not the explanation. How should I broach this with my management without: - revealing that I am 100% sure what this new DE is making, - threatening to leave if they don't up my pay, - getting myself on the short list for layoffsWe just finished our annual reviews. This pay disparity is even after I received a meager merit raise. Anyone else navigated this? Am I really going to have to company hop just to get paid a fair market salary? I want to stay at this company. I like what I do, but I also need more money to make ends meet.EDIT (copying a comment I left): I guess I should have said this in the original post, but I already tried this before our annual reviews. I provided evidence of my contribution, asked for a specific annual salary increase, and wanted it to be part of my annual increase which had a specific deadline. What I ended up getting was a bunch of excuses as to why it wasn't possible, empty promises of things they might be able to do for me later this year, and a meager merit raise well below inflation.So, to take your advice and many others here, sounds like I should just start looking elsewhere.",

I've been working primarily with Databricks and Spark, and I really enjoy the flexibility and power of working with distributed compute and Python pipelines.Now I’ve got a job offer from a company that’s heavily invested in the Snowflake + Dbt stack. It’s a solid offer, but I’m hesitant about moving into something that’s much more SQL-centric. I worry that going \"all in\" on SQL might limit my growth or pigeonhole me into a narrower role over time.I feel like this would push me away from core software engineering practices, given that SQL lacks features like OOP, unit testing, etc...Is Snowflake/Dbt still seen as a strong direction for data engineering, or would it be a step sideways/backwards compared to staying in the Spark ecosystem?Appreciate any insights!",

If I want to make changes to it without a Dev environment - I might manually change the \"target\" table to a test table I've set up (maybe a clone of the target table), make updates, test, change code back to the real target table when happy, PR, and merge into the main branch of GitHub. I'm assuming this is what teams do that don't have a Dev environment?If I did have a Dev environment, what might the high level process look like? Would it make sense to:- have a Dev branch in GitHub- some sort of overnight sync to clone all target tables we work with to a Dev schema in Snowflake, using a mapping file of some sort - paramaterise all scripts so that when they're merged to Prod (Main) they are looking at the actual target tables, but in Dev they're looking at the the Dev (cloned) tables? Of course this is a simple example assuming all target tables are in Snowlake, which might not always be the case",

From there, Analytics Engineers usually take over and apply transformations. I hold certifications in Airflow (Astronomer) and Databricks Data Engineer Fundamentals, and I’m currently thinking about diving into DBT, mainly through personal projects.Recently, I received the suggestion that being full-stack in data is the ideal, or even necessary, path to follow. That got me thinking:How far should we go in expanding our technical scope? Are we sacrificing depth for breadth? Is this expectation more common for Data Engineers than for AEs or Data Scientists? Is being full-stack really an advantage in the long run, or just a sign of immaturity or lack of process in some organizations?I’d love to hear your thoughts, especially from those who have faced this kind of situation or work in more structured data teams.",

I don't want to link each one and start a witch hunt, esp when there's JUST ENOUGH plausible deniability. But the quality of this subreddit feels kinda garbage with those kinds of posts in it. Real speedrunning dead internet theory vibes.Idk what's the solution. Do other people notice it too? Do the mods notice it? I'm not here to say I make lots of quality posts myself (I made \"How do I transition from analytics\" post #999000 2ish months ago - although I then went and did it) but I'd at least like to lurk in a place with quality posts.

        "content": "Code’s here: [github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia)We're building Onyxia: an open source, self-hosted environment manager for Kubernetes, used by public institutions, universities, and research organizations around the world to give data teams access to tools like Jupyter, RStudio, Spark, and VSCode without relying on external cloud providers.The project started inside the French public sector, where sovereignty constraints and sensitive data made AWS or Azure off-limits. But the need — a simple, internal way to spin up data environments, turned out to be much more universal. Onyxia is now used by teams in Norway, at the UN, and in the US, among others.At its core, Onyxia is a web app (packaged as a Helm chart) that lets users log in (via OIDC), choose from a service catalog, configure resources (CPU, GPU, Docker image, env vars, launch script…), and deploy to their own K8s namespace.Highlights:- Admin-defined service catalog using Helm charts + `values.schema.json` → Onyxia auto-generates dynamic UI forms.- Native S3 integration with web UI and token-based access. Files uploaded through the browser are instantly usable in services.- Vault-backed secrets injected into running containers as env vars.- One-click links for launching preconfigured setups (widely used for teaching or onboarding).- DuckDB-Wasm file viewer for exploring large parquet/csv/json files directly in-browser.- Full white label theming, colors, logos, layout, even injecting custom JS/CSS.There’s a public instance at [datalab.sspcloud.fr](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr) for French students, teachers, and researchers, running on real compute (including H100 GPUs).If your org is trying to build an internal alternative to Databricks or Workbench-style setups — without vendor lock-in, curious to hear your take.",

They don't know what value the company derives from it so they ask me every year about it. It does generate more value than it costs.I'm just wondering if this is even reasonable? We have over a hundred various systems that we need to incorporate as topics into the \"warehouse\" this IT team purchased from another vendor (it's highly immutable so really any ETL is just filling other databases in the same server). They did this stuff in like 2021-2022 and have yet to extend further, including building pipelines for the other sources. At this rate, we'll be paying millions of dollars to manage the full suite (plus whatever custom build charges hit upfront) of ETL, no even compute or storage. The $10k isn't for cloud, it's all on prem on our computer and storage.There's probably implementation details I'm leaving out. Just wondering if this is reasonable.",

If you're confused too, here's what I've learned: **Which one should you use?****Kubeflow Spark-Operator:** The battle-tested option (since 2017!) if you need production-ready features NOW. Great for scheduled ETL jobs, has built-in cron, Prometheus metrics, and production-grade stability.**Apache Spark K8s Operator:** Brand new (v0.2.0, May 2025) but it's the official ASF project. Written from scratch to support long-running Spark clusters and newer Spark 3.5/4.x features. Choose this if you need on-demand clusters or Spark Connect server features.Apparently, the Apache team started fresh because the older Kubeflow operator's Go codebase and webhook-heavy design wouldn't fit ASF governance. Core maintainers say they might converge APIs eventually.What's your take? Which one are you using in production?",

I’ve noticed that a couple of my colleagues have different understandings of what goes in the valid_from and valid_to columns. One says that they get snapshots of the day before and that the business wants the reports based on the day that the data was in the source system and therefore we should put current_date -1 in the valid_from.The other colleague says that it should be the current_date because that’s when we are inserting it in the dwh. Argument is that when a snapshot hasn’t been delivered you are missing that data and the next day it is delivered, you’re telling the business that’s the day it was active in the source system, while that might not be the case.Personally, second argument sounds way more logical and bullet proof since the burden won’t be on us, but I also get the first argument.Wondering how you’re doing this in your projects.",

        "title": "Modular Data Pipeline (Microservices + Delta Lake) for Live ETAs – Architecture Review of La Poste’s Case",
        "author": "Typical-Scene-5794",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "In a recent blog, the team at La Poste (France’s postal service) shared how they redesigned their real-time package tracking pipeline from a monolithic app into a modular microservice architecture. The goal was to provide more accurate ETA predictions for deliveries while making the system easier to scale and monitor in production. They describe splitting the pipeline into multiple decoupled stages (using Pathway – an open-source streaming ETL engine) connected via Delta Lake storage and Kafka. This revamped design not only improved performance and reliability, but also significantly cut costs (the blog cites a 50% reduction in total cost of ownership for the IoT data platform and a projected 16% drop in fleet capital expenditures, which is huge). Below I’ll outline the architecture, key decisions, and trade-offs from the blog in an engineering-focused way.From Monolith to Microservices: Originally, a single streaming pipeline handled everything: data cleansing, ETA calculation, and maybe some basic monitoring. That monolith worked for a prototype, but it became hard to extend – for instance, adding continuous evaluation of prediction accuracy or integrating new models would make the one pipeline much more complex and fragile. The team decided to decouple the concerns into separate pipelines (microservices) that communicate through shared data layers. This is analogous to breaking a big application into microservices – here each Pathway pipeline is a lightweight service focused on one part of the workflow.They ended up with four main pipeline components:1. Data Acquisition & Cleaning: Ingest raw telemetry from delivery vehicles and clean it. IoT devices on trucks emit location updates (latitude/longitude, speed, timestamp, etc.) to a Kafka topic. This first pipeline reads from Kafka, applies a schema, and filters out bad data (e.g. GPS (0,0) errors, duplicates, out-of-order events). The cleaned, normalized data is then written to a Delta Lake table as the “prepared data” store. Delta Lake was used here to persist the stream in a queryable table format (every incoming event gets appended as a new row). This makes the downstream processing simpler and the intermediate data reusable. (Notably, they chose Delta Lake over something like chaining another Kafka topic for the clean data – a design choice we’ll discuss more below.)2. ETA Prediction: This stage consumes two things – the cleaned vehicle data (from that Delta table) and incoming ETA requests. ETA request events come as another stream (Kafka topic) containing a delivery request ID, the target destination, the assigned vehicle ID, and a timestamp. The topic is partitioned by vehicle ID so all requests for the same vehicle are ordered (ensuring the sequence of stops is handled correctly). The Pathway pipeline joins each request with the latest state of the corresponding vehicle from the clean data, then computes an estimated arrival time. The blog kept the prediction logic straightforward (e.g., basically using current location to estimate travel time to the destination), since the focus was architecture. The important part is that this service is stateless with respect to historical data – it relies on the up-to-date clean data table as its source of truth for vehicle positions. Once an ETA is computed for a request, the result is written out to two places: a Kafka topic (so that whoever requested the ETA gets the answer in real-time) and another Delta Lake table storing all predictions (for later analysis).3. Ground Truth Extraction: This pipeline waits for deliveries to actually be completed, so they can record the real arrival times (“ground truth” data for model evaluation). It reads the same prepared data table (vehicle telemetry) and the requests stream/table to know what destinations were expected. The logic here tracks each vehicle’s journey and identifies when a vehicle has reached the delivery location for a request (and has no further pending deliveries for that request). When it detects a completed delivery, it logs the actual time of arrival for that specific order. Each of these actual arrival records is written to a ground-truth Delta Lake table. This component runs asynchronously from the prediction one – an order might be delivered 30 minutes after the prediction was made, but by isolating this in its own service, the system can handle that naturally without slowing down predictions. Essentially, the ground truth job is doing a continuous join between live positions and the list of active delivery requests, looking for matches to signal completion.4. Evaluation & Monitoring: The final stage joins the predictions with their corresponding ground truths to measure accuracy. It reads from the predictions Delta table and the ground truths table, linking records by request ID (each record pairs a predicted arrival time with the actual arrival time for a delivery). The pipeline then computes error metrics. For example, it can calculate the difference in minutes between predicted and actual delivery time for each order. These per-delivery error records are extremely useful for analytics – the blog mentions calculating overall Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and also segmenting error by how far in advance the prediction was made (predictions made closer to the delivery tend to be more accurate). Rather than hard-coding any specific aggregation in the pipeline, the approach was to output the raw prediction-vs-actual data into a PostgreSQL database (or even just a CSV file), and then use external tools or dashboards for deeper analysis and alerting. By doing so, they keep the streaming pipeline focused and let data analysts iterate on metrics in a familiar environment. (One cool extension: because everything is modular, they can add an alerting microservice that monitors this error data stream in real-time – e.g. trigger a Slack alert if error spikes – without impacting the other components.)Key Architectural Decisions:Decoupling via Delta Lake Tables: A standout decision was to connect these microservice pipelines using Delta Lake as the intermediate store. Instead of passing intermediate data via queues or Kafka topics, each stage writes its output to a durable table that the next stage reads. For example, the clean telemetry is a Delta table that both the Prediction and Ground Truth services read from. This has several benefits in a data engineering context:Data Reusability & Observability: Because intermediate results are in tables, it’s easy to query or snapshot them at any time. If predictions look off, engineers can examine the cleaned data table to trace back anomalies. In a pure streaming hand-off (e.g. Kafka topic chaining), debugging would be harder – you’d have to attach consumers or replay logs to inspect events. Here, Delta gives a persistent history you can query with Spark/Pandas, etc.Multiple Consumers: Many pipelines can read the same prepared dataset in parallel. The La Poste use case leveraged this to have two different processes (prediction and ground truth) independently consuming the prepared\\_data table. Kafka could also multicast to multiple consumers, but those consumers would each need to handle data cleaning or maintaining state. With the Delta approach, the heavy lifting (cleaning) is done once and all consumers get a consistent view of the results.Failure Recovery: If one pipeline crashes or needs to be redeployed, the downstream pipelines don’t lose data – the intermediate state is stored in Delta. They can simply pick up from the last processed record by reading the table. There’s less worry about Kafka retention or exactly-once delivery mechanics between services, since the data lake serves as a reliable buffer and single source of truth.Of course, there are trade-offs. Writing to a data lake introduces some latency (micro-batch writes of files) compared to an in-memory event stream. It also costs storage – effectively duplicating data that in a pure streaming design might be transient. The blog specifically calls out the issue of many small files: frequent Delta commits (especially for high-volume streams) create lots of tiny parquet files and transaction log entries, which can degrade read performance over time. The team mitigated this by partitioning the Delta tables (e.g. by date) and periodically compacting small files. Partitioning by a day or similar key means new data accumulates in a separate folder each day, which keeps the number of files per partition manageable and makes it easier to run vacuum/compaction on older partitions. With these maintenance steps (partition + compact + clean old metadata), they report that the Delta-based approach remains efficient even for continuous, long-running pipelines. It’s a case of trading some complexity in storage management for a lot of flexibility in pipeline design.Schema Management & Versioning: With data passing through tables, keeping schemas in sync became an important consideration. If the schema of the cleaned data table changes (say they add a new column from the IoT feed), then the downstream Pathway jobs reading that table must be updated to expect that schema. The blog notes this as an increased maintenance overhead compared to a monolith. They likely addressed it by versioning their data schemas and coordinating deployments – e.g. update the writing pipeline to add new columns in parallel with updating readers, or use schema evolution features of Delta Lake. On the plus side, using Delta Lake made some aspects of schema handling easier: Pathway automatically stores each table’s schema in the Delta log, so when a job reads the table it can fetch the schema and apply it without manual definitions. This reduces code duplication and errors. Still, any intentional schema changes require careful planning across multiple services. This is just the nature of microservices – you gain modularity at the cost of more coordination.Independent Scaling & Fault Isolation: A big reason for the microservice approach was scalability and reliability in production. Each pipeline can be scaled horizontally on its own. For example, if ETA requests volume spikes, they could scale out just the Prediction service (Pathway supports parallel processing within a job as well, but logically separating it is an extra layer of scalability). Meanwhile, the data cleaning service might be CPU-bound and need its own scaling considerations, separate from the evaluation service which might be lighter. In a monolithic pipeline, you’d have to scale the whole thing as one unit, even if only one part is the bottleneck. By splitting them, only the hot spots get more resources. Likewise, if the evaluation pipeline fails due to, say, a bug or out-of-memory error, it doesn’t bring down the ingestion or prediction pipelines – they keep running and data accumulates in the tables. The ops team can fix and redeploy the evaluation job and catch up on the stored data. This isolation is crucial for a production system where you want to minimize downtime and avoid one component’s failure cascading into an outage of the whole feature.Pipeline Extensibility: The modular design also opened up new capabilities with minimal effort. The case study highlights a few:They can easily plug in an anomaly detection/alerting service that reads the continuous error metrics (from the evaluation stage) and sends notifications if something goes wrong (e.g., if predictions suddenly become very inaccurate, indicating a possible model issue or data drift).They can do offline model retraining or improvement by leveraging the historical data collected. Since they’re storing all cleaned inputs and outcomes, they have a high-quality dataset to train next-generation models. The blog mentions using the accumulated Delta tables of inputs and ground truths to experiment with improved prediction algorithms offline.They can perform A/B testing of prediction strategies by running two prediction pipelines in parallel. For example, run the current model on half the vehicles and a new model on a subset of vehicles (perhaps by partitioning the Kafka requests by transport\\_unit\\_id hash). Because the infrastructure supports multiple pipelines reading the same input and writing results, this is straightforward – you just add another Pathway service, maybe writing its predictions to a different topic/table, and compare the evaluation metrics in the end. In a monolithic system, A/B testing could be really cumbersome or require building that logic into the single pipeline. Operational Insights: On the operations side, the team did have to invest in coordinated deployments and monitoring for multiple services. There are four Pathway processes to deploy (plus Kafka, plus maybe the Delta Lake storage on S3 or HDFS, and the Postgres DB for results). Automated deploy pipelines and containerization likely help here (the blog doesn’t go deep into it, but it’s implied that there’s added complexity). Monitoring needs to cover each component’s health as well as end-to-end latency. The payoff is that each component is simpler by itself and can be updated or rolled back independently. For instance, deploying a new model in the Prediction service doesn’t require touching the ingestion or evaluation code at all – reducing risk. The scaling benefits were already mentioned: Pathway allows configuring parallelism for each pipeline, and because of the microservice separation, they only scale the parts that need it. This kind of targeted scaling can be more cost-efficient.The La Poste case is a compelling example of applying software engineering best practices (modularity, fault isolation, clear data contracts) to a streaming data pipeline. It demonstrates how breaking a pipeline into microservices can yield significant improvements in maintainability and extensibility for data engineering workflows. Of course, as the authors caution, this isn’t a silver bullet – one should adopt such complexity only when the benefits (scaling, flexibility, etc.) outweigh the overhead. In their scenario of continuously improving an ETA prediction service, the trade-off made sense and paid off.I found this architecture interesting, especially the use of Delta Lake as a communication layer between streaming jobs – it’s a hybrid approach that combines real-time processing with durable data lake storage. It raises some great discussion points: e.g., would you have used message queues (Kafka topics) between each stage instead, and how would that compare? How do others handle schema evolution across pipeline stages in production? The post provides a concrete case study to think about these questions. If you want to dive deeper or see code snippets of how Pathway implements these connectors (Kafka read/write, Delta Lake integration, etc.), I recommend checking out the original blog and the Pathway GitHub.

Well, by adapting YAML into a data quality checks framework, we will get a simple, accurate, and effective **data collaboration model** which allows us to have:* A clean, declarative way to define data expectations.* Non-engineers to contribute checks and proposals.* Business logic flows more naturally in the data pipeline based on quantifiable data expectations.* Actual data accountability that is visible and traceable.That's what a properly structured and designed YAML-based framework can achieve. As a result, we will have more people involved in testing → issues being caught earlier, which leads to less friction, fewer surprises.

Of course we are just getting started, so one might suggest choosing a barebone DB and some basic tools to launch the app, but anticipating traffic, we want to distill the best knowledge available out there and choose the best stack to build our product from the beginning.For our chat application, where all typical user behaviors are there - messages, spaces, \"last seen\" or \"active\" statuses, message notifications, read receipts, etc. we need to choose a database to store all our chats. We also want to enable chat searches, and since search will inevitably lead to random chats, we want that perf to be consistently excellent.We are planning to use Django (with channels) as our backend. What database is recommended to use with Django to persist the messages? I read that Discord used to use Cassandra, but then it started acting up due to garbage collection, so they switched rto Scylla, and they are very happy with trillions of messages on it. Is ScyllDB a good candidate for our purpose to use with Django? Do these two work together well? Can MongoDB do it (my preferred choice, but I read that it starts acting up with high number of reads or writes at the same time - which would be a basic use case for enterprise chat scenario)?",

The difficulty arises because the JSON files are deeply nested (up to four levels deep) as shown in the example below. I would like to hear suggestions on how to handle this. I have tested Lambda Transformations but I am getting errors since my json is 12x longer than that. I wonder if Kinesis Firehose can handle that without any coding.

More often than not, companies don't need to deploy an Airflow server for Orchestration or a Kafka one for Streaming because they don't need to do Streaming, or even the Orchestration could be done by using Glue or ADF (for example). I see many post regarding poorly architectured solutions that rely on pyspark when the processing could've been done using pandas, and so on.So, how do maintain relevant in a Business that apparently needs those tools, when in reality, a large part of companies doesn't need them at all, or even the tech stack is not in favor of using those tools?Thanks.",

        "content": "Hello everyone! I am an early career SWE (2.5 YoE) trying to land an early or mid-level data engineering role in a tech hub. I have a Python project that pulls dog listings from one of my local animal shelters daily, cleans the data, and then writes to an Azure PostgreSQL database. I also wrote some APIs for the db to pull schema data, active/recently retired listings, etc. I'm at an impasse with what to do next. I am considering three paths:1. Build a frontend and containerize. Frontend would consist of a Django/Flask interface that shows active dog listings and/or links to a Tableau dashboard that displays data on old listings of dogs who have since left the shelter.2. Refactor my code with PySpark. Right now I'm storing data in basic Pandas dataframes so that I can clean them and push them to a single Azure PostgreSQL node. It's a fairly small animal shelter, so I'm only handling up to 80-100 records a day, but refactoring would at least prove Spark skills.3. Scale up and include more shelters (would probably follow #2). Right now, I'm only pulling from a single shelter that only has up to ~100 dogs at a time. I could try to scale up and include listings from all animal shelters within a certain distance from me. Only potential downside is increase in cloud budget if I have to set up multiple servers for cloud computing/db storage.Which of these paths should I prioritize for? Open to suggestions, critiques of existing infrastructure, etc.",

Yes I get small nuggets of info that I didn't know here and there but it feels like a large majority of the info Is not really relevant or is very surface level. Yet it takes a lot of time to go through. I feel like I have gotten significantly more value out of simply learning on the job. Doing projects and researching questions as they come up. I'm sure there are very nuanced, highly technical questions that come up when working with specific scenarios like IoT or banking information but I don't really experience that.I've also worked on some wed development side projects in the past that require a DB on that backend and that real life experience has also taught me a lot about both programming principles and optimizing DBs/Queries.I have three other books that I would consider reading:* Pragmatic Programmer* Designing Data Intensive Applications* Kimball's Data Warehouse Guide I know at least the bottom two are way more technical but is it worth fully reading through from someone who learns better so hands on? Should I just skim through them and look up some basics that I can further deep dive once I know I need it? Or is there really value in reading through it and taking notes? How do you guys approach learning at different points in your career?",

I've been doing this for about 8 years but only recently learned about DBT and SQLMesh, for example._I'm working on an ELT pipeline that converts input files of various formats into Parquet files on Google Cloud Storage, which subsequently need to be loaded into BigQuery tables (append-only).- The Extract processes drop files into GCS at unspecified times.- The Transform processes convert _newly created_ files to Parquet and drops the result back into GCS.- The Load process needs to load the _newly created_ files into BigQuery, making sure to load every file exactly once.To process only new (or failed) files, I guess there are two main approaches:1. Query the output, see what's missing, then process that. Seems simple, but has scalability limitations because you need to list the entire history. Would need to query both GCS and BQ to compare what files are still missing.2. Have some external system or work queue that keeps track of incomplete work. Scales better, but has the potential to go out of sync with reality (e.g. if Extract fails to write to the work queue, the file is never transformed or loaded).I suppose this is a common problem that everyone has solved already. What are the best practices around this? Is there any (ideally FOSS) tooling that could help me?",

        "author": "Original_Chipmunk941",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "**Question:**I am currently learning Google Cloud Platform for data engineering. I learned that there are three types of schemas that I can use when constructing tables in BigQuery: 1) Normalized relational schema, 2) Nested & Repeating Schema, 3) Denormalized schema. I am trying to understand when I will realistically use \"Nested & Repeating Schema\" instead of \"normalized relational schema\" for the tables that I construct in BigQuery.Please answer both of these questions below:1. When do you use \"Nested & Repeating Schema\" over \"normalized relational schema\" when you construct tables in BigQuery?2. When constructing tables within BigQuery data warehouses, how often do you use \"Nested & Repeating Schema\"? How often do you use \"normalized relational schema\"? If possible, please provide me a ballpark percentage (Ex. 40% Nested & Repeating Schema vs. 60% normalized relational schema). **My Current Rationale:**I understand that BigQuery is a columnar oriented database. I learned that \"Nested & Repeating Schema\" is a more cost-effective for querying and more efficient than \"normalized relational schema\". However, even after researching it, I do not fully understand the real life advantages of \"Nested & Repeating Schema\" over a \"normalized relational schema\".Although \"Nested & Repeating Schema\" is more efficient and cost-effective for querying, I think a \"normalized relational schema\" makes more sense because it allows you to update records more easily like a traditional SQL RDBMS.I understand that columnar oriented databases are great when your historical data within the BigQuery table does not change. However, from my experience on working as a data analyst, historical data frequently needs to change. For example, lets say you have an external OLTP RDBMS that feeds into BigQuery daily. This external OLTP RDBMS contains a table named sales data. This table contains a column named \"Member Status\" and returns either one of two outputs: \"Active\" or \"Inactive\". \"Member ID\" 123456 has a \"Member Status\" of \"Active\". The data for that daily load is sent from the external OLTP RDBMS to the BigQuery table containing the data of \"Member ID\" 123456 with a \"Member Status\" of \"Active\". Three months later, the \"Member Status\" of \"Member ID\" 123456 changes to \"Inactive\" within the external OLTP RDBMS.From my understanding, now I cannot change that data easily within the BigQuery table if it has \"Nested & Repeating Schema\" . If my BigQuery table had \"normalized relational schema\", it should be able to update the \"Member Status\" of \"Member ID\" 123456 very easily.This is my rationale on why I think a \"normalized relational schema\" is better than \"Nested & Repeating Schema\" for the majority of real world use cases. Please let me know if you agree, disagree, etc. I would love to hear your thoughts. I am still learning GCP and data engineering. Thank you for reading. :)",

I am looking for open-source (free) programs I can use to take the information given in the API break it into a full database (dataset tables) and keep in constantly updated in a gateway. In this phase of the project I am more invested in being able to do an API call and automatically pulling the data to set it into the appropriate schema. I have a really good understanding of dataset creation put I am new to the scripting an API side. I don't really know what else to add but if you have any follow up questions please comment.

I really enjoyed the work and felt like I was growing in the right direction. I also expressed my interest in this work with my manager and he said he would forward any similar projects to me as they come. The issue: However, now my manager seems to have changed his mind and told me that any future full stack opportunities will go to other team members instead of me because “I’ve had enough.” His reasoning is that projects should rotate through the team members one by one before coming back to me. While I understand wanting to give everyone opportunities, this feels like it’s limiting my ability to build expertise and grow in areas where I’m performing well.I’m also sensing some tension from teammates who seem to think I’m being “greedy” for wanting to continue with this type of work, even though I’m just trying to advance my career like anyone else would.My question: I’m considering talking to the director of data engineering about potentially switching to a different team that focuses more on core data engineering work rather than support. Is this a reasonable move, or should I try to work things out with my current manager first?Additional context:- I’ve been doing well in the full stack/data engineering work and it aligns with my career goals- This seems to be part of a broader pattern where I feel like growth opportunities are being limited- The team culture feels like it discourages ambition or self-advocacyHas anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it?TL;DR: Manager is rotating opportunities away from me after I had success with a project. Considering switching teams. Good idea or should I try to resolve this first?",

So the structure looks like something like this : |TableName|URL|Offset||:-|:-|:-||Invoices|[https://api.example.com/invoices](https://api.example.com/invoices)|0||Invoices|[https://api.example.com/invoices](https://api.example.com/invoices)|100||Invoices|[https://api.example.com/invoices](https://api.example.com/invoices)|200||PurchaseOrders|[https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders](https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders)|0||PurchaseOrders|[https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders](https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders)|150||PurchaseOrders|[https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders](https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders)|300| For each RDD, a function is called to extract data from API and returns a dictionary of data.Later on I want to filter RDD based on table name and create separate dataframes out of it. Each table has a different schema, so I'm avoiding creating a data frame that could include extra irrelevant schemas for my tables rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(offset_tuple_list) fetch_rdd = rdd.flatMap(lambda tuple:get_data(tuple,extraction_date,token)).cache() ## filter RDD per table invoices_rdd = fetch_rdd.filter(lambda row: row[\"table\"] == \"Invoices\") purchaseOrders_rdd = fetch_rdd.filter(lambda row: row[\"table\"] == \"PurchaseOrders\") ## convert it to json for automatic schema inference by read.json invoices_json_rdd = invoices_rdd.map(lambda row: json.dumps(row)) purchaseOrders_json_rdd = purchaseOrders_rdd.map(lambda row: json.dumps(row)) invoices_df = spark.read.json(invoices_json_rdd) purchaseOrders_df = spark.read.json(purchaseOrders_json_rdd)I'm using cache() to avoid multiple API calls and do it only once. My problem is that caching won't work for me if **invoices\\_df and purchaseOrders\\_df** are running by different executors. If they are run on the same executor then one takes 3 min and the other a few seconds, since it uses the cache(). If not both take 3 min + 3 min = 6min calling API twice. This behaviour is random, sometimes it runs on separate executors and I can see locality becomes RACK\\_LOCAL instead of PROCESS\\_LOCAL Any idea how I can make all executors use the same cached RDD?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi,We are a traditional software engineering team having sole experience in developing web services so far using Java with Spring Boot. We now have a new requirement in our team to engineer data pipelines that comply with standard ETL batch protocol. Since our team is well equipped in working with Java and Spring Boot, we want to continue using this tech stack to establish our ETL batches. We do not want to pivot away from our regular tech stack for ETL requirements. We found Spring Batch helps us to establish ETL compliant batches without introducing new learning friction or $ costs.Now comes the main pain point that is dividing our team politically. Some team members are advocating towards decentralised scripts that are knowledgeable enough to execute independently as a standard web service in tandem with a local cron template to perform their concerned function and operated manually by hand on each of our horizontally scaled infrastructure. Their only argument is that it prevents a single point of failure without caring for the overheads of a batch manager. While the other part of the team wants to use the remote partitioning job feature from a mature batch processing framework (Spring Batch for example) to achieve the same functionality as of the decentralized cron driven script but in a distributed fashion over our already horizontally scaled infrastructure to have more control on the operational concerns of the execution. Their argument is deep observability, easier run and restarts, efficient cron synchronisation over different timezones and servers while risking a single point of failure.We have a single source of truth that contains the infrastructure metadata of all servers where the batch jobs would execute so leveraging it within a batch framework makes more sense IMO to dynamically create remote partitions to execute our ETL process.I would like to get your views on what would be the best approach to handle the implementation and architectural nature of our ETL use case?We have a downstream data warehouse already in place for our ETL use case to write data but its managed by a different department so we can't directly integrate into it but have to do it with a non industry standard company wide red tape bureaucratic process but this is a story for another day.",

In this talk, we discuss how to avoid this trap and gracefully exchange personal ego for personal growth and super-charged collaboration. We'll also examine how software tools affect social behaviors, and how to successfully manage the growth of new ideas.\"One part that resonated with me greatly was regarding the human developer. \"I will toil in this cave and no one will know this code exists until it is perfect, at which point I will emerge and be recognized for the genius I am.\" On reddit, have you ever done some quick research before clicking that \"post\" button, out of concern you may be wrong or fearful of backlash? Same concept.The consequence of this (among others) is that neither your team nor the newer generation of programmers will get to see all of the failure you had to endure, to achieve that one cool thing, because of the way we want to be viewed. Enduring those failures and overcoming them, I believe, is more important then, and required by, any programming language, framework, tool, etc.Newcomers have all the resources, AI, and work previous generations have accomplished to look up to but we are doing those people a disservice by hiding our failures due to human emotion wether thats how we want to be viewed or general fear of negative feedback from our work.Hopefully this doesn't offend anyone or become divisive, it's just some unspoken honesty that I have appreciation for and it stuck with me because honestly... it hit close to home when I saw it back then.",

Today was the first time I've ever seen Leetcode whilst I was watching a few YouTube videos about some updates to C# (My language of choice). For me, Leetcode is definitely not reflective at all of what you would do in the majority of programming jobs and is very algorithmically heavy. Most of these algorithms you will not need to know at all most of the time as most languages contain core libraries that do this stuff way more efficiently than most developers will be able to do. Case in point, I was stuck on the first question today for about 45 minutes mainly because the question was worded really badly. I managed to solve that pretty quickly after I understood what it was asking for although I will admit I did it in my IDE rather than in Leetcode as nobody codes in the equivalent of Notepad anymore (although that's how I started back in the day). The second question I was completely stumped and gave up because it was more maths than programming (and believe it or not, you do not need to be good at maths to be a good developer). It's really going to depend on what you end up doing as an actual job. If you are writing drivers or doing anything mathematically heavy in your job then yes Leetcode might be a good fit but mostly it's algorithmic nonsense that most developers will never even use. I've worked for some of the biggest banks, insurance providers doing APIs hooking up to some pretty complex business logic and never have I had to use anything close to Leetcode level solutions. My point is, don't be disappointed in yourself if you struggle with Leetcode. You can still be a success. Lead teams. Produce mobile applications and desktop systems that millions of users use and enjoy each year all without ever needing to worry about the types or problems shown on Leetcode.",

But the backend takes the cross site request, runs the request, and sends a proper response like how it would do for a genuine request. so now I don't understand what if [bank.com](http://bank.com) has some endpoint like /sendmoney, that returns success or failure. and [evil.com](http://evil.com) makes cross site request to that endpoint. Will the backend still execute the /sendmoney? what I understand is, backend does the work and returns response, then browser blocks [evil.com](http://evil.com) from seeing the response(which doesnt matter in this case).so if this is how it works, CORS is to stop [evil.com](http://evil.com) from only viewing resources/responses of [bank.com](http://bank.com) it wont stop from making it hit some endpoints?I have read about CSRF tokens.

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi everyone,I’m 22 and about to graduate with a Master’s in Computer Applications. I don’t have a job yet, and honestly, I feel completely stuck and left behind.When I was 14, I found out about software engineering after my neighbor moved to the US. That lit a fire in me—I started dreaming of becoming a great engineer, moving abroad, doing something meaningful. I pushed hard through 9th and 10th grades believing that hard work now would lead to success later.Then the lockdown hit just as I entered my Bachelor's. I learned a bit of programming, but I also wasted a lot of time—watching movies, helping at home, and losing direction.In 2022, I tried learning web development. I got a job I didn’t enjoy, then an internship where I couldn’t perform well. I tried React, but it felt overwhelming. Since then, I’ve bounced between DSA, frontend, Golang, and trying to build projects—but nothing sticks. Most projects remain unfinished. I’m not proud of anything I’ve built.I try starting projects, but I lose interest after two or three days. The initial excitement fades quickly, and I struggle to push through once things get repetitive or challenging. I feel stuck in a loop—excited to begin, but unable to finish. This keeps happening, and it kills my confidence even more.Now it’s 2025, and I feel like I’ve lost the **curiosity and excitement** that got me into tech in the first place. Programming doesn’t excite me anymore—it feels like just another boring subject I’m forcing myself through. I accept that YouTube and social media made tech look glamorous, and I got pulled into that version. But now I realize—it’s only fulfilling if you truly love the work.I have a short attention span. I give up easily when I hit bugs. I don’t learn frameworks or concepts as fast as I think I should. I feel like I’m not cut out for this.The worst part? I’m scared I’ll be stuck as someone mediocre forever. I lie awake at night thinking, *What if I’m falling behind in this race? What if I missed the boat? What if I end up like someone who fell out during the dot-com bubble and never recovered?*Meanwhile, I see people younger than me building amazing things, earning well, learning fast. It crushes me.My family—especially my parents and older brother—are amazing and supportive. They never pressure me, but I know deep down they want me to start earning. A few days ago, my mom quietly said, *“I thought you’d do something to change things at home, but you couldn’t.”* That sentence shattered me. I want to help them financially and emotionally. But I haven’t earned a single **dime** yet.I’ve been cold-emailing founders, CTOs, and employees on LinkedIn, and applying to jobs almost every day—but I keep getting rejections or no responses at all. It’s disheartening.Sometimes, I want to give up. But I also don’t want to. There’s still a small part of me that wants to break through, to build something meaningful, and to prove to myself that I *can* do it.I want to make it in tech. I want to be good at it. I still dream of building cool products and figuring out how things work. But I just don’t know how to keep going when everything feels overwhelming. I want to feel motivated again. I want to believe it’s not too late for me.Lately, I’ve been interested in backend development, but I know frontend is important too—and after failing so many times at it, frontend feels boring and intimidating. Starting again feels stupid and exhausting.Sorry if I sound like a complaint box or just another burnt-out CS guy. I just needed to get this off my chest.If anyone has been through this—or made it out of this kind of mental/emotional/technical rut—please let me know: **How do you stay consistent when your confidence is shattered?** **How do you bring back the excitement and curiosity for tech?** **How do you stop feeling like a failure?**Thanks for reading.**TL;DR:** 22, finishing MCA. Lost interest and motivation in programming. Tried web dev, Go, DSA—nothing sticks. Projects remain incomplete. Haven’t earned a dime yet. Family is supportive but I feel like I’ve let them down. Programming feels boring now; glamorized YouTube content pulled me in. I’m cold emailing founders, CTOs, employees and applying for jobs—but facing rejections. I’m scared of falling behind forever. Still want to succeed in tech but don’t know how. Backend interests me, frontend feels overwhelming. Looking for advice, support, or just someone who understands.",

What do people recommend?Personally I can’t see the point in Vibe coding unless you know the language already. It won’t teach you much except perhaps mundane things like API interfaces etc.I could leave him learning C, which is sort-of fine. I wonder if he’d develop things more quickly in another language and that would increase his engagement.By the same token I think it’s pointless to teach him ARM assembly. It would be an awful lot of effort for limited output - learning lots of instructions and different register sets just so he could e.g. multiply two numbers together. Whereas I tended to use ARM assembly because I needed speed 30 years ago.What do people think? Thoughts welcome.",

VBA (as I understand it) is only compatible with Excel, so if I wanted to create my own desktop or web based program I’d need to put my code…. Somewhere else…. Again, I feel absolutely stupid asking, so please feel free to poke fun in a kind way, but know that if I could’ve asked in a way concisely enough to just google it I would have taken that route months ago. Do I need an app, to create an app? Or a specific website? Is Java a language and a program? And for someone with rudimentary knowledge of VBA and a past life on MySpace, where would you recommend I start?",

        "author": "Voxmanns",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "In my 10 years so far with tech, I have had the absolute pleasure to work alongside some brilliantly talented and well educated programmers. However, I have seen those same developers have their arguments and perspectives fall flat, despite their technical prowess, while less technically gifted minds withhold tremendously valuable ideas for fear of being caught on a technicality or unknown detail.TL;DR - We are taught that cleanliness and efficiency of code is the earmark of a quality solution. While important, we fail to educate programmers on the importance of factors beyond the code and how to navigate the complexity and priorities of a real application. This post is for anyone who is truly curious about what \"good code\" really means, and for those who suspect the answer has more to do with the problems you solve than the language you use to do it.**Introduction**Goodhart's Law - \"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\"I think most of us have experienced those often frustrating debates between programmers where one is claiming the other has an inferior approach because \"I could write it faster by doing x.\" or \"I could write it with less complexity by doing y.\"My goal with this post is to primarily open up discussion around this topic and hopefully provide something valuable from my 10 years of doing software development.Before I dig in, I think it's only fair to say where I come from. I have worked the last 10 years in cloud development, working with a lot of different SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS technologies. I have dabbled a LITTLE in hardware and lower level languages - but never really had to do much in terms of deploying code for a new piece of hardware and have, admittedly, been a bit spoiled on not having to deal with things like managing pointers or resolving memory errors at a lower level. However, what I want to talk about should be a fair bit removed from that level of granularity and speaks more to how we as programmers approach a problem. That being said, I have worked as an admin using declarative tools, managed code bases of several million lines, and successfully implemented several medium and large scale system architectures in my time. That is to say, I've seen a lot of shit in the last decade.**Conflating personal skills with solution quality**With the preface out of the way, let me put my assertion straight. I see a lot of programmers conflating their proficiency with coding (speed to write code, initial resilience of code, complexity mitigation, readability, testability, etc.) as a reflection of solution quality. It is a frequent and concerning problem that many programmers are taught or conclude that the quality of how the code is written is above the functionality of the existing application.For clarity, I am not saying that things like readability are irrelevant to the measurement of a solution's quality. Of course, all other things equal, a solution with more readable code is a better solution than the same with less readable code. What I am saying is that the actual influence of these metrics varies depending on the environment and context of the implemented solution.For example, a small scale and local utility (such as a simple script for managing files in a folder) does not gain nearly as much proportional benefit from more readable code as a large scale ETL job managed by multiple people from multiple teams working in multiple frameworks. We could deliberate endlessly on what the \"correct\" weighting of these metrics are for any given project, but the real issue is when these metrics become surrogates for the strategic goal of the application.The reality is that, when it comes down to the application running and doing its job, the only thing that matters is how well it does its job: How efficiently does it succeed when it is provided valid inputs, how effectively does it recover from unexpected inputs/results, and how safely does it fail in the event of an unrecoverable error?Nobody cares that you made it super readable if it doesn't work. Nobody cares that you wrote it faster if it's laden with bugs. No one is happy that you reduced 30 lines to 2 lines if it makes the application a total resource hog. Similarly, nobody cares if it runs 500ms faster UNLESS that 500ms makes a difference in the grand scheme of the tech.Simply put, there is an important and clear distinction between your skills as a programmer, and the quality of the solution you produce. While your technical skills as a programmer are EXTREMELY important, they do not necessarily ensure that the solutions you produce are quality solutions. It's a mistake I have seen a lot of developers make, and it leaves them bewildered because they felt they did everything right. It reminds me of the classic Indiana Jones scene when Jones simply shoots the guy showing off all his fancy moves. It looks cool, super impressive, but totally useless in the wrong context.**Programming and solution quality is impacted by the real world and supporting relationships.**\"I would've never written it this way. They could've easily done x to make this better.\"We've all felt that way at least once. You are SO blessed to finally work on that bit of code that hasn't been touched in 25 years just to find it is such a convoluted mess of outdated checks, redundant assignments, tightly coupled classes, et al. The feat of the developers goes from \"This is really nice and sensible code that I can work with.\" to \"How the hell did the last guy keep this thing running at all?\"This sentiment that you would've done it better by doing it your way is almost always a lie you're telling yourself. Here's why:Programming, as we all hopefully understand by now, is an iterative process. That means to reach your ideal state, you necessarily cannot jump from step 0 to the final step. There are checkpoints you must cross in order to get there. However, these checkpoints are marked by the application's functionality, and the structure/ease of the code is loosely implied by the business/client at best.In other words, the developer will always be pressured to produce functional code over \"clean\" code. I am not referring to the actual principles of Clean Code necessarily, just whatever your idea of the \"right way to write the code\" is.This means that leading into these checkpoints, there are always unanswered questions and missing pieces of context that we wish we would have had in the beginning. I just recently was working on a report generation tool for a friend when, just a week before we needed it to be done, they decided to clarify that certain parts of the report needed to have dynamic labeling and columns when we had already understood them as static elements. As you can imagine, that's a totally different approach than I had originally planned for. With not enough time to totally rewrite the program, I had a choice:1. Quickly refactor the code, accept that it'll be a bit messy, defer proper restructuring, happy client because it works.2. Ask for an extension to the deadline, customer misses their reporting window, blame them for not being clear and not knowing that information at the beginning?I, of course, asked for the extension. They, of course, denied the request. So, I went with option 1. Why? Because the relationship was more valuable to me than the structure of my code. I will absolutely take on a bit of a messier solution on the backend to secure another future project and ensure the client is happy **in this scenario**.That's not to say it's always the right answer. I have refused to deploy changes that were of security or regulatory concern because not going to jail was more important than winning another project. I'm not even saying I am always right in which options I take for these situations. My point, as highlighted by the title of this section, is that the world around the application matters a LOT. Assuming you would have done it better without knowing all of the context for why those decisions were made is not only unfair to the previous developers, but is simply a conclusion driven by ego.Tying this back to our main theme, you are measuring the quality of the solution based on metrics which are not the goal. The goal was a functional app that satisfied the defined requirements within the allotted timeline. That's it.**Programmers have limitations. It's okay to not be a superhuman.**I'm going to pivot the focus a bit and talk more about you - the programmer. I'm not going to say that every programmer is an antisocial basement dweller who would never suffer the presence of another human being or (God-forbid) a team building exercise. We know that already (jk).Seriously, though, there are some INCREDIBLE programmers out there. I've seen people who have mastered a multitude of frameworks, seem to 100x processing times every time they touch something, and can build a decent MVP, if given all the info up front, at a break-neck pace.But, I have also seen programmers who are incredible in a different way. They may be slower on the keyboard, but they do a much better job at diagnosing issues and getting to the root cause of a problem. Some of them are incredible at interpersonal relationship building (very valuable in tech as a programmer, just saying). Some can understand a seemingly limitless amount of complexity and boil things down to a simple direction that everyone understands. I've met and managed a few that seemed to be able to do all of it and more entirely on their own (usually 25+ YoE on those guys/gals).We say this all the time, but I think we forget to take our own advice: Programming is so much more than the code. For every rockstar programmer I have had the pleasure of working with, I could identify several issues working with them. Even the guy who does it all tends to be a victim of their own success and struggles to not dominate the room when collaboration is a must. Everyone has their gaps in knowledge and that's okay. Programming is an absurdly broad, dense, and deep discipline.I say this, because I still see it as a big issue in tech today. I think AI has really inflamed the issue too (I won't be getting into that) because of how many different ways there are to use this, frankly, very powerful tool. Please, for the sake of your sanity and enjoyment of programming, do not measure yourself OR OTHERS on a single dimension. It is my belief that a pillar of a good programmer is the ability to appreciate solutions and strengths which they do not possess nor understand, and the ability to keep the big picture in mind when addressing a potential weakness in themselves, the solution, or another programmer. Remember, comparison is the thief of joy.**What leads to the surrogation of goals in software?**I think it takes a lot of tolerance for uncertainty to work in tech. After all, your job is to essentially invent things that don't exist yet. Sure, there's a million pdf parsers out there, but there isn't one that does EXACTLY what you need the EXACT way you need it. There are 1000s of security camera models out there, but your new camera design (hopefully) taps into something the market is being starved of.But, what the hell do you do when something like blockchain hits it big? What if you're required to use a library you've never even heard of? What if Maggie in accounting can't so much as find the damn Windows start button, yet she's the VP of your project and wants to know every little technical detail just to ridicule things she doesn't understand? Dammit Maggie, it's a REST call! IT'S JUST A....On top of that, we hardly have much consensus on what \"good code\" even is - or the \"right\" way to do it. We had waterfall for some 30 years, then Agile happened, but we still have waterfall and now we have hybrid Waterfall/Agile teams with varying adherence to either paradigm. Sometimes they just make up their own rules and call it Agile because they do stuff on a bi-weekly cadence.Plus, you have Scrum and Kanban muddying the waters. But, you also have standards like TOGAF and ITIL. Let's also not forget how SaaS providers like Jira have their own rules to abide by. Honorable mention to the books and onslaught of professionals saying \"I have figured it out! Buy my shit.\" That's all before you even get to the framework you're going to be working in. It's a freaking mess!The reality is, we just don't know what perfect code is. We can generally approximate when code is written poorly or well, and we can loosely articulate the reasons and speculations around that approximation, but we don't \\*know\\* if it's right except for very specific cases (of which there are still many examples). Nearly everything is up to debate, and it can be really hard to be certain that the code we write is good. Except, it doesn't need to be.**Preventing surrogation of goals.**Ironically, one of the most important lessons I have learned in tech has been from the least technical users I have encountered. I learned that there are two questions that should always be guiding a solution.1. Why does this work?2. Why doesn't this work?If you're underwhelmed, you probably should be. If you're enraged because of questions like -1. What about the code structure and efficiency?2. What about security?3. How does this help me implement design patterns into my work?\\- bear with me.As I mentioned in the beginning of this post, I have seen many programmers prioritize the quality of the code over the functionality of the app. I've seen it in practice as well as in conversations/debates amongst programmers. These questions still matter, but their relevance is predicated on how it answers the question of \"Why does this work,\" and/or \"Why doesn't this work?\"What about structure and efficiency? Is that why it does/doesn't work? If the current code structure does not significantly impact the solutions ability to work or not work, then it's a moot question. It's moot, because it has no meaningful bearings on how well the app does its job (or fails to do its job).For a personal utility script where the focus is on development efficiency and functionality, not raw execution speed, a few seconds' difference in runtime is inconsequential. So the practical value of a faster script is diminished if it sacrifices development efficiency. Ultimately, **the script's success is defined by whether or not it works as intended.** In that regard, a 'slower' script developed in one hour can be a more pragmatic solution than a 'faster' one that took three hours to build.Now, I said a lot about strengths and weaknesses of a programmer. So let's take it a step further and address the speed at which coding is done. I, frankly, am not a super fast coder. I'm not the slowest in the room, but I was never the guy who could just churn code like a factory (pattern).I know, way to show my ass to the crowd. The thing is, I am simply stronger in analysis and communication than I am in writing code. I'm cool with being that guy. I love working with developers who are code factories and don't want to deal with people as much, because that's a complementary counterpart to what I bring to the table. So, while I focus on drafting demos and POCs and diagrams and all of these things about the application, they can focus on the real meat of the application, preventing backdoors, scaling efficiency, obscure mathematical theorems, etc.However, since we are talking about a collaborative environment, it is important to note that this is not a siloed effort. I NEED to write production code because I NEED to understand what goes into it, pitfalls, and tricks. I may be subordinate to the code master next to me, but I cannot circumvent the necessity of actually doing the work. The same goes for the code master. They NEED to create diagrams and explain concepts because they NEED to understand how the customer feels, whether or not their idea can conceptually make sense to another person, and so on. Just like they bail me out if I back myself into a corner, I bail them out if they start fumbling the presentation. It goes both ways, and we both become exceptional for it.**The True Programmer, and respecting your colleagues**I know advocating for respect on an internet forum is a quintessential example of \"screaming into the void,\" but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention it.Just like how I said we don't know a lot of things, we (as a society) don't know what a true programmer is. Something to do with writing code, something to do with building applications. I'm not here to claim that I have the be-all-end-all answer to what a true programmer is. Quite the opposite.The literal definition of a programmer is pretty vague when you look at it from a technical perspective. There's a lot of nuance and layers to writing a computer program that we could spend a long time deliberating over. That is precisely why we must be very careful, or downright avoid, the argument that \"someone who does x\" or \"someone who doesn't know y\" is or is not a \"true programmer.\" Fans of the True-Scotsman fallacy will know exactly what I mean here. It's an argument that leads to nowhere.The reality is technology is a part of everyone's life, and everyone's perspective on it matters. We need non-technical users to break our apps and force us to come up with more resilient and intuitive designs. We need semi-technical users to help translate the real world to technical ideas with new and creative inspirations outside of the conventional walls. We need deeply technical users to navigate the gritty details of building the applications when they're 9 layers removed from the original problem. Most importantly, we need all of them to work together to build anything meaningful.Everyone gets into tech with their own perspective for their own reasons. But what technology is, fundamentally, doesn't change. Whether it's writing a new business integration or starting a SaaS company or building robots or even developing new devices that don't require a plug - the whole idea of technology is rooted in discovery. We take the chaos the world presents us, and learn how to contain it and use it to achieve our goals. Fire became torches, circuits became software, and Maggie became a great lesson for me in what really matters in software.I hope this post serves as a valuable reminder of all the things we still don't know in software and technology as a whole. I hope it reassures newcomers that it's okay to feel like everything is a hot mess - because it is. I also hope it helps to soothe some of the hardened veterans who know things and learned lessons that the vast majority of society could hardly understand, let alone be expected to know. Finally, I hope it helps everyone make better applications by focusing on what really matters. Whether it's an actual project, or just discussing ideas with a stranger, we should always focus on why it does or doesn't work first, and remember that what is most valuable to us as programmers is not always what's most valuable to the applications themselves.**P.S. Counter arguments and the importance of taking different approaches**I am acutely aware that there are many software that are vastly different than the cushy business applications I have come to know. Even banks have a higher tolerance of failure than, say, the technology responsible for safely landing your aircraft. Furthermore, there is a very real snowball effect poorly written code has where tech debt and developer morale go in the wrong directions quickly.This is not me advocating for haphazardly writing code and being complacent with what we do not know. If you've got 30 layers of if statements in your method, I'm inclined to believe that you did something wrong and should have fixed it a long time ago. Getting the job done tomorrow matters as well as getting it done today, usually. You'll never solve for everything, so you always try to solve what matters the most first, and there are times that your application can \"get the job done\" today, but should absolutely not see the light of production until it is completely reworked into a sensible architecture.The answer to \"Why doesn't this work?\" can very likely be \"Because it's so impossible to understand that we won't know why it fails.\" or \"Because this bug introduces a 0.1% chance that the plane slams into the ground upside down and kills everyone on board.\"This is a bit more philosophical, but I am of the mind that you should always have unresolved reasons for why something doesn't work. If you don't, you probably don't know your application very well. This ultimately gets into risk assessment and whether or not the risk/reward is worth it. A tiny risk of a minor issue, like a script running a few seconds slow, may not be worth hours of work. However, a tiny risk of a major disaster, like a plane crash, is unacceptable and must be addressed. Deciding what risks to tackle is a judgment call based on the severity of the potential outcome.Remember, the definition of what does and does not work varies. You need to be aware of it and set your own standards (at least, as much as you're able to) to ensure that the software you produce is to the quality it needs to be. Knowing the implications of not following a best practice, and accurately determining if it's a meaningful risk, is an extremely delicate decision. You need to know the rules and respect the rules before you go off deciding to intentionally break them.",

I myself was not introduced to coding until much later in life which I wish I was, stuff would’ve been easier for me. I was thinking of enrolling him into a scratch course to help him get ‘head start’ into the field. He has done some scratch animation projects in school however I came across a course which teaches scratch more in depth with more projects. He said he would be interested in doing it, however I was relaying the information to some people and they’ve said that programming is dead now because of AI and a lot of people are not able to make use of their skills anymore. They said that it’s not worth it to learn how to code. I’m really conflicted because I would like my brother to learn skills early on that will help him in his later schooling and career and he isn’t struggling to grasp basic concepts in college like I was. I still want to enroll him in scratch course because I know in the end he will learn something and it’s worth it rather than him not doing anything at all. I wanted to know if anyone had any advice on how I can help him learn early on about the IT industry, software engineering, etc. so he already has basic knowledge beforehand. Any courses, classes, activities for middle schoolers? I know about code ninjas but I’m not a fan of those learning center franchises. I have tried them out, They are super expensive and barely learn anything while they are there. TIA!",

I was wondering if learning a less known but still used language would be a good idea. I was thinking something like Rust or maybe an older language that still is used in industry but not taught as much in academia. I would appreciate any thoughts, and am very open to the idea that I'm just wrong :)",

        "content": "So basically, I'm studying first year of CS, we're at the end of the year and we learnt about the basics of c++, using simple data structures like maps, or binary trees, or lists, pointers , and classes. As a part of a final project we have been tasked to create a Finder class that accepts pointers to any type of object. It assumes the object has a get rectangle function that gives it's left, right, top and bottom coordinates. It must be able to add, erase, and update the positions.The last function must return a set that contains the pointers to the objects that are inside or intersect with a given rectangle. and the problem is we have to do it in O(log n) with n being the number of rectangles on the container.In my research I've found that to accomplish this I've gotta use complex (at least for me) data structures like rtrees or quadtrees, which doesn't seem very reasonable to me. And we haven't been given any more guidelines how or what we can and cannot do. Do you guys think I should investigate and implement one of these tree structures? Or is there a simpler alternative?Thanks in advance to everyone.Update: I wasn't expecting this many responses, wow. So I took your advice and spent the whole day learning and implementing this quad tree fucker because I had to deliver it for today, it works and all the automatic test give the ok. And within the two weeks we had to do this I started to do it yesterday because I'm too lazy.I asked my friend and it seems most people have implemented a grid system with maps, but the tree seems to be better and more elegant I learnt a lot today so, again, thanks.",

Still it's been a lot of work, and even if I'm still hanging on, I'm having doubts on my process and abilities.When people ask me at what percentage of the progress I am on this project I cannot answer because I know every damn features takes so much more work than the basic prototype, especially for a good UX. It drives me crazy when people ask me such questions and are underwhelmed by how slow things actually goes. (Even if I'm grateful I know people who genuinely want to be users.)I don't know other devs and I've been recently asked by a friend if I was slow because I am self-taught, assuming that was the issue. I took several online course on my own and try to keep learning regularly in order to have better practice. I am still learning, so it's slower than an experienced dev with a lot of experience... but I'm assuming programming a good product is just long and difficult and the pace will always be underwhelming. Am I wrong for assuming that? I'm not against stepping up my game but I'm afraid I'll just burn myself out. Do anyone have any advice to keep one's sanity on such long-term project?",

This time, I received a good review, possibly even being considered for promotion. No more comments about being slow.However, just 3 months after that latest performance review (at 1 year and 9 months of experience — which is now), I received feedback again from others saying that I'm slow. These comments came from a few different sprints, and possibly from different people as well.For more context, the \"slowness\" now refers to me taking a longer time to complete relatively simple tasks. I was asked why I needed so much time to finish a task that others completed in much less time. (Even though the task was simple, I still completed it on time.) While working on it, I encountered some hiccups — which were simple to fix — but it still took me some time to figure out the solutions. This might be because the issues were new to me, I quickly got the grasp of where are going wrong, but finding the workable fix take me sometime, or maybe because I'm just not good enough at logic or programming, which makes me slower than others.What can I do now?I'm starting to question myself about pursuing a career in programming. Does all of this mean I’m just NOT born to be a good programmer?I want to be the best — someone recognized and respected at work.",

I’m considering either going back to Python (haven’t written any in about 6 months) or learning Go and studying those concepts while I pick up Go. At first, I won’t be using either Python or Go at work, so it would just be for studying in my free time. So here’s the question:1. In your free time, do you use a different language than the one you use at work, or do you stick with the same one to stay sharp?2. Should I stick with Java to improve as a Java developer, or could switching tools be a good idea?",

I don’t want to rush into building AI stuff without a strong foundation. But I also don’t want to get stuck in “tutorial purgatory” or waste time on things I don’t need yet.A few things I’m wondering:•What areas of software engineering should I focus on next if my goal is to build real, scalable products (like SaaS)?•How do I transition from learning to building things that people actually use?•When is a good time to dive into AI/ML agent development?•How do you know you’re “ready” to work on these more complex systems?Also, if you’ve been down this road yourself and wouldn’t mind being a bit of a mentor (even informally), I’d be super grateful.

Instead of putting everything in one CSS file, I ended up splitting it into a bunch of smaller files like `header.css`, `utilities.css`, `modals.css`, and so on.

I have been making a VB .Net WinForms app to archive project directories at work to a different storage raid by scanning all the files/folders recursively and ensuring everything is older than a specified date. It then copies the files to our archive drive. then, it does a binary comparison of the source and copied files to ensure everything was 100% successful before deleting the source file. All that functionality works PERFECTLY. (Picture a shared drive full of folders, each of which is a complete project. If no changes have happened to a project in at least a year, it's safe to archive. Stuff on the archive drive is read-only for most of the company to keep it safe for record keeping and not cluttering up daily work)For the next phase, I want it to go through that archive drive and put all the archived directories into compressed files (Zip or 7Zip). So, each project folder becomes its own zip file. Our data is highly compressible, and we can save about 30% space by compressing files that we don't need to be regularly accessing.I see that this line of code easily creates the zip file for me: System.IO.Compression.ZipFile.CreateFromDirectory(FolderPath, OutputZipPath, CompressionLevel.SmallestSize, True)My questions are:* Is there a way to verify the file accuracy after zipped before I delete the source files? * I may be over-cautious, but I don't want to risk any file corruptions* Is there a different way to compress folders that I should research? * I did my proof-of-concept testing using a batch file that triggered 7zip, but I prefer to keep everything integrated into a single program if possible unless there's a good reason not to. edit: minor error: i flipped the percentage of saved space, sorry. they compress to 70% of original size, saving 30%.",

I'd love to hear your thoughts on which path would be best to start my career. Ideally, I’d like to stay flexible and be able to explore different areas in the future if my curiosity changes, so I don't want an area that will specialize me too much too early. I have always heard BE engineering seems to be the best role for this kind of felxibility, but please let me know what you think!Here's the list of opportunities, ordered from most attractive to least (in my opinion):### Backend Engineer Internship at a Product Company- **Duration:** 9-month internship, with a possibility of a full-time offer afterwards.- **Tech stack:** Spring, Kafka, SQL and NoSQL databases.- **Pros:** I love everything about this—tech stack, company culture, team vibe.- **Cons:** The pay is lower than the other (non-internship) offers for the first 9 months.---### Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) at a Product Company- **Status:** Interview scheduled next week.- **Details:** The company was acquired by a major player, so it seems relatively stable.- **Pros:** I find SRE work interesting.- **Concerns:** I'm worried that starting my career in SRE might limit my ability to change into other areas later on.---### Backend Engineer at an Outsourcing Consultancy- **Status:** Passed HR round; they're waiting on salary expectations.- **Details:** They want to move me forward to client interviews.- **Pros:** I expect to learn a lot, and they were open to salary negotiations—even with my slightly above-entry-level ask.- **Cons:** Still unclear which client or project I'd end up on.---### Data Scientist at a Consulting Company- **Status:** Just received the message; haven't responded yet.- **Details:** Seems to involve in-house consulting, with a focus on machine learning.- **Pros:** They seem very enthusiastic about some ML stuff in my CV and my Python experience (pretty advanced for an entry level).- **Cons:** I’m not particularly interested in data roles right now. I'd only consider it for a very high salary (mid-level developer range), which might be unrealistic for an entry-level hire.---### Internship at a Startup- **Status:** Offer available.- **Details:** The startup recently closed a big contract and is expanding.- **Pros:** I'd probably learn a lot quickly.- **Cons:** Very low pay. Feels unstable. Work would include a mix of backend, data, and no-code frontend (only one other dev on the team). Might make transitioning to more traditional jobs harder later on.Thank you so much in advance! :)Edit: forgot to turn on markdown mode",

I have two goals 1) An app that shows potential to employers and 2) to use different technologies then school will teach (Java, Python, Js) to broaden my knowledge. My question is should I stick with .net and use blazor or maui, or switch to something else like flutter and go, or does it really even matter? There is lots of .net jobs in my area but that may change in four years. I guess my concern would be that this will be a very large project and I would hate in a few years to realize I should've done something different.

Is this a feasible structure? It seems like it would fill up with a lot of posts really fast. On the other hand, if you simplified it and just had a table for all users, all posts, all comments, and all communities, wouldn't it also take forever to parse and get, say, all the posts created by a given user?

        "author": "dethstrobe",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I recently left Google after nearly four years. I wish I could say it lives up to all the hype, but it didn't. I honestly felt like I did some of the worst work of my career there. The environment, the processes, and team dynamics simply didn't align with my approach for how to collaborate and ship software. I've been reflecting on exactly why I wasn't able to make it work for me.Just to brace you, I know just how ranty this is going to sound. I'm not writing this as a condemnation of Google, because I know there are people that thrive and enjoy working there. This is just my own personal perspective on it. Take it with a grain of salt.# Agile is a SinI come from companies that do agile processes. It's not perfect, but it's empowering and very adaptive to change. I've been told that agile processes do not scale. So when I joined Google, I was extremely interested in learning how and what Google does to ship software. They must be doing something slightly different or better to ship software at scale, right?Wrong. They quite literally don't have processes around collaboration. It's basically waterfall. Product writes up a doc. Gets buy-in from leadership. Tosses it at engineering. And then we never see them again, so we're left to implement it as we see fit.It is literally the most expensive and high risk software development I've seen in my entire career. They basically have blind faith they've hired super smart people that will just magically build the perfect product. Which to be fair, they do quite literally have a lot of *rock star* developers. But relying on purely heroics to ship software is a recipe for burn out and knowledge silos.Also, they don't ship software. Deadlines are arbitrary. There are so many times when we approach a deadline only for \"X\" feature needs to absolutely be there on release so we'll just push out the release. I think deadlines are stupid, so I don't want to pretend like I care about them. But I do care about shipping software. The sooner you ship, the sooner you can start to learn and prove that your core assumptions are right or wrong. So to ship sooner, you need to downscope. If your MVP (minimal viable product) requires several really difficult features to implement, maybe it's not an MVP anymore. But then again, I guess no one called it an MVP, but me, who is used to shipping software regularly.# The Doc MachineSo, if you're not regularly shipping software, how can you possibly measure impact?Docs.Endless docs.Countless docs.So many docs that it can be impossible to find what doc says what you did.Google's mission is to \"organize the world's information.\" Internally in Google, they generate a lot of information in docs, and it's very hard to search and find the information you're looking for.What's the point of docs no one reads? Well, since software doesn't get shipped, I assume it just acts as a laundry list of links when attempting to show impact for your performance reviews or promotions. You might not have shipped anything, but at least you left a paper trail of what you didn't ship.You want to know the worst part of it? They want you to write a doc on a system you don't understand. So you write it up, make some assumptions and send it out for approval. No one reads it to approve it. Let's say you get your single approver and start implementing. Guess what, your core assumption is wrong. The data isn't in the right place, or the data you thought had what you needed, doesn't. Now you need to rewrite the doc.What's the point of getting approval? What's the point of a doc that is wrong from the start? What's the point of upfront design that is wrong? Why not just implement and find out what actually is going on and make it work?The point is, it's just theater to make it look like we're doing our jobs. Why isn't the software the evidence we're doing our job?I'm not trying to say docs are bad, and everything should just be tribal knowledge. But I am saying docs that need to be rewritten from the get-go are a waste of time.# Bad docsIronically, despite needing to write so many docs to implement things. When you read other people's docs, you might notice something. They're very high-level. They're more like a thesis, then like actual documentation on how to use an API.What is the point of docs that don't answer how to use an API?Focusing on the high-level philosophy of a service is honestly distracting and unhelpful. I think I understand why this happens. It's hard to keep docs up to date. So if you keep them high-level, they won't become obsolete or need to be updated. But I don't care about your thesis defense; I just want to use your software to solve my problem.And I know Google can write good docs. [Angular](https://angular.dev/overview) has fantastic documentation. [Proto Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/overview/) have great docs. Both of these are made by Google. I guess the difference is they're public facing and Google doesn't prioritize internal docs like they do their external facing ones.# A Culture of SilenceSo, there is a lot of lip service towards how open Google is. Say how they're trying to encourage employees in fireside chats to not ask anonymous questions so that leadership can follow up with the individual to gain more context. (This, by the way, does not prevent people from asking anonymously, which they do.)There is also a culture of no-blame retrospectives. They don't run regularly, even when I advocate for them. And worst of all, when we finally do run retrospectives, we don't discuss challenges and problems we are encountering. So, what's the point of a retrospective that doesn't talk about pain points and mitigation strategies? From my perspective, it just looks like theater and a way to paint a false view that everything is good and we have nothing to complain about. Or worse, that we are helpless and we really cannot change anything.Coming from companies with genuinely open cultures where we fostered candid and open discussions, it's baffling to me that no one seems willing to put in the minimal effort to improve everyone's lives.It is better to be positive about a broken system and keep the status quo than it is to ask people to put in a laughable small level of effort to make everyone's life better. Not everything is going smoothly all the time. And assuming we **want** it to run smoothly, we should probably discuss the pain points and workarounds or solutions to them. Knowledge silos are bad. More open discussions can reduce knowledge silos which reduces the burden on individuals and gives everyone a balance for job responsibilities.# A Culture of Bottom-Up (but only if it's top-down)So, in meetings with leadership. They emphasize that our *bottom-up culture* is how we do such great work. And by *bottom-up*, they apparently mean *top-down*.# When Bottom-Up Meets Brick WallSo, let's say our UXR (user experience research team) has come up with an obvious gap in our offerings. What would you do? Perhaps gather some people from multiple disciplines and brainstorm a solution. Or maybe you just get leadership and design in a room and iterate on who knows what behind closed doors for literal months, before you ever even involve engineering. And for those few months, you pull engineering off their current teams in a large-scale reorg and don't give them marching orders instead just give them a bunch of vague ideas of what they might want to build. Like...what is engineering supposed to do? Build against an invisible moving target? The answer is, that is exactly what we do. Not because it's a good use of our time, but because we have nothing better to do and we have no input into the vision of the product.So let's say, you're an engineer, like yours truly, and you think that process is stupid, and instead you really do want to try to implement a bottoms up initiative. So maybe, see a feature, we originally spec'd out but was dropped because they didn't see the current value in implementing it. But it sounds kind of cool, and shouldn't be that difficult to get an MVP for this feature. Maybe you go to reach out across teams, pull in people that own data you need, a team that works on Android and iOS, and try to get people from the backend team so you can make an e2e MVP to demonstrate this feature is doable. Also, act as a test bed to show smaller agile processes work and probably how we should handle work in the org.Sounds pretty encouraging, right? But here is the real problem, one of the teams is a no-show. Not only are they a no-show, they also refuse to work with you and ignore your messages. You escalate to your manager and tech lead, and that team also ignores them too. You work with the other teams and implement everything, but say the one thing to tie everything together and make it work e2e. Let's say a backend team refused to work with you. So, naturally, offer to do the work for them. And they tell you to not do that. Because it's not my code base, I'm not on call, and I don't have to maintain it. So what do you do?What I did was create a video demo that made it look like it should work and presented it to leadership. We were reorged before this demo was even presented, so the feature died on the vine.# The Only MVP Is Minimum Viable Plausible DeniabilityLet's say that you do still believe in the rhetoric that, *the organization really does believe in bottom-up*. So you take some time and write up a doc (which is an activity you don't enjoy but if that's how the game is played, and you want to play ball, you do it). The doc outlines an open source initiative that is coincidentally attempting to solve the space we just tried to fill. But since there's an open-source community trying to solve the same problem space, maybe we can just leverage that and even help them grow at the same time. Anyway, it was super nice to have leadership hear me out, but they didn't want to go with it, because it turns out that one of the reasons we hamstrung our last project was because we were attempting to skirt a legal definition that the open source project is tackling head on. Suddenly, it made more sense: The original project was destined to fail, not because it was a bad idea, but because they were trying to handicap the implementation to avoid legal scrutiny.Fundamentally, we're not trying to build good software or solve problems. We're just trying to do something without bringing legal scrutiny to Google.I understand getting sued sucks, and the law is often weaponized against Google. But why handicap ourselves? There are so many other ideas out there. Why not pursue things that are higher value and lower risk? I cynically believe it could just be virtue signaling to investors, to show Google is trying new things and still taking risks. But their risks seem high-risk, low-reward, compared to the normal practices I'm used to, which focus on mitigating risk and prioritizing high value. Taking risks here seems to be about signaling growth, but are they truly growing? Wouldn't the more obvious path be to take the calculated legal risk to solve a real problem and potentially achieve genuine growth? I don't know; I'm not in leadership. I just had a worm's-eye view of the machine.# Grassroots Agility, Stomped by ApathyLet's say you came from an agile background and you even believe it. Because you've seen it solve very obvious communication issues that you see arise in large organizations. You've experienced it firsthand, you know it works. You go and explain it to your manager, they say that there are organization issues and leadership is resistant to change. They don't discourage you from trying, but they kind of set the expectations that nothing will change. But, what else are you supposed to do? Nothing?So you have a meeting with your skip manager (your manager's manager) once again advocating to adopt agile processes and maybe get more stakeholder buy-in. And they give you the advice to do it locally with your team. You know, \"bottom-up\" kind of stuff.You present it to the team. They hate it. They don't want processes. They don't want collaboration or more communication. They say agile practices are dehumanizing and that we are not interchangeable cogs in the machine. A bit of a disservice towards agile processes. But they are willing to try some of the ceremonies.But literally, for any reason whatsoever, they cancel meetings, like retrospectives or stand-ups. Maybe we need more time to finish a feature, or maybe it's a holiday, or we get reorged. And we never start up the meeting again, at least until I ask for it. Followed by it once again being canceled at the drop of a hat. And no one cares. They don't see the value in it. And to be honest, the ceremonies are toothless because we don't discuss actual problems, we don't discuss work progress to reduce knowledge silos, and action items are never done and are also usually not meaningful anyway.The reason people don't see the value of agile processes is not that it's not a good framework to address communication gaps, but because just doing the ceremonies without the communication makes them pointless. There is value in the ceremonies if they're being used to address the problems. But actively ignoring the problems, even with ceremonies, means we're now just wasting people's time.# Bottom-Up, Top-Down, and Going NowhereIf there is a bottom-up culture at Google, it is self sabotaging. There is so much momentum for the status quo that actual process change is near impossible. The only change that appears to work is a top-down mandate, which they try every year with constant reorgs and get the same results.# There is No Team in ISo, coming from an agile background (I know I sound like I'm in a cult, with how much I bring it up, but bear with me), I've come to the understanding that I as an individual do not necessarily matter. It's about putting aside ego and working together on a larger goal. This also comes with a nice benefit of distributing responsibility, and reducing burn out.That's pretty damn *ungoogley*. At Google, they're rugged cowboys. They pull themselves up by the bootstrap and don't care about your collaboration. You need to own everything. Your work, your feature, your project, your process, your career. No one is here to help you. You need to just do it yourself. Which is ironic, as [googley-ness](https://staffeng.medium.com/being-googly-62b75dd642df) should theoretically not embody it. But the performance evaluation surely doesn't emphasize trying to make teamwork work.[A bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) of 1 is seen as a positive thing. It means you've made yourself invaluable. You are the sole point of contact, and despite that sounding like a lot of annoying responsibility, it's perceived as good because you *own* it.I hate knowledge silos. I do not believe it makes anyone more valuable. I fought against the hoarding of knowledge. I'd include people into meetings to make sure I'm not the only one with context. I'd ask stupid questions and repeat talking points in meetings to make sure I understood and we were aligned. These are all considered negative things at Google. Because it is seen as wasting everyone's time in the meeting. It is better to repeat yourself with several dozen 1:1s (or I guess write yet another doc no one will read) than it is to talk it over in a group and make sure there is no ambiguity.It could just be me though. But it sure felt like it, when my manager said I was *\"leaning on others too much.\"* How else am I supposed to read that?I've never seen such an environment that is literally so hostile to collaboration.# Performative TheaterI hate 1:1s. I think they're a waste of time. I would even argue that most 1:1s are a waste of time in every context. I'm probably being hyperbolic, as I'm sure there must be cases where 1:1s are beneficial. But I'm struggling to think of one right now.1:1s are a bottleneck to communication. And judging by how often my 1:1s were canceled with my managers, I'd have to say they don't value them either.So, I'm a huge advocate for openness and transparency. And after one reorg (I went through 5 reorgs in my 4 years at Google, and been through 7 managers, chaos is the norm) leadership was attempting to be more open and transparent and so allowed anyone to join their meetings. So, since I felt like I did not have enough context to understand their decisions, I joined those meetings.When they asked if everyone had context on a doc, I was the only person to raise my hand and said I did not. I guess this was a sin to acknowledge my own ignorance, because it turns out after the next meetings I was removed from the subsequent meetings. I asked my manager if I could be brought back to gain more context, and he told me I had enough context to do my job. While probably true, I had a suspicion that my work was not very high priority. Maybe we should work on something else. Anyway, this taught me that it's all optics. I think my manager wanted to control the narrative. If he wasn't there to be a middle man, what is his job? Like, seriously, what *is* his job? I still don't understand what value he brought.# Tech Debt ForeverTo say Google's code base is complex is an understatement. Not only is it complicated, it's also a mess. Not only is it a mess, but it's also poorly documented. And not only that, but it actively fights you as you make changes and try to understand it.Cryptic compile errors. Cryptic build errors. Cryptic run time errors. And just when you think you've finally got it working. There are blockers on merging the code because of invisible linting errors you didn't know you were violating. Or there is some weird test case that broke, but only after 3 hours of running tests in the CI pipeline. Or maybe, you just want to delete some code, but it turns out that the code you're trying to delete has a different release schedule, so it cannot be deleted with other code. And the other code is dependent on the first bit of code that you cannot delete being deleted. The code is constantly fighting you. And maybe if we could discuss these issues in a group, we could understand the problems quicker or come up with strategies to mitigate them...but it turns out talking about how much it sucks to write code is frowned upon. So you just need to keep it to yourself. And I'm left wondering, *am I the problem?* Is my career a lie? Do I have imposter syndrome if I don't actually know what I'm doing? It makes you question everything.So I talked with my director (the skip’s manager) about my challenges. And I was candid about it. And he said, \"It sounds like you need mentorship.\" And I said, that's exactly what I need. And he said he'd help get me some. I messaged him every week for a few months. He offloaded this responsibility to my manager, who naturally, did nothing. By the time I left, I made the request 8 months prior. I was clearly not getting the mentorship I asked for. My manager's *wonderful* feedback was, \"maybe you should find your own mentorship.\" And it does make me wonder, \"what is *your* job if it is not to help me do *my* job better?\" Anyway, I also was unable to find mentorship on my own. And it does make me wonder, does anyone truly understand the beast that is Google's complex internally built tech stack with poor documentation? Even the internal AI that is usually pretty good at explaining some of the code, will just straight-up hallucinate how the code works and then it becomes very hard to understand. The AI will tell you a very convincing lie, but you won't know it's a hallucination or how to possibly fix it, because the documentation is poor and the only way to learn how it really works is to reverse-engineer it by performing code archaeology.# I'm outSo I left Google. It was amicable. This was, of course, also only my personal experience in my particular organization. I've been told different parts of the org and different teams are said to have different cultures. Heck, even some people might even thrive in the culture I described. But it's not for me.They gave me severance, which was honestly extremely nice. I tried so hard to bring cultural change to Google, but there is no willingness to change. Honestly, with the amount of money they're printing with ads and search, there is no pressure for them to make any changes.There is a clear cultural mismatch between what I value and what Google values. Even if Google pays lip service that they value the same things I value, their actions clearly show they do not. And so, I am honestly happy to be free from them and given the time to look for a place that values what I want.I used to believe I was *a mercenary for hire to the highest bidder*. But you know what? Apparently, within reason. I just want to work, collaborate, and iterate on software. Is that asking for too much? The one thing I can take away from my time at Google is that I now have a clearer understanding of what I'm looking for in my next step.",

My point is I don't care what you have to say. Anyone who has said anything about AI with confidence in the last 4 years has been talking out their ass. Fuck those people. They are liars and charlatans. None are to be trusted.That includes me.# Doing your uni work for youI've been using ChatGPT since it came out. My initial reaction (like many others) was, \"Oh shit, in 5 years I'm out of a job\".Don't get me wrong - AI is going to be transformative. However, LLM's aren't it. Can they do university assignments? Sure. But what's a uni assignment? A pre-canned solution, designed to make students consider critical aspects of the trade. You're not breaking new ground with a uni assignment. They're all the same. Templates of the same core concepts, **university assignments are designed to help you learn to learn**.# Microsoft replaced developers with AIMicrosoft and many other companies have vaguely stated that, due to AI, they are laying off X amount of workers. Note the language. **They never say they are replacing X amount of developers with a proven AI solution**. This is essentially legal acrobatics to make investors believe that they are on the cutting edge of the hype train. No actually skilled developers have been replaced by AI - At least not directly. Let me clarify a little.AI is a perfect excuse for layoffs. It sounds modern. It sounds high tech. It gets the investors going! Functionally, however, these jobs still all need to be done by humans. Here, let me give you an example:[The other day, someone noticed something hilarious](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1krttqo/my_new_hobby_watching_ai_slowly_drive_microsoft/) \\- AI is actually driving the engineers at Microsoft insane. Not because it's this fantastic replacement for software developers - but rather because a simple PR which would, pre-AI, have taken an hour or two, is now taking in some cases days or even weeks.# \"I outperform classically trained SWE's thanks to AI\"Once the world had access to Google, suddenly millions of people thought five minutes mashing their keyboards was equivalent to an 8 year medical degree. Doctors complained and complained and complained, and we laughed, because why would they care? It's only a bunch of idiots right? Well now we get to experience what doctors experienced. The software equivalent of taking a WebMD page and thinking you now understand heart surgery.**Here's a quick way to shut overconfident laymen down on this topic:**Show. Us. The. Code.Show us the final product.Sanitize it, and show us the end product that is apparently so superior to actual knowledge-based workers who have spent decades perfecting their craft, to the point where they are essentially artists. AI is incapable of this.None of them ever show the code. Or, when they actually DO show the code, we get to see what a shitshow it actually is. This is fast becoming a subgenre of schadenfreude for experieced developers.* The number of posts from people who's project has suddenly scaled to the point where it has more than a couple of basic files, in an absolute panick because suddenly ChatGPT can't reliably do everything for them, is only going to increase.* The number of credit card and personal data like SSN's leaked onto the internet is going to balloon.* \"Who needs SSL anyway\" is something I've never seen uttered so commonly in tech spaces on the internet. This is not a coincidence.# DecayLook, it's not going to be overnight. Enterprise software can coast for a long time. But I guarantee, over the next 10 years, we are going to see enshittification 10x anything prior experienced. Companies who confidently laid off 80% of their development teams will scramble to fix their products as customers hemorrhage due to simple shit, since if AI doesn't know what to do with something, it simply repeats the same 3-5 solutions back at you again and again even when presented with new evidence.Klarna were trailblazers in adopting AI as a replacement for skilled developers. They made very public statements about how much they saved. [Not even half a year later they were clawing back profits lost due to the fact that their dumbass executives really thought glorified chatbots could replace engineering-level talent](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1ku8qo9/klarnas_ai_replaced_700_workers_now_the_fintech/). **We will see many, many more examples like this**.# But, executive X said Y about AI - and he RUNS a tech company!Executives are salespeople, get a fucking grip. Even Elon Musk, the self proclaimed \"engineer businessman\", barely understands basic technology. Seriously, stop taking people who stand to make millions off of their sales at face value when they say things.I have no idea when we collectively decided that being a CEO suddenly made you qualified to speak on any topic other than increasing shareholder value but that shit is fucking stupid and needs to stop.If you think someone who spends 70% of their time in shareholder meetings has any idea what the fuck they're talking about when they get into technical details you're being sold a bridge. You know who knows what they're talking about? People who actually understand the subject matter. Notice they are rarely the same ones selling you fantastic sci-fi solutions? I wonder why that is.# What about the interns? The juniors? The job market? What will happen???Yeah man shit's fucked. We're in for a wild ride and I anticipate a serious skills shortage at some point in the future as more Klarna-like scenarios play out.The flipside is, we are hitting record levels of CS grads, so at least there's ample supply of soft, pudgy little autistic fucks who can be manipulated into doing 16 hour shifts with no stock options for 10 years straight. If you got offended by that I've got a job offer for you.# Fin - The Dotcom CrashLook I'm not saying AI isn't shaping the industry. It's fucking disruptive, it's improved productivity, it's changed the way we develop software.**But none of the outlandish promises over the last 4 years have come true**.Software engineers are often painted as being the new troglodytes. Stubbornly against AI since it will take their job. Fuelled by pride and fear alone. Let me tell you, that is not the case. I'd love nothing more than to stop writing fucking code and start farming goats.If you think SWE's haven't been actively trying to automate their entire jobs for the last 40 years you simply don't know the tech industry. All we fucking want is to automate away our jobs. Yet, we are still here.The gap between where AI currently sits, and where it needs to be to achieve what the salespeople of our generation are boldly claiming, is far greater than the non-technical \"tech\" journalists would have you believe.People tout statements from Sam Altman as gospel, showing their complete lack of situational awareness. The man selling shoes tells you your shoes aren't good enough. *Quelle fucking surprise*.Look, it's going to be tough. People will lose jobs. People will become homeless.But at least we have automatic kiosks at McDonalds.,",

Last year, I left my company after being presented with scenarios that went against my ethics and being told there would never be room for growth for me again.So, I have been applying to 100s of jobs, have had probably 20 interviews at least, but a recent interview really brought up a question for me. This interview required a 4 hour coding assessment. It was sent to the final 15 candidates. That's 4 hours of wasted time for 14 people. Why is the industry OK with wasting 56 hours of people's time like this? Why isn't there at least some sort of payment for all those hours?I understand coding assessments are common place, but I knew going in it was very unlikely those 4 hours would actually get me the job. A week later, and wouldn't you know it, I was right and was passed on. Just curious what causes this to be fine for everyone?",

        "content": "For anyone looking at my Reddit post history, it would be easy to notice that I have been struggling to land a new job in this tough market.As a completely self-taught backend engineer, without a university degree nor boot camp, rather just a love for technologies and programming from a young age, and a few years of experience in a very small non-profit organization, the market has not been easy on me at all. During my job hunting journey, I have applied for more than 800 jobs, conducted more than 70 interviews, and was a finalist in the hiring process about 10 times. Yet regardless of that, there was always a candidate more favorable than me which got chosen, until this exact day.Today I have received an email which was quite unexpected. I have been offered a full-time remote position as a junior software engineer in an international mid-sized company, with big customer base and highly distributed systems. The offer I received is realistic and slightly above average for my years of experience and the consideration it's a fully remote position, therefore I have gladly signed it and accepted it.The agenda of my post is first and foremost spreading some positivity and hope in this Subreddit in these tough market conditions, because I feel like many people can use it here as a motivation to keep trying. Secondly, I would like to celebrate this moment here in this Subreddit and post about the good times, the same as I did when I posted about the bad times.I wish everyone out there the best of luck in their job hunting journey, and as I said I want to shed some light and spread positivity proving that it is possible to get offers with the right skills, hard work, consistency, and a bit of luck.Good luck everyone!",

        "content": "Location: ON, Canada job is Canada remote. Just had an interview with HR about a senior devops python engineer position. This is interview 3 after a video interview, technical test and HR casually drops that it's a being your own device company. Like are you guys for real? You go through the hassle of looking for a senior engineer and you can't get them a dedicated laptop separate from their own personal life not to mention the safety of your IP? I find that shocking and disrespectful. I've been applying for jobs for months and I would rather continue my freelance practice than be subjected to the equivalent of a sweatshop. Needless to say I just dead face told her I'm not going to waste your time after she mentioned this is company policy. Rant over. Edit : as some of you noted I didn't get an offer, apologies about the unclear titleEdit 2: i will expand on this in a few hrs cause I've written most of my comments with a 6m old trying to eat my phone Edit 3: OK now that I can sit on my PC, let me just explain a few things that have caused some confusion in the comments. I'm mostly a python/ML/AI freelancer who wants to get into a full time position. I've worked with many big names in this industry and generally take every interview that I'm given whether it is a small company or not. This particular company is based in Mississauga, ON and has about 30 employees and is in the information systems for transport/logistics. It has about 2.1 stars on Glassdoor in their recent reviews and honestly, I wasn't expecting too much from the job but was giving them the opportunity to show themselves for who they are. I don't really care too much about buying my own laptop per se. It's about how they approach onboarding new employees. I've worked in companies where I was thrown into legacy systems from the first day and I can see the signs written on the wall from a mile away, which is why I decided that I shouldn't proceed. For those of you who say that I'm spoiled and entitled. Bruh, I literally make less than average salary working as a freelancer, all of this while paying 100% more the taxes for CCP of what full time employees pay while having to do my own accounting. In general I do not prefer working freelance but I would rather have the ability to say no than to work on things that will make my life utterly miserable which is why I refer to this kind of environment as a \"sweatshop\".",

Got rejected the next day because the hiring manager was worried that I was willing to leave my current role in such a short amount of time. I get that they’re worried I might jump ship after joining, but seems wack when they’re the one who reached out? What do they expect me to do, respectfully decline the phone call because I just started a new role? What’s the alternative? Don’t mention I just started a new role and what, claim I’m still at my old company? Or claim that I’m unemployed? How do you think I should handle recruiter calls and interviews going forward?",

These types of firing often come with less or no severance than if you were laid off. Also, often times no healthcare coverage paid for that a layoff would provide.But the biggest thing is it comes with you being labelled a \"bad worker\" in the press, which other hiring managers will see. Even though it was just a way to lay you off in secret. If you were not a bad performer, then this is defamation of character and is affecting you financially. Both from losing benefits you would receive from a normal layoff, as well as the potential financial pain that comes from not being hired due to being falsely labeled a \"poor performer\".It is time employees start suing these companies. Most people at these companies can afford to sue as well given their salaries. What do others think?",

I don't really have anything to put on my resume. I don't even understand what is considered a \"reasonable\" project. I've known people growing up who were bonkers good at programming, like building up a basic 3D engine from scratch as a teenager. Is that where you should be? I've been told that no internships is essentially auto reject where I'm at.I'm glad I didn't pay anything for my degree but it's really weird having my family be proud of me realizing that I'm probably just going to keep working the same shitty retail job forever. I don't have particularly high salary expectations either, for the Bay Area I'd settle for anything at or above $70,000 lol...I've been looking at different careers my whole last semester and just considered my CS degree as \"personal enrichment\" and waffled through it knowing there weren't really any employment opportunities for the average person but it's weird thinking about how you're completely soft locked out of the industry if you don't do everything right. If I wanted that I would have gone into finance or something.Whatever.",

        "content": "I’ve been doing full stack dev for 7 years. Nothing flashy, just solid, real-world experience: frontend, backend, a bit of devops. The kind of stuff that keeps products running. No flashy startups or MAANG names on my resume. Just regular jobs at regular companies.While I am still currently employed, I wanted to increase my income due to rising expenses and no appraisal since last 2 years, so I started looking for a switch. Over the past 3 months, I’ve applied to hundreds of jobs ( I know it's not enough ). I’ve rewritten my resume, practiced for interviews, tried reaching out recruiters on linkedin, tried to get some freelance work. Still, nothing worked out, the responses are either ghosting or rejections, or nothing at all.While I've built some solid products in my current company, I have no idea how to use it to stand out. I never got the time to work on any side projects which I can showcase. I know for the matter of fact and have accepted it that my resume will never stand out amongst 100s if not 1000s of applications on every job post.I’m not the type to post on X or LinkedIn every day to build a personal brand ( I did started a youtube channel though). I don’t have what it takes to contribute to open source just to maybe get noticed ( I know open source contribution is not meant to seen as a way to get job, but it is what it is). I just wanted to quietly do good work, but that doesn’t seem to count for much anymore.I feel like I’m shouting into the void. I used to love building things, but now it just feels like I’m stuck. No one wants experience unless it’s from a specific company or school maybe.I’m seriously wondering if it’s time to walk away, and leave tech entirely. I don’t even know what I’d do instead, and that scares me.Has anyone been through this? Which field do you think I can pivot into as a tech guy, so that I can earn almost similar and more in the longer run ?p.s: I took help of gpt to write this post, to express what I am actually feeling.",

        "author": "Organic-Pipe-8139",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I just did another mock interview with another Staff Engineer from Open AI I’d argue this is the near perfect solution for Design K Leaderboard for Facebook comments or videos. To be honest the design was so impressive, I was struggling to keep up.Here is the full video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhyzIBVEIjo&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhyzIBVEIjo&)So this is exactly how a person of this caliber nailed the interview step by step:What I really liked is how he handled the ambiguity of the problem. He kept asking clarifying questions, gradually narrowing down what exactly the system needed to do. He started by defining the scope, deciding to track trending content globally and focusing mainly on real user reactions (ignoring edge cases like bot farms). He emphasized the need for real-time or near real-time updates, especially important when people refresh their pages a lot.He moved on to data modeling and decided to track each event (like user reactions) with details like user ID, post ID, reaction type, and timestamp (this one was critical as he spent an incredible amount of time later on discussing how bad clocks really are in a distributed system). Importantly, each user only has one reaction per post at any time, which simplifies some of the complexity.Then he dove into the scaling challenges. He chose a regional approach for data handling, using local timestamps for consistency within each region, and came up with this clever \"hot/cold\" key strategy. Basically, popular (\"hot\") posts update almost instantly, while less popular (\"cold\") posts don't need frequent updates. Regions share their top posts periodically to keep the global leaderboard updated.Interviewee didn't tie himself down to a specific database or any tools in general. Unlike mid level engineers, he actually used zero tools at all and just kept the interview on the conceptual level. He even mentioned a custom solution might be better than something traditional, highlighting using write-ahead logs and processing events separately from aggregating them. I bet this might be because he spent most of his career at Google (Youtube & Spanner) as well as Meta and OpenAI where tools are mostly proprietary and made in house.He implicitly acknowledged the CAP theorem, but explained that real systems don’t work like research papers referring to CRDB aka CockroachDB, which claims to be both available & consistent. Even when it “feels like” consistency is important, you almost always want to prioritize availability and default eventual consistency rather than absolute consistency. This practical decision means the system stays reliable even if it's not theoretically perfect.He showed how practical trade-offs matter more than absolute precision. Losing or misordering a small percentage of events is okay if it means the system stays fast and scalable.Interviewee leveraged the idea of data distribution, noting most posts have low engagement, while a few blow up. This influenced his \"hot/cold\" strategy, optimizing resources.One subtle yet powerful idea he stressed was \"monotonicity.\" By ensuring updates always move in one direction (like engagement always increasing), the system becomes much simpler to reconcile and scale.Finally, his incremental approach to design really stood out. He started broad, refined step by step, and wasn't afraid to revisit decisions. Overall, it's one of the best example of how real-world system design works and how a true staff engineer really behaves like. Managing complexity and making smart trade-offs rather than trying to build a theoretically perfect system. I definitely learned a ton from this one as an interviewer, but curious to hear what you all might think. TL;DR\\- Ask questions, don't make assumptions, don't use tools mindlessly, and use the experience you got on the job to impress the interviewer on the design.",

The project that my team was pushed to deliver too quickly is getting delivered this week and I’ve been on PTO for the past 2 weeks after telling them I’m tired of working every weekend. I think when I come back I’ll continue to have to work many weekends and nights and don’t want to keep the company a chance.

If they don’t do it I may just quit if I continue to have to work long hours. Will it be possible for me to re enter the industry after only 1 YoE? I should also mention I have a 2.5 GPA so new grad applications that ask GPA won’t work. I’m thinking after I leave I’ll spend some time traveling and trying other non traditional careers to try and leave the industry but know it likely won’t work out.

It's a core component of system design interviews, and LinkedIn bios are quick to mention they worked on systems with 10mil DAU, MAU etc. Some advice I see on what makes an impressive personal project disregard the project itself but rather focus on the number of actual users and how they scaled when their user base exploded. Is this just a big tech thing? Or are people who have handled scale actually more skilled? Especially since many companies outside of big tech don't have scalability as their main problem.",

        "content": "Preface: I am still a junior dev in terms of YoE and would consider myself an average-level dev, in that I can read code, debug, navigate through the codebase, figure out what questions to ask. But I wouldn't be able to implement something from scratch with ambiguous to no information or even rewrite or refactor a module.OK. So, i've been browsing this sub for maybe 3 years? and I would sometimes read opinons here or other subs just how easy their software dev job is and that the challenging part is just passing the interview..And I feel like that is a lie.. obviously jobs differ from company to company, project to project etc.. In my case I was lucky enough to deal with good people, managers, business analysts, stuff people would complain about but if there is something I would complain is the work itself.There were moments where I would ask myself wtf am I doing working as a developer because some tasks just made me feel like I was staring at a wall, I had no idea how to approach this issue, I would have an idea but going deeper I would eventually get lost and forget why I went down the path the first place.Right now i'm on a new project which is basically rewrite from scratch of an older project that was done in a couple of years and they want some core functionality implemented in a matter of months..You might think, oh that doesn't sound so bad.. the logic is already there. Well imagine that programming paradigm changed so from functional to OOP and that you need to integrate 3rd party vendors as well.Oh yeah I forgot, nobody really talks about how most projects IRL deviate in some way from the online tutorials you're used to, that medium article you though is relevant to your problem? yeah nah. How about that StackOverflow answer? how inconvenient it can't be applied to that one specific use-case you're dealing with.Right now, i'm questiong myself and my ability to continue a career in this industry, I invested way too much time learning and investing time in another degree will be quite a setback in terms of career growth as well as age. And given the current state of the industry I am counting my blessings but damn can it be challenging.",

        "content": "Seeking some advice… In March 2023, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science from a UC in Southern California after returning to school following a break in 2019. While in college, I completed an internship at a local tech company doing software engineering and also picked up some freelance web development work.After graduation, I spent about five months preparing for technical interviews and applying for jobs. Unfortunately, I drained my limited savings during that time and didn’t land any offers. I eventually stepped away from the job search, partly due to frustration and loss of professional motivation and because I really needed money quickly.Since then, I’ve been working at an organics grocery store (the rain forest one) for the past year and eight months. I currently make $18.67 per hour, working 30 to 35 hours a week. I’ve recently been offered a leadership-track role that would bump my pay to around $21.50 per hour with a 40-hour workweek. Still, I’m not happy with my financial situation or this job.Despite working in retail, I continue to code and try to learn software engineering topics on my days off or when I have the energy after work. That said, it has been difficult to maintain momentum, and I feel like I’ve lost touch with many of the CS fundamentals needed in the field.Part of me regrets not going all in on the job search earlier and settling for a grocery store job. Another part of me is grateful for the soft skills I’ve developed in the meantime.Now, I want to pivot back into tech and become a software engineer. At this point, I’d take almost any role in the field just to gain experience and start building a network. I know the job hunt will require time, discipline, and financial commitment. Preparing through LeetCode, system design, and personal projects is going to be time consuming, but it’s necessary. I am rusty on a lot topics. That said, reading about the current job market has me feeling anxious.I’m at a crossroads and feel completely lost. My options are:1. **Stay in my current role**, working 30–35 hours per week. Continue saving and use my days off or evenings to focus on technical prep (LeetCode and NeetCode). Once I feel ready, start applying.2. **Accept the leadership position**, work full-time for six months, and save aggressively. This will net me roughly $20,000 in savings considering holiday pay and OT. After that, step back to part-time (I’m able to work from 4 to 24 hours a week) and use my savings to support myself while focusing full-time on interview prep and project work. I know I made mistakes and as a result I feel so behind on EVERYTHING. Am I about to make another mistake?",

They had a multiple choice question that was the typical “what does the following code output?” Except it was a convoluted mess of METACLASSES and DECORATORS! Never thought I would see those on a test. Then the coding question was at least at the level of LC Medium. Anagram type question with multiple arrays. Had to be done efficiently. I kept getting time limit exceeded. And here’s the part that makes me say that Adaface specifically is the worst. They were giving me “advice” to try to put print statements in my code to debug. So I did, ran the tests again… zero visible output. There was no separate console, I clicked around everywhere, either it was hidden somewhere or not explained in the demo but I was out of luck. Couldn’t see what I printed anywhere. Eventually I had to give up and there’s no way I’m getting an interview from this.Good luck out there guys.",

        "content": "I was reflecting on [u/SnooTangerines9703](https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooTangerines9703/)'s [post on building startups](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kq8hq3/fk_it_lets_build_startups/). It's something that’s been on my mind for a while. I used to think it was too tedious or far-fetched, but lately, desperation and a deep hunger to make something real have completely overridden that imposter syndrome I carried. Reading their post was like hearing my own thoughts said out loud made me hyperfocus on it.So here’s what I’m proposing (and may even build myself if I get enough support behind me):**One group. One community.** Let’s stop being divided and conquered in a dog-eat-dog grind. Let’s build *together*. Learn together. Grow together.The idea is to start a community, on Slack, WhatsApp, Discord, Reddit, wherever there's traction where anyone who's serious about learning and building can join. No gatekeeping, just mutual accountability.**How it would work:*** Each member logs their learning journey with a start and end date, plus their chosen path (e.g. [`MOOC.fi`](http://MOOC.fi) `Java => Java Internship (3 months) & Java II (3 months)`, `Harvard CS50 => (3 months) => w: Web Dev Internship, ai: AI Internship`, etc.).* Proof of completion is required (certs, GitHub commits, demo videos). This isn’t about fluff, it’s about **real growth*** Every Thursday or Friday we could have a community event like DSA Thursday/Friday* After internship, or if you want to skip it would be **Entry-Level** (the initial commitment would be **6 to 12 months**)* Everyone begins by building a **personal project** to set a baseline and gauge their current level.* If possible, everyone at this stage is assigned an accountability buddy, preferably one that isn't on the same team so that one person isn't doing the work of another. * After that, we begin and transition into **collaborative projects** run in an agile team format. Everyone keeps their main role they want and rotates any unused/unsure roles: designer, dev, PM, tester, to build real-world skills.# The exposure strategy:Once a project is finished, we create a **video breakdown** and post it on LinkedIn, X (Twitter), YouTube, or wherever else makes sense. Each person is credited for their work and gets the exposure they deserve.Let’s be real: Most of us are **introverts**. Some of us are **highly skilled**. And many of us are **still unemployed**, even while being more capable than folks earning six figures.This isn't just about skill, it's about being **seen**. We need a system that clears the dust off our shine. Many of us are grasping at straws. **Maybe this is what we actually need: real experience, real proof, and real support.**# Long-term vision:* After 6+ months, or if your **personal project** stands out, you transition into a **junior developer role** within the group.* You start to take on leadership responsibilities and begin developing those soft skills like communication, initiative, and mentoring.* By then, or even earlier, you should be ready for a paid role. If not, you’ll still have a strong portfolio, exposure, and momentum to start freelancing or even launch your own thing.# What a full journey might look like (if starting from zero):1. **Internship Phase (Learning Phase):** * Java I & II (MOOC.fi), or Full-Stack, or Python, or 2x+ CS50 courses, etc. * \\~6 months total (self-paced) * Initial project (\\~1 month) * Career development + feedback2. **Entry-Level Phase** * 3 to 12 projects built with team * Weekly GitHub updates, project demos, and social proof * Lasts 6 to 12 months3. **Junior Phase** * \\~6+ months of group work and possible freelancing * Exposure, mentorship, and leadership opportunitiesIn total, you’d have **about 2 years of experience**, real-world projects, team collaboration skills, leadership development, and consistent exposure. With that kind of portfolio and growth, **you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who wouldn’t hire you**.I may start this, but I obviously can’t do it alone. If you’re interested, or if you have suggestions to improve the idea, **drop a comment or DM me**. Please share this with anyone you think may benefit from this style of rigor, discipline and community.Let's stop moping and wallowing away our best years in self pity.Let’s stop waiting for experience and start **building it**.",

I started to get questions similar to the title as early as November in my job search... now in May with close to 10 months of unemployment I pretty much always get this question. and I feel like the honest answer is not getting a good response.The honest answer is I got laid off when my daughter was only 6 months old and I decided to lean into enjoying being a father... I ramped up applications closer to the end of January when companies had their new budgets for the year and I might see an improvement in my job search. Ive started a sales job about a month ago because $$ keeps the house. So my question is what's a good BS response to this question that people might like in interviews?This is something I feel tempted to rant about but what am I to do... I knew this industry made the demand that you keep up with learning modern practices and things like that but it's easy to feel bitter about it... To look at your toddler thinking about how much longer things can continue as they are before you lose the roof to then taking a phone interview where they ask in fewer words \"What work have you done to keep your skills fresh for no money?\"... I dunno I feel like the time sink the job search is in itself is enough.",

I never saw a researcher get their work out to production early on in my career, and now it seems like ops is an expectation of the ML / researcher role. part of the reason thats possible is how good the tooling is now. not everything has to be rewritten to c, or created from scratch in a matrix compatible arrangement of html + css + vanilla js.I havent worked with young devs since 2018. so I guess I am wondering, what kinds of work are jr developers being expected to do today? is there still a lot of the same kind of work I started out doing or is it different? appreciate any insights people might offer.",

I’m about 9 months into my first role, and while things have improved a bit, I’m still really struggling and could use some career advice.So heres a bit about my background. I started in tech through a conversion Master’s and landed a graduate role in a Big 4 consultancy. The first few months were rough. I was getting minimal work, no mentorship, and I felt totally lost. I nearly quit, but after speaking to management, I was paired with a senior dev and shifted to frontend (React), which I’m more comfortable with.My problem is that I’m still not learning like I want to. I lean too heavily on ChatGPT and feel like I don’t really understand what I’m doing. I feel stuck and like I’m not becoming a better software engineer. I’m constantly being rejected from even other graduate level dev jobs, and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I have completed a couple of interviews, one company was kind of a dream role which I do think I was pretty unqualified for but I did get to the final stage of the process. I actually pulled out of another interview process because I realised during the first interview that this wasn’t the right job for me.So here’s what I’m doing to try to learn and get better. I have an active github with personal projects, and a publicly available CV website. I attempt most leetcode daily challenges, and complete online udemy courses. I also attend local tech meetups and listen to tech podcasts to expand my knowledge.So these are my questions:* *How do I get better as a software engineer when I feel like I’m just guessing or relying on AI?** *What do other junior devs do to actually learn rather than just getting by?** *Why do I keep getting rejected from other jobs/how can I make myself stand out?*Any advice, resources or honest stories from other devs would really help.

Every company I interviewed with asks completely different questios, one is super focused on networking, other is on multithreading, third is on kubernetes, etc... I feel like I don't deserve to be a senior dev as I just fail all my technicals and once I finally pass it feels like sheer luck.How many technicals do you failed before landing an offer?",

I’m just not happy living in my small hometown and would like to move to a more urban area, and am considering looking for something else. The problem is that with my internship experience I’m only at 8ish months total experience.Everywhere I read says “just work there for 2 years and leave” but another year+ in my hometown just seems like such a long time when I feel like I’m somewhat wasting my life where I’m at right now.Does anybody have any advice as to 1. how feasible it is the leave before the 1-2 year mark, and if it will hurt in the long run. And also 2. Things I can do to improve my resume and skills to get the attention of more prestigious and higher paying companiesThanks in advance",

I'm an Argentinean Mid-level Mobile Developer, specializing in native Android, but I’ve also worked quite a bit with React Native.I got offered a job as an AI Engineer thanks to a friend who works there, but it would be as a Junior. The thing is:1. They pay less2. It’s for a US-based startup , and there aren’t many real benefits3. It’s full-time (not contractor)4. It’s kind of weird because the technical interview is basically a classic FullStack mini-project, nothing AI-related… it seems like the position is more oriented towards FullStack work and consuming LLMs. My friend told me he’s now learning TensorFlow/PyTorch (which is actually what interests me the most, same as Architecture modeling), but apparently he doesn’t work strictly with that.----------------------------------------I’ve been looking for Senior Mobile jobs in my stack for the past 6 months — they obviously pay more and have better benefits (though I haven't been lucky, I always make it to the 3rd interview only).---My questions are:1- What future do you see for Mobile? With AI and the current market, I’m seeing fewer open roles (in LATAM more than anything). Do you think it makes sense to pivot to something with more demand? Or should I double down and specialize in Mobile?2- Do you think it’s worth switching to AI Engineering? What future do you see in working with TensorFlow/PyTorch? Or other AI branches ?P.S. According to a professor I had in college (who’s head of the AI department at a major multinational Spanish company), he said that regardless of what you choose, the future trend is to become an Architect and be an expert in the big picture.",

Feels like a 30 IQ debuff at the very least.It’s honestly like language processing and logical reasoning exist on separate threads, in different languages in my brain. So not only do I have to interrupt the logic thread which is necessary for a coherent, correct solution, I also need to translate it into English language to be presentable and make sense, on the fly. But also keep enough reference of the logic to have something to return to once I explain a point. The result is both threads are interrupted frequently and produce incoherent responses. On top of the pressure of being watched and judged for it.That’s why I can program a solution in whole, then I can explain it well after it’s all done. Each thread can complete one by one without loss of context mid execution.Does anyone have any advice? Ideally if you used to be bad at this, but got significantly better? Is it just a matter of more exposure? This feels insurmountable since I’ve always been this way. Top of math class, but teacher asks me to walk through a solution on the whiteboard?

What jobs can I find or what can I do over the summer that would be helpful to finding a job / look good on a resume?I have a 3.7 GPA at UofM, but my experience is really only projects from upper level classes and a remote job at an AI company (not an internship, i was just reading ai outputs all day and grading it). These are what I have on my resume, and I fear this isn't enough in todays job market.",

        "content": "Excuse me if I come across as whining, immature and/or petty. My thoughts are all over the place. I have been working for a large bank for nearly 4.5+ years up until now, ever since I graduated from college in May 2020. I was working in a Teradata Dev role nearly 4 years and internally transitioned to on Observability Engineering role about 2 months ago. I primarily accepted the opportunity to switch internally because it was offering a fat pay raise in my base comp, and I didn’t want to pigeonhole myself in one tech stack and get chance to learn new skills in the observability world and I also thought this role would be less red tape as my previous role.But now 2ish months into my current role, I can see similar patterns of corporate BS from my prior role: shaky communication with scrum masters, shitty documentation, lack of documentation for critical initiatives, a bit of unclear direction in certain tasks I’m working on, and being thrown into tasks without additional support, slow traction and approval for in POCs which my manager said would be in the pipelines, SREs trying to dump their work on Engineering side. Amidst this, I feel like I’m kinda forced and forcing myself to just maintain the optics of seeming like I’m doing work(proposing new initiatives, exploring self initiated POCs to bring to table, partaking in meetings, asking questions, engaging in code reviews/pull request reviews and trying to do the work assigned me to even if it entails some level of handholding). My team manager and tech leads who interviewed me , I clearly told them I don’t have experience in this stack being used in this role , and despite that they still offered the position and for the most part I’d say I’m pretty active in ramping up quickly and continuing to learn the tech stack used in this role. But right now my scrum master is kinda gate keeping some of the deliverables in our engineering team and I feel he’s sorta pushing tasks to me which he wants to be prioritized more heavily , but those certain tasks they’re kinda outta my reach and there’s very limited internal support to lean onto and shadow along side with them. All in all, I really came excited into this new role to really be plugged in to high impact work, with little to no corporate BS, red tape , crystal clear communication, and tasks where new onboarded folks can gradually pick up and ramp . But right now I feel like I’m thrown into a deep end and barely floating and treading water. I feel like even though I’ve delivered some tasks and my tech leads are supportive, my scrum master assigns certain in which there’s no meaningful documentation on nor internal support and I can’t seem to move much forward without butting heads into him (in a neutral manner)Overall what I’m trying to convey is , I feel like shit and I think I’m going to be perceived as a phony , regardless of how proactively I’m putting effort in.This is really taxing and taking a toll on my confidence in how I can deliver in a highly regulated ass environment like banking. Id really like to jump ship by next 4ish-6ish months by the end of the year and would love to work outside a banking environment , preferably a startup or industry outside of banking altogether.I need help fam. Idk what I just spilled. For those of whom were in similar situation or circumstances as me, what did you do ? Did you move out to a different industry altogether or a startup ? Is it possible to avoid these in a startup",

        "content": "I have reached 2yoe working on a hardware focused company as a software developer. My primary language is C/C++ and some python for data analysis. At the time of performance reviews and promotions I was at 1yr 6mos so was not selected to the next level. I was then talking with my fiance and it seems like most jobs I see available are frontend/backend using Javascript, react, Django, etc. I do enjoy the work I do and the product I work on as the code is used on hardware which is really neat and fulfilling. My role is safe since it is a smaller company but if I ever want to switch paths I think it will be difficult. For example if companies require 2+yoe on web development or database knowledge, I will not have any experience on my resume to showcase that.I guess my question is, would it be a good idea to brush up on my full stack and leetcode to round out my experience? Or what other jobs require C/C++ development? Would this be robotics and other hardware focused companies? I dont mind RTO so not limited to remote only or anything although that's the preference.",
