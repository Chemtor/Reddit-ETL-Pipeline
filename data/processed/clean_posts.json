I saw multiple posts on this subreddit and elsewhere that showcased it's comparison with tools like Polars, and that people have used DuckDB for local data wrangling because of its SQL support. Point is, I wouldn't compare Postgresql to Pandas, for example, so this is confusion 1. 2. Is it another alternative to Dataframe APIs, which is just using SQL, instead of actual code? Due to numerous comparison with Polars (again), it kinda raises a question of it's possible use in ETL/ELT (maybe integrated with dbt). In my mind Polars is comparable to Pandas, PySpark, Daft, etc, but certainly not to a tool claiming to be an RDBMS.",

        "content": "Hi everyone!Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve been working on a small library that generates **column-level lineage** from SQL queries **directly in the browser**.The idea came from wanting to leverage column-level lineage **on the front-end** — for things like visualizing data flows or propagating business metadata.Now, I know there are already great tools for this, like [sqlglot](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot) or the [OpenLineage SQL parser](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/tree/main/integration/sql). But those are built for Python or Java. That means if you want to use them in a browser-based app, you either:* Stand up an API to call them, or* Run a Python runtime in the browser via something like Pyodide (which feels a bit heavy when you just want some metadata in JS :smiling_face_with_tear:)This got me thinking — there’s still a pretty big gap between **data engineering tooling** and **front-end use cases**. We’re starting to see more tools ship with WASM builds, but there’s still a lot of room to grow an ecosystem here.I’d love to hear if you’ve run into similar gaps.If you want to check it out (or see a partially “vibe-coded” demo :grinning_face_with_sweat:), here are the links:* [Repo](https://github.com/nickBes/meta-sql)* [Demo](https://nickbes.github.io/meta-sql/)**Note:** The library is still experimental and may change significantly.",

        "content": "This article and many others say that Databricks is much faster/cheaper than Snowflake. [https://medium.com/dbsql-sme-engineering/benchmarking-etl-with-the-tpc-di-snowflake-cb0a83aaad5b](https://medium.com/dbsql-sme-engineering/benchmarking-etl-with-the-tpc-di-snowflake-cb0a83aaad5b)So I am new to Databricks, and still just in the initial exploring stages. But I have been using Snowflake for quite a while now for my job. The thing I dont understand is how is Databricks faster when running a query than on Snowflake.The Scenario I am thinking is - I got lets say 10 TB of CSV data in an AWS S3 bucket., and I have no choice in the file format or partitioning. Let us say it is some kind of transaction data, and the data is stored partitioned by **DATE** (but I might be not interested in filtering based on Date, I could be interested in filtering by Product ID).1. Now on Snowflake, I know that I have to ingest the data into a Snowflake Internal Table. This converts the data into a columnar Snowflake proprietary format, which is best suited for Snowflake to read the data. Lets say I cluster the table on Date itself, resembling a similar file partition as on the S3 bucket. But I enable search optimization on the table too. 2. Now if I am to do the same thing on Databricks (Please correct me if I am wrong), Databricks doesnt create any proprietary database file format. It uses the underlying S3 bucket itself as data, and creates a table based on that. It is not modified to any database friendly version. **(Please do let me know if there is a way to convert data to a database friendly format similar to Snowflake on Databricks).**Considering that Snowflake makes everything SQL query friendly, and Databricks just has a bunch of CSV files in an S3 bucket, for the comparable size of compute on both, how can Databricks be faster than Snowflake? What magic is that? Or am I thinking about this completely wrong and using or not knowing the functionality Databricks has? In terms of the use case scenario, I am not interested in Machine learning in this context, just pure SQL execution on a large database table. I do understand Databricks is much better for ML stuff.",

        "title": "Quantum Odyssey update: now close to being a complete bible of quantum computing for data engineering",
        "author": "QuantumOdysseyGame",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey guys,I want to share with you the latest Quantum Odyssey update (I'm the creator, ama..) for the work we did since my last post (4 weeks ago), to sum up the state of the game. Thank you everyone for receiving this game so well and all your feedback has helped making it what it is today. This project grows because this community exists.In a nutshell, this is an interactive way to visualize and play with the full Hilbert space of anything that can be done in \"quantum logic\". Pretty much any quantum algorithm can be built in and visualized. The learning modules I created cover everything, the purpose of this tool is to get everyone to learn quantum by connecting the visual logic to the terminology and general linear algebra stuff.Although still in Early Access, now it should be completely bug free and everything works as it should. From now on I'll focus solely on building features requested by players.Game now teaches:1. Linear algebra - vector-matrix multiplication, complex numbers, pretty much everything about SU2 group matrices and their impact on qubits by visually seeing the quantum state vector at all times.2. Clifford group (rotations X, Z , S, Y, Hadamard), SX , T and you can see the Kronecker product for any SU2 group combinations up to 2\\^5 and their impact on any given quantum state for up to 5 qubits in Hilbert space.3. All quantum phenomena and quantum algorithms that are the result of what the math implies. Every visual generated on the screen is 1:1 to the linear algebra behind (BV, Grover, Shor..)4. Sandbox mode allows absolutely anything to be constructed using both complex numbers and polars.5. Now working on setting up some ideas for weekly competitions in-game. Would be super cool if we could have some real use cases that we can split in up to 5 qubit state compilation/ decomposition problems and serve these through tournaments.. but it might be too early lmk if you got ideas.TL;DR: 60h+ of actual content that takes this a bit beyond even what is regularly though in Quantum Information Science classes Msc level around the world (the game is used by 23 universities in EU via [https://digiq.hybridintelligence.eu/](https://digiq.hybridintelligence.eu/) ) and a ton of community made stuff. You can literally read a science paper about some quantum algorithm and port it in the game to see its Hilbert space or ask players to optimize it.Improvements in the past 4 weeks:In-game quotes now come from contemporary physicists. If you have some epic quote you'd like to add to the game (and your name, if you work in the field) for one of the puzzles do let me know. This was some super tedious work (check this patch update [https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2802710/view/539987488382386570?l=english](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2802710/view/539987488382386570?l=english) )Big one:We started working on making an offline version that is snycable to the Steam version when you have an internet connection that will be delivered in two phases:Phase 1: Asynchronous Gameplay FlowWe're introducing a system where you no longer have to necessarily wait for the server to respond with your score and XP after each puzzle. These updates will be handled asynchronously, letting you move straight to the next puzzle. This should improve the experience of players on spotty internet connections!Phase 2: Fully Offline ModeWe’re planning to support full offline play, where all progress is saved locally and synced to the server once you're back online. This means you’ll be able to enjoy the game uninterrupted, even without an internet connectionWhy the game requires an internet connection atm?Single player is just the learning part - which can only be done well by seeing how players solve things, how long they spend on tutorials and where they get stuck in game, not to mention this is an open-ended puzzle game where new solutions to old problems are discovered as time goes on. I want players to be rewarded for inventing new solutions or trying to find those already discovered, stuff that requires online and alerts that new solves were discovered. The game branches into bounty hunting (hacking other players) and community content creation/ solving/ rewards after that, currently. A lot more in the future, if things go well.We wanted offline from the start but it was practically not feasible since simply nailing down a good learning curve for quantum computing one cannot just \"guess\".",

The pipelines I build are fairly small and nothing too heavy.I’ve been given a project that’s actually very important for the business, but the standard here is still batch files and task scheduler. That’s how I’ve been told to run things. It works, but only just. The CPU on the VM is starting to brick it, but you know, that will only matter as soon as it breaks..I use Linux at home and I’m comfortable in the terminal. Not an expert of course but keen to take on a challenge. I want to containerise my work with Docker so I can keep things clean and consistent. It would also let me apply proper practices like versioning and CI/CD.If I want to use Docker properly, it really needs to be running on a Linux environment. But I know that asking for anything outside Windows will probably get some pushback, we’re on prem so I doubt they’ll approve a cloud environment. I get the vibe that running code is a bit of mythical concept to the rest of the team, so explaining dockers pros and cons will be a challenge. So is it worth trying to make the case for a Linux VM? Or do I just work around the setup I’ve got and carry on with patchy solutions? What’s the general vibe on docker/linux at other companies, it seems pretty mainstream right?I’m obviously quite new to DE, but I want to do things properly. Open to positive and negative comments, let me know if I’m being a dipshit lol",

You can load data from PDFs, transcripts, spreadsheets, databases, integrations, etc., and pull structured tables directly from it. The output is always a table you can use downstream. You can merge it, filter it, export it, perform calculations on it, whatever.The workflow has LLM jobs that are arranged like a waterfall, model-agnostic, and designed around structured output. So you can use one step with 4o-mini, or nano, or opus, etc. You can select any model, run your logic, chain it together, etc. Then you can export results back to Snowflake or just work with it in the GUI to build reports. You can schedule it to scrape the data sources and just run the new data sets. There is a RAG agent as well, I have a vectordb attached.In the gui on the left is the table and on the right, there’s a chat interface. Behind the scenes, it analyzes the table you’re looking at, figures out what kinds of Python/SQL operations could apply, and suggests them. You pick one, it builds the code, runs it, and shows you the result. (Still working on getting the python/SQL thing in the GUI, getting close)Would anyone here use something like this??? The goal is let you publish the workflows to business people so they can use it themselves without dealing with prompts.Anyhow, I am really interested in what the community thinks about something like this. I'd prefer not to state what the website is etc here, just DM me if you want to play with it. Still rough on the edges.\\*\\*\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*\\*\\* Thanks to everyone who reached out. A lot of people asked for a demo video, so I put one together. It starts with a real use case: a customer receives a weekly report that breaks down feature requests and related metrics.This is just one example. What makes this platform different is accuracy and flexibility. There are plenty of polished tools built for product teams (and to be clear this tool is not marketed as a dedicated tool for PMs). We offer the same insights, but without the fluff. Raw data goes in, and you get structured tables or written reports out. You can push results into tools like Jira or Aha, or plug them into your own dashboards, or just query data in our interface.It also supports broader use cases. Need to convert 1,000 PDFs that are dumped in a Google Drive each day into a Google Sheets and into S3 for purchasing managers? No problem.The platform supports up to 1GB of data with a built-in vector store.So at its core, it is an AI-native ETL engine built for unstructured-to-structured or vector store workflows. We are also working on a simple, center-screen chatbot that gives execs access only to what you choose to publish. Here's the youtube, follow us!

It took what I went through, and still going through, for me to post this.****So, Chris Garzon..., Lets talk about him a moment. This is a guy who couldn't give a sh!t about his students/clients. Unless, of course, they pay him a crazy amount of money. And, I found recently, he isnt as good as he says he is. There is so much I want to say here but it may incriminate some folks so I must digress. Just know, Chris is not a good person. He has a great face for his commercials and has a good mop of hair. On top of that, he uses some good taglines in his commercials. At first, his commercials targeted noobs like me. He made it seem like this was easy and they were here to help. What a crock of shit.****I started learning SQL (which I found out was free). If you have a question about something you are learning, you are asked to place the question in a slack channel that is provided to you. The question sits there until someone gets around to it which is usually the next day. A lot of the time the CSM (Client Success Manager) would tell you to \"check chatgpt\" or \"Look it up on youtube\". What? Isnt that what I paid OVER $10K for? For you to assist me? Sorry to inconvenience your day. Its hard for anyone studying to come across a question or logic that is hard to understand and just need a quick answer.** **Calls for study would happen but the instructor didnt show a few times. They have been better about that. DEA even created a discord channel and right when people were using it, they took it away. At first they were all about \"Study Buddies\". Find yourself a partner and study with them. Great, so you do that and use the discord but then they take it away. Back to square 1. Studying on my own with no one to ask questions or anything. I felt lost.** **Then, a number of months go by and we see a new add from Chris. He was marketing different. \"You must make between $150k-$200k and have a couple years of experience OR KEEP SCROLLING\" was the new tagline. Everyone was up in arms. Some guy on the site made a post about it. He called Chris out and everything. He was pretty respectful too. I wouldn't have been. To think they scammed the new comers, me. To think that the job security they talked about is now gone and out the window. What pieces of crap!****Then... Python starts and the instructor is insufferable. The course is horrible. Not much else to say about that other than I paid over $10k to change my career and become a data engineer and I have to go buy another course because the one I was ripped off for is absolutely terrible.** **Now, not everything is bad. There have been some good teachers and mindset coaches. Payal was amazing and she got tired of the place and quit.** **It would be in your best interest to look elsewhere for your education as a data engineer, even if you are experienced. Dont fall for the commercials.****#whatdidigetmyselfinto** **Me...**",

You can speed it up further with parallelism. \\- Sling costs 3x more hardware resources for the same work compared to any of the dlt fast backends, which i found surprising given that there's not much work happening, SQL copy is mostly a data throughput problem.All said, while I believe choosing dlt is a no-brainer for pythonic data teams (why have tool sprawl with something slower in a different tech), I appreciated the simplicity of setting up sling and some of their different approaches.",

        "content": "Hi everyone,Is anyone here using GitHub for managing Power BI assets (semantic models, reports, CI/CD workflows)?We're currently migrating from Azure DevOps to GitHub, since most of our data stack (Airflow, dbt, etc.) already lives there.That said, setting up a clean and user-friendly CI/CD workflow for Power BI in GitHub is proving to be painful:We tried Fabric Git integration directly from the workspace, but this isn't working for us — too rigid and not team-friendly.Then we built GitHub Actions pipelines connected to Jira, which technically work — but they are hard to integrate into a local workflow (like VS Code). The GitHub Actions extension feels clunky and not intuitive.Our goal is to find a setup that is:Developer-friendly (ideally integrated in VS Code or at least easy to trigger without manual clicking),Not overly complex (we considered building a Streamlit UI with buttons, but that’s more effort than we can afford right now),Seamless for deploying Power BI models and reports (models go via Fabric CLI, reports via deployment pipelines).I know most companies just use Azure DevOps for this — and honestly, it works great. But moving to GitHub was a business decision, so we have to make it work.Has anyone here implemented something similar using GitHub successfully?Any tips on tools, IDEs, Git integrations, or CLI-based workflows that made your life easier?Thanks in advance!",

I would appreciate any advice or guidance.**The Current Situation:**We have an ETL pipeline that ingests data from Firestore. The source of this data is JSON outputs generated by the OpenAI API, based on dynamic, client-specific prompts. My boss and the CTO decided that this data should be stored in structured tables in a PostgreSQL database.This architecture has led to two major problems:1. **Constant Schema Changes & Manual Work:** The JSON structure is client-dependent. Every time a client wants to add or remove a field, I receive a request to update the OpenAI prompt. This requires me to manually modify our ETL pipeline and run ALTER TABLE commands on the SQL database to accommodate the new schema.2. **Rigid Reporting Structure:** These PostgreSQL tables directly feed client-facing reports in Metabase. The tight coupling between the rigid SQL schema and the reports makes every small change a multi-step, fragile, and time-consuming process.**My Question:**How can I handle this problem more effectively? I'm looking for advice on alternative architectures or key concepts I should learn to build a more flexible system that doesn't break every time a client's requirements change.**ETL Details:*** The entire pipeline is written in Python.* The data volume is not the issue (approx. 10,000 records daily). The main pain point is the constant manual effort required to adapt to schema changes.Thank you in advance for any suggestions",

        "author": "Inner_Butterfly1991",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey, I used to work at a Scala Spark shop, and we cared a lot about code optimization, we avoided writing UDFs, ensured the vast majority of operations were using the Dataframe API when possible, and although sometimes we had to leverage UDFs that was the exception. We ran all our jobs in batch and were able to run ETL jobs where data was in the 100s of GBs in 10-15 minutes. I recently got a new job at a Java Spark shop, and we use the spark streaming API. Our code starts with a foreach, and all of our code base is assuming we're operating on a single row. But then I took a java spark udemy course and it seems like it's teaching the very thing we're doing in java. But we end up streaming \\~20gb of data and our jobs take hours. Now I know we don't even really need to use spark with data that size, but given we have a spark code base, I guess I just have a few questions:1. Is it normal in java spark to use foreach and treat each row differently, and does the java spark engine recognize common transformations written in foreach and leverage it to create a plan that operates on the larger dataframe in a performant fashion? Is the scala logic of ensuring we focus on Dataframe operations rather than row-level UDFs the same in Java? 2. Is java spark, if written well, less performant than Scala Spark? 3. Is it possible that the streaming part could make Spark less performant when looking at \\~20gb of data? We're streaming data in json format via Kafka, whereas our Spark Scala batch jobs at my old company were using data both sourced from and creating new parquet files. 2.",

For future the client needs to decide on attribute level whether the attribute is required, mandatory or optional, why is collecting that attribute important? What further relations it has etc etc. So in simple words, I'm looking into, whether we can define some questions or a framework against which each attribute could be evaluated and client can really define their requirements clearly.Any thoughts on that?

Just validation in your browser.# Why it matters:I designed the UI and contract format to be **clear and readable by anyone** — not just engineers. That means someone from your team (even the “Excel-as-a-database” crowd) can write a valid contract in a single video call, while your data engineers focus on more important work than hunting schema bugs.This lets you:* Move validation responsibilities earlier in the process* Collaborate with non-tech teammates* Keep pipelines clean and predictable# Tech bits:* Python lib: data-sitter (Pydantic-based)* TypeScript lib: WASM runtime* Contracts are compatible with JSON Schema* Open source: [GitHub](https://github.com/lcandea/data-sitter)# Coming soon:* Auto-generate contracts from real files (infer types, rules, descriptions)* Export to Zod, AVRO, JSON Schema* Cloud API for validation as a service* “Validation buffer” system for real-time integrations with external data providers",

        "author": "Muhammad-AbdAlsattar",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone in r/dataengineering,I've been tinkering with this personal project to put together a full end-to-end real-time fraud detection pipeline on GCP, and I'd really appreciate your thoughts, critiques, and any suggestions you might have. One thing I focused on heavily was decoupling the system components to keep everything modular and flexible separating the real-time actions, ML model endpoint, and enrichment database from the core processing pipeline. This serverless-first approach with modern design patterns makes it easier to scale, update, and maintain individual parts without disrupting the whole flow. That said, I know there's always room to improve, so hit me with your feedback.# Here's the: [Project Repo](https://github.com/Muhammad-Abdelsattar/Real-Time-Fraud-Detection-Pipeline)Basically, the idea is to build a setup that pulls in a stream of financial transactions, beefs them up with past user data, runs them through an ML model to check for fraud, and then stashes them away for later analysis all happening in just a few seconds.Here's a quick look at the system architecture:https://preview.redd.it/zfjc71jmt1if1.png?width=10973&format=png&auto=webp&s=f51eff1e4b1a3f011f5452ea5459153787f0e429# Hot Path vs. Cold Path BreakdownI split the system into two main flows to keep things efficient, and the decoupling shines here by letting each component operate independently:**Hot Path (Real-Time Scoring):** This is the fast lane for figuring out if a transaction is sketchy right away, with loose coupling between ingestion, processing, enrichment, inference, and actions to allow for independent scaling and updates.1. **Ingestion:** Transactions get pushed straight into Cloud Pub/Sub, keeping the entry point decoupled from the downstream pipeline for reliable, asynchronous handling.2. **Streaming ETL:** A Cloud Dataflow job (using Apache Beam) grabs those events and processes them on the fly, acting as the central pipeline without embedding any enrichment or ML logic directly.3. **Enrichment:** The Dataflow pipeline queries Firestore—a fully decoupled, low-latency cache—to pull in pre-calculated historical features for the user or merchant, ensuring the database can be swapped or scaled without touching the pipeline.4. **ML Inference:** Once enriched, it sends the data over HTTP to a separate FastAPI endpoint on Cloud Run for scoring. This decoupling is key: it lets the data science team iterate on the model (using XGBoost or Scikit-learn) independently, without redeploying the entire pipeline.5. **Action & Archiving:** The scored transaction is published to another Pub/Sub topic for real-time downstream actions like alerts (fully decoupled for flexibility in what those actions might be), and simultaneously archived to a GCS data lake as Parquet files.**Cold Path (Analytics & Feature Loop):** This one's more about batch jobs, digging into the data, and feeding insights back to the hot path, with orchestration keeping everything loosely coupled.1. **ETL to DWH:** Every hour, a Spark job on a short-lived Dataproc cluster reads the fresh Parquet files from GCS, shapes them into a star schema, and loads them into BigQuery—decoupled from the hot path for cost-effective batch processing.2. **Orchestration & Feature Refresh:** Cloud Composer (Airflow) handles the scheduling as a separate layer. There's a daily DAG that queries BigQuery, recalculates all the historical features, exports them, and updates the Firestore cache, closing the feedback loop without tight integration into the real-time components.# Tech Stack I Went With**Cloud Provider:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**Streaming**: Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Dataflow (Apache Beam)**Batch Processing:** Cloud Dataproc (Apache Spark)**Data Warehouse:** BigQuery**Real-Time Feature Store:** Firestore (decoupled for easy swaps)**ML Serving:** Cloud Run, FastAPI, XGBoost, Scikit-learn (standalone endpoint)**Orchestration:** Cloud Composer (Apache Airflow)**Containerization:** Docker, Cloud Build, Artifact Registry**Infra Automation:** Mostly Bash scripts for now, but I'm eyeing Terraform next# Some Key Choices & Stuff I'm Curious AboutDecoupling was a big priority for me to avoid monolithic setups, but I'd love your take on these decisions good, bad, or ugly:1. **Firestore for Features:** I picked Firestore because it's serverless, super fast for reads, and completely decoupled from the pipeline, making it ideal for serving pre-computed features in real-time enrichment. But I've read about how it can get pricey at scale versus something like Redis or Memorystore. Anyone here used it for high-throughput scenarios like this? What kind of gotchas should I watch out for with this separation?2. **Separate ML on Cloud Run:** Keeping the inference as its own auto-scaling service on Cloud Run emphasizes decoupling—it adds a bit of network lag compared to embedding the model in Dataflow, but it keeps concerns separated beautifully. Plus, scaling to zero saves cash, and the data science team can deploy updates without pipeline downtime. That said, the CPU/memory limits can be a pain. Worth the tradeoff in your experience?3. **Dataproc/Spark for Hourly Loads:** Going with managed Spark on Dataproc for pulling from GCS to BigQuery hourly seemed solid and straightforward, and it keeps batch ETL decoupled from the streaming side. But is it overkill? Could I swap it for BigQuery's built-in tools, a Dataflow batch job, or even a Cloud Function since the data's already in Parquet, while maintaining that separation?4. **Handling Errors with DLQs:** In Dataflow, I've got a dead-letter queue dumping failures to GCS for later, which fits the decoupled vibe by isolating errors without halting the pipeline. Airflow in the cold path uses sensors and alerts for the same reason. Pretty standard, right? But are there smarter ways to deal with and retry failures in streaming setups that enhance this modularity?I'd love to pick your brains on this whether it's big-picture architecture ideas (especially around further decoupling), or nitty-gritty tech tweaks. This community's got so much experience, and any input would help a ton.Thanks for checking it out!",

Our main bottleneck is running and merging two separate queries, one for KNN and one for BM25, which currently results in an average response time of 7–10 seconds.

We’re considering replacing it entirely with DuckDB + Ducklake, working directly on Parquet files stored in S3, without any additional database layer.• Users can update data via the UI, which we plan to support using inline updates (DuckDB writes). • Analytical jobs that update millions of records currently take hours – with DuckDB, we’ve seen they could take just minutes. • All data is stored in columnar format and compressed, which significantly reduces both cost and latency for analytic workloads.To support Ducklake, we’ll be using PostgreSQL as the catalog backend, while the actual data remains in S3.The only real pain point we’re struggling with is retrieving a record by ID efficiently, which is trivial in MongoDB.So here’s my question: Does it sound completely unreasonable to build a production-grade system that relies solely on Ducklake (on S3) as the primary datastore, assuming we handle write scenarios via inline updates and optimize access patterns?Would love to hear from others who tried something similar – or any thoughts on potential pitfalls.",

Not gonna pretend I know everything - I'm only mid-senior myself, but here's what I've picked up from both sides of the fence.**Stop obsessing about languages**Everyone's like \"which language should I learn???\" and tbh it doesn't matter that much. Just pick one that seems cool and focus on getting comfortable with the basics - functions, loops, etc until you don't have to think about syntax. Then grab a web framework for whatever langauge you picked and build some actual stuff.JS is probably the easiest recommendation since it works in browsers, handles JSON without extra headaches, and you can make UIs right away. I personally like TypeScript these days cuz it catches my dumb mistakes, but I started with Python. My team at work uses Go for backend stuff and I'm still learning it lol. Languages are just tools.**What companies acutally look for**I've been on both sides of interviews and helped with hiring at my last company. Gonna be real - the worst junior devs aren't the ones who don't know stuff, its the ones who don't improve fast enough.Your starting point matters way less than how quick you pick things up. What I care about when interviewing juniors isn't what you know right now - it's how fast you'll become usful and how much babysitting you're gonna need. Being able to read documentation and understand existing code is honestly MORE valuable than writing it perfectly from scratch.One of the best devs I know beat me at Chess after only reading about strategy for a few days. Same energy - they can just absorb new info super quick.**Portfolio stuff - simpler than you think**One legit project that YOU built (not copy/pasting a tutorial) beats a dozen generic portfolio projects. I need someone who can solve problems when stuff breaks, and personal projects show me you've actually dug yourself out of holes.If you're stuck on what to build - thats kinda a warning sign tbh. You should want to build SOMETHING. Clone spotify. Make a task app that doesn't suck. Build that game idea. What did you think would be cool before you realized coding is hard af?As for how big the project should be - there's no magic answer. You should feel like you've made something that works, or that you're proud of parts of your code, or that you've fixed enough annoying bugs that you've learned some real lessons.**Find ppl who get it**You need someone who'll help keep you going, but they can't push you - that's on you. A decent mentor answers questions and helps when you're stuck, but YOU gotta stay motivated til things click.Stack overflow and reddit are fine but sometimes u need someone who gets YOUR specific confusion. Don't be afraid to ask stuff that seems stupid - I asked sooo many dumb questions when I started (and still do in our team slack lol). Learning to code is legit painful, but it does get better!I was stunned when i started mentoring how many questions are so context-specific that googling just doesn't help. Like sometimes you just need a human to explain something in YOUR terms.**Just. Pick. Something**\"People keep saying mixed things about X\" is something I hear ALL the time. But mixed reviews just mean nothing is perfect - welcome to programming lol. Try like 2-3 options for a day each and then just commit to one. Don't feel like you have to finish every udemy course - I've prob completed like 3 out of the 20 I've bought because I usually get what I need halfway thru.Every \"wrong\" choice actually makes you better in the long run. I started with Django bcuz I thought I wanted to be a python dev, then moved to Node, then React, and now I'm doing Go microservices. None of it was wasted time.Also don't worry about frameworks changing or whatever. Once you know one, picking up others is 10x easier.**The secret sauce**Consistency > motivation. Make a habit of coding everyday, even if its just 30 min. Some days you'll hate it. Some days you'll love it. But your brain needs the repetition to build those neural pathways.I still have days when I feel like an absolute fraud and other days when I'm like \"damn I'm good at this\". It's normal.Hit me up if u got questions. Not guaranteeing I'll answer but I'll try if I have time.Edit 1: Been getting a bunch of dмs with similar questions — I’ll write small posts on Medium / [Substack](http://typedweekly.com) so it’s easier to share in next days.",

For someone just starting their programming journey now, what would you recommend they focus on?Some specific questions I'm wondering about:\\- Are traditional fundamentals (algorithms, data structures, etc.) still as crucial when AI can handle a lot of implementation?\\- Which programming languages or technologies seem most future-proof right now?\\- What soft skills or ways of thinking are becoming more important as the technical barriers lower?\\- How should new programmers approach learning alongside AI tools rather than competing with them?I'd love to hear from both experienced developers and fellow newcomers about what you think will matter most going forward. What are you focusing your learning on, and what gaps do you see in the current market?Thanks for any insights!",

Dynamic typing does not even serve its own special purpose. You want polymorphism: use inheritance. You want a beginner-friendly language: well then why would you abstract away something as important as data types. Why does dynamic typing exist?",

I find a project with source code (usually from GitHub or a course).2. I go through the code and figure out which parts I don’t understand.3. I take crash courses or quick tutorials on those missing concepts.4. Then I try to rebuild the project from scratch on my own.I’ve seen a lot of people here say that building your own stuff is the key, and I totally get that. But as a beginner, building something *completely* on my own still feels a bit overwhelming. So this method has been kind of a middle ground for me. I’m currently thinking to work on 3–4 projects using this approach.Just wondering — does this sound like a good learning path? Has anyone else tried something similar or got any tips to improve it?Would love to hear your thoughts!",

By this I mean code simple stuff that I, myself has built from scratch but when it comes to working in a large group and have to tap into other people’s mind and their code, all of a sudden I feel like a black sheep.For example when I was tasked with creating a simple web app to serve some users it was pretty easy at the start since there was a lot of documentation about the language and the framework so I just googled the questions that I have and 9 out of 10 times it would come up for me and I just Copied it and changed some of the lines but I feel like I still didn’t learn as much. And as the codebase grew over 20k lines of code, I could answer less and less questions about it.And now with all this AI hype it’s even harder to not be lazy.

My last couple of review cycles have been positive overall but have highlighted some areas that I feel like are quite big weaknesses for me and that I am not sure how to improve at.It took me a very long time to get to the level of being a steady junior contributor who can be given a task and reasonably trusted to implement it with some guidance and instruction from more senior engineers (partially slow adjustment period on my part, partially poor management during COVID) but I really feel like I've hit a plateau and don't know how to get out of it. The main feedback I'm getting is that I need to do more code reviews and speak up more in meetings to discuss design - my work is fine in and of itself (though I feel my ability to design things and push my projects forward is a bit lacking) but I have very little impact on the wider team. I feel like I don't know how to analyse code or review it at all, that I have no deep understanding or knowledge. I can execute tasks well but really struggle a lot with designing solutions to problems or critiquing designs to suggest improvements or point out potential holes. When I try to review code I can spot simple mistakes, but amn't able to give anything more indepth (pointing out areas of refactoring, inefficiencies, suggesting alternative ways of solving the problem) and don't know where to start. When I start looking at reviews I can just feel my mind go blank instead of being able to break down the review and think through what's going on with it or what could be done better.Because I've been working in this career for quite some time I feel bad even asking for help, I've managed to struggle my way through it so far but it's very stressful and I don't want to feel so incompetent and afraid when doing my job.

No matter, anyway, i still have the Final Thesis to complete and took one year to focus on it since i can continue working my student job, which is great for me. So i was mostly stumbling through the 3 years, managing to get where i am with hope and prayers. The teachers said how they are teaching us the basics and how to learn to learn (their words). So i am asking for any advice how and where to learn. Those who have experience and learned online through forums and sites, what do you recommend? How did you memorize the important bits, how did you start understanding it, any tricks how to be better at programming, what learning technique could be applied to learning different languages and so on... We learned some c++ and python, but mostly c#, xml, php. In my free time i've focused mostly on javascript, html and css since i'm interested in making websites and web applications. Let's say i'm a noob with basic knowledge, what would you recommend? Got 1 year before i need to look for a job and alot of free time.",

Now- I want a job in CS. Back in school, I wasn’t a strong coder, and I’ve forgotten pretty much everything (I tried re-learning Python, and it felt completely new, like the knowledge didn’t \"bounce back\"). I have no CS work experience, no internships, or anything professional under my belt. I’m honestly lost on where to start.I've taken time off and I can dedicate 8 hours a day, Monday through Friday, to learning until December to- as they say- \"figure my life out\" and \"get my shit together.\" I need a clear, up-to-date path that won’t lead me to dead ends. My husband and I are fortunate to make this sacrifice (I currently work as an elementary school teacher(long story), but I’m terrified of wasting time. I’m worried that come November, when I’m ready to apply for jobs, I’ll realize I focused on the wrong things and I’m still unprepared.I’ve done some research online, but it feels like staring into a void. I see posts about people with 5+ years of experience struggling to get jobs and others saying there’s no way a newbie like me will land a role.  Any advice on how to approach this? What should I do for the next 4 months to be job-ready by December? Any specific field that's more fruitful than the rest?I was thinking of doing **AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate** certificate - however I read it's impossible to land a job without experience in the workforce. I was thinking of doing iOS- but again - the competition is cut throat- truly im at such a loss. I don't even know why I got a Computer Science degree- it seems so obsolete.",

My resume is almost empty.I know it's completely my fault, but I think I have executive dysfunction.

I keep seeing students' resumes on here, their projects have terminologies that sound so complicated. Apart from that they even have experience and still struggling to land roles. And here I am just starting, but don't want to waste more time. And I kinda need to do it fast, to try and gain some internship experience.I think I believed in my abilities a few years ago, but lately I just don't. Been feeling defeated and full of regret. Please offer some advice, which will help me take concrete, focused action.Thanks for reading.",

        "author": "wordbit12",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I'm a CS student who's really into metacognition and how people learn programming. I get to see lots of students at university and talk with them about their code (sometimes JavaScript), and I've noticed something that I think is a huge problem.The fundamental concept that causes the most trouble for beginners is that **they don't understand evaluation** \\- what it actually means to evaluate an expression until it becomes a value.People always say universities are rigorous and full of definitions, but they (or at least my university) seem to completely fail at teaching the definitions that actually matter. I can't count how many friends have told me that programming suddenly \"clicked\" once they understood these basic definitions:* **Value**: an expression that evaluates to itself* **Evaluation**: transforming an expression, step by step, into a valueOnce you get this, everything else builds naturally. Assignment makes sense because it's basically a function that takes two arguments: a name and a value. If there's an expression on the right side, you have to evaluate it first, step by step. Functions only accept values, so arguments have to be evaluated first - boom, functional composition becomes way easier to understand. and same for functions calls, because the student start seeing the call as an operator that takes a function on its left, not just syntax to memorize.Later when you study first-class functions, a statement like \"functions are values\" actually makes sense. Students start asking the right questions: \"But what kind of value? How does it look?\" And that naturally leads to closures and understanding that the value contains a reference to the environment where the function was defined.Here's the thing - I truly believe understanding these basic concepts early helps students ask the right questions. When they face something unexpected with a new expression, the first thing they think is \"How does this evaluate? There must be some evaluation rules.\"I think all CS 101 classes should start with (or at least teach at some points) these fundamentals: evaluation, values, the difference between statements and expressions, etc. Instead we get thrown into syntax and algorithms without understanding what's actually happening under the hood.

For example, **PHP** used to be huge, powering a massive chunk of the web. What do you think led to its decline in popularity compared to other options?

Codefinity’s step-by-step lessons were great for breaking down concepts into manageable chunks, and I found the small projects really helpful for practicing what I learned.That said, it’s not perfect some parts felt slow, and if you’re already confident with basics, you might find it a bit repetitive. Still, it gave me the structure and confidence to move from “I know Python syntax” to actually building things I can show.For those interested, my goal is to eventually work in robotics, and I’ve been using a Raspberry Pi alongside the course to try out small hardware projects. The combination has been helpful to connect coding with real-world applications.I’d love to hear from others who’ve tried Codefinity did it help you move forward?

I have finished a linux course before so maybe it will help a bit but i am a beginner. At first I was planning to learn C++ because it was suitable for game developing. But today I have seen a video about CS50 course of Harvard, after that I did an quick search and found out that most of the people on internet were saying like it is the best course of the internet. Also you can earn a sertificate at the end of the course for free. My question is that can I adapt my Python knowledge to C++ if i finish the CS50 python course? How important is the certificate? Should I start to cs50?",

I don't have a job in programming, only have 1 major project under my belt, and I still have a lot to learn.Now for my advice that I wished I knew when I started out: code by discipline, not by inspiration.What do I mean by this? Well, you know how some of you guys (typically beginners) will wait until you get a cool idea of what to code like a poker game or a new mod for minecraft, code it, then wait for your next big idea to come to you? Yeah stop doing that. Waiting on motivation to code won't build good habits and at the end of the day you can't make it that far, not just in getting a job but in your personal growth as well. Coding by discpline means to code something, anything every day or whatever interval you want to set. If you don't have an idea, search for one online. Maybe even do some leetcode problems if nothing interests you that day. But, you have to do something. After all, if you want to get a job in coding you will have to code every day. Might as well get used to it early right? But yeah, just waiting until ispiration strikes means you won't code as many projects as you could've if you just coded say a small add function to a calculator, or the collision physics for snake instead of doing nothing.Anyways, that's my advice. What do you guys think of it? I hope this helps someone out starting coding!",

I got into an internship (called FTT) where I was placed in a project as a backend developer — but there wasn’t much onboarding or guidance.The project is a WhatsApp chatbot (not AI-based, just a menu tree of questions and answers to help students with common doubts about our university). The second part is a dashboard for professors to interact with “tickets” — messages from students that the bot couldn’t handle.At first, I was excited and learned a lot. I got exposed to things like databases, HTTP requests, backend frameworks, APIs… way more than I ever saw in class. But now I’m stuck. I don’t know what the next step is. I’m just staring at the codebase and feeling completely lost.To make things worse, the “client” (university professors) barely show up to clarify things. We don’t know what API to use for WhatsApp integration, and we’re not even sure if we’ll get access to a real number to test the bot properly.We had about a month of vacation, and during that time, I started learning Java. It felt cool — I like how structured it is. But despite that, I still feel like I don’t know how to code. I feel like I’m just copying code, Googling everything, and faking my way through things. I don’t feel like a “real” dev. Sometimes I feel like a fraud.I know this is all part of learning, but it’s hard not to feel lost or like I’m falling behind.Has anyone else been through something like this? Any advice on how to push through this kind of block?",

        "content": "https://inventwithpython.com/blog/leap-of-faith.htmlI've written a short tutorial about what exactly the vague \"leap of faith\" technique for writing recursive functions means, with factorial and permutation examples. The code is written in Python.TL;DR:1. Start by figuring out the data types of the parameters and return value.2. Next, implement the base case.3. Take a leap of faith and assume your recursive function magically returns the correct value, and write your recursive case.4. First Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call cannot be the original argument.5. Second Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call must ALWAYS get closer to the base case.I also go into why so many other tutorials fail to explain what \"leap of faith\" actually is and the unstated assumptions they make. There's also the explanation for the concept that ChatGPT gives, and how it matches the deficiencies of other recursion tutorials.I also have this absolutely demented (but technically correct!) implementation of recursive factorial: def factorial(number): if number < 0: raise Exception('number must be a positive integer') if number % 1 != 0: raise Exception('number must be an integer') if number == 100: # BASE CASE return 93326215443944152681699238856266700490715968264381621468592963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223758251185210916864000000000000000000000000 elif number < 100: # RECURSIVE CASE return factorial(number + 1) // (number + 1) else: # ANOTHER RECURSIVE CASE return number * factorial(number - 1)",

The problem is I can only focus on one task at a time. These tasks usually require deep focus, making it impossible to effectively switch between them.For example, I have a couple of pet projects, and when I return to either of them to make some changes, it always feels like starting from scratch - learning the codebase again, figuring out the code logic. Every time. Another example is coding in different languages. If I spend some time with one language or framework, it inevitably leads to forgetting stuff from other languages, and when I switch them, I usually spend more time recalling the stuff I forgot than advancing. It feels like an uphill battle all the time. I'm sure some people manage to overcome these struggles, and so I'm asking - how do you juggle multiple projects, stacks effectively, without losing step at any of them? Maybe it's a silly question, but I'm genuinely curious how other people stay productive in these situations.",

To prevent files from touching my server I plan to use pre-signed URLs with some restrictions on file type, size, etc. but I still have some concerns that I am hoping someone could clarify.I need a way to remove metadata from the images and (I think?) scan them for malware. My approach is to just do this with Lambda and use either a temporary uploads bucket, then run the scans and move to a separate permanent storage bucket, or just upload directly to permanent storage. The part that I am concerned about is that this does not seem to be the industry standard. I have played around with several sites and they all seem to have the same approach. They use a single bucket, and the entire image upload latency is < 5 seconds. After \\~5 seconds the images are uploaded and available via their CDN, the metadata is removed, and I assume they have either already scanned for malware or have queued an async scan.Unless there is something I am missing, it seems that there is a brief period of time where user content is available via their CDNs but post-upload processing like metadata removal and malware scans have not been completed. Is the the standard approach to just immediately serve images and accept the low levels of risk as a tradeoff for very fast UIs, or is there a better approach that I am unaware of?",

From there I went on PHP agains using Symfony and Laravel.Last I applied for a job and went on learning Java Spring Boot which I think is awesome. I really want to try GraphQL and Nest.JS, but the problem is, I am also building my backend API in .NET 9. I experimented with Rust and also Go a bit,I am more of a jack of all trades, but I realise that this might not be the best possible thing, since I am neither really really good at them all. I have the most experience using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySql though. I feel like I should be sticking to one language I can be very very good at.I see languages, frameworks and libraries as tools in my arsenal, but when I have to use them, I do have to read the docs again to how the syntax works and what some of the differences are. C# is really straight forward, but Java Spring Boot requires to know about component scanning and IoC.Where someone professionally sticks to Java Spring Boot for example and became so good, they understand a lot of the Spring Framework architecture and knowledge that is on a deeper level.I like programming, I am bad at Leetcode and Hackerrank, I don't have the best problem solving skills, but I learn a lot by trying and experimenting and I am able to build API's using and ORM layer fairly easy.What do you recommend?",

I never really knew what type of position I wanted in the SWE industry so I kind of selected a stack prematurely. After using JavaScript for about 2 months and doing some leetcode easy problems, I found that solving problems really excites me. Even though I’d sometimes look up the solution when I didn’t understand the problem, just being able to sit and read the code and study it contributed a lot to my learning. My original plan after spending some time with full-stack was to just learn programming with JavaScript, do all the nit and gritty, get a job, then pivot into AI/ML or AWS. From what I see I think companies nowadays value specialization more than generalization. I’m starting to think maybe I had it all backwards and should’ve committed to a single stack rather than a full stack. I tried surfing subreddits for similar experiences but always came across mixed opinions. Overall, I like backend and I’m willing to learn it with Python or Java (my cs classes will be taught in either of these), JavaScript is cool but I don’t think it’s healthy to learn with a tool I’m not passionate in using.

        "content": "Hi everyone! :waving_hand:I'm excited to announce **WallpaperSwitcher 3.0**, the latest release of my first actually useful C# WinForms project!#### What is WallpaperSwitcher?A minimal, fast, and practical desktop wallpaper switcher for Windows (8/10/11), written in C# with WinForms and .NET 9. It allows you to manage wallpaper folders and switch wallpapers with ease—ideal for those who prefer static wallpapers and want something simpler than Wallpaper Engine.**Core Features**:* **Next wallpaper**: Switch wallpapers with a click.* **Folder management**: Add, remove, or switch between wallpaper folders.* **Hotkey support**: Assign hotkeys to switch wallpapers or folders quickly.* **Startup support**: Enable launch on Windows startup.* **System tray support**: Runs in the background with tray icon support—hotkeys still work.* **Settings UI**: Easily manage folders, hotkeys, and other settings via a dedicated window.* **Two wallpaper switch modes**: * **Native Mode**: Uses Windows SlideShow API (smoother but slower switching). * **Custom Mode**: Direct wallpaper setting via Win32 API (faster, emulates slideshow behavior).#### Why I built thisAs a long time **Wallpaper Engine** user, I started growing tired of dynamic wallpapers high power usage, choppy animations during frequent `Alt + Tab`, and lack of portability made me look for alternatives. I began using static wallpapers manually and realized I didn’t need all those extra features. I just wanted a fast, reliable wallpaper switcher and so I built one.Originally considered WPF, WinUI 3, or even Avalonia, but chose **WinForms** for its simplicity and low learning curve. I was able to build a working prototype in just a few hours after watching some tutorials and reading Microsoft docs.--- **What’s new in 3.0.0*** :check_mark_button: Full settings UI (no more editing config files manually!)* :check_mark_button: Hotkey system* :check_mark_button: Dual wallpaper switch modes: Native vs Custom* :check_mark_button: Better folder switching logic* :check_mark_button: System tray + auto-start support* :check_mark_button: UI improved using hand-written `.Designer.cs` (more on that below :backhand_index_pointing_down:)---**About the UI**I initially relied on Visual Studio’s WinForms Designer. But I wanted a cleaner, more modern look—something like Java Swing’s *FlatLaf*. I couldn’t find a suitable theming library for WinForms, so I turned to AI assisted code transformation.I uploaded my `*.Designer.cs` files and asked AI to refactor the UI styling. After several iterations, I got a design I was happy with. The catch? The updated UI broke Designer compatibility in Visual Studio so now I maintain the UI purely via code. It’s a tradeoff, but acceptable for a mostly stable project.---**Architecture decisions*** **Two-project structure**: * `WallpaperSwitcher.Core`: Logic layer (hotkeys, folder mgmt, wallpaper APIs). * `WallpaperSwitcher.Desktop`: UI layer (WinForms).* Started with `DllImport + SystemParametersInfo`, later switched to `LibraryImport` for better AOT support.* Eventually migrated all native API calls to **[CsWin32](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32)**. This made the code much cleaner and easier to manage—highly recommended if you deal with Windows APIs.---**Tech stack*** C# (.NET 9)* WinForms* CsWin32 (for Windows API interop)* Visual Studio + Rider (design/code split)---:package: **Project & Source Code**:backhand_index_pointing_right: GitHub: [https://github.com/lorenzoyang/WallpaperSwitcher](https://github.com/lorenzoyang/WallpaperSwitcher)Any feedback, suggestions, or code critiques would be super appreciated. I'm still learning C# and desktop development in general, and I’ve learned **a ton** during this project—especially around COM interop, hotkey registration, and Windows APIs.Thank you all for reading! :folded_hands:If you’re someone like me who just wants a simple, no bloat wallpaper switcher give it a try!",

After that it breaks out the loop and the next if statement checks the bool value and since it's not false, the program ends. However my confusion is that since the bool variable was set to false from the start, isn't the for loop checking that as long as the program is within the bounds of the vector and that the foundCountry is now true (since !foundCountry changes the value to true) execute the following within the loop statement? Wouldn't it make more for it to be set up as foundCountry == false? // Find country's index and average TV time foundCountry = false; for (i = 0; (i < ctryNames.size()) && (!foundCountry); ++i) { if (ctryNames.at(i) == userCountry) { foundCountry = true; cout << \"People in \" << userCountry << \" watch \"; cout << ctryMins.at(i) << \" mins of TV daily.\" << endl; } } if (!foundCountry) { cout << \"Country not found; try again.\" << endl; } return 0; }",

Sometimes the wording confuses me, or I don't know how to break the problem down into smaller steps.I'm not necessarily asking for help with one specific problem — I just want to know how you approach understanding any coding question.Do you have a method or checklist you follow when reading a new problem? How do you identify what the input/output is, what the problem wants you to do, and how to start thinking about the logic?Any advice, examples, or tips would be greatly appreciated!Thanks in Advance",

        "content": "After 4 years as a backend developer at my current company, I've decided to look for new opportunities. One of the main reasons is that my salary hasn't kept pace with industry standards, which has made me feel undervalued in my role.Over time, I've learned a lot through trial and error, but I've also tried to use my own knowledge and experience to improve my skills. Unfortunately, as one of the remote workers in the company, they are mobbing me to leave. As a result, my team pushing me to do tasks like meetings, ci/cd deployments and documentation. Limiting my work but I still do the coding stuff because Im the one who is pushing for it and I dont get any support from my team. It started be like this since last 2 years. First 2 years were great and I learned a lot in those times.I've found it tough to balance my work and personal life because of work times and getting tired from sitting for 8-10 hours. These has made it hard for me to find time to learn new things outside of work. I have applied for jobs but I've often struggled with basic development trivia questions because I haven't been keeping up as much as I'd like or memorizing about everything about the technology I used.In one of the applications that did showcase my skills was the one I created a microservice from stratch. But after the project interview they wanted me to write some basic code(reverse the string they provided). It took me a bit longer than expected to get it done because I wasnt going to write code in the interview from what they told, my laptop was in a way to show my face which didnt had room for me to write but I managed to write it with some debugging. It wasnt enough for them I think they just declined my application. I applied to here through a senior friend and they thought how did he create all of this by himself, must have got helped which I didnt get any.Anyway, now I'm feeling a bit stuck and unsure about how to move forward. Despite knowing a lot about project structures and API design, backend development etc... I'm not feeling like my skills are growing as quickly as I'd like. Im doing some leetcode, hackerrank examples and studying some topics (taking notes) but yet Its not enough or match the criteria for the applications. Sometimes I feel like I cant write code without looking to documentation or examples. And sometimes I cant write it out of my head, I know what to create or write as an idea but the functions or annotations are not in my memory all the time, I have to look for the usage.I'm wondering how can I make some changes or seek out new opportunities to learn and grow. Im really tired of this loop, feeling like exhausted but need a job for living. I keep learning, taking notes etc but Im still here without moving forward",

I had made a mistake; I should've started a Java file so that after a lesson I could go into the file and practice what I had learned. I started a project in Java but am having a hard time gaining any progress on the project because I can't remember what I learned. I was wondering if anybody had any tips or ideas on what I should do next so that I can remember what I learned and be able to code in Java successfully without having to recall as much information on Google.

I am starting another project but as it stands, the app keeps on crashing. I suspect, update to Android 15 might be the reason. Does anyone know similarly comprehensive IDE for smartphone that is compatible with Android 15? Alternative, way to resolve issue? P.S. - Android IDE is different from AIDE.

        "content": "I’ve been keeping an eye on ChatGPT as it’s evolved, and with the release of ChatGPT 5, it honestly feels like the improvements have slowed way down. Earlier versions brought some pretty big jumps in what AI could do, especially with coding help. But now, the upgrades feel small and kind of incremental. It’s like we’re hitting diminishing returns on how much better these models get at actually replacing real coding work.That’s a big deal, because a lot of people talk like AI is going to replace software engineers any day now. Sure, AI can knock out simple tasks and help with boilerplate stuff, but when it comes to the complicated parts such as designing systems, debugging tricky issues, understanding what the business really needs, and working with a team, it still falls short. Those things need creativity and critical thinking, and AI just isn’t there yet.So yeah, the tech is cool and it’ll keep getting better, but the progress isn’t revolutionary anymore. My guess is AI will keep being a helpful assistant that makes developers’ lives easier, not something that totally replaces them. It’s great for automating the boring parts, but the unique skills engineers bring to the table won’t be copied by AI anytime soon. It will become just another tool that we'll have to learn.I know this post is mainly about the new ChatGPT 5 release, but TBH it seems like all the other models are hitting diminishing returns right now as well.What are your thoughts?",

        "content": "Over a month ago, we had a regression testing deadline coming up. My manager reached out to me on Saturday to work on some bugs . I told her I was out of town and couldn’t work — which was true. I’ve got four kids and my weekends are usually packed, especially with no notice.The following Monday in standup, she brought it up — saying she should have communicated earlier, but also added that she expected the team to step up and work weekends to meet deadlines. I mentioned I wouldn’t be available the coming weekend either if that’s what she was expecting. It was my son’s birthday weekend. They worked til midnight that Saturday.For context: my manager has always been happy with my work. She’s consistently appreciated my contributions and never had any complaints about my performance. The only “issue” seems to be that I don’t volunteer for extra work. lol. She’s made comments in the past like she wants me to “see the bigger picture” and help other teams.A couple of weeks ago, she asked if I’d be available the second weekend of September for another deadline. At the time, I said I should be. But since then, my wife made plans for that weekend, so I updated my manager and told her I wouldn’t be available anymore in case she needs people to work.She wasn’t happy and said something like, “I can’t keep asking the same person to work on weekends,” referring to a coworker who regularly puts in 50–60 hours. I replied, “That’s a personal choice. I already stretch my weekdays beyond 40 hours. I choose to spend weekends with my family. If every release requires weekend work, then we have a process problem.”Now I’m brushing up my resume. Haven’t interviewed in over 10 years……",

The second one they had to let her go because they did some bad calculation around the budget they had and fired a couple of new people and she was one of them.She is getting really depressed with this despite being her dream, and I think she's not so bad that she can't find a job, there are really bad people out there, how can she not find one after all this energy and struggle. It makes me really sad to see her in this situation and would love to help her in any way possible.Since I use reddit regularly I wanted to ask people in this subreddit what we can do?We have optimized CV in every possible way, she did a portfolio, she's trying to find clients in the meanwhile. But a part from that, what can we realistically do? How can it be so hard after all the efforts?",

That hasn't changed, though. It's always been that way.The problem isn't leetcode, because as stupid as the whole concept is fundamentally, I'm at least good enough at it to be able to handle them with some modicum of confidence, in spite of it being completely irrelevant to any work in the field.The problem isn't interviews, because in spite of this job being fairly insular (although not as much as most people believe), I have good soft skills from my last job especially being very interactive with many different teams.The problem is that *I fucking hate what tech has become in 2025.*90% of job ads are for gambling sites, crypto sites (but I repeat myself), or AI bullshit that's draining society for every penny it's worth while putting people out of their jobs without any plan for what happens when vast swathes of the population are trained in unemployable fields. It's feeding into a regime that I will withhold my feelings about so as not to get too political, but suffice it to say I vehemently disagree with. The rest of the job ads are so hotly contested and so few and far between that I have barely any shot of competing for them, and even those jobs are still mildly problematic, but at least it's only in the same old ways that they've always been (ie. Banking, marketing).Sorry if this has been said before by others but the feeling of needing to sell my soul to these companies that are speedrunning societal destruction makes me want to throw myself into a river rather than prostrate myself at their feet hoping a little bit of their plundered wealth trickles into my pockets.",

It’s the only proper job offer I’ve ever received. I came in at the minimum, making a bit over $50k. I was happy to finally have a job.The job is stable. Demands are more than reasonable. But with 6 YoE, I make under $80k in a top 10 US metro. I'm in the bottom 20% of my pay band. I’ve argued for raises. Answer is basically, \"why should we?\" It's frustrating, but I realize that if I don't have any offer letters as leverage, then they *don't* have any reason to do anything. And raises are now frozen for *everyone* due to federal funding changes. Meanwhile, my coworkers are in the top half, if not top third or quarter of their pay bands, making $30k+ more than me. And don't even get me started on how I compare to the figures on levels.fyi or Glassdoor.I’ve been applying since I got my 401k vested, which coincided with the job market starting to fall apart. The search has not been successful or positive or encouraging. It's particularly disheartening to know that people out there with actual expertise and proper CS degrees and double/triple my YoE are also struggling. If *they* can't find jobs, what chance do *I* have?Maybe I am still behind in some ways, but I *have* improved. I’ve gotten promoted. (Even though the promotion just put me at a lower percentile in my new pay band.) I get positive feedback from PMs and BAs, and a coworker recently said he's even impressed with how far I've come on a history degree and that he thinks I might make a good architect someday. Their praise doesn't translate into anything material, of course.I had always had an interest in tech, but this is not a case of \"I love code, but the bureaucracy is killing me.\" These days, I *prefer* the requirements gathering and backlog refinement sessions to head-down coding. I didn't exactly get into this field as a fulfillment of a lifelong passion. I think early on I felt gratification in helping people *via* the code. But there's not joy inherent to the code itself. Nowadays, my work feels disconnected from real users. It feels like grinding through abstract problems created by the tools themselves. Some days I wish I never had to touch code ever again.Maybe my mentality would change if I felt like I had a future, even a path to just being a median developer making a median salary. But right now, I don't see it.I don't think every person is necessarily cut out for every type of job. Am I just not cut out to be a developer? Or maybe not cut out for it anymore?

They were nice people and good colleagues but I had nothing in common with them, could not -for the love of me- hold a normal conversation with them and being at the office was incredibly draining.

If you're not learning Python in 2025, you're missing the boat. It's dominating AI/ML, data science, and increasingly backend development.2. **Docker**: +17 points (highest single-year increase ever). Container literacy is now a basic requirement, not a nice-to-have.3. **Cloud platforms**: Still growing steadily across AWS, Azure, GCP**The AI Skill Paradox:**Here's what the survey reveals about AI: usage is up, but trust is down to 60%. Translation for your career:\\- Learn to collaborate WITH AI tools, don't depend ON them\\- Develop skills that complement AI rather than compete with it\\- Focus on verification, architecture, and strategic thinking**Technologies to Consider (But Don't Panic About):**\\- Rust: Growing but still niche\\- Go: Solid for specific use cases\\- Kubernetes: Important for infrastructure roles**Technologies That Remain Solid:**\\- JavaScript: Still the most widely used\\- PostgreSQL: Database of choice\\- Git: Universal (obviously)**My Practical Advice:*** **If you're starting out**: Learn Python first, then JavaScript, then Docker* **If you're mid-career**: Add containerization and AI collaboration skills to your existing stack* **If you're senior**: Focus on architecture and team leadership while staying current with Python/containers**Career Strategy:**Don't chase every new framework. The survey shows that sustained success comes from mastering fundamentals and selectively adopting innovations that solve real problems.**The numbers don't lie**: developers with Python + Docker + cloud skills are seeing the most opportunities right now.What's your experience?

I was careful in what roles I applied to - I didn't really want to work in advertising or wacky new AI start ups. The roles I applied to I either thought I'd absolutely love working there, or they would be a great fit for the specific skill set I was starting to build for myself. 3 YOE did turn out to be the edge of non-senior: I was offered a senior role by one company, a non-senior for another, and rejected by a third company because I wasn't quite senior enough. I think if you have a few years of experience, the job market is not as bad as people say it is. If you don't, then you might be SOL. I was also pleasantly surprised, none of the interviews were very leet-codey. They were mostly common sense, real-life kind of scenarios. I prepped about 100 leet code mediums before applying, which was a bit useless, but I think it gave me the confidence I needed in these interviews.",

        "author": "SomeRandomCSGuy",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "For all the engineers that are feeling invisible, stuck or plateaued, this is for you and hope it helps / guides you into the next steps. I am a senior software engineer who got to this position pretty fast, and got promoted over other engineers with 3-4x my YoE, so whatever I saw in this post contributed massively to my growth, making my impact visible, getting me recognized, and eventually promoted. As a junior engineer, I was always awed by these senior+ engineers who seemed to make such an impact by whatever they did. This led me to start observing and building relationships with some of these really senior engineers around me (staff/principal) and learn how they operated, built that authority around them, and got stuff done, and something clicked. I realized it wasn’t just about technical skill and crushing tickets. What moved the needle was learning to communicate clearly, understand what impacts the business, build trust, build alignment between stakeholders, and be proactive (taking initiatives) instead of just reactive (wait to get assigned work).There is usually a misconception, that to stand out, you just need to work on your technical skills. That is wrong. To get to senior+ you need to hone in on your non-technical skills like communication, how you take initiatives, how you build alignment etc. These are absolutely crucial to be seen as someone with authority, and something most engineers neglect and plateau.A lot of engineers think that these skills are only required for managers etc, but they are wrong - even ICs require them. For these soft-skills (the real game changer), I would recommend focusing on good documentation (and I don't mean writing wikis/docs that no one reads, but being strategic with it) like writing summary docs to summarize complex discussions, writing well-thought-out design discussion tradeoff analysis docs to promote healthy, structured discussions and building alignment, etc. Taking time to write these up can not only promote healthy structured offline discussions (google docs for eg) but also act as an information aggregator for knowledge sharing (instead of being scattered on slack for eg or lost in meetings) and for having an audit log of important decisions - so in the future anyone can refer back to why a decision was taken and one doesn’t have to scramble to remember it, etc. The documents that you write now also help you to present your ideas and propose changes in a better manner in live meetings, where you can present that doc during the meetings and walk everyone through it - you don't need to memorize anything since all the information is already there in front of you, in a clean structured manner.Speech is equally important - the phrasings used, the tonality used etc can immediately set an authority apart from a noob - this also translates 1:1 into slack threads, and code reviews as well. Small tweaks like that can instantly make someone come off as authoritative and knowledgeable.I worked heavily on my speech. I was afraid to speak in meetings because I was introverted and had confidence issues because I had a bit of stuttering problem, I used to use too many filler words, lose track of thought etc. But I took time to work on it, and over time I started speaking more eloquently and fluently which made such a massive difference in my confidence, and whenever I had to propose something or even speak during meetings, it made a difference. Don’t get me wrong, technical skills are also important, but as you go up, your mastery of these other non-technical skills starts to matter more. They will make you more visible, your impact more visible, and eventually get you promoted. So I urge you to start working on them, you will be surprised just how much difference they make. If you are an introvert like me, if I can do it so can you. I used to think these soft skills are reserved for extroverts but I was extremely wrong, and these are most definitely learnable. Looking forward to hearing in the comments what has worked for other engineers out there as well!Happy to answer any questions in the comments and DMs! I am an open book and happy to help however I can!",

        "author": "tobythestrangler",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey all, I’ve been working as an intern at a small professional services firm since May of last year (so ~1.5 years now). What started as a short summer internship got extended **four times**, every time with vague mentions that I’d be offered a full-time role once \"we finish X\" or \"get through Y.\"In the beginning, I was doing analytics-focused work, i.e., building dashboards, eda/reporting for clients, simple regression tasks. It was great. Then, as the team realized more of the analytics was internally focused, we decided to stop client work and migrate our dashboards into the company website. That’s when things shifted. Since I have a background in data science + some experience with full-stack dev, I became the one spearheading the dashboard migration effort.For the next 6+ months, I’ve collaborated directly with the dev team, learning React, GraphQL, MongoDB, Docker, Task Scheduling, and D3.js on the fly. It was messy but fulfilling. We were building these tools with hope of scaling them into client-facing tools eventually.Throughout this, my boss kept saying I’d be the one maintaining these dashboards and owning future projects, especially because I had context on both the data and the dev side. I even got **another** project last month, again with the implication that I was part of long-term plans.Fast forward to now: all three projects are basically done. The dashboards work, the visuals take in prod data, and we’re just ironing out some small aesthetic issues + a rework of some GraphQL logic for one proejct. At 9am today, I get a calendar invite for an \"exit interview.\" No warning. I talk to my boss and he flatly tells me my last day is next week (August 11), and to have everything wrapped up and documented by then. That’s it.No full-time offer. No more extensions. No transition into another role. Just \"thanks and bye.\"Honestly, I’m kind of heartbroken. I poured so much time into this place. Took on projects well outside my scope. Built tools that no one else had the technical background for. I **thought** I was doing everything right. My coworkers were surprised to hear I wasn’t being kept. It’s not just me imagining this either. My boss has consistently dragged his feet on giving me a real answer about my future here.Truthfully, I didn’t even really \"work\" today. I spent most of it job hunting and planning to use up my accrued PTO before I go. I’m in grad school part-time (1 year left), which I think has scared off a few employers. And it's all starting to sting a bit... Especially since I've grown close to my coworkers and enjoyed the work. Side note: this is the second time I've been let go. My first job out of college started as an internship but was extended to full time. However, the company laid me off due to budget slashing post-covid. This time around feels very different.Is it normal to feel like this? To feel like it’s not worth pushing these final 2% of features anymore? Am I being unprofessional by mentally checking out a week before I’m done?I just feel burned out, a bit betrayed, and unsure of what’s next. Thanks for reading.",

        "content": "My company had mass layoffs back in April 2024, which I was affected by. I had been at the company for a little over 2 years at that point and had purchased a house in October of the year before. The first few months, I wasn’t that worried, I had rented out the house and was also doing Airbnb to keep the mortgage payments covered. I was interviewing and hearing back, getting ghosted, getting reached out to by recruiters. My former company had a career counselor program for everyone who was laid off, but obviously it yielded no success. Winter came, airbnb bookings were low and I really started to feel the pressure. April came around again and I started to just feel like a straight up failure.Anytime people would talk about CS (I did computer engineering tho not that it really matters) being a dying field now or just about how horrible the job market was, I just didn’t think much of it because I figured there would always be something.I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I was in a forbearance period for my mortgage but the forbearance period is over and I’ve missed 2 payments. I got a notification in the mail from my mortgage company with a pamphlet about “Tips to avoid foreclosure”. It feels like there’s a noose around my neck. I don’t know if I’m being dramatic. I don’t want to ask my parents (who I live with) for money because it seems like money is tight right now, but I know they would find the money if I did ask. I just feel so hopeless, it’s like nothing is working. I have no money. I don’t even respond to my friends anymore because I’m tired of telling them that I have no money. I’m in credit card debt too from the money I spent to furnish my airbnb. It’s like no one around me can even comprehend how much money occupies my mind. I’ve been going outside in nature a lot more recently and in those moments it feels like everything will be okay but then I get home and I remember.Honestly I’m kind of tired of typing so I’m gonna stop here, I guess I just wanted to vent a bit.",

I've had to do everything from the infrastructure, database setups, APIs, project management, UX/UI ab testing, optimization and scalability, server stuff, project management (think, massive social/ecommerce platform with tons of stuff on it and people joining and using), backend dashboards, random particular features of many kinds, managed small team of 3, sales, campaigns, so on.

Now, this was my first time, I didn’t prep as much as I should have, and I also have adhd so I tend to be slower anyway (i get double time in school and use it). So I’m asking, am I just stupid/bad at coding or is it normal for coding assessments in job applications to not give you enough time?",

My domain is mobile development.I feel I am able to get the job done for the most part, and it is mostly functionally correct as well. However, I always end up making mistakes that seem obvious, and that end up reducing all my work to a zero.Two instances come to mind, among many:1. I was tasked to create a bottom sheet using a Figma design as a reference. I got too caught up in the functionality, which I did implement correctly for the most part. But the bottom sheet was supposed to show over all the other components in the UI, which I forgot to do. My team lead reviewed the task and pointed it out to me.2. I created another bottom sheet that was supposed to have a certain appearance in both landscape and portrait mode. I was able to implement it correctly, and tested it in both orientations, as well as landscape -> portrait and portrait -> landscape (or so I thought). Later, it was discovered that despite my thorough testing, i missed the portrait->landscape scenario, leading to the UI looking bad. Once again, an obvious mistake that should have been avoided and pointed to me by my team lead.It is a problem because \"needs to get better at testing\" has appeared far too many times in my performance review which comes every 3 months and instances like these are cited to me far too often.We only get performance based increments, and because of this, I have never been able to get one, as I believe their perception of me is \"Makes too many obvious mistakes\".I have tried the advice of \"write down all test cases beforehand\", but as scenario 2 shows, even that doesn't stop me from making errors like those.I seem to have hit a wall, one that I can't get over.Has anyone ever faced a problem like this before? How did you overcome it?",

        "content": "I’m a junior studying computer science/data science, and I feel like I’m just drifting with no real direction.I’ve never done a coffee chat before, never had a proper internship, and while I do like coding, I only really enjoy the simple, creative kinds of coding projects you might do in high school: small, straightforward, “polished but not deeply technical” stuff. The more intense, algorithm-heavy, grindy SWE work doesn’t excite me.What I am really good at is managing, organizing, and coordinating. I thrive when I’m planning, running projects, and keeping people on track. Because of that, the only path I can see right now is forcing myself into a SWE internship to eventually move into a PM role. But even then, I’m not sure I’m cut out for any of this.I’m also an international student and currently in the process of applying for an EB-5 visa, which adds a whole other layer of pressure and uncertainty to figuring out my career.Meanwhile, my friends are doing coffee chats every week, interviewing, and already have internships lined up (some are even returning to previous ones). I spent my summers hanging out with friends, doing artsy projects, watching TV, basically nothing “competitive” or career-boosting. Now I’m feeling the weight of that.Part of the problem is that I’ve had almost zero exposure to what jobs are actually like. My dad’s retired and never really talked about work, my brother just tells me to “focus on learning and chill,” and I’ve never been in an environment where I could see what a day in a tech or PM role is like. Any time I think about doing a personal project, I feel like it’s pointless because there are already better versions out there and mine won’t be “competitive” enough.I just feel… lost. I don’t have genuine interest in what I’m learning right now, I don’t have a clear vision of what kind of job I’d like, and I feel like I’m already behind compared to my peers.If you’ve been in this position, what did you do? How do I figure out what I might actually enjoy and build toward it without wasting more time? Is SWE → PM really the only path if I don’t want to code forever? And is it possible to “catch up” if I’ve essentially wasted my first two college summers?I’m looking for honest, no-BS but kind advice from people who’ve been here before.",

I have been in software development for years at consulting companies where clients ask to develop certain systems for their needs which are mostly CRUD with complex business rules, rarely realtime. Most of those solutions do not need large scale system design, you may use containers, may be K8s if you are lucky. But mostly do not need hundreds of microservices, CQRS, event-driven stuff. Even if we have freedom of tech stack we are doing disservice to client and future developers if you did something complicated for resume driven development. While I can try and learn new design patterns, good coding practices, there is no room to build things at scale.But when you look at jobs posts, they ask for things like microservices, event-driven design, CQRS, Kafka etc. So my question to those who were in similar situation before, **how to gain experience building things at scale when your work do not need things at scale?** It seems I have been stagnant years without opportunity to involve in systems that need scale.",

Then he pushes for me to make the change in the same sprint by hand waving away \"it should be quick\". I take issue with this because more often than not, when working on the changes he wants, they turn out to not be as straightforward as he thought and I have to work longer to complete the story. It wouldn't be such an issue if I found out earlier in the sprint, but with him, it's usually like 1-3 days before the sprint ends and this is a noticeable pattern with him. It drags me down in completing the original task that was assigned to me and the story has chance to rollover and nobody wants that. I try not to take it personal, but it's getting harder. It's like he purposefully tries to put me in tight spots to try and get out of it. And it's not like I'm trying to not work. I just want to meet the original expectation of my story before going further and doing more work.

        "content": "Hey all!I’ve currently got 2.5ish years of experience as an SWE on the Platform team in my company (hired as a new grad in January 23), and I wanted to get a general opinion. In my current position it definitely is feeling like I’ve kind of hit the limit of what I can learn. We use a lot of SaltStack and most of my day-to-day is writing custom Python modules to set up small amounts of server infrastructure by executing those custom modules with SaltStack. More recently we’ve been using Ansible as well, but to me none of this seems like real software engineering work and I’m afraid of being pigeon holed into Platform engineering when I prefer more traditional SWE.My question is: how do I properly transition from a more platform oriented role to more SWE oriented? Is that really a thing? I’ve been trying to apply to jobs but every position wants years of enterprise experience in things like Spring, and it seems like the frameworks at this job aren’t used basically anywhere else. Is going to a startup the answer?Thanks for reading! Any advice would be super appreciated",

They were basically ambushing me with stuff i dont memorize, i was told this is going to be a python test, but then they ask, \"how do you add a middleware in fastapi\", obviously this is a pretty straight forward question, but off the head no one can remember unless you live and breathe fastapi.These platforms require webcam and mic to be on and the window will go full screen when test is on going so you cant alt tab and search for information. I was asked about big O of quick sort, which again off the head i cant tell. I do know whats a big O and i can give a few examples , just not quick sort, not off the head.At the coding assessment i forgot the syntax of Array's method(js). They were very much asking me obscure methods that are very rarely used. You have to be the kind of person who memorize the documentation to know all the available methods.Do i really have to memorize the documentation? For all those who excel at technical interviews, what should i be doing to not get surprised by questions like these.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm an embedded software engineer with four years of experience working on real-time embedded systems for aerospace. I am currently working on a product that has two programmable components -- software running on a CPU, and two FPGAs that drive several of our hardware components.I am on the software team, and in particular I am writing drivers for the FPGA interface, as well as the lowest level of userspace software in our product for driving certain components. The FPGAs have hundreds of programmable registers between them. We have ICDs for both that are quite detailed, but given the complexity of the interface, they don't answer every question that I have and I often spend a lot of time spinning my wheels while I wait for our EE team to get some time to look into those questions. Our EE team is incredibly understaffed and overworked, so I've often received the response that they don't have time to look into it in detail for me. I'm not sure what management issues are preventing that team from being staffed properly.After a while of this, my manager and I started talking about pursuing a professional training on FPGA design and VHDL -- enough to get me speaking the language. The idea is that, if I have a cursory understanding of FPGA design, I can find the answers to a lot of those questions myself and better bridge the gap between our teams. It would save the EEs the time that they would need to spend interfacing with me, and give me a better understanding of the hardware components of our system.The EE that I was interfacing with was largely against this, and wanted to get his manager involved when I asked him what he thought about the specific training program I was looking at. His argument was that it's a complex design, and that without years of experience he was worried that I would come to the incorrect conclusions and deviate from the ICD that they're providing. They want me to ask them to update the ICD with missing information.But that puts me right back where I started -- struggling to get assistance from them, and spinning my wheels. Am I wrong to want to peek behind the curtain, here? Is it really that dangerous for me to read the VHDL to determine what causes this flag to get set, or this part of the state machine to be activated? I know it's not the same as the sort of low-level software that I'm used to writing -- but as an experienced engineer, I feel like I have the ability to both understand complex systems, and to understand when I'm deviating from the intended interface.Is something social going over my head, here? Am I overstepping by wanting to understand their part of the system? This is really the first cross-domain engineering project that I've worked on.",

        "author": "fleethead",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey everyone,I’m hoping to get some guidance or perspective from this community. I’ve been feeling lost for a long time now.I'm 26 and studied Computer Science in Australia (where I'm from and live now) and have always seen myself as a systems thinker. I like to see how everything connects, not just code but tech, people, economic and social systems. I’ve had a rough few years between life setbacks, grief, and demoralising work environments. I feel like I've stagnated and lost confidence in my abilities, or never really developed them further than university level.I’ve held two jobs since graduating:* One was an \"application specialist\" role, mostly user support and QA testing - no real development. (1.5 years) \\[Australia based\\]* My current job is a support engineer role maintaining legacy WinForms tools in C#. I fix minor bugs, occasionally touch Blazor or SQL, but I wouldn’t even know how to build one of these apps from scratch. There's little mentorship, PRs only get reviewed by the boss once per week if you're lucky, and every other team member is spread thin. (2 years total, with 2x 5 month gaps in between due to multiple deaths in the family) \\[Australia based, but worked remotely for 9 months from London\\]It’s been a mixed, somewhat toxic environment. I was the only new person to last longer than two weeks in three years. My boss often humiliated me which wrecked my self-worth, and I find it hard not to feel panic that I’m falling behind while everyone else is moving forward.That said, I have done a few things I’m proud of:* At uni, I had a job building Python software for Raspberry Pi devices (e.g., an NFC security system, e-ink display widgets). I don’t have access to these any more.* I’ve participated in two blockchain hackathons (first a team of three which I led/did most of the project, and second I did solo), working with Solidity and JavaScript. Both times something went wrong at the very end and I couldn’t demo properly, but I want to revisit those projects and finish them.* I’ve also started writing about cybernetics, AI, and cognitive security/cogsec on my blog.I have so many project ideas, but I’m overwhelmed. I don’t know whether to double down on the blockchain stuff, explore AI/ML (I’d even go back to uni if I felt it was the right path), or start a new project using something more marketable like React. I often feel FOMO seeing the focused, driven people on this sub. I know I’m capable and think deeply, but I feel stuck and don’t know where to aim.I’ve also been able to find a few thinkers/leaders online who I look up to. In 2023 I flew internationally to a tech conference and networked with, met and conversed at length with the founders and staff of this company, which is probably the highlight of the last few years for me. This is the same company I did the hackathons for. In my mind, I’m working toward having some diverse portfolio that really demonstrates me and my strengths which I could present to any of these people and ask for mentorship.So here’s what I’m hoping you might help me figure out:* How do I find a path in CS I can truly thrive in, that makes use of my strengths?* Should I try to finish the blockchain project or start fresh with something more mainstream like a React app?* Is it worth exploring AI/ML or systems design formally? Or should I just build, build, build and let the path emerge?* How do I rebuild confidence and skill after years of support roles and a toxic work environment?Any advice or shared experiences would mean a lot. Thank you.",

Luckily the job market was strong and I was able to find good paying jobs. I even worked with a few people who did the same, or were even self taught, over the years. I have 8 YOE now.I've been at my current employer for 4 years now. But last year new management took over, and things have been slowly going downhill. I would be surprised if we made it another year at this point. So I've started applying for jobs. I take my time and tailor the resume and cover letter to the posting, and I'm only applying for ones that I'm a good fit for. Despite this, I get rejected automatically. My best guess is that I'm being filtered out based on my degree. Even when it comes to posting that say they'll take equivalent experience. Even if the job only requires 4 years of experience and pays less than what I currently make.The problem is that I have a family and a mortgage and all that now, so I can't just drop everything and go back to school. I could do online classes, but there's no way I would be able to finish a degree before this company folds. What do I do?",

        "content": "In 2026, I'm going to be a grad fresh out of college in Ireland. I want to break into high frequency trading as a SWE and had a roadmap set in my mind for how I would reach my goal in 2 - 3 years time. I wanted to have people's opinion on how realistic this is. Currently as part of my placement year (more like semester), I'm interning at IBM. I'm working on Db2 which is IBM's enterprise database solution. If I get a return offer, hopefully, this is what I'll continue working on. Now, I know to break into HFT, I'll need a lot of experience in C++ and I was hoping this opportunity would give me that. I have considered applying to HFT firms but I feel like I won't be able to make it past their interviews since I'm not prepared much in that area and also am quite inexperienced in C++. As Db2 is a database, I'm also getting experience in low latency/high transaction systems, solving concurrency problems. I feel like these are all skills HFT firms value. I understand I'll be lacking in the area of financial knowledge. After 2 years of working here, I hope to get a Master's done with a minor in Finance, after which I plan on applying to HFTs. Would you say this plan is realistic or are there some changes you would suggest? Thanks as always :)",
