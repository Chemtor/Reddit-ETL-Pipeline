        "content": "We are hiring for a data engineering position, and I am responsible for the technical portion of the screening process. It’s pretty basic verbal stuff, explain the different sql joins, explain CTEs, explain Python function vs generator, followed by some very easy functional programming in python and some spark. Anyway — back to my story. I hop onto the meeting and introduce myself and ask some warm up questions about their background, etc. Immediately I notice this person’s head moves a LOT when they talk. And it moves in this… odd kind of way… and it does the same kind of movement over and over again. Odd, but I keep going. At one point this… agent…. Talks for about 2 min straight without taking a single breath or even sounding short of breath, which was incredibly jarring. Then we get into the actual technical exercise. I ask them to find a small bug in some python code that is just making a very simple API call. It’s a small syntax error, very basic, easy to miss but running the script and reading the error message spells it out for you. This agent starts explaining that the defect is due to a failure to authenticate with this api endpoint, which is not true at all. But the agent starts going into GREAT detail on how rest authentication works using oAuth tokens (which it wasn’t even using), and how that is the issue. Without even trying to run it. So I ask “interesting can you walk me through the code and explain how you identified that as the issue?” And it just repeats everything it just said a minute ago. I ask it again to try and explain the code to me and to fix the code. It starts saying the same thing a third time, then it drops entirely from the call. So I spent about 30 minutes today talking to someone’s scammer AI agent who somehow got their way past the basic HR screening. This is the world we are living in. This is not an advertisement for a position, please don’t ask me about the position, the intent of this post is just to share this experience with other professionals and raise some awareness to be careful with these interviews. If you contact me about this position, I promise I will just delete the message. Sorry. I very much wish I could have interviewed a real person instead of wasting 30 minutes of my time :pensive_face:",

        "content": "Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about how often companies use Spark by default — especially now that tools like Databricks make it so easy to spin up a cluster. But in many cases, the data volume isn’t that big, and the complexity doesn’t seem to justify all the overhead.There are now tools like DuckDB, Polars, and even pandas (with proper tuning) that can process hundreds of millions of rows in-memory on a single machine. They’re fast, simple to set up, and often much cheaper. Yet Spark remains the go-to option for a lot of teams, maybe just because “it scales” or because everyone’s already using it.So I’m wondering:•How big does your data actually need to be before Spark makes sense?•What should I really be asking myself before reaching for distributed processing?",

I love the agency it affords me because I can own projects end-to-end and do everything in one place. However, I am sick of the infra overhead and bells and whistles. Now, I am not in a massive org, but there aren't actually that many massive orgs... So many problems can be solved with a simple data pipeline and basic model (e.g. XGBoost.) Not only is there technical overhead, but systems and process overhead; bureaucracy and red-tap significantly slow delivery. Anyway, I decided to try and address this myself by developing [FlintML](https://github.com/flintml/flintml). Basically, Polars, Delta Lake, unified catalog, notebook IDE and orchestration (still working on this) fully spun up with Docker Compose. I'm hoping to get some feedback from this subreddit on my [tag-based catalog](https://github.com/flintml/flintml/blob/master/docs/concepts.md#flint-catalog) design and the platform in general. I've spent a couple of months developing this and want to know whether I would be wasting time by continuing or if this might actually be useful. Cheers!",

We are looking for tools to replace pandas as our processing tool and Duckdb caught our eye, but we are worried about testing of our code (unit and integration testing). In my experience is really hard to test sql scripts, usually sql files are giant blocks of code that need to be tested at once. Something we like about tools like pandas is that we can apply testing strategies from the software developers world without to much extra work and in at any kind of granularity we want. How are you implementing data pipelines with DuckDB and how are you testing them? Is it possible to have testing practices similar to those in the software development world?",

        "author": "godz_ares",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey all,[https://github.com/RubelAhmed10082000/CragWeatherDatabase](https://github.com/RubelAhmed10082000/CragWeatherDatabase)I was wondering if anyone had any feedback and any recommendations to improve my code. I was especially wondering whether a DuckDB database was the right way to go. I am still learning and developing my understanding of ETL concepts. There's an explanation below but feel free to ignore if you don't want to read too much. **Explanation:**My project's goal is to allow rock climbers to better plan their outdoor climbing sessions based on which locations have the best weather (e.g. no precipitation, not too cold etc.).Currently I have the ETL pipeline sorted out.The rock climbing location Dataframe contains data such as the name of the location, the name of the routes, the difficulty of the routes as well as the safety grade where relevant. It also contains the type of rock (if known) and the type of climb.This data was scraped by a Redditor I met called u/AmbitiousTie, who gave a helping hand by scraping UKC, a very famous rock climbing website. I can't claim credit for this. I wrote some code to normalize and clean the Dataframe. Some changes I made was dropping some columns, changing the datatypes, removing nulls etc. Each row pertains to a singular route. With over 120,000 rows of data.I used the longitude and latitude of my climbing Dataframe as an argument for my Weather API call. I used OpenMeteo free tier API as it is extremely generous. Currently, the code only fetches weather data for only 50 climbing locations. But when the API is called without this limitation it has over 710,000 rows of data. While this does take a long time but I can use pagination on my endpoint to only call the weather data for the locations that is currently being seeing by the user at a single time..I used Great-Expectations to validate both Dataframe at both a schema, row and column level. I loaded both Dataframe into an in-memory DuckDB database, following the schema seen below (but without the dimDateTime table). Credit to u/No-Adhesiveness-6921 for recommending this schema. I used DuckDB because it was the easiest to use - I tried setting up a PostgreSQL database but ended up with errors and got frustrated.https://preview.redd.it/vkb85ebk7y6f1.png?width=661&format=png&auto=webp&s=38f13454a40df069957a5aaec7b2df111830c316I used Airflow to orchestrate the pipeline. The pipeline is run every day at 1AM to ensure the weather data is up to data. Currently the DAG involves one instance which encapsulates the entire ETL pipeline. However, I plan to modularize my DAGs in the future. I am just finding it hard to find a way to process Dataframe from one instance to another.Docker was used for virtualisation to get the Airflow to run.https://preview.redd.it/7rpquq7c8y6f1.png?width=1351&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c3720d0188006c25aabbf9931956bb63cf98637I also used pytest for both unit testing and features testing.**Next Steps:**I am planning on increasing the size of my climbing data. Maybe all the climbing locations in Europe, then the world. This will probably require Spark and some threading as well. I also want to create an endpoint and I am planning on learning FastAPI to do this but others have recommended Flask or Django**Challenges:**Docker - Docker is a pain in the ass to setup and is as close to black magic as I have come in my short coding journey.Great Expectations - I do not like this package. While flexible and having a great library of expectations, is is extremely cumbersome. I have to add expectations to a suite one by one. This will be a bottleneck in the future for sure. Also getting your data setup to be validated is convoluted. It also didn't play well with Airflow. I couldn't get the validation operator to work due to an import error. I also couldn't get data docs to work either. As a result I had to integrate validations directly into my ETL code and the user is forced to scour the .json file to find why a certain validation failed. I am actively searching for a replacement.",

        "content": "Hi !I know this isn't a UI subreddit, but wanted to share something here.I've been working in the data space for the past 7 years and have been extremely frustrated by the lack of good UI/UX. lots of stuff is purely programatic, super static, slow, etc. Probably some of the worst UI suites out there.I've been working on an interface to work with data interactively, with as little latency as possible. To make it ***feel*** instant.We accidentally built an insanely fast rendering mechanism for large tables. I found it to be so fast that I was curious to see how much I could throw at it...So I shoved in 100 million rows (and 16 columns) of test data...The results... well... even surprised me...[100 million rows preview](https://reddit.com/link/1lb13ep/video/yeivgrn7wt6f1/player)*This is a development build, which is not available yet, but wanted show here first...*Once the data loaded (which did take some time) the scrolling performance was buttery smooth. My MacBook's display is 120hz and you cannot feel any slowdown. No lag, super smooth scrolling, and instant calculations if you add a custom column.For those curious, the main thread latency for operations like deleting a column, or reordering were between **120µs-300µs**. So that means you hit the keyboard, and it's done. No waiting. Of course this is not for *every* operation, but for the common ones, it's extremely fast.Getting results for custom columns were **<30ms**, no matter where you were in the table. Any latency you see via ### is just a UI choice we made but will probably change it (it's kinda ugly). ***How did we do this?***This technique uses a combination of lazy loading, minimal memory copying, value caching, and GPU accelerated rendering of the cells. Plus some very special sauce I frankly don't want to share ;) To be clear, **this was not easy.**We also set out to ensure that we hit a roundtrip time of <33ms UI updates per distinct user action (other than scrolling). This is the threshold for feeling instant.We explicitly avoided the use of Javascript and other web technologies, because frankly they're entirely incapable of performance like this.***Could we do more?****Actually, yes.* I have some ideas to make the initial load time even faster, but still experimenting. ***Okay, but is looking at 100 million rows actually useful?***For a 100 million rows, honestly, probably not. But who knows ? I know that for smaller datasets, in 10s of millions, I've wanted the ability to look through all the rows to copy certain values, etc.In this case, it's kind of just a side-effect of a really well-built rendering architecture ;)If you wanted, and you had a really beefy computer, I'm sure you could do 500 million or more with the same performance. Maybe we'll do that someday (?)Let me know what you think. I was thinking about making a more technical write up for those curious...",

There are little guardrails and very little testing and it bothers me when I have to clean stuff up and show them how to fix it but the process I have in place wasn’t designed for so many ingestion workflows, automation workflows, different SQL objects and etc.I’ve been working for the past week on standardizing and switching to a full blown orchestrator, along with adding comprehensive tests and a blue green deployment so I can show the team before I switch it off, but I just feel like maybe I’m doing too much, but I feel as if I work on fixing stuff instead of providing value for much longer I’m going to want to explode!Edit:Rough high level overview of the current system is everything is managed by a YAML dsl which gets popped into CDKTF to generate terraform. The problem is CDKTF is awful at deploying data objects and if one slight thing changes it’s busted and requires normal Terraform repair.Obsevrability is in the gutter too, there are three systems, cloud, snowflake, and our Domo instance that needs to be connected and observed all in one graph, as debugging currently requires stepping through 3 pages to see where a job could’ve went wrong",

Fixed it by loading the model once and passing handles to workers. GPU usage dropped drastically.2. **CUDA + Serialization Hell:** Trying to serialize CUDA tensors between workers triggered crashes. Eventually settled on keeping all GPU operations in-place with smart data partitioning + local inference.3. **Auto-Hardware Adaptation:** The system detects hardware and: * Spawns optimal number of workers * Adjusts batch sizes based on RAM/VRAM * Falls back to CPU with smaller batches (16 samples) if no GPU4. **From 30min to 2min:** For 200K reviews, the pipeline used to take over 30 minutes — now it's down to \\~2 minutes. 15x speedup.**Dask Architecture Highlights:*** Dynamic worker spawning* Shared model access* Fault-tolerant processing* Smart batching and cleanup between tasks**What I’d Love Advice On:*** Is this architecture sound from a data engineering perspective?* Should I focus on scaling up to **multi-node** (Kubernetes, Ray, etc.) or polishing what I have?* Any strategies for **multi-GPU optimization** and memory handling?* Worth refactoring for **stream-based (real-time) review ingestion**?* Are there common pitfalls I’m not seeing?**Potential Applications Beyond Gaming:*** App Store reviews* Amazon product sentiment* Customer feedback for SaaS tools:link: **GitHub repo**: [https://github.com/Matrix030/SteamLens](https://github.com/Matrix030/SteamLens)I've uploaded the data I scrapped on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishikeshgharat/steam-games-data-40-gb) if anyone want to use it Happy to take any suggestions — would love to hear thoughts from folks who've built distributed ML or analytics systems at scale!Thanks in advance :folded_hands:",

        "content": "\"Start right. Shift left.\"Is that just another marketing gimmick in data engineering?Here is my opinion after thinking about it for the last couple of weeks.I bet every data engineer who's ever been exposed to data quality has heard at least one of these two terms.The first time I heard “shift left” and “shift right,” it felt like an empty concept.Of course, I come from AI/ML, where pretty much everything is a marketing gimmick until proven otherwise. :face_with_tears_of_joy:And “start right, shift left” can really feel like nonsense. Especially when it's said without a practical explanation, a set of tools to do it, or even a reason why it makes sense. Now that I need to get better at data engineering, I’ve been thinking about this a lot. So...**Here is what I've come to understand about \"start right\" and \"shift left\".** (please correct if wrong). **Start right**Start right is about detection. It means spotting your first data quality issues at the far right end of your data pipeline. Usually called downstream.But not with traditional data quality tests. The idea is to do it in a scalable way. Something you can quickly set up across hundreds or thousands of tables and get results fast.Because nobody wants to set up manual checks for every single table.In practice, starting right means using data observability tools that rely on algorithms to pick up anomalies in your data quality metrics. It's about finding the unknowns.Once that’s done, it’s way easier to prioritize which tables need a manual check. That’s where “shift left” comes in. **Shift left**Shift left is about prevention. It's about stopping the issues you found earlier from happening again.You do that by moving to the left side of the pipeline (upstream) and setting up manual checks and data contracts.This is where engineers and business folks agree on what the data should always look like. What values are valid? What data types should we support? What filters should be in place? \\---By starting right and shifting left, we take a realistic and practical approach to data quality. Sure, you can add some basic checks early on. But no matter what, there will always be things we miss, issues that only show up downstream.Thankfully, ML isn’t just a gimmick. It can really help us notice what’s broken.",

It’s eating me up.Right now, I’m torn between two paths:1.Data Path – I’m learning SQL and have asked internally to transition to a data role. But I have no prior data experience, and I’m not sure how much longer it’ll take, or if it’ll even happen.2.Automation + Playwright + DevOps Path – This seems more aligned with my QA background, and I could possibly start applying for automation roles in 3–6 months. Eventually, I might grow into DevOps or SRE from there.Here’s what matters most to me:•I want a high-paying job and strong long-term growth•I’m tired of feeling “behind” and I’m ready to go all in•I can dedicate 2–3 hours/day consistently•I have the urge to build something real now — GitHub projects, job-ready skills, etc.Part of me feels choosing automation means accepting “less,” but maybe that’s ego talking. I also feel haunted by the time I lost — like I’ve wasted the past decade drifting.Anyone who’s made a pivot after years of feeling stuck — how did you decide? What worked for you? Should I go for data role and prepare for it or continue in automation and I don’t know if I will be able to grow that much in QA?",

Right now I copy the .sql file, paste and replace, then run everything manually :clown_face:. I have looked into Git, and have been using it keep track of changes on this .sql file at least. No more \"funny_finance_sql_v1.sql\" and on!As for me, I can handle my own with SQL, some databases, some Powershell/bash, some C# from my \"learn to code\" times, Excel, Power BI, etc. But no actual programming/data engineering studies or experience.

Better *security features*: lineage tracking, RBAC, and edge protections.*Second test (run by me):*- Recreated equivalent tables in Redshift for the same 6-month dataset.- *Findings*: 1. Redshift delivered *50% faster* performance on the same query. 2. *Zero ETL* in our pipeline — leading to significant cost savings. 3. We highlighted that *ad-hoc query costs* would likely rise in Databricks over time.My POV:With proper data modeling and ongoing maintenance, *Redshift offers better performance and cost efficiency*—especially in well-optimized enterprise environments.",

Even in my projects, my colleagues and manager always compliment my data pipelines more than my ML-related work. I understand the math behind ML but when it comes to actually applying ML solutions for business tasks, I don't think I am that good at this.I have also been more successful on my job search circuit with data engineer roles than ML roles.

Our goal would be to re-write the entire ETL pipeline (*), turning into a ELT with the T handled by dbt. For the 95% of the times we ingest data from MSSQL db (the other 5% from postgres or oracle). Searching this sub-reddit I found two interesting candidates in airbyte and singer, but these are the pros and cons that I understood: - airbyte: pros: support basically any input/output, incremental loading, easy-to-use cons: no-code, difficult to do versioning in git - singer: pros: python, very flexible, incremental loading, easy versioning in git cons: AFAIK does not support MSSQL ? Our source DBs are not very big, normally under 50GB, with a couple of exception >200-300GB, but we would like to have an easy way to do incremental loading. Do you have any suggestion? Thanks in advance(*) actually we would like to replace DWH and dashboards as well, we will ask about that soon",

Our approach is *not* to turn it on across the entire database—only on a small set of high-value tables.However, I’m running into some organizational pushback. There’s a general concern about performance degradation, but so far it’s been more of a blanket objection than a discussion grounded in specific metrics or observed issues.If you've enabled CDC on SQL Server:* What kind of performance overhead did you notice, if any?* Was it CPU, disk I/O, log growth, query latency—or all of the above?* Did the overhead vary significantly based on table size, write frequency, or number of columns?* Any best practices you followed to minimize the impact?Would appreciate hearing from folks who've lived through this decision—especially if you were in a situation where it wasn’t universally accepted at first.Thanks in advance!",

My hangup is that the old CRM is claiming that they have no way of doing any sort of massive data dump for us. They say in order to export all of that data, you have to do it using the export tool within the UI, which requires going to each individual job and exporting what you need. In other words, for every one of the 5000 jobs I would have to click into each of these Items and individually and download them.They don’t have an API I can access, so I’m trying to figure out a way to go about this programmatically and quickly before we get charged yet another month.

The consequences of that arent that dramatic but in many cases led to strange spikes in some metrics that are dependant of these values. When viewed via some dashboards in tableau for example, the customer questions whether our data is right and why the amount of expenses in this or that month are so high etc. How do you deal with cases like that?

        "content": "Hi everyone! I'm working on a data engineering problem and would love to hear your thoughts on my solution and how you might approach it differently.**Problem**: I need to create a unique user ID (cb\\_id) that unifies user identifiers from multiple mock sources (SourceA, SourceB, SourceC). Each user can have multiple IDs from each source (e.g., one SourceA ID can map to multiple SourceB IDs, and vice versa). I have mapping dictionaries like {SourceA\\_id: \\[SourceB\\_id1, SourceB\\_id2, ...\\]} and {SourceA\\_id: \\[SourceC\\_id1, SourceC\\_id2, ...\\]}, with SourceA as the central link. Some IDs (e.g., SourceB) may appear first, with SourceA IDs joining later (e.g., after a day). The dataset is large (5-20 million records daily), and I require incremental updates and the ability to add new sources later. The output should be a dictionary, such as {cb\\_id: {\"sourceA\\_ids\": \\[\\], \"sourceB\\_ids\": \\[\\], \"sourceC\\_ids\": \\[\\]}}.**My Solution**: I'm using Spark with GraphX in Scala to model IDs as graph vertices and mappings as edges. I find connected components to group all IDs belonging to one user, then generate a cb\\_id (hash of sorted IDs for uniqueness). Results are stored in Delta Lake for incremental updates via MERGE, allowing new IDs to be added to existing cb\\_ids without recomputing the entire graph. The setup supports new sources by adding new mapping DataFrames and extending the output schema.**Questions**:* Is this a solid approach for unifying user IDs across sources with these constraints?* How would you tackle this problem differently (e.g., other tools, algorithms, or storage)?* Any pitfalls or optimizations I might be missing with GraphX or Delta Lake for this scale?Thanks for any insights or alternative ideas!",

We were rewriting the same queries, juggling multiple tools, and losing past work and context in Slack threads.So, I built **ToolFront**: a local, open-source server that acts as a unified interface for AI assistants to query all your databases at once. It's designed to solve a few key problems:* Useful queries get written once, then lost forever in DMs or personal notes.* Constantly re-configuring database connections for different AI tools is a pain.* Most multi-database solutions are cloud-based, meaning your schema or data goes to a third party (no thanks).Here’s what it does:* Unifies all your databases with a one-step setup. Connect to PostgreSQL, Snowflake, BigQuery, etc., and configure clients like Cursor and Copilot in a single step.* It runs locally on your machine, never exposes credentials, and enforces read-only operations by design.* Teaches the AI with your team's proven query patterns. Instead of just seeing a raw schema, the AI learns from successful, historical queries to understand your data's context and relationships.We're in **open beta** and looking for people to try it out, break it, and tell us what's missing. All features are completely free while we gather feedback.It's open-source, and you can find instructions to run it with Docker or install it via pip/uv on the GitHub page.If you're dealing with similar workflow pains, I'd love to get your thoughts!GitHub: [https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront](https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront)",

GREEN> PS6 has scaling, metal to metal contact. ORANGEThere are over 3000 of these. No structure, no dropdowns, just text. Right now someone has to read each one and manually pull out stuff like the location (TP14, PS6), what type of problem it is (scaling or pitting), how bad it is (GREEN, ORANGE, RED), and then write a recommendation to fix it.So far I’ve tried:- Regex works for “TP\\d+” and basic stuff but not great when there’s ranges like “TP2 to TP4” or multiple mixed items- spaCy picks up some keywords but not very consistentMy questions:1. Am I overthinking this? Should I just use more regex and call it a day?2. Is there a better way to preprocess these texts before GPT3. Is it time to cut my losses and just tell them it can't be done (please I wanna solve this)Apologies if I sound dumb, I’m more of a mechanical background so this whole NLP thing is new territory.

        "author": "eMperror_",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi,Our main OLTP database is an RDS Aurora Postgres database and it's working well but we need to perform some analytics queries that we currently do on a read replica but some of those queries are quite slow and we want to offload all of this to an OLAP or OLAP-like database. Most of our data is similar to a time-series so we thought of going with another Postgres instance but with Timescale installed to create aggregate functions. We mainly need to keep sums / averages / of historical data and timescale seems like a good fit for this.The problem I have is how can I keep RDS -> Postgres in sync? Our use-case cannot really have batched data because our services need this analytics data to perform domain decisions (has a user reached his daily transactions limit for example) and we also want to offload all of our grafana dashboards from the main database to Timescale.What do people usually use for this? Debezium? Logical Replication? Any other tool?We would really like to keep using RDS as a source of truth but offload all analytics to another DB that is more suited for this, if possible.If so, how do you deal with an evolving DDL schema over time, do you just apply your DB migrations to both DBs and call it a day? Do you keep a completely different schema for the second database?Our Timescale instance would be hosted in K8s through the CNPG operator.I want to add that we are not 100% set on Timescale and would be open to other suggestions. We also looked at Starrocks, a CNCF project, which looks promising but a bit complex to get up and running.",

Unfortunately, it seems like each engine can only adhere to access controls using its own primitives (eg. roles, privileges, tags, masks, etc). For example, as we understand the state of these tools, applying a policy in DB UC to a table in the Glue foreign catalog, will not enforce those permissions for Snowflake, when it attempts to query the table as a Snowflake external iceberg table.Has anyone succeeded in centralizing these permissions and possibly syncing them from abstracts into each engine's security primitives? Everyone is fighting to be **The Catalog**, and provide easy read from other engine's catalogs. However, we sense that even if we centralize to just one catalog, eg. Databricks UC, it will not enforce its permissions on other engines querying the tables.",

        "content": "I've been working as a software developer for the past 10 years. I've done a wide range of tasks, but most of my experience involves migrating legacy software to full-stack technologies. That also means I've been responsible for, and involved in, architecture and infrastructure decisions—so I've always tried to keep learning in order to make the best choices I can.The thing is, even though I keep studying and staying up to date with full-stack development, I can't shake the feeling that I'm just an average developer. I don't feel like a real software engineer. I often wonder how people reach the level needed to land a $200K job at Google. How smart do you have to be to work at Uber or Meta? I just don't see myself there. I work for an average salary at an average company, as an average \"senior\" developer—though, honestly, I don’t even feel senior.How can I become a real engineer?Is it even possible to reach the level of a Google engineer—or at least learn what I need to pass a Google-style interview? I'm not necessarily aiming to work at Google, but my goal is to become a real engineer one day.Edit: Thanks very much to everyone , I really appreciate you taking the time to comment and share such kind words and advices. I truly means a lot to me.A lot of comments out there make a lot of sense so I will work on that, thanks again !",

        "content": "I understand that documentation pretty much has everything you could ever want to know about a certain technology, but I personally HATE learning through documentation.I never understood the advice of, \"just read the documentation\", SPECIFICALLY towards beginners. Never worked for me. I feel like I've learned better and more effectively through having a MAIN course for something I want to learn and documentation as a SIDE-RESOURCE that I use to refresh my memory or learn new concepts quickly for a technology I'm already comfortable with. I want to learn the bigger picture, not just learn the modules in Node, and I feel like courses are great at explaining WHY something works and in what situations it is best in. I believe this is why I've enjoyed The Odin Project so much even though they heavily push on reading documentation. They don't just send you the link to JavaScript.info and tell you to read the whole thing, they give you little bits and pieces from the website and other websites for you to learn that specific concept and in their article they teach you the bigger picture of why you're even learning said concept and why the resources they're linking are good resources.Now, this is not to say that MDN, JavaScript.info, W3Schools and other websites are bad resources. I just feel like if my friend tells me tomorrow, \"Hey I want to learn HTML\". I wouldn't just tell them to download VSCode and read W3Schools. I'd give them different options like freeCodeCamp, programming with mosh's video, udemy courses, etc, and then they can read MDN to refresh their memory or revise new concepts. Or I'd ask them what their preferred method of learning is and we go from there.At the end of the day, not everyone is going to feel comfortable learning the same way. Which is why we should keep that in mind and not tell the beginner, \"just dive in and read MDN when you get lost\". I feel like a lot of documentation out there isn't very beginner friendly, or doesn't go slow enough for that person to grasp the why's and how's of that technology.",

        "author": "yughiro_destroyer",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello! When I started to learn programming a few years ago, I was introduced to OOP and I thought \"Woah, that's the best way to reason about data in programming!\". Over my experience as a programmer, I saw OOP to be highly encouraged in academy and to some degree even to my workplace. As I programmed more and more I started to hit tons of roadblocks that kept me from truly finishing my projects (mostly related to game development). It wasn't until I tried data oriented paradigms, such as an entity component system (ECS) that I saw better progress. With OOP, you have to plan very carefully how you plan your inheritance chain. You might initially make Player and Enemy inherit from Character but then decide that Player and Enemy share many things that you eventually make Player inherit from Enemy too. Then you also realize that Enemy should have a behavior you don't want Player to have. No matter what you do, you either load unused behaviors into the object or you are forced to rewrite the same code for two classes. Your object can't be two things at one. Let's say you have fighters, archers and mages in your game - three classes. At some point, you want the player to be both an archer and a mage. How do you do that without complex or ugly workarounds like creating another class named FighterAndMage ? Or FigherAndMageAndArcher. Code gets ugly real fast. Encapsulation is a useful trait for OOP to make code more secure but getts and setters can add a lot of boilerplate. With ECS you have a relation of \"IT HAS\" instead of \"IT IS\". An \"object\" is a collection of components (position, volume...) and a system is a function that operates on objects that have certain components. With this, adding new behaviors becomes easy plug and play, as adding or removing logic doesn't break the entire program. If I were to compare this to a real life application, OOP is like building a computer in one single circuit board - something breaks, the whole computer breaks. With ECS (or DOD similar paradigms) it's like building a computer from multile parts - if an SSD fails the rest of the computer keeps working. And refactoring or modifying an OOP class is very risky, especially if that happens to a parent class, beacuse there's no way how the children will react to those changes. OOP through composition is an alternative to inheritance and cleaner in my view but there's still some issues a pure DOD paradigm doesn't have. For instance, a composed class Button that is made of class Position and class Volume needs the method \"pressed()\" which in fact will act on those two inner classes. But if you change the Volume and Position, it could break again, and what if you wanted to share \"pressed()\" to another class like \"CheckBox\" ? Will you inherit from \"Button\"? It's possible but that causes lots of chains to follow that at some point becomes exhausting to keep track of. With an ECS paradigm for example the entities are self explanatory - it has that component then it's subjected to this action. I find OOP has use for creating data models or classes with unique behaviors no other class has. Or use composition to build bigger classes from smaller classes. How do you view this?",

I tried in my free time game development I was stuck because I failed to learn shaders (I couldn't build a connection with the logic) Also, I am so bad at designing 3d or 2D. I tried low level coding and contribute to open source projects I got bored fast,...etc. Also, I tried AI for some time got bored fastI don't know what to do. Whatever field I join I get bored or I be like man that's not my place.

Instead, I’m assigned random tasks across many parts of the company’s systems, mostly to avoid getting stuck doing just one thing.An Edit, Should I start game development for fun (again), and Will I be able to do something in game engines.

        "author": "Only-Stress7546",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "In high school (grades 9–11), I was the best student in my class at math. I really liked it and wanted to study higher mathematics.Now I’m studying Computer Science at university and aiming to become a software developer. My question is about the actual level of higher mathematics knowledge required for a programmer.Of course, math is essential, but the specific areas you need depend on your field. For example, machine learning and systems programming require deep knowledge of probability theory, statistics, linear algebra, mathematical analysis, and discrete math.To create new algorithms or be an advanced developer, you definitely need higher math.However, here’s my problem: I struggle to memorize all the theory presented in lectures. I don’t remember all the integration or differentiation methods. When I face a mathematical problem, I usually can't solve it right away. I have to look up the method or algorithm, study some examples, and only then can I solve it — which takes time.So I’d like to ask developers who regularly deal with advanced mathematics: When you're faced with a math-heavy problem, do you immediately know which method to use and remember the formulas by heart? Or do you also have to look things up and review examples?Also, will I fail an interview for a systems programmer or ML developer if I don’t know all the higher math theory by heart? What if I can't solve a math problem on the spot?Lastly, I’m worried that in real work I’ll spend too much time solving math problems, which might not be acceptable for employers.",

That’s part of what’s making this decision tough.On one hand: •It’s paid •I’d get solid work experience and build professional soft skills •I wouldn’t be left with an empty termBut on the other hand: •It’s not aligned with the software/dev path I want to pursue •I’m worried it won’t be the most relevant or impactful experience in the long run •I don’t want it to push me into an IT support career trajectory by defaultI’m also nervous about declining and not finding anything else. I’ve applied to a lot of places already, but nothing else has worked out yet, this one came unexpectedly.Has anyone else been in a similar spot? Is it better to take it just to have something, or should I hold out for something more aligned with development?Really appreciate any insight.",

I am learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript entirely for a large creative project that I have dedicated most of my life to.

I do not care; I just want a smooth implementation of my ideas.I am currently using a Linux VM on my windows pc to learn. I like the simplicity of it, the separation from my main files(in some manner) and all the bash stuff. I have two monitors. One I dedicate to the tutorials(windows side, because the VM runs videos and other things slowly) and the other I dedicate to all my practice and coding and all that. This has worked well for me so far, but I would like to know if this will cause me issues in the future.All my writing files for this project are in google docs or libreoffice, the former because I tend to write on a laptop away from home and need a way to keep it synced. Most of my non-coding development for this project happens on windows, as well as other things like browsing or playing games. My question is this: should I plan to scoot over to Linux permanently at some point? Should I dual boot? Should I plan to transfer my knowledge to Windows after this course is finished(Odin project, of course)? Should I dual boot? If the answer to these are “personal preference” I am completely okay with that. I am just seeking guidance, know the pros and cons for my situation, and I do not need Linux for the purpose of being marketable for companies(which is what people mention whenever this question comes up online, for good reason.)",

The problem is, my university only guided us toward web and mobile development, so I never explored other fields.Recently, I started learning Data Structures and Algorithms with Python, and I'm actually enjoying it a lot.

I bought all the codewithmosh courses for some direction and I’m using freecodecamp doing the full stack dev course. I’ve been retaining information fairly well although I don’t know if I’m overdoing it. I have all the time in the world and put atleast 6-8 hours a day towards learning and I try to apply my knowledge along the way. Long term goal here is being able to make very attractive web apps, bots and webpages, also do web3 dev work. Being able to just create my own programs instead of paying a crypto nerd thousands of dollars to do it for me. The “unanswerable question” lol. Realistically what’s the average time it takes someone to achieve what I would like to achieve with the time dedicated everyday. I was hoping I’d be half decent by the end of the year and a competent programmer. Not interested doing this career wise for a company, I just hangout and learn things.Also any tips you guys have to help me learn, speed up the process, filter out the bs etc I’m all ears.",

I have a dependancy upon these tools which i now find constrain my ability to write fresh code. Am i doing something wrong in programming? Ive been at this on and off for the past 3/4 years and i just cannot retain specific functions and libraries languages need to make some programs, and it makes me feel useless as a programmer. How could i transition from where i am currently to progress further.I have never touched programming books or any biographies, i have only previously tried to get inspiration from others code, developing off examples on libraries and writing stuff, getting to a point where i am stuck and reverting to AI, baffling my flow and resulting in lacks of motivation where i am supposed to be in control of software im writing, but it takes over and becomes another sequence of hoops i need to jump through to even get anywhere.Any feedback towards my situation would help me so much, im looking forward to spending an extended period over the summer to try to become the best i can be, an end goal trying to create a product with some revenue so i can fund a community project that ive wanted to do for a while.

In the program, it seems that it can't read it, or something, because everything except for case, the text and break don't have their colours. And when I put the cursor there, it says that I need to put a String or a println with String, but in the class I'm following it's nothing like that. And, when I tried rewritting, it didn't work.I tried making a new Class and wrote Sysout... without anything and it works, but when I write it pasting the Switch I made (outside or inside the Switch cases), the others won't change and the one I did prior to paste it, have their colours. It's super strange. A friend told me that it was probably a problem with the syntax of my lines, but I write Sysout using Ctrl+Space (to save time), so, it can't be a syntax problem.I'll try to write everything in advance so I can continue the class, but I want to know the real solution to this strange error, if it exists...",

However, I made a similar weather api project 2 years ago when I first started learning to code with SheCodes- a beginners course. Over the past two years I’ve done further Python courses, and a software engineering bootcamp with CodeFirstGirls where we went over JavaScript, Python and MySQL. Right now I’m a web designer for a law company - we can both use html bootstrap css, so nothing technical. I do enjoy front end so these qualities aren’t pointless to write on my cv, but I’ve been here for 13 months but I’m not challenge enough. I feel like I’ve gone backwards. Even this weather app seemed a bit difficult. The reason I say self sabotage is because I went back to JavaScript, something I began learning years ago. I felt like I didn’t know it enough so I went right back to the beginning rather than going onto react which I now feel like I should have. I never know how much JavaScript I should know before I move on. Also another thing that gets to me, is during my bootcamp, the instructors encouraged us to use ChatGPT. They said in their jobs they use it everyday and the skill is know what it ask and where to add this in your code, so some times I use ChatGPT but maybe more than I should. Is this normal? I’m also 26 in 5 months, and I’m on 31k right now. I honestly expected to be doing better and I just don’t know if I’m being dramatic or impatient.",

        "content": "I am really interested in computer graphics and low-level systems, and at the minute I am in my senior year of college. I didn't get an internship and all I am doing at the minute is working, and one thing I would really like to make is a raytracer. I am not necessarily a stranger to graphics, as I worked alongside the LearnOpenGL book and finished most of it up to the section on PBR. However, I am not sure if my approach to that book was the best and it ended up taking me a really long time to internalize the concepts, and even at that, now I wouldn't even know simple things like more advanced yet standard lighting techniques. To prevent wasting a lot of time and actually learn better, I was wondering what is the best way to read a programming/CS book/textbook? I am at the moment reading the Raytracing in a weekend series (going to read all 3 books), and then I would like to read the PBRT book. I noticed that there is a lot of given code and concepts in raytracing in a weekend, as well as PBRT, and I am wondering if I should just read it, or if I should be programming alongside it. Or maybe I should read it first and then try to apply it? but then by then I have forgotten everything.I dont know but any help I very much appreciate. I really want to get good at these topics but how I go about it seems to be the hardest thing to grasp.",

I know I should validate the input format with something like the express-validator middleware, but what about for something like a text-area where a user might have a perfectly valid reason for including \"dangerous characters\"? I've tried escaping/encoding the input, but at least with the express-validator `.escape()` method, this literally displays the output as encoded symbols. I've discovered that if I don't use `.escape()` and just display the content in the view either with the `.textContent` DOM method or with a templating engine like ejs, it will display the proper text content on the page and literally display any `` or other html tags instead of running the code inside of them. However, is there still a risk of an attacker manipulating the code on the back-end if I don't escape the input?Finally, I know I should use parameterization for Postgresql queries. Will this alone protect my database from SQL injection (I'm use node-postgres for queries)?Thank you for your responses and assistance.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "It's the summer after HS graduation, right before I enter my first semester of University in my Data Science major. I thought, \"Maybe I should learn code before anything else, get ahead, and make some time for math when I'm actually in uni. My 11th-grade Pre-cal teacher recommended learning code first even.\" There weren't many free online structured courses for learning Python that had hands-on practice but I did find Kaggle. I completed the short \"Intro to Programming\" course on there with relative ease. Some exercises were mildly tricky but I was able to get through them with minimal hints and criticism from ChatGPT. After that, I headed onto the main Python course. This was also relatively easy in the first few topics but when it got to lists, list comprehension, dictionaries, for loops and stuff, the exercises became increasingly difficult. The reading part before the exercises page weren't the hardest to understand and I even tried my best to truly understand the content. I would try a code first, see if it's correct, if it isn't, I send it to ChatGPT to see what's wrong with it without providing a hint to the solution, and try again. I'd even uncomment the \"q.solution()\" to see the solution when I'd given up after hours of head banging, trying to figure this out. I'd check out the solution, read through it line by line to see what the hell it's even doing and how it makes sense, not get it, send it to ChatGPT to explain it in practice, still get confused, explain bit by bit, go back, solve the same problem, move on to the next problem, and struggle with even getting *started*. I've been *especially* stuck on the \"Exercise: Strings and Dictionaries\" on problems 2 and 3. holy hell I can not even think of what to start with, I can not brainstorm. I've heard the advice \"just code dumb stuff that pertains to the problem, fix it, expand it, and slowly work towards the solution\" but I feel like I can't even code dumb stuff either. I thought maybe Kaggle goes to quick with questions that go from simple syntaxes, to abstractions of those syntaxes, and then abstractions UPON abstractions on those syntaxes that just overload my working memory. **Is Kaggle actually the problem? Or am I approaching this terribly wrong?**",

        "author": "Eagle_dev",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi everyone,I'm starting my MCA this year. Before this, I completed a BSc (non-CS), so I have no formal background in programming. My ultimate goal is to get into the AI/ML field, and I’ll have 3 years during MCA to build my skills.I’ve been researching roadmaps, and most of them recommend Python and strong math foundations—which actually works well for me since I studied a lot of math in depth during my BSc. So I started learning Python and brushing up on math side by side.I also spoke to my cousin who works at Boeing as a full-stack developer. He told me that full-stack/frontend/backend roles are getting saturated, and if I'm starting fresh, AI/ML is a better long-term direction. That motivated me even more to stick to this field.However, a friend of mine told me that companies don't just want Python developers. He said that languages like C++ and Java are often preferred too, and since Python is more \"readymade,\" it might not be enough alone. He suggested learning C++ or Java first, then Python later—which has left me confused.Now I’m also wondering—should I be open to development roles too? Like learning full-stack or backend frameworks (Django, React, etc.) along with Python and AI/ML stuff? Or should I just stay focused on AI/ML and not try to juggle too many things at once?Has anyone been in a similar situation—coming from a non-CS background and aiming for AI/ML? I'd really appreciate any guidance, suggestions, or roadmaps.Thanks in advance!",

The logic is rudimentary, but it’s been very useful in helping the team catch and correct user errors. I am leaving the team in a month or so, and none of the team has a programming background. I have set up the macro to run as a one-click XLAM within excel. But I would like to have the modules as simply readable/editable for the team to hopefully be able to figure out on their own once I leave. Now I admit that this is probably the sole challenge on writing code, but I am looking for suggestions from the community that has much more experience than me. Code-focused questions-What should be my approach for readability?-Should I prefer to separate the aspects of the logic into separate modules or subroutines/functions?Tutorial-focused questions-Should I write a tutorial on Word with screenshots?-Should I screen record myself explaining the logic?-Is unreadability inevitable if they don’t have a coding background?Just looking for advice, any resources would be appreciated as well.

What if that object is a variable size (like it contains an array, etc.)? What if the object is too small for the buffer, or too large?I'm on this path as I'm trying to learn how to process data as it is read, such as when you need to process very large files and waiting to read the entire thing at once is infeasable, or do work on data very quickly. And it would be good to know more than just \"File.ReadLines()\" or \"File.ReadAllText()\" (or the equivelent in other languages).",

AI really can’t do real engineering work. I think for the startup I’ve been working on, there’s definitely been moments where I feel like we’re going really fast but eventually end up in a point where we need to think of real engineering solutions (particularly in case of software startup) and get stuck. It’s good for the early stages when you need to validate an idea or get something out there but you do eventually hit a wall and need to actually start thinking rather than relying on AI.Vibe coding doesn’t create solutions that scale and exponentially increases technical debt if you’re putting no thought into what’s being engineered. Over the past few months, I’ve seen some terrible code written with single / long files and no kind of abstraction and modularization done in many cases. This makes it hard to actually build on top of what’s already written and certainly doesn’t scale. I think AI is pretty far away from replacing real engineers.",

        "author": "nysoxfan01",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "95% of this subreddit is people complaining about the job market or AI. The remaining 5% of actual advice is straight up garbage and completely outdated. Thought I would help out by making a list of things that will greatly improve your job searchAs a background, I have 6 years of Software Engineering experience and have worked with people of many backgrounds. I have never worked at FAANG, went to a mediocre school with mediocre grades, never had an internships or anything like that. But I have also never been unemployed. This isn't for the .1% of people, this is for the common CS man (or woman). And if you were asking, I'm a U.S. citizen in the U.S. market. If you are neither of those this probably won't apply to you.With that out of the way here's what I have gathered from my experience:**1. Apply to local/hybrid jobs in non-tech hubs.** Your goal is to reduce competition as much as possible. When I first started I would literally filter jobs on linkedIn to states nobody wanted to live in, like Ohio. You will be given jobs in locations that people don't even know exist. A lot of them have barely any applicants. If they are desperate enough they will hire you. Another tip would be to update your resume to have your location be within the same area, since companies might filter you if you are located too far away**2. Make sure your resume is concise.** When I review resumes I hate ones that have tons of wordy bullet points that basically say nothing. Don't dilute your resume with crap. Most people have 1-2 important projects they have worked on at a company and a bunch of filler work. Just focus on the important stuff and make sure it is clear what you actually did. Also PLEASE do not use arbitrary percentages in your bullet points. I hate this advice so much just put what you actually worked on. It doesn't matter how the business benefitted we all know that is the point of work.**3. Similar to 2, make sure your technical skills are concise** If you put every tool or technology it looks like you have very little experience in lots of things. Focus on putting skills that are needed for the job you are applying to. Another easy approach is to take the skills you are best at (say React), and filter only for jobs with React. Then do the same thing with Angular etc.**4. If you don't have any experience (or limited) YOU NEED TO DO PROJECTS** You need some way to show that you have some sort of technical knowledge or drive. You don't need a github, but you should have projects that you can explain how they work. This is especially crucial for internships. My company just hired an intern that was the CEO/Cofounder of a startup. Her startup? Building websites with other students for various people. Sounds stupid, but it got her an internship.**5. Just straight up fucking lie** I don't want to endorse this, but I just want people to know who they are competing with when they send out 500 applications without a response. We hired someone who had experience as a software engineer. But they accidentally told me they were a QA at their last role. I checked their linked in and they were listed as a software engineer. So yeah, if you work in tech support, QA, product. Doesn't matter, you were a software engineer**6. Same as number 5** This is more reasonable in my opinion because recruiters are stupid. If you have React experience and applying to a job with Angular, congrats - you actually have Angular experience. Same with Java and C# etc. The important thing is you are able to actually pass an interview for this stuff. It is worth it to review core concepts and maybe do a few leetcode problems in that language. At the end of the day you need a job**7. Interview advice: be honest but not too honest** When I was interviewing for a job I wanted they asked me a common interview question about a time I failed. So I told them a real story about how I messed up getting requirements and caused a delay in the release. I didn't get this job. The next job I applied to asked the same question, so I told the same story but rephrased it where product threw a bunch of requirements at me last minute and I had to work overtime to get things across the finish line. I did get this job. You get the idea**8. Do not negotiate** There's a lot of people on this sub that will scold you for not negotiating. But I have seen first hand peoples' offers get rescinded for negotiating, especially in this market. Just accept the damn offer once you get to this stage. Every job I've gotten when I negotiate I got $5k more on top of the initial offer which is not worth risking losing an offer over. I simply asked if there was any wiggle room and they gave me basically the same offer**9: For students: do not waste your time** Seriously, start applying/working on projects as early as you can. Grades hardly matter. I knew a dumb kid that had a 4.0. It didn't make a difference when it came to getting a job. He could have spent some of his time studying instead building a react app or something and gotten a 3.7 and been better off. Take as many easy classes as possible and focus on learning on your own time. Most CS classes I've taken taught be .01% of my current CS knowledge**10: Make sure everything is up to date, even when employed** Keep your resume up to date with your latest experience. Try to check LinkedIn/Indeed once a week or so. I've seens job boards get flooded with really good jobs one week, which all get removed the next. You never know when that next opportunity is going to be available so it's good to always be looking.",

Copilot in my editor, ChatGPT open in one tab, pasting console errors like it was a team member. But now? I’m kinda over it.Somewhere between the half-correct suggestions, the weird variable names, and the constant second-guessing, I realized I was spending more time editing than coding. Not in a purist way, just… practically speaking. I’d ask for a function and end up rewriting 70% of what it gave me, or worse, chasing down subtle bugs it introduced.There was a week I used it heavily while prototyping a new internal service. At first it felt fast code was flying. But reviewing it later, everything was just slightly off. Not wrong, just shallow. Error handling missing. Naming inconsistent. I had to redo most of it to meet the bar I’d expect from a human.I still think there’s a place for these tools. I’ve seen them shine in repetitive stuff, test cases, boilerplate, converting between formats. And when I’m stuck at 10 PM on a weird TypeScript issue, I’ll absolutely throw a hail mary into GPT. But it’s become more like a teammate you work with occasionally, not one you rely on every day.Just wondering if there are other folks feeling this too? Like the honeymoon phase is over, and now we’re trying to figure out where AI actually fits into the real-world workflow?Not trying to dunk on the tools. I just keep seeing blog posts about “future of coding” and wondering if we’re seeing a revolution or just a really loud beta.",

        "content": "Hey Guys,I finally got my first job offer since applying for the last 4 months, and the culture, people, and pay is great for my first job out of college. The only thing is that the majority of my job will be using COBOL/JCL and the more I learn about the language the less I like. I'm also not wanting to get trapped in a hole where the only jobs I'm qualified for are legacy systems or ones using COBOL. Tbf they said that they were trying to migrate off of it, but it will most likely take a long time before that can happen.I'm having trouble figuring out if I should keep applying to other jobs while I work this one or not look a gift horse in the mouth. I would feel guilty about leaving say a month after they finally train me as I told them that I had no prior COBOL experience and are willing to train me. Can anyone else give me advice about whether this experience will carry over to a new job or if I should just keep applying and leave whenever I get a new offer. Update: I took the job! Thanks so much for the replies, It's helped me see the job in a new light. A lot of you guys had some good points, especially about keeping a COBOL consulting job in my back pocket in case I need to fall back on it. Luckily I like the company and I'm really grateful that they gave me a shot even though my experience isn't in COBOL. I'm excited to start with them and like other people were saying, maybe I can get my hands in modernizing or working on some of their other projects while I'm there. Also to the people who saw this and were like duhh take it, I have some things that would make me very marketable to the field I'm interested in and got myself a couple of interviews for those companies, but there just aren't jobs for it in my state and I was weighing whether I can stay here and gain experience while being close to my family and do that in a couple years, or I should just leave now and try for that even if I have to move a little farther than I would like.",

What I mean by this is : A hobby project is exactly that a small, self contained app with limited scope. You’re not trying to build an enterprise-grade solution, nor are you expected to. And unless you’ve already worked in the industry, you likely have no idea what enterprise development even *looks* like.One Google search will throw you into a rabbit hole of 20 unfamiliar technical keywords, and suddenly you’re trying to engineer a business-scale architecture for a portfolio project. It’s not realistic and it creates a false impression of what actual preparation looks like.\"",

Joining FANG was a dream come true, after working hard in college. But over time, I started getting feedback that I was too slow. Eventually, I was put on PIP (and failed). It was tough pill to swallow since I had always assumed that as long as I delivered work, that would be enough. Apparently, speed matters as well.Post that chapter, I joined a startup. But, few months in here, I'm getting the same feedback. Management is again raising concerns about my speed and deliverables.It's a bit frustrating, since I do put in the hours. A typical day is like 7-8 hours, with 3-4 hours of focused work. But, when things get heated to meet deadlines, I find myself pushing the hours to 13+ hour days for stretches, to keep up.I'll admit I'm introvert by nature. I don't engage a lot in casual conversations, but I try to communicate clearly about anything related to my work. I document my designs, processes, task breakdowns etc - Anything that might clear things for the management, or, might help others for future reference.And, still I find myself tagged as a \"slow developer\". It's very hard and honestly, I'm not sure how to improve from here. This breaks down my workplace confidence completely.If anyone has been in a similar situation, how did you overcome it? What would you suggest to improve if you were in my shoes? And, are there alternative career paths I can explore?Edit - Since some people asked about situation based examples:\\- I was assigned a deliverable, which took me about 9 months (as single developer on the project). About 4 months went into testing, which wasn't even on me since the testing process was completely ad-hoc. Looking back, I could have communicated a bit better, but it would still take me about \\~3 months for that project.\\- In my current startup, since the last 5 months, I'm working on a totally different aspect than what my team's functional domain is. This required me to understand a ton of things to enable myself to start delivering. Also, since there is shortage of documentations, I mostly had to rely on people & codebases to get the understandings. This took me significant time, and was labelled as slow. Not sure what could have been done differently.",

We assume it’s a good thing because the US is a “rich” country and assume everyone else is extremely poor and desperate. We ignore that we have a huge cost of living crisis primarily driven by our insane housing costs no where higher than in Silicon Valley. The primary cause of our high housing costs are nationwide restrictive zoning laws that prevent the supply of housing from meeting the demand and making it extremely difficult and expensive to build anything. r/yimby has great discourse on this issue if you want to learn more. It’s impossible for Americans to compete because we would literally be homeless if we were paid equivalent salaries in the countries they are offshoring.

Hiring manager seemed impressed by my personal projects and professional experience, and the interviewers all seemed like smart and capable people. At this time, I'm also in a process with Qualcomm for a CPU LLVM Engineer position and they also seem very interested (though I'm a bit skeptical of them, tbh the team seemed very demoralized and overworked). At this point, Apple said they want to move forward and we're in the offer phase.I just had a conversation with the recruiter this morning just checking the team was something I was interested in and starting the conversation about salary expectations. I told him I like the team and I'm very interested in what Apple has to offer. However, when I told him I'm expecting something in the base pay range of $200k - $250k he seemed very shocked. He used the phrase \"strongly misaligned\" on salary expectations. I told him the truth: I'm currently making close to the middle of that range at Intel, plus stock and bonuses (about another $20-40k). I panicked a little when I heard that, so I backpedaled a bit and told him that compensation wasn't necessarily the most important factor and hopefully it wouldn't be an impediment to them making an offer. He said he'll need to talk to the senior hiring manager and get back to me.I have another call scheduled with him tomorrow to talk again, but I'm worried I screwed up. The online posting says the base pay range is between $175,800 and $312,200, so I don't think I highballed them or made a ridiculous offer. I understand experience may be a mitigating factor, but I'm still really worried. Intel has been doing really poorly since I started working here, and while I like the work overall and have a good relation with my manager, working with my team can be pretty exhausting, and the layoffs have taken a heavy toll. All in all, I'm ready to get out.Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks if you've read this far.",

Also I'm pretty much alone on working on projects, I feel like I have way too much responsibility. Sure I can ask help but still.I feel like I'm so done having to solve hard problems all the time, not sure if I will even be able to solve them.I'm kind of fantasizing about just working on a farm at this point.

        "content": "I have been a software engineer for 13 years now. I've been web frontend focused since 2019 since I took a liking to it at the end of my first job. Anyway, my career has had its ups and downs, but it feels way way down right now.My career was going pretty well until I got laid off in March, 2023. Since then I have had two jobs, and both ended poorly. I am currently unemployed yet again, but unlike previous job searches, I am not feeling hopeful this time.One of my last two jobs ended with being fired and my previous one ended with resignation. Both lasted less than 1 year. I felt productive at both jobs, and I made an effort to help less experienced devs. However, after a while, I would inevitably clash with leadership and not behave that well, and the reasons were different at the two companies.At one, I felt overly constrained by controlling product managers and wasn't able to make any code change that was not ticketed, since every single PR needed manual QA before being merged into prod. I felt that the React code was the worst I'd ever seen, such as ~25 components that were 1000+ lines long. One component had an ENORMOUS switch statement for conditional rendering that I badly wanted to refactor, but it wasn't a business priority. I also wanted to introduce tests since there weren't any at all, but it wasn't a business priority. Anyway, after trying to take initiative on these things and being blocked, I handled things without much tact, empathy, or whatever else is necessary to maintain good relations with people. Eventually I was fired.The most recent job I thought was going to be better. It took me 7.5 months to get it and I liked the industry it was in and the novelty of the service they offered. The code was better than at the other company, and there was more room to make code changes I felt were important to make (after making a Jira ticket myself first). About midway through I got to greenfield a frontend for an internal software overhaul, and it was pretty cool honestly. But then the head of engineering was fired and never replaced, and another engineer that I got to know somewhat was fired without backfill. At one point I was split between a new modern website the company was building and the greenfield internal project, which signaled that I was valuable, but I also couldn't handle it. We had only two frontend devs, myself and a more junior person, working on two huge projects, both rewrites meant to modernize software that had been tried and true for 15+ years.I was in a good position on the one hand, but on the other I just got burned out. Both projects had unrealistic deadlines given our dev resources. Engineering leadership felt non-existent since the fired head was never replaced. I couldn't balance the responsibilities with the rest of my life, which includes daughters aged 1 and 3.Then, since I was so frustrated by what was happening, I told the Owner/Founder of the company, who also wrote most of the original code, that we weren't going to hit the deadline, plus some other thoughts. He actually was open to what I was saying and he ended up convening a 2 hour meeting where we changed course with the internal project, and he thanked me for speaking up. I should have felt good about this, but everyone else on the project looked upset with me. At some point, it became clear to me they didn't approve of what I did for some reason, and they wouldn't tell me why, or in some cases talk to me at all. This became an unbearable situation for me and I ended up resigning.Throughout these two experiences, I had a lot of negative thoughts and kind of vented at people more than is helpful. Looking back, my intentions and my technical performance seem fine, but I just went about it all in a disruptive and heavy-handed way. I wanted to bring about change, but I didn't want to be patient in the process, and I assumed ill intent by others when it probably could have been explained by incompetence, ignorance, or simply an unfortunate set of circumstances.Now I'm in this all too familiar position of lacking employment. AI is ravaging all except senior+ positions, and my two shots at senior responsibilities did not go well on the whole. I can probably get there, but it would take more time than I have to invest, realistically. The amount of coaching, therapy, preparation, and practice I'd need to land a job, and more importantly to succeed in it, feels overwhelming. We don't have much help with the kids, and daycare is WAY too expensive.What's the path now? It's not like it once was where the only huge hurdle was passing an interview. I've failed at two roles now, even if I feel there were positive aspects. I've replayed the reasons for these outcomes dozens of times in my head, and the positive things too, but the poor end results remain.",

In Canada, 240K USD is a crazy amount, especially for a New Grad - it's about about how much Google & Apple pays for senior engineers.**Which offer should I choose?** I'd love to hear all of your opinions. Especially if you're a Canadian who has worked in the US before (and either stayed or come back to Canada after a few years).\\---**Edit:** Someone in the comments said that my usage of big tech was too broad. To clarify, the company I was referring to is one of the leading LLM model companies in the US. There's very few, so take your guess.**Edit 2:** I'm obviously just gonna put \"Software Engineer\" on my resume if I accept the Canadian company offer, not \"Tech Lead\". I'm 100% not claiming I'm anywhere near as experienced as a senior software engineer. This is just the title the company gives me, which is why I put it in the post.**Edit 3:** The startup is more stable than the US company because they've existed for a decade without firing/laying off a single person. I guess they're more of a small business than a startup since they've been around for awhile.",

I did work on 2–3 small projects, but the contributions were honestly pretty minimal(it was more about filling the gap while job hunting).Now I’m wondering:* Do I include **my current job on my resume** if I get laid off after just 2 months?* Is that better than keeping the freelancing gap longer? So basically saying that I freelanced from April 2025- June 2025* Or does having a super short job stint raise more questions than it’s worth?* Any other tips or advice that you might have",

I’m incredibly lucky in that way, and I don’t take it for granted.I'm finding that I'm really dreading work and I'm unhappy about it. The limited times I travelled I really felt alive. I want to quit and go travel, but when I consider it, I get very scared of what my life will be like once I'm done travelling. I will be out a year of experience and savings, possibly with an even tighter job market than we have right now. And then working while stressing my ass off about finances sounds like it would be worse than now.Does anyone have any advice? Even if the advice is that I have to suck it up",

        "content": "I waited a while before making this post because it didn't feel real at first, and felt like it could all be taken away. But it's been a short while so maybe I feel okay sharing now. Hope I don't jinx it.I was laid off in October of 2024 from a small consulting company. The company had been contracted at a \\[big tech company\\] for my first year there, and then work dried up so I ended up doing something else for the company. Though, \\[big tech company\\] legally requires that as a contractor, when describing work experience, you're not allowed to say you work for \\[big tech company\\]... you have to point out you are contracted by another company, at \\[big tech company\\]. In other words, my work experience leading up to my job hunt was:* \\[big tech company\\], contracted by \\[consulting company \\] (1 year)* \\[consulting company\\] (1 year)I have severe imposter syndrome, get stuck on Leetcode mediums, feel like I don't possess anything that really makes me special. I've **never** interviewed for a big company before, as I never imagined I could even qualify through technical screenings. I didn't do much job interview research either, other than the \"Blind 75\" lineup of Leetcode problems.I frequently see people saying doing X or being Y will ruin your chances of getting a job, but I went a step further and really made some major \"mistakes\" during my interviews. So here I was incredibly lucky that things worked out. So the point of this post is just to highlight the absurdity and randomness that can factor into your search. So just believe anything can happen, apply to anything, and be optimistic. Things I see around this sub that people say will hurt your odds, and I did ALL of them.* Two column resume layout* Not a \"top\" school, public (ranked 30-40)* Work at contracting companies* Told every interviewer that asked, that I was laid off* Late to an interview by 5 minutes* Less than average Leetcode skills (50 easy, 50 medium, 3 hard)But with each failed interview, I clearly knew where I was lacking, and took home lessons that I focused on hard for the next interview. For example, my first interview was with a FAANG company, and it was my first interview in YEARS, let alone my first interview with a big tech company. I was stuttering and stumbling over my words. The company is heavy on behavioral questions so I totally embarrassed myself. I started practicing my storytelling a lot.With the next, a medium-sized tech company, I was really enjoying the interview and things were going well. I scheduled each round 2+ weeks away to maximize my preparation time for each one. Just before the hiring manager round, I was told that another candidate accepted an offer and they were cancelling the rest of my interviews. Lesson learned: I should be prepared before any interview is scheduled, and schedule everything at my first availability.I ended up giving interviews for 6 medium-to-large companies, and received 2 offers. One from FAANG and one from a comparable company. It took me around 7 months – I just accepted an offer in April, and started working a month ago. Both offers were way better than anything I was making before, to the point where I felt relieved I didn't make it through the Amazon interview.I just want to remind everyone that luck is a major factor in the interview process. Good luck everyone, don't give up and remember anything can happen.",

It was literally my childhood dream - I finally felt like a \"real hacker.\" Then I jumped into the startup world as a backend dev and eventually shifted to managing their cloud infrastructure.Here's the thing - after 3 years across various IT fields while in college, I'm completely burned tf out. IT feels like endless chaos and bullshit. Both pentesting and DevOps have buried me under mountains of tasks and drama with devs and clients. The manual testing, red team engagements, and report writing are draining asf. My boss keeps pushing for more certifications.Don't even get me started on getting pinged at all hours because pipelines \"don't work\" - only to find out some dev forgot to do a proper build on their machine, the build failed, and they blamed the CI pipeline. Between the low pay at both companies and all this stress, I'm burned tf out.At this point, I genuinely despise cybersecurity, software development, and even the data science BS I'm learning at university. I've got multiple offers from banks and other solution companies in both fields with way better pay, but I feel paralyzed. I don't want to screw over the companies that gave me my first opportunities at such a young age. I want to leave on good terms, but I'm stuck.Honestly not sure what to do anymore. Maybe therapy? **TLDR:** 3 years in IT across pentesting/DevOps while in college, completely burned out despite good opportunities. Lost all passion but feel guilty about leaving companies that gave me my start.",

Got a lot of brutally honest answers (I mean this is reddit...). I now am getting the gist. 1. Resume - Short, compact, with metrics and targeted for a specific role. Make a few if you have to.2. LinkedIn - Use for connecting. Make it more generic.3. Applying - Use all the tools necessary, but write your own cover letter. Make it short and sweet.4. General - Its hard for most people out there. I know I am gonna have to switch from mobile to backend or something. Maybe I will try and my luck in the AI developer field... Anyways Thanks guys.

Worked pretty hard to learn programming, got a BSCS at WGU (bleh, I know) and here I am. The tech stack is mostly a mix of very old Java applications and some newer React stuff. Seems like devs are kind of doing it all - front end, back end, testing, you name it! It's fun and I've been exposed to a lot off cool technologies. I've mostly been doing the typical entry level guy stuff - add a GUI option to automate this database change we get hit with a lot, learn our no/low code platform and help us convert legacy apps to it, help us change this PDF export, all that kind of stuff. A few apps we maintain are getting moved to the cloud over the next year, and I've expressed interest with the managers in helping with that. Overall, it seems really laid back and everyones being extremely helpful as I learn and giving me more than enough time (and space) to do everything. I'm in a LCOL area, and the job is hybrid (2 days a week in office), I get great health insurance, and I'm just really thankful to have a job! Honestly, I love it. My coworkers are great, everyones so chill, it's a laid back environment, an absolute dream to me coming out of my last job. That being said, pay is on the low end of the scale ($60,000) and I get it - I have no practical experience. I'm ok with starting here and taking a pay cut from my last role, but I do have ambition. I'm worried that I'm not gaining experience on new and cool tech stacks, I'm worried about the no code app conversions. I want to grow, and level up my income.

        "content": "I need some advice.I left a job where I was working for 10 months due to toxic leadership, it was literally making me sick. I started a new one at a company that I heard amazing things about, how everyone was great and how leaders were super supportive, I was genuinely excited.I started in January, onboarding was a bit messy but eventually I figured it out, I had my first oficial feedback session on 09.04, all positive, a few things to improve but the official document statement said that I was on track to complete my 6 months probation. Ever since that feedback I didn’t have any other official feedback, my manager and I talked about projects, I worked on improving what I had to improve, all our conversations were positive. There was going to be a offsite next week - well this is still happening, but I’m won’t be there - where my manager were telling me things and activities for the team. She doesn’t live at the same city that I do, so Tuesday (10.06) was the first time we’ve met in person, we talked about the offsite, she was very friendly and then, Wednesday, on our regular 1:1, not even like a separate meeting, she says that I did not completed it the requirements and therefore I was no longer at the company. I asked for examples of what was wrong, she didn’t tell me, I asked why she didn’t say it before, she had 02 months to provide more feedback saying what was not working and helping me in what I needed, I mean, is her job too, she invested time, money and energy to hire and train me but ,she didn’t say anything either. It was a stab in my back, it is astonishing how someone can be so cold. I honestly have no idea, I’m reliving all my steps and I can’t find something or a little somethings that led to this. I even thought that it could have been homophobia, I’m bi and since this is pride month, when we met I was wearing some pride apparel, but I think this is a stretch.Now I’m here, on my CV there is a 10 month job and now a 5 months job and I’m thinking I’ll never find a place again cause who would hire someone like this? I am really lost, do HR really care so much if you look like a job hopper?For context I have a little over 10 years experience in performance marketing/tech and jobs where I stayed almost 4 years but still, this looks so bad. I’m also in Germany if that makes any difference",

        "author": "SheSaidTechno",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi everyone !In the French tech industry — especially in software engineering — companies relies massively on external contractors through infamous service companies called ESNs (between us, we call these companies \"les marchands de viande\" (translation : 'meat dealers')). But does this model exist to the same extent in the US, Canada, UK, Australia..., or do companies there prefer a more direct approach to hiring ?**Here’s how it typically works in France, and why it feels problematic :*** **Heavy use of ESNs (consulting companies)** : Most engineers work on long-term projects (sometimes several years) for client companies, but are officially employees of a consulting company* **Claimed flexibility** : Companies say it’s easier to end a contractor’s mission but the same is true for permanent employees on a trial period* **Supposed lighter HR workload** : In theory, ESNs handle hiring, but the client still interviews and evaluates candidates themselves* **\"Temporary\" reinforcement :** Most missions last so long that consultants become de facto internal staff but without the benefits or recognitionIn reality, the drawbacks are significant :* **More expensive** over time than hiring internal staff* **Little to no training** from ESNs : consultants have to upskill on their own* **High job insecurity** : consultants can be removed or relocated with very little notice* **A general lack of respect** : Many ESNs treat software engineers like interchangeable resources rather than skilled professionals. Since a business developer gets a 2000€ bonus each time he places a consultant on a project, some business developers may not give a fuck whether the mission matches the consultant’s skills or career goals or if the project is far from the consultant's home. And if the mission fails put all the blame on the consultant. Btw, since ESN have to pay compensations to fire an employee, their \"secret\" technique to get rid of an someone is to repeatedly relocate consultants across the country to uninteresting projects, hoping the employee will eventually resign on their own. But I won't elaborate on all the bad practices of ESNs in this post, because I could write a whole book on this subject.* **And definitely the worst of all : LOWER SALARIES** compared to internal employees with similar skills. Half the money the consultant earns goes to the ESN.This system creates a kind of vicious circle :low pay —> less savings —> more pressure to accept poor conditions —> repeatAt the end, I don’t see who actually wins here aside from the ESN profiting from both sides.**The English-speaking countries model (as I understand it)*** Companies hire engineers as full-time employees, even for short-term needs — it's the 'hire quick, fire quick' approach* There's less protection, but also more autonomy and transparency* Workers can earn higher salaries because there’s no intermediary between them and the employerTo me, this seems healthier even if it’s more unstable.But maybe it's just an impression, so I’d really like to know : Is this accurate ?**To sum up, my questions for engineers in English-speaking countries :**1. Do companies rely heavily on contractors, or is direct hiring the norm ?2. Are there equivalents to the French-style ESN system ?3. Does the “hire quick, fire quick” approach actually make the work more efficient ?I’m asking all this out of curiosity and a bit of frustration. This is quite a hot topic in France. Here, the current system seems to serve the interests of consulting firms more than the people actually doing the work. So I wonder : is the “Anglo-American” model actually better, or does it simply have different drawbacks ? Because honestly, if the French model turns out to be significantly worse for building a career, I'm seriously considering moving abroad to have a decent quality of life.Looking forward to reading your perspectives.Thanks in advance!",

Why should they program in natural languages over the programming languages they are already productive in? It, also, causes learning loss in new programmers like handing a calculator to a kid learning arithmetic.If you are selling the ability to program in natural language to non-programmers, you need a much more mature product that generates and maintains production-grade code because non-programmers don’t understand architecture or how to maintain or debug code.If you are selling the ability to automate repetitive tasks, how is GenAI superior to a vast amount of tooling already on the market?The only application that makes sense to me is a “buddy” that does tasks you are not proficient at - generating test cases for programmers, explaining code etc. But, then, it has limits in how good it is.It appears companies have decided to buy into a product that is not fully mature and can get in the way of getting work done.

On the other other hand, I'm single. I currently live in 1500 square feet for $1600/month, my car doesn't get that much more expensive, and I buy nice toys that get 4% more expensive in California than not California. Sales tax. If I had a family, this would be insane, but I've always been working too hard not to get fired to ever go on a date. Or dealing with the resulting health issues.I'm also worried about RTO at the remote place which would just put me in SF anyways, but with less money.",

I thought I did badly because I didn’t actually have any working code but walked through my thought process. I actually passed and moved on to the next step.The next step is 1 technical screen, 2 coding, 1 architecture and design, and a behavioral interview. So what should I expect for the next coding interviews? I’m sort of confused because they say study LeetCode problems, but they also said that for the last interview, and that wasn’t LeetCode and was more JavaScript problems. Also, if they are LeetCode, do you have to have a working solution to continue, or is talking through the code and writing some code enough? I’m not good with LeetCode; this is the first time I have ever done this before. I never did them in college. What should I expect? Is this supposed to be extremely more difficult?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I graduated 3 years ago, it's a bit of a personal story, and one that I'm honestly not sure how to share with an employer but here it is (the story can be skipped as I don't know if it's relevant to my situation, regardless of why, I haven't been employed in industry for 3 years):At around the time of my graduation date I stumbled across the Amber Heard Johnny Depp trial. Amber Heard really reminded me of my brother but I wasn't sure why. As she got diagnosed with NPD and BPD I looked into it and the covert narc description happened to completely match my brother.I had a lot of mental health challenges growing up but I managed to keep it together when it came to my education. Got A\\* Maths, A\\* Computer science A-levels, graduated CS with a First-Class Integrated Masters from a reputable university. But when I came across this piece of news my whole world flipped upside down. So many things started to make sense and I went through a wild emotional rollercoaster. Hadn't cried in 10 years since I was 13 but for at least 2 weeks I would be weeping 6hrs/day and I honestly didn't know what to make of my life. I had to get a job fast after graduating since I didn't want to live back home so I got hired at McDonalds. My mental health was fragile during this time and it took me 6 months to get a job in retail. Only a year after that had I actually started applying to CS jobs.As soon as my CV hit the market I started getting calls from recruiters, at least 2 calls/week. I started making some progress with some companies but a friend of mine from McDonalds hit me up and convinced me to start a business. It's a long story with him, but basically he came to the UK by selling his business for 40K pounds. He had a small thing where he bought bicycle parts in some dodgy auction and used them to make bicycles and sell them. He worked at McD to earn the rest of what he needed to pay off his tuition fee (he had to pay 21K/year as he was not from the EU/UK). I resonated with the idea of being self-employed and the guy seemed competent enough and I thought YOLO, why not.3-4 months into that whole process I realised I really craved some financial security and it'd be a waste not to use my degree. So I quit and started applying to jobs again. I got very close with a video game apprenticeship (was the 11th applicant out of 300 but they only had 10 positions). And I also got an interview for a job through a uni connection that went really well. I had been given a call and was told that I have the job! just have to be on the lookout for HR to contact me. No contact, I stayed in touch via email and eventually called and the hiring manager told me he doesn't know what's happening and the job seems to be in the air. He's signed everything and so has his boss he is just on lookout for the final business approval. He told me he'll contact me if anything changes, so I can only assume nothing changed.After this whole foray I was a little bit low and my friend sweeps in again to offer me to start our own thing. Great timing. Won't go into the details of that but we did a lot of work but were delayed by waiting for my passport to arrive from Romania to the UK as we needed ID to start the business bank account. Just when we were starting to do outreach and get some customers the guy started behaving very poorly towards me. Very passive aggressive, would tell me to do shit for him, etc. When I confronted him about it he called me sensitive, etc. I just couldn't deal with that kind of behaviour so we split up.It's been a while at this point since I actually graduated and I learned so many things about myself. I thought for a while maybe I don't want to do CS and I went on to try to be self-employed. It turns out I'm a little too fragile for that at the moment, I don't quite have enough self-determination for it and I've lived for 2.5 years in a constant state of anxiety (as my current workplace is quite toxic and demanding as well). I just need a little bit of breathing room and some financial stability to pull myself together enough to actually attempt something like that.This brings me to now, 3 years later, applying to jobs yet again but now I'm honestly worried since it seems like the market is not in a great place, and my gap is getting quite large.Is there any point in me applying to CS related jobs at the moment? Does anyone have any advice for how to stand out in this market given this disadvantage?",

Think of agents as software systems that use AI to perform tasks on behalf of users or other systems. Agents let you tell them what you want (often in natural language), and do things like scour the web (and various data sources) and summarize results, engage in deep research, write code, find anomalies, highlight interesting insights, translate language and code into other variants, and automate a lot of tasks that consume our time. ... As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.What are your thoughts on this memo?",

        "content": "Hi everyone, just like every other new grad in CS right now I'm struggling to find full time. I managed to get 2 years of internships during my bachelors (1 year at AMD, 1 year another lesser known company) hoping it'd give me an edge but I'm not finding success at all here in Canada, after around 400 applications I've been given like 4 technical assessments and 1 interview only. While I know I'll be spammed with '400 isnt nearly enough' I still want to do what I can to improve my odds, of course I am still applying and will continue to till I get something.I have heard its better to look in the US. I was already considering this due to having a lot of family in NY and was applying from linkedIn to both Canada and NYC. I know to check the 'authorized to work here' as yes and to check 'sponsorship needed' as no (then later explain that you're a Canadian and a TN visa is far easier) but despite that I've only gotten 1 response from the US. I'm sure my resume isn't perfect, but I've had some Sr engineers that I've gotten to know over the years as well as a recruiter I know well look it over and say its quite good for a new grad especially the 2 years of industry experience so I don't think its holding me back.I've heard someone mention to apply to US from LinkedIn you need to buy a US phone number or you get filtered instantly. Furthermore I've noticed of course my LinkedIn profile has my location as within Canada, I figure I'd have to change this too but currently I'm applying everywhere in Canada and in NY and I worry doing that will then blacklist me from Canadian roles and I just don't know if that's a good idea? I also worry that maybe thats just uneeded steps and has nothing to do with why I'm hearing nothing from the US applications.Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated. While I would love to be picky with a job the reality is I'm graduating in a few days and I need income asap to support myself and start my career, at this point I just want to break into the industry idc where or the salary I just need to get my foot in the door.",

For this purpose, I considered looking for a job there, or getting a remote job that pays over  $65k a year(digital nomad visa requirement). I didn't have too much luck with either of these so far.So in the meantime, I decided to simply use the time to grow my career. My current job is kinda badly paid, no raises whatsoever, but besides that, I really like it, and I have become very efficient at doing my tasks, which leaves me with plenty of time to learn new things, and work on personal projects. I was also going to pursue a master's degree.But I've been contacted by a fintech company, and I'm at interview 4/4, going great so far. I am quite interested, because I know that finance is one of the best domains in terms of both learning high performance C++, optimization, multithreading(I'm a nerd for these) AND high salaries. The given salary range isn't great considering that it requires relocation to a place with hellish cost of living, but I'm trying to think long term here, it's probably better than telecom, based on my research. I'd probably need to give up on the master's degree for now though, since I might not have much free time in this new position. The tuition cost is also much higher there, which puts me off.**TL;DR** which would have more positive impact on my employability(particularly for the South Korea market): staying at chill job while pursuing a master's degree and doing personal projects OR switching jobs to fintech?",

        "content": "Hi,my current software development job requires me to work with three different repositories, each is in different programming language, each has it's own micropatches, tweaks and peculiarities.Our testing flow for new features basically requires me to run code from one repo, to use stuff that was built locally in other repo, and third repo is basically a locally hosted backend. The thing is: patching and making a small change here in there is required, just so I can then easily analyze the results and the whole flow can actually run without problems.Also, the testing results need to be noted down manually...In some cases I had opened at least five different VS Code instances opened, each with multiple files opened st once. I am not counting the browsers and other apps.I find this extremely exhausting and tiresome to even test one feature since everything needs to be in sync. This really makes me lose my sanity with each flow I run, show to the general public at work, but then I actually need to correct my findings since I noticed a bug in one of the patches in one of the repos. I don't think if I should waste so much time with running that testing flow, where it is mostly expeced of me to create new features and fixes, not to struggle to manage mentally my attention between that many windows.In most of my career, or even in my free time programming - I mostly end up working comfortably and window-exhaustion never gets me. This current job I have pays extremely well, but chaos in the work organization is scary.Am I just bad with multitasking and juggling between repos? Is this normal? I don't have a comparison and I really don't know how to deal with it, can anybody relate or suggest what is wrong here, and how can I help myself?",

        "content": "Hello I am IT consultant specializing in data engineering. In this topic, I would like to know what effective communication or soft skillsmeans to you, how to practice it and how to present it. During each half or full year evaluation, my direct manager comes to me with feedback on what the client(s) and other colleagues (usually senior managers) have said about me - it is always along these lines: technically exceptional but should work on communication. I tried to ask what does it mean but got only vague answers.On my part, I am always nice and open to other people - at least thats what I think of myself, but sometimes I have to draw a thick line when, for example: someone entrusts me with a task that goes beyond my competence or scope of duties - think of setting up infrastructure, when its managed by client infra team and I got no permissions. Of course, I do not say \"no\" leaving the person alone with the problem, I suggest who can help and how to do it, sometimes I even engage people to help. I have the impression that any objection, which is not really an objection, and I really cannot do certain things myself, is perceived as my flaw. Of course, it doesn't work the other way around - sometimes people, like the product owner from the client's side, doesn't speak kindly to me, or uses micromanagement but it's fine, no one pays attention to it, arguing \"it is what it is, he was probably nervous\". If the situation were reversed, I would probably be removed from the project. Often, even despite previous suggestions that something might go wrong, my opinion is ignored until the thing happens and then there are complaints about it. Here I come to the conclusion that communication is simply taking everything upon yourself, nodding to everything (being a yes-man) and pretending that everything is going well, even when it isn't? I don't think so, that's why I'm asking you. I would be grateful for any feedback and materials regarding soft skills and communication.",

Recently I've become a bit disillusioned with the direction my current employer is being run and got 3 more cold-calls, all for the same job I mentioned before. I engaged with all 3 and confirmed they're all the same role, although each agency has given me a different salary expectation/range. I ended up following through with the one that paid the most, but should I have countered the other recruiters with the higher offer to try and get a bidding war started? The salary is in the middle of their bands for a senior dev and is 50% more than what I currently get paid, which I'm fairly happy with. I had the final interview yesterday and am just waiting on the verdict and potential offer to come through (they've already asked me for referees).",

I’m a full stack software engineer at a midsize non-tech company (but still well known) with 4.5 YOE (1.5 YOE in data analysis before that, so I guess 6 YOE total). I’ve been cold applying for remote software engineering roles but I’m not really getting any bites. I know the remote market is insanely competitive right now, but I’d really like one and I’m only considering switching roles if the new one is remote.For some more background, I have an unrelated bachelors from an Ivy League school. I have a feeling that this is one of the main reasons I’m not getting much traction - I’m probably being filtered out immediately at a lot of places for not having a CS degree, especially in this market. I was getting a good chunk more interviews 2-3 years ago.Lately, I’ve been contemplating doing a MSCS to make up for that shortcoming. Last year, I got accepted into GT OMSCS but I decided to not attend after thinking heavily about the time commitment. It would’ve taken me about 3 years and I would’ve completely had to sacrifice my quality of life due to the programs rigor. I have a wife and now a baby on the way, and my wife and I are ready to expand our family even further in the short term future, so I just didn’t think it was worth the sacrifice. Plus, now it’s been a year so my offer of admission is no longer valid anyway.Here’s the thing. WGU just came out with an MSCS that I think I can get done in 6 months, if not a year. That time horizon and day-to-day commitment is a lot more palatable to be honest. Also, my employer is willing to pay for it 100%.All that said, do you think it’s worth it for me to do the WGU MSCS so that I can meet the CS degree requirement at a lot of places/avoid getting filtered out early in the process? The way that I’m thinking about it is that I can always take it off my resume if I feel it’s causing a negative impact on my profile. What do you guys think? Would it be beneficial to my profile or make it worse? At this point, it’s either WGU MSCS or nothing - I’m just at a point in my life where I’m done with higher education otherwise and want to focus on life itself, so I’m not considering any other masters programs.I do have 3 YOE working remotely due to COVID and I’ve reflected that on my resume, plus some promotions, so I don’t think it’s a track record issue.",

        "content": "Hello. I've been working for around 2.5 years in a startup as a senior backend engineer.When I started, we were 2 on the team, under the CTO. 1 person left. We hired someone terrible, and we didn't continue with him after a few months. I proposed to not replace this person with anyone because the workload was ok-ish just for me. I was the only backend engineer for more than one year, managing (successfully) around 1/3 third of the product (several microservices etc).During this period, the CTO was changed because of investors' wishes. A few months back, we hired a couple of more people for my team, but they are nowhere close to my productivity or domain knowledge, and are on-par or below my general technical knowledge. I get along with everyone, I have good communication skills, and I've gotten 2 raises during this time. This is why I was expecting to become a Tech lead when it was time to have one.Unfortunately, we (i was included in the call) are interviewing for an external technical lead. This has been extremely disappointing. When asking my CTO, he said that they wanted someone with experience in leading teams who could effectively help with the refactors that we need, and so on.I'm more than capable (or at least that's what i think) of planning and managing long projects and make them happen through incremental steps, but this new CTO has never let me do that because he always proposes more long-term, breaking refactorings. So we are kind of stuck in urgent things and bugs (that obviously should not happen on the first place) and not moving forward with the important topics.I have the impression that they (the CTO and the CEO) have already made the decision not to count on me to promote to teach lead, because otherwise they would have, at least, spoken with me about what I'm not good at or something.So Im wondering if it make sense to push for it anyway. For example, writing a detailed technical proposal of the refactors that we need, and having another conversation with my CTO. But one part of me thinks that this would be a waste of my time and would only lead to an uncomfortable conversation in which no one wins. What do you think? Any similar experience? Thanks!",

        "content": "Hiya! I currently hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Art and have been working as a front-end engineer for three years at a large company. I love my job and am learning so much every day. My BA in CS didn't teach me much about front end (react, graphql...) but I have had so much fun learning these things :)I feel like I've hit a learning plateau, though, and many people my age are pursuing masters degrees or attending other types of schools. I feel like traditional CS masters programs are pretty CS foundations focused (i.e algs, data, machine learning) and I don't see many that focus on user interfaces... I also stalked all of the senior engineers I work with, and none of them have masters. I advocated for myself in the workplace and get to work on the UI for internal tools which is fun.I currently live in SoCal and don't want to move for a full-on in-person program. Is it even worth it to get a masters? I've found some certificate programs and I believe my company will pay up to $700 per credit. If I were to look for more sr roles with my CS degree already, would a certificate help? When the time comes for me to jump for a sr role I would have at least 5+ years of experience.I just want to really be a front end engineer who really works on making beautiful UIs that are easy to use, accessible, and look great. I feel lost :/ any advice would be really helpful <3 Thank you!I couldn't post in /frontend for some reason :/ so I'm hoping for some advice here if thats okay",

        "content": "\\[23M\\]Reviews were done in-person with the CEO in which we would review our self-evaluation, our manager's valuation, and go over logistics such as bonuses and raises.Good news: I got \"Exceeds all expectations\" for all of the categories. Manager's feedback was thoughtful and mostly glowing (\"\\[Me\\] demonstrates exceptional breadth; eagerly dives into new languages, SDKs, and frameworks, often delivering functional features very quickly.\", \"\\[Me\\] is exemplary in client follow-ups; responding within four business hours and documenting decisions clearly.\"). Criticisms were small things, presumably because they have to write something down for that (\"Make sure every demo and screen-share is up and running before the guest joins\", \"Sometimes shows visible frustration when stakeholders pivot\" \\[who doesn't lol\\]).Bad news: did not get a bonus, or a salary increase. CEO explains that usually X% of profit is reserved for the employee bonus pool, but it was a bad year for company so this year the bonus pool was 0. Salary increases were only for promotions.Although this technically means I'm being paid less, it could be worse. My understanding is that not doing bonuses or salary increases is just one of the ways companies use to avoid having to fire people. Sucks because I was already being paid below market rate, but oh well. I plan to job-hop in the next year anyways.",

        "content": "I decided last year in my fourth semester that I had absolutely no interest in actually staying in CS and that I should not have listened to my parents and my peers trying to pressure me into continuing instead of retraining in some other discipline. Unfortunately, I couldn't have changed my major without staying for another year and spending a lot of money, so I stayed on until I graduated in May.I figured out that the field that is the most appealing to me is social work. I like helping people, and social work is also a terminally under-staffed field so even if the pay isn't great, I'll always have something to do. This would require me to get a MSW, which I'm aiming to start in 2026.It occurred to me when talking to other people who majored in Computer Science that a lot of other students also don't have much interest in continuing down this field. Some of the people I met in CS have not made a program without ChatGPT since 2022, and have no projects, internships, or job experience. It also occurred to me that a lot of CS subreddits don't offer great advice, giving platitudes that the job market will soon improve, or just advising to continue grinding Leetcode and applying to more entry-level positions.If anyone is interested in a community for people who are looking to do something besides CS- whether going to grad school, or finding an unrelated job, I made /r/leavingCS. Would anybody be interested in a subreddit like this? I also likely need moderators and people who can help out with providing resources on what to do for people in this situation.",

I applied to over 2-3k applications with a potential mill degree and received 4 interviews over the course of 1+ years. My resume had been posted many times and after a while wasn’t much to tweak except my lack of experience. After a year, I got unmotivated and kept working 6-7 days a week to pay loans and bills. It’s currently June 2025. Seems to as murky as when I stopped applying. I haven’t touched any type of projects/coding in a year. What’s my next step? Or is it too late and a masters the only way?",
