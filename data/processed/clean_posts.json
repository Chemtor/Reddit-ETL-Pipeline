        "content": "Received an alert this morning stating that compute usage increased 2000% on a data warehouse.I went and looked at the top queries coming in and spotted evidence of Vibe coders right away. Stuff like SELECT \\* or SELECT TOP 7,000,000 \\* with a list of 50 different tables and thousands of fields at once (like 10,000), all joined on non-clustered indexes. And not just one query like this, but tons coming through.Started to look at query plans and calculate algorithmic complexity. Some of this was resulting in 100 Billion Query Steps and killing the Data Warehouse, while also locking all sorts of tables and causing resource locks of every imaginable style. The data warehouse, until the rise of citizen developers, was so overprovisioned that it rarely exceeded 5% of its total compute capability; however, it is now spiking at 100%.That being said, management is overjoyed to boast about how they are adding more and more 'vibe coders' (who have no background in development and can't code, i.e., they are unfamiliar with concepts such as inner joins versus outer joins or even basic SQL syntax). They know how to click, cut, paste, and run. Paste the entire schema dump and run the query. This is the same management by the way that signed a deal with a cloud provider and agreed to pay $2million dollars for 2TB of cold log storage lol The rise of Citizen Developers is causing issues where I am, with potentially high future costs.",

        "content": "Recently I decided to start out as a Freelancer, a big part of my problem was that I need to show some projects in my portfolio and github, but most of my work was in corporates and I cant share any of the information or show code from my experience. So, I decided to make some projects for my portfolio, to show demos of what I offer as a freelancer for companies and startups.As an experiment, I decided to try out vibe coding, setting up a fully automated daily batch etl from api requests to aws lambda functions, athena db and daily jobs with flows and crawlers.Takes from my first project:1. Vibe coding is a trap, if I didn't have 5 years of experience, I wouldv'e made the worst project I could imagine, with bad and old practices, unreadable code, no edgecase handling and just a lot of bad stuff2. It can help with direction, and setting up very simple tasks one by one, but you shouldn't give the AI large tasks at once.3. Always try to provide your prompts a taste of the data, the structure is never enough.4. If you spend more than 20 minutes trying to solve a problem with AI, it probably won't solve it. (at least not in a clean and logical way)5. The code it creates between files and tasks is very inconsistent, looks like a different developer made it everytime, make sure to provide it with older code it made so it knows to keep the consistency.Example of my worst experience:I tried creating a crawler for my partitioned data reading CSV files from S3 into an athena table. my main problem was that my dates didnt show up correctly, the problem the AI thought was very focused on trying to change data formats until it hits something that athena supports. the real problem was actually in another column that contained commas in the strings, but because I gave the AI the data and it looked at the dates as the problem, no matter what it tried, it never tried to look outside the box. I tried for around 2.5-3 hours fixing this problem, and ended up fixing it in 15 minutes by using my eyes instead of the AI. Link to the final project repo: [https://github.com/roey132/aws\\_batch\\_data\\_demo](https://github.com/roey132/aws_batch_data_demo)\\*Note\\* - The project could be better, and there are many places to fix and use much better practices, i might review them in the future, but for now, im moving onto the next project (taking the data from aws to a streamlit dashboard.)Hope it helps anyone! good luck with your projects and learning, and remember, AI is good, but its still not a replacement for your experience.",

When I was working as an Analyst, I mostly enjoyed preparing, transforming, managing the data rather than displaying it with graphs and all. Which is why I'm now targeting more Data Engineer positions. Thing is, when I'm reading job descriptions, I feel discouraged by what's asked as skills.What I know/have/done:* Certified SnowProCore* Certified Alteryx Advanced* Experienced Tableau Analyst * Used extensively PostgreSQL * I know Python, having used it back in the days (and some time to time) but I lost some of it. Mostly used pandas to prepare datasets. I'll need a refresher on this though.* Built a whole backend for a Flutter-based app (also the frontend) using Supabase: designed the schemas, the tables, RLS, Edge Functions, cron jobs (related to the startup I mentionned earlier)* Experience with Git* Have a really low understanding of container with Docker* Currently reading the holy bible that is The fundamentals of Data EngineeringWhat I don't have:* Experience on AWS/Azure/GCP* Spark/Hadoop* Kafka* Airflow* DBT/Databricks* Didn't do a lot of data pipelines* Didn't do a lot of CI/CDand probably more I'm forgetting. I'm a quick learner and love to experiment, but as I want to make sure to be as prepared as possible for job interviews, I'd like to focus on the most important skill that I currently lack. What would you recommend?Thank you for your help!",

Clearly AI generated.They all belong to bots, AI posters, marketing and salesmen people, market research, etc. It's a clear example of dead internet. I know moderating a sub is hard, but you don't even have to spend 5 minutes to come across these kind of posts. Proposals that usually work can be draconian, but for example, permanent bans on spam, 0 effort posts, self promotion and marketing, etc, should be implemented IMO. They were never going to contribute anything to the subreddit anyways, and marketers, article spammers, etc, shouldn't be able to post on communities with thousands of members for free. Autobans on emojis and em dashes have been implemented in other communities, and bans on even the slight suspicion of shilling without arguments. Sad, but oh well. It's either that or the community taking a dip in actual quality where people can learn from each other.

        "content": "Im a DE with several years of experience in analytics, but after a year into my role, I’m starting to feel like a failure. I wanted to become a DE because somewhere along the lines of me being an analyst, I decided I like SWE more than data analysis/science and felt DE was a happy medium.But 1 year in, I’m not sure what I signed up for. I constantly feel like a failure at my job. Every single day I feel utterly confused because the business side of things is not clear to me - I’m given tasks, not sure what the big picture is, not sure what it is I’m supposed to accomplish. I just “do” without really knowing the upstream side of things. Then I’m told to go through source data and just feel expected to “know” how everything tied together without receiving guidance or training on the data. I ask questions and I’ve been more proactive after receiving some negative feedback lately about my ability to turn things around-frequently assigned tasks that are assumed to be “4 hours of effort” that realistically take at least few days. Multiply one task by 4-5 tasks and this is expected to be completed in a span of less than 2 weeks. I ask, communicate, document, etc. But at the end of it all, I still feel my questions aren’t being answered and my lack of knowledge due to lack of exposure or clear instructions makes me seem frequently dumb (ie: manager will be like “why would you not do this” when it was never previously explained to me and where there was no way I’d know without somebody telling me). I’ve made mistakes that felt sh*tty too because I’m so pressured to get something done on time that it ends up being sloppy. I am not really using my technical skills at all-at my old job, being one of the few people who wrote code relatively well, I developed interactive tools or built programs/libraries that really streamlined the work and helped scale things and I was frequently recognized for that work. When I go on the data science sub, I’m made to feel that my emphasis on technical skills is a waste of time because it’s the “business” and not “technical skills” that’s worth $$$. I don’t see how the 2 are mutually exclusive? I find my team has a technical debt problem and the deeper we get there, the more I don’t think this helps scale business. A lot of our “business solutions” can be scaled up for several clients but because we don’t write code and do processes in a way where we can re-use it for different use cases, we’re left with spending way too much time doing stuff tediously and manually that prolongs delays that usually then ends up feeling like a blame game that comes right back at me. I’ve been trying, really trying to reflect and be honest with myself. I’ve tried to communicate with my boss that I’m struggling with the workload. But I feel like there’s a feeling at the end that it’s me. I don’t feel great. I wish I was in a SWE role but I don’t even think that’s realistically possible for me given my lack of experience and the job market. Also not sure SWE is the move. My role seems to be evolving into a project management/product manager role and while I don’t mind gaining those skills, I also don’t know what I’m doing anymore. I don’t think this job seems like a good fit for me but I don’t know what other jobs I can do. I’ve thought about the AI/ML engineering team on my job but I don’t have enough experience at all for it. I feel too technically unskilled for other engineer jobs but not “business savvy” enough to do a non-technical project/product based role. If anybody has insight, I’d appreciate it.",

Since there’s only one DAG and the workload is pretty light, I’m concerned this could waste resources and time on configuration that might not be necessary.Has anyone been in a similar situation? Do you think it's worth going through the full Airflow + ECS setup for such a simple pipeline? Or would it make more sense to use a lighter solution for now and scale later if needed?",

I apologize if this question sounds very beginner-like (we're just taking our first steps in data analysis). We don't have a DBA to optimize the query; data preparation, business rules, and graph creation are all handled by the systems analyst (me).

My middle school had a weeks work of lesson plans teaching us how to coax relevant results out of Altavista and Lycos using quotes, booleans etc.However, I find that the internet is increasingly unusable and I have become a bit too dependent on CGPT. Like, I straight up can no longer find answers to questions. I can't even find webpages or documentation that I know exists, I just can't remember the URL. The old standby of adding \"reddit\" to the question doesn't work either, any post older than a month is all \"obtuse rubber goose up your nose with a rubber hose\" redacted slop.I can't find answers to questions on stackoverflow and a lot of documentation for python packages is essentially unusable (pyarrow, airflow core not provider packages).

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "So I am in my first DE job, been here for a year, working for a company who hasn't had someone whose title was DE before. There were lots of people doing small scale data engineering type tasks using a variety of no-code tools, but no one was writing custom pipelines or working with a data warehouse. I basically set up our snowflake database, ETL pipelines, and a few high impact dashboards. The situation was such that even as a relative beginner there was low-hanging fruit where I could make a big impact.When I was getting hired, it seemed like they were taking a chance on me as an individual but also 'data engineering' as a concept, they didn't really know if they 'needed it'. I think partly because of this, and partly because I was just out of school, my compensation is pretty low for a DE at 72k (living in a US city but not a major coastal city).But, there are good benefits, I haven't needed to work more than 40 hours more than two or three times, and I feel like the work is interesting. I'm also able to learn on the job because I'm pretty much defining/inventing the tech stack as I go. There is a source of tension though where it feels like no one really understands when I do something innovative or creative to solve a problem, and because of that sometimes it feels like timelines/expectations are expressed with no knowledge of what goes into my work which can be a little frustrating. But, to be fair nothing ever really happens when a timeline is missed.My hunch is that if I asked for a raise it would be denied since they seem to be under the impression anyone with a basic data engineering related education could take my place. IMO, if someone tried to take my place there would be a months-long learning process about the business and all the data relationships before they could support existing work let alone produce more.Anyway, just curious if this seems like I'm hoping for too much? I'm happy overall, but don't know if I am just being naive and should be getting more in terms of recognition, money, opportunities to advance. What are other people's work experiences like? I have a feeling people make more than me by a lot but I don't know if that comes with more stress too. TLDR: I'm getting paid 72k with, working 40 hours a week, good benefits, not a ton of stress, 1 year of full time DE experience, should I be looking for more?",

I'm thinking about going with the setup suggested in the title - using DLTHub for ingestion pipelines, DBT or SQLMesh for transforming data in the database and Airflow to schedule this. Is this generally speaking a good direction?For some more context: \\- for now the volume of the data is quite low and the frequency of the ingestion is daily at most; \\- I need a strong focus on security and privacy due to the nature of the data; \\- I'm sitting on Azure.And lastly a specific technical question, as I started to implement this solution locally - does anyone have experience with running dlt on Airflow? What's the optimal way to structure the credentials for connections there? For now I specified them in Airflow connections, but then in each Airflow task I need to pull the credentials from the connections and pass them to dlt source and destination, which doesn't make much sense. What's the better option?Thanks!",

The sad part of it was that DE role had absolutely no work in the start-up idk why they even hired me but i salvaged what i could, I built basic stacks from scratch(combo of managed and serverless services), set up CDC, Data Lake-ish architecture(not how clean as i had hoped it to be) all while the data being extremely minimal like MBs, I solely did it just to learn because the CEO did not seem to care about anything at all. I'm pretty sure the lay-off was because they realised if they don't have the product or the data or the money to pay me so why need a DE at all (honestly why keep the company at all). I might have fumbled a lil and i should have switched sooner but the problem still stands that I have no prod or any real DE experience. I experiement with services all the time, anything opensource(basics using docker) like kafka, airflow and I have a strong handle of AWS I would like to believe. Now that I am here -- unemployed, idk what to do, I must clarify that i do tech for money and my passions do lie elsewhere. But I don't hate it or anything and I really like the money. I just don't know how to get back into the DE market, like yk where there a lil bit of senior DE team that wouldn't mind hiring me just because (I am willing to learnn). I actually gave freelance DE a thought too. Like I have AWS certifications and stuff, how about breaking into freelance consulting? anyways, I would love to know what you would do in a situation like this.PS: Please be kind for my mental health purposes thanks.",

It works great but one scenario is bothering me.Each day we get a CSV of all *active* customers from our vendor delivered to our S3 landing zone. That is, each file contains every customer as long as they’ve made a purchase in the last 3 years. So from day to day there’s a LOT of repetition. The vendor says they cannot deliver the data incrementally.The business wants to be able to report on customer activity going back 10 years. Right now I’m keeping each daily CSV going back 10 years just in case reprocessing is ever needed (we can’t go back to our vendor for expired customer records). But storing all those duplicate records feels so wasteful. Adjusting the drop-off to be less frequent won’t work because the business wants the data up-to-date.Has anyone encountered a similar scenario and found an approach they liked? Or do I just say “storage is cheap” and move on? Each file is a few gb in size.",

        "content": "Hello Data Engineers :waving_hand:I've been scouting on the internet for the best and easiest way to setup **dbt Core 1.9.0 with Airflow 3.0** orchestration. I've followed through many tutorials, and most of them don't work out of the box, require fixes or version downgrades, and are broken with recent updates to Airflow and dbt.I'm here on a mission to find and document the best and easiest way for Data Engineers to run their dbt Core jobs using Airflow, that will simply **work out of the box**. **Disclaimer**: This tutorial is designed with a Postgres backend to work out of the box. But you can change the backend to any supported backend of your choice with little effort.So let's get started. ## Prerequisites- Docker desktop (https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)- Python 3.12 or higher (https://www.python.org/downloads/)- Code repo (https://dbtengineer.com/airflow-with-dbt-core-tutorial/#code-repo-video-tutorial)## Video Tutorial{% embed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUfYuMjHQCc&ab_channel=DbtEngineer %}## Setup1. Clone the repo in prerequisites. 2. Create a data folder in the root folder on your local.3. Rename `.env-example` to `.env` and create new values for all missing values. Instructions to create the fernet key at the end of this Readme.4. Rename `airflow_settings-example.yaml` to `airflow_settings.yaml` and use the values you created in `.env` to fill missing values in `airflow_settings.yaml`.5. Rename `servers-example.json` to `servers.json` and update the host and username values to the values you set above.## Running Airflow Locally1. Run `docker compose up` and wait for containers to spin up. This could take a while.2. Access pgAdmin web interface at [localhost:16543](http://localhost:16543). Create a public database under the postgres server.3. Access Airflow web interface at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Trigger the dag.## Running dbt Core LocallyCreate a virtual env for installing dbt core```shpython3 -m venv dbt_venvsource dbt_venv/bin/activate```Optional, to create an alias```shalias env_dbt='source dbt_venv/bin/activate'```Install dbt Core```shpython -m pip install dbt-core dbt-postgres```Verify Installation```shdbt --version```Create a `profile.yml` file in your `/Users//.dbt` directory and add the following content. ```yamldefault: target: dev outputs: dev: type: postgres host: localhost port: 5432 user: your-postgres-username-here password: your-postgres-password-here dbname: public schema: public```You can now run dbt commands from the dbt directory inside the repo.```shcd dbt/hello_worlddbt compile```## CleanupRun `Ctrl + C` or `Cmd + C` to stop containers, and then `docker compose down`.## FAQs### Generating fernet key```shpython3 -c \"from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())\"```I hope this tutorial was useful. Let me know your thoughts and questions in the comments section. Happy Coding!",

        "content": "So the company I'm working with doesn't have anything like a Databricks or Snowflake. Everything is on-prem and the tools we're provided are Python, MS SQL Server, Power BI and the ability to ask IT to set up a shared drive.The data flow I'm dealing with is a small-ish amount of data that's made up of reports from various outside organizations that have to be cleaned/transformed and then reformed into an overall report.I'm looking at something like a Medallion-like architecture where I have bronze (raw data), silver (cleaning/transforming) and gold (data warehouse connected to powerbi) layers that are set up as different schemas in SQL Server. Also, should the bronze layer just be a shared drive in this case or do we see a benefit in adding it to the RDBMS? So I'm basically just asking for a gut check here to see if this makes sense or if something like Delta Lake would be necessary here. In addition, I've traditionally used schemas to separate dev from uat and prod in the RDBMS. But if I'm then also separating it by medallion layers then we start to get what seems to be some unnecessary schema bloat. Anyway, thoughts on this?",

I don't know if I am doing things the right way. But my use case is to generate vector embeddings for one of the `string` columns (say `a`) in my DataFrame. I also have another vector embedding for a `blacklist`.Now, I when I am generating vector embeddings for `a` I first filter out nulls and certain useless records and generate the embeddings for the remaining of them (say `b`). Then I do a cosine similarity between the embeddings in `b` and `blacklist`. Then I only keep the records with the max similarity. Now the vector that I have is the same dimensions as `b`.Now I apply a threshold for the similarity which decides the *good* records.The problem now is, how do combine this with my original data?Here is the snippet of the exact code.

Our past approach to data analytics was extremely primitive, as we pretty much just queried our production OLTP database in SQL Server for all BI purposes (terrible, I know). We are presently modernizing our architecture and have PowerBi Premium licenses for reporting. To get rolling fast, I just replicated our production database to another database on different server and use it for all BI purposes. Unfortunately, because it’s all highly normalized transactional data, we use views with many joins to load fact and dimension tables into PowerBi. We have decided to use Synpase Analytics for data warehousing in order to persist fact and dimension tables and load them faster into PowerBi. I understand Microsoft is moving resources to Fabric, which is still half-baked. Unfortunately, tools like Snowflake or Databricks are not options for our agency, as we are fully committed to a Microsoft stack. Has anyone else faced this scenario? Are there any resources you might recommend for maintaining fact and dimension tables in a dedicated Synapse pool and updating them based on changes to an OLTP database? Thanks much!",

        "content": "Hey everyone,I recently joined a new company and started this week. My first assigned task is optimizing an existing pipeline that the team has been using. However, the pipeline requires significant work.This team hasn’t had a dedicated data professional before, so they outsourced pipeline development to an offshore team. Upon reviewing the pipeline, I was shocked. There’s zero documentation, no helpful comments or method signatures, and even variable declarations are riddled with errors (e.g., indexes spelled as indekes). The function and class naming conventions are also poor. While I haven’t done extensive data engineering work before, I’m certain these are subpar coding practices. It seems the offshore team got away with this because no one technical was overseeing the work. The pipeline has broken frequently in the past, and instead of proper fixes, it’s been patched with band-aid solutions when what it really needs is a complete overhaul.# The Core Problem:The team wants a unified database where each customer has a unique primary key. However:* Data comes from 5-6 sources, none of which have primary keys for joining.* PII (and other details) for the same customer can differ across sources.* The goal is to deduplicate and unify all customer records under a single ID.I’m considering fuzzy matching, but with \\~1M rows, pairwise comparisons are computationally expensive. The offshore team attempted a workaround:1. **Blocking:** Grouping potentially similar records (name variants, emails and phone numbers) to reduce comparison scope.2. **Similarity Scoring:** Running comparisons only within these blocks.I had some questions1. Is there a better approach? Have you worked on similar problems? Any recommended tools/strategies?2. Learning resources? I’m relatively new to data engineering and want to do this right. Any books, papers, or guides on large-scale deduplication?This is a critical project, and I’d appreciate any advice whether technical, procedural, or even just moral support! Thanks in advance, and feel free to ask follow-up questions.",

        "content": "i there,my company recently decided to use Apache Kafka to share data among feature teams and analytics. Most of the topics are in Avro format. The Kafka clusteris provided by an external company, which also has a UI to see some data andsome metrics.Now, the more topics we have, the more our devs want to debug certain things and analytics people want to explore data. So the ui technically allows that, but search for a specific message is not possible. We have now explored other methods to do \"data exploration\":* Flink -> too complicated and too much overhead* Kafka Connect (Avro -> Json) fails to properly deserialize logicalType \"decimal\" (wtf?)* Kafka Connect (Avro -> Parquet) can handle decimals, but ignores tombstones (wtf?)* besides: Kafka Connect means, having an immutable copy of the topic - probably not a good idea anyways* we are using AWS, so Athena provides a Kafka Connector. Implementation and configuration is so hacky. It cannot even connect to our Schema registry and requires to have a copy of the schema in Glue (wtf?)* Trino's Kafka Connector works surprisingly good, but has the same issue with decimals.For you Kafka users out there, do you have the same issues? I was a bit surprised having these kinds of issues with a technology that is that mature and widely adopted. Any tool suggestions? Is everyone using Json as a topic format? Is it the same with ProtoBuf?A little side rant: I was writing a consumer in python, which should write the data as parquet files. Getting data from Avro+AvroSchema into a Arrow table, while using the provided schema is also rather complicated. Both Avro and Arrow are big Apache projects. I was expecting some interoperability. I know that the Arrow Java Implementation, can , supposedly, deserialize Avro directly into Arrow. But not the C/Python Implementation.",

His reasoning:•They might hire me but still keep me working on the same stuff at the studio•They could reject me because taking me would leave the studio without a data engineer•Worst case, they might tell my current company that I’m trying to leave. Ideally I shouldn’t expose that I would like to leave.However, I wanted to apply because their data team is a big team of senior and mid level developers . They use tools that I’ve been wanting to work with.

So this won't work.* Row filtering is a feature in Fivetran, but only for database sources, not for Qualtrics.I'm thinking we'd need to dump all of the data into our own destination first and then sync across the filtered data to their lake...I suppose this will work, but I'm just looking for ideas in case I can avoid the multi step process.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Fun fact - Yes, most databases use B+ trees to hold data, but these trees are not actually very deep; most of them are hardly 3 to 4 levels deep.A page size is either 4 KB or 8 KB, and a typical B+ tree has a branching factor of 300-500 for a page size of 8 KB. This implies that for a 4-level B+ tree, the total number of leaf nodes will beLevel 1 - 1 Level 2 - 400 Level 3 - 400 \\* 400 Level 4 - 400 \\* 400 \\* 400 = 64M leaf nodesEach of the 64M leaf node points to a page of size 8KB holding the actual row. Now, assuming each row is 100B long, each leaf node can hold 80 database rows.With this as our core assumption, the total number of rows this B+ tree can hold is 64M \\* 80 = 5.12 billion rows. Pretty neat :)We can thus fairly assume that a typical database would not take more than 3 or 4 page reads to locate any record and then a couple more lookups to read the data stored in the heap.I also uncovered: \\- Why Redis still uses hash tables (and when it makes sense) \\- How major databases like Oracle secretly use BOTH structures (and why) \\- How B+ trees and Hash tables works internally Read the full breakdown in my latest newsletter article.Do you think we will have more advanced indexing than B+ trees in the future?",

        "content": "Hi. This is purely a pedantic question, with no practical impact on what is being developed. But still curiosity may lead to some fruitful discussion.We have a typical data pipeline, where some data are goign to go daily through a series of transformations, and finally written into a unified database. Now, for most cases, the source and destination/sink of that data is on the same database instance. Therefore, what we can do, is to just run everything a sequence of SQL statements (`INSERT INTO T(n+1).... SELECT ... FROM Tn` etc), without actually \"loading\" any data into our server. So all data stays in teh database server and transformed there. It has the huge benefit that we don't have to deal with partitioning, distribution etc. So, it's quite clear to me that it's not ETL since we don't extract data into our data processing server and then transform it (or not?). But is it ELT indeed, given that we do not leave the transformation for after loading the data, and we do not store raw data (well we do, but only as T0 to feed our pipeline). Is it neither of them, or some other Jargon I don't know about?",

        "author": "Away-Violinist3104",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey folks – my friend and I have been thinking a lot about the communication overhead between business stakeholders and data engineers when it comes to building data pipelines. From what we observe at our job and further validated by chatting with a couple friends in data engineering space, a lot of time is spent just getting alignment – business users describing what they want, engineers trying to translate that into something technically feasible, and a lot of back-and-forth when things aren’t clear.We’re exploring whether it’s possible to reduce this overhead with a self-service tool powered by an “AI data engineer” agent. The idea is:* Business users specify what they want (e.g., “I need a dashboard showing X broken down by Y every week”).* The AI agent builds the pipeline using the existing data stack.* If there's any ambiguity or missing context, it prompts the user for feedback. If they don’t know the answer, they can loop in a technical person, all in the same tool. Technical/data team can provide necessary context so the agent can carry forward.* After getting clarification, the agent continues building the pipeline.* Once the pipeline is built, technical/data team verify, review, edit or approve This way, non-technical users could handle more of the work themselves, and engineers can focus on higher-leverage tasks instead of ad-hoc asks.We’re super early ideation and trying to understand if this is actually a real pain point for others – or if it’s already solved well enough with existing tools, or is it just another \"imagined problem\".Would love to hear your thoughts:* Do you run into this communication gap in your org?* Would something like this be useful, or would it just add noise?* Are there any tools out there that already handle this well?Any perspectives would be appreciated!",

Our main upstream is RDS (planning to use DMS for CDC) and some APIs/files, and the main downstream is analytics and external reportingHere’s what we’re doing currently:Using Spark-based processing with Iceberg as staging.DMS captures CDC data from RDS to S3.A custom Glue Spark + Lambda ingestion framework loads data from S3 to Iceberg.We then apply transformations in Glue and load curated data to Redshift.The reason for this approach was individual scalability and familiarity with Spark.However, I recently came across Zero ETL in Redshift, which seems to simplify things:CDC data directly stages into Redshift.We can then use DBT for transformations and create curated models within Redshift itself.Given that:We currently have GBs of data but expect it to grow significantly.Our team is comfortable with Spark/Glue.Which approach would be better for long-term scalability and manageability?Would Zero ETL with DBT simplify infra and reduce cost/complexity, or does the Spark + Iceberg route give more flexibility for future multi-destination use cases?Any insights from your team’s experience with similar setups would be very helpful.Thanks in advance!",

File is picked up and split into csv's based on sheet names (Using Python presumably)3. Those CSVs are then uploaded into Snowflake Tables4. Once in Snowflake I will trigger tasks that transform and get the data where we want it (This I've already mostly figured out). We have been leaning towards Azure Data Factory for our data pipelines as the basics are already set up but I seem to be having issues figuring out a reliable source for running python in ADF. I have seen stuff from Azure Functions and Batch Processing (which I have little experience configuring and setting up). Another solution would be to just migrate to a full python approach with Apache Airflow but that would be another system to configure... I would love assistance on how people use ADF and Python or if I should be thinking in a different way for these pipelines. Any assistance or thoughts is greatly appreciated!",

I'd love to get your feedback on it as I feel this community is the best to comment on some of the problems we are trying to solve.[fenic](https://github.com/typedef-ai/fenic) is an opinionated, PySpark-inspired DataFrame framework for building AI and agentic applications.Transform unstructured and structured data into insights using familiar DataFrame operations enhanced with semantic intelligence. With first-class support for markdown, transcripts, and semantic operators, plus efficient batch inference across any model provider.Some of the problems we want to solve:Building with LLMs reminds a lot of the map-reduce era. The potential is there but the APIs and systems we have are too painful to use and manage in production.1. UDFs calling external APIs with manual retry logic2. No cost visibility into LLM usage3. Zero lineage through AI transformations4. Scaling nightmares with API rate limitsHere's an example of how things are done with fenic: # Instead of custom UDFs and API orchestration relevant_products = customers_df.semantic.join( products_df, join_instruction=\"Given customer preferences: {interests:left} and product: {description:right}, would this customer be interested?\" ) # Built-in cost tracking result = df.collect() print(f\"LLM cost: ${result.metrics.total_lm_metrics.cost}\") # Row-level lineage through AI operations lineage = df.lineage() source = lineage.backward([\"failed_prediction_uuid\"])# Our thesis:Data engineers are uniquely positioned to solve AI's reliability and scale challenges. But we need AI-native tools that handle semantic operations with the same rigor we bring to traditional data processing.# Design principles:* PySpark-inspired API (leverage existing knowledge)* Production features from day one (metrics, lineage, optimization)* Multi-provider support with automatic failover* Cost optimization and token management built-in# What I'm curious about:* Are other teams facing similar AI integration challenges?* How are you currently handling LLM inference in pipelines?* Does this direction resonate with your experience?* What would make AI integration actually seamless for data engineers?This is our attempt to evolve the data stack for AI workloads. Would love feedback from the community on whether we're heading in the right direction.Repo: [https://github.com/typedef-ai/fenic](https://github.com/typedef-ai/fenic).

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I am considering database CI/CD frameworks for a long term project to handle database evolution eloquently. At my place of work, it's pretty common to just spin up at a database and have an admin make ad-hoc changes to create/modify users, permissions, schemas, tables, etc. (if you're lucky, they commit those changes to a repo). This generally doesn't pose any issues when we expect the life-cycle of the project to be a matter of months-- and it helps us move quick when we have a crunched deadline and a smallish team, reduces overhead/red tape, but scrappy. For reference, these are generally analytic databases, not hooked up to any downstream application, save for a dashboard here or there. Our products are generally processed data itself or research derived from that data. The downsides to this scrappy database approach is the one prod environment can become messy, the admin might not always remember to commit ddl changes to version control, and if a dev is creating stored procs or something, that is likely going to fly under the radar of source/version control. Ultimately it can become hard to maintain and hard to appropriately gatekeep and record what changes are made when. So I come with a question for those of you that use flyway, liquibase, atlas, dbmate or any similar tools: How has it made your life easier/harder? How do you get buy-in from your teams?

I thought the more languages I knew, the better I would be, but in reality, it just delayed my growth.What finally helped me was choosing **one practical project** and committing to building it end-to-end. That’s when the learning started.Now, after 6+ years working professionally as a software engineer, I’ve realized most beginners don’t need more tutorials, they need *direction and feedback*.If you’re stuck in tutorial hell or unsure what to focus on, feel free to ask. I’m happy to share what helped me move forward or answer questions you have about breaking out of that phase.**What helped you escape tutorial hell, or what are you struggling with right now?**",

        "author": "cheyyne",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "If you haven't heard of it, Bitburner is a free coding game in which you take on the role of a hacker writing Javascript to hack computers in a cyberpunk world, earn money, and eventually do lots of things that I can't go into here.The actual 'hacking' is very simplified, the game doesn't teach you cyber security - it's more about writing code that gets things done. In the beginning of the game, you are shown examples for how to write basic things, which you can then learn to improve upon.The game naturally evolves to become a bit more complex as you play, and you are rewarded for thinking about how to make things happen more efficiently, which results in a rewarding gameplay loop that fosters learning without holding your hand, so you have creative freedom.And that's sort of the thing of it; you can muddle through using code that's 'good enough' *if you want to.* But you will more likely be inspired to find that next way to level up your code, to make it more effective, to find the inefficiency and ruthlessly eliminate it.A large part of what makes the game useful is that you are writing real code in a real language using real javascript syntax, with scripts that are really running on your computer; there is very good documentation that you can read to figure out how to improve your code yourself, and how to understand the in-game systems; and the in-game help for how you might approach newly unlocked mechanics is quite good, though not universally so (looking at you, corporate \"Smart Supply\" script example!). And if you get stuck, there is a Discord full of very helpful people who can assist you with whatever you don't understand.Anyhow, though I've done a lot in other languages, before last year I hadn't learned almost any Javascript. Now I've got almost a thousand hours in Bitburner, I've learned how to think about a lot of elementary coding problems in new ways, I've learned a lot of Javascript, and I've even come face to face with a number of Javascript's hated quirks - all from just trying to *make more damn money than I did on my last run, given my current system's limitations.*So I heartily recommend giving it a shot. You can find Bitburner on Steam, or at [https://bitburner-official.github.io/](https://bitburner-official.github.io/). You can find the documentation for all the game's commands [here, at https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/stable/markdown/bitburner.ns.md](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/stable/markdown/bitburner.ns.md). (It says NS, which just means the object which, for all intents and purposes, contains the commands and functions that you can do in the game that aren't straight javascript declarations). Expect a certain amount of exploration - once you're knee deep, you'll be checking through documentation for a given mechanic and get valuable 'Aha!' moments.**NOTE: If you are playing to learn coding, I strongly recommend -avoiding- looking up other player's solutions.** It's okay to start off with an example, but you'll only grow as a programmer by figuring out novel ways to overcome the challenges you'll face. The solution you find for yourself, even if it's less efficient, is infinitely more valuable - and you will find more and more solutions as you get better at thinking like a coder. If you really do hit a hard wall, you might ask AI how a problem could be approached - you'll find GPT has a good corpus of Bitburner dialect in its training data - but do your best to solve your problems with whatever you find in the help files and in the game's documentation. And if you do give in, you could ask on the Bitburner discord, where players will be happy to hint at the right approach without out and out solving the puzzle for you.Anyway, I hope some novice coders find this valuable and discover how fun coding can be through this game. (I have no affiliation with the game or its devs. Just a big fan.) Have fun! Happy coding!",

I personally love it and have legitimately found that it has changed my career trajectory for the better. So many advanced concepts felt clear only when I learned Haskell. Most notably concurrent programming. I also see so many posts by users in this community that they are struggling to grasp concepts or move past beginner. Not saying it will for sure work for everyone but like it definitely worked for me? Yet if I was to speak on that experience Id be called culty and just experience pure hate for FP with no explanation. I really have never experienced this cultiness people talk about. Wouldn't this hate signal that OOP is kinda culty? Like to me a cult is like a religion in that you're not supposed to question it but I've never met a Haskell dev like that, in fact they will probably happily and curiously chat about my question with me for hours. On the OOP side I've never really heard any convincing explanation as to why we do things a certain way, there's just the \"pythonic\" way to do stuff for example. But then if I point out an issue with their logic it always becomes \"how come you dont know OOP\" or some crazy question which is weird because OOP is quite simple and it often times has nothing to do with OOP theory. Before I get attacked inevitably with questions of the same category as that, I do have experience with OOP and my past project was acquired by Xerox to help plan their sales efforts. Ive also never heard any reason why Haskell is a bad choice besides it can be hard to learn, which I do agree with to an extent, but that's a very fixable problem as its often taught by researchers who are obsessed with the most advanced aspects of the language, and there are many great resources like learn you a Haskell that make it easy as all heck to learn.",

Some dummies need to study English rather than digital electronics.I just want to share my humble opinion from what I saw and experienced. This post may not be suitable for complete beginners. I assume that you already know DS&A and can build something at least in two different languages.I see so many questions, not only in this subreddit but generally on the web, like \"which language should I choose/is good to start/should I learn,\" etc. I think this is kind of missing the idea of \"software engineering\" or development.I bet most of us were stuck in \"language hell\" before. What should I learn? C? C++? Java? Fortran? Cobol? PL/I? Python? Rust? You can extend this list.Language is usually the easiest part of programming. Because in 2025, you can just open Google and type \"xyz language syntax/libraries,\" and then you get a kabillion resources about it.If language were that important, I bet most of the computer science classes would focus on low or mid-level languages like Assembly or C and similar languages.So you (we) should focus on technology rather than the syntax. You should focus on \"how can I store/manipulate/transmit this digital data more efficiently?\"When you list your languages in your CV like this:* C & C++* Java* Python* Haskell* Verilog* so onyes, it shows something but not everything or big picture. It is still too abstract and does not answer \"Are you capable of using the [ARINC 429](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARINC_429) standard to transfer encrypted data?\" or \"Which boards did you work on?\" or \"Have you deployed a containerized microservice on Kubernetes with Helm charts?\" or \"Can you deploy a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins?\"The other issue that occurs due to focusing on languages too much is that you do not know how you should create your portfolio. Since you focused on the language, you are hanging around basic implementations like a calculator, simple USB driver, or an asynchronous web page, etc.The more experienced programmers would notice that I am pointing out the \"specialization.\" Let's be honest, in 2025, industries do not need too many juniors.So rather than obsessing about languages, explore the telecommunication standards, protocols, and preferred [software architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_architecture_styles_and_patterns) and technologies you’ll actually use in your target industry, then build projects around those. This approach will teach you the necessary language and engineering skills at the same time.",

But I’m way more curious about how people landed on what works for them. Did you start by failing a lot and then tweaking your method? Copy a YouTuber’s setup and slowly ditch most of it? Realize that everything falls apart after 3 p.m. so you built your schedule around that?I think a lot of us, especially in programming, go through that phase where we’re doing tutorials on autopilot, feeling like we’re learning, but nothing sticks. Then something clicks. Maybe it's building your own project, maybe it's just doing spaced recall the right way, or realizing that you need to write code, not just watch it being written.Personally, I used to grind tutorial after tutorial thinking I was improving, but I couldn’t build anything from scratch. Only after I started using flashcards and forcing myself to explain stuff in my own words did things actually start sticking.Anyway, I’d love to hear what your turning point was.

        "content": "I've been coding for fun on and off since I was a kid. Though I'd say it only 'clicked' 7-8 years ago when I got into automation and scraping for some hobby projects (mostly in Python, but dabbled with a few other languages and Android apps too).Never got any formal training, not even classes at school (I was homeschooled throughout). Honestly looking back, my stuff was pretty much cobbled together from Stack Overflow - but they worked at the time, and I genuinely enjoyed making them.Well, that lasted until a couple years ago when some shit hit the fan around high school grad age. Convinced myself I'm burnt out, and barely learned anything during that period, except finishing CS50X and CS50P.Anyway, figured it's time to cut the cycle. I'm still unsure which subfield or job I want, but I know I should work on my understanding of CS theory - and that would mean basically everything beyond basic scripting.An IRL formal CS uni degree is currently not an option for that, so I'm looking for a structured, self-taught online alternative. Looking over the resources list, OSSU and TeachYourselfCS caught my eye, so now I'm trying to decide between those two before I commit.From what I understand, OSSU starts from zero and is a 1-2 years long commitment but has a more active community, while TeachYourselfCS assumes some prior knowledge but claims to have a more targeted scope. Given my background, which would you recommend and why? Or would you suggest something else entirely?",

Along with this I am also studying nextjs for SEO which react lacks in. It feels like I have put so much effort into learning all this because I know a lot of people who don’t even code outside uni despite having a passion for cs. But at the same time there are students who I work with at uni who feel so much more ahead of me and much more prepared for this industry. Yes I know comparison is the theft of joy. But I feel like it’s just unavoidable. At the same time with all the LLMs going around and vibe coding, I see students who vibe code websites under a day which would take me at least a few days to create all while them not even having a grasp of what the code is about. So it really defeats the purpose of putting all that effort into studying all that. What would you do this in my situation?

Can you suggest me something to code or more small projects before learning React? I feel like the knowledge is there but I need to practice a lot on everything related to JS logic, problem solving and syntax. I would prefer some project that already has css and html done or something with minimal front-ent to focus on JS. Thanks.",

My issue is that I can’t seem to decide on one. I enjoy working with all of them, and whenever I spend a few hours coding in one language, I get the urge to switch to another cool language. Right now, I’ve got my eye on C++.I’m not sure where I want to go professionally, which makes it hard for me to choose a language, since I can’t even decide on a specific field.I find embedded systems and backend/cloud very exciting. ML also seems interesting, but probably involves too much math (I do like math, but I probably do not like it enough for that).Is there anyone here who has been in a similar situation? I’m not switching languages because I find them hard or don’t enjoy them. I love them all — and hate myself for it :(Every field and language I’ve explored is exciting to me. But now that I’m close to finishing my bachelor’s degree, I feel like I’m wasting time by constantly switching between them.I jump from one thing to another so often that I end up feeling paralyzed when it comes to making a decision — and in the end, I barely get around to actually coding anymore.",

So yeah, what I’m facing right now feels way too complicated for the knowledge I currently have.What should I do at this point? because I'm totally lost. Thanks in advance for reading.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi folks,I've been on reddit for a while, mostly just reading and learning from other people's stories. But now, I finally decided to write my own post to share my journey and ask for some honest advice about my career path. **If you've been through something similar or just want to share your stories, I'd really appreciate it.****Warning: wall of text.**I graduated in 2018 with a degree in Software Engineering from a university (not top tier). The program was mostly practical, not too much theory. At that time, the job market in tech was really good.I started working at a few software outsourcing companies, focused on web dev. Because of the nature of the projects, I had to work with many different technologies. I think this is one of the biggest differences between outsourcing companies and product companies. I didn't get a chance to go deep into any technology, as soon as I started to get familiar with something, I had to switch to something else.Also, many of my friends were working at big companies and making a lot of money. That made me feel peer-pressured and pushed me to switch jobs often, chasing better pay, even though my skills weren't really strong enough to match those expectations.Over time, I started feeling lost and didn't know what I was working toward anymore. I also started to lose motivation, so I made a big decision to go study abroad for 2 years, hoping to find a new direction and more opportunities. I guess this is another big mistake that I made.With how tough the job market is right now, I've spent long time doing self-reflection. I realized that the grass is not always greener on the other side. Sometimes we don't appreciate what we already have until it's gone. And I've learned that success takes real effort and time, there are no shortcuts. If I had worked continuously since graduation, I would have over 7 YOE by now, but because of many breaks and job changes, I still feel like I'm only at a mid-level, not senior yet. I'm still afraid to apply for senior roles.",

In school, I always excelled at tasks \"this is goal\", but when we had a \"do a project of your choice\", I struggled and done something super simple. I think I am decent at figuring how to reach a goal someone else gave me. But I realised I have no clue how to use what I write outside of the pressing \"run\" in the IDE. Best example: I wanna make a mp3 out of Pi zero. I already done python youtube downloader a while ago. But when I want to run it, I go into PyCharm, press run, paste the link into the terminal and it works. But now I want to make a bash sctipt that I will call with alias + the link and I want the bash script to use the python code and then send the sound file into the Pi. But... How do I use the python code passivly? Aka how do I input the link from outside? how do I run it? How do I know the sound is downloaded and is ready to be sent?I am not necesserily looking for answer for This One Example. Because it's far from the only time I have no clue how to apply my code. And I can probably solve it with some googling. But the example shows a massive hole in my knowlage. A hole I have no clue how to start patching, and I feel like school won't help me patch it either. Is there a way to start learning how to use the code I write? Could you maybe give me some ideas for projects that might help me learn so?Luckly, bioinformatics is the one direction where these fancy printf statements might be enough... But it's not enough for me.Thank you for your time reading this and any advices.",

        "author": "franzz4",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So, I started learning programming last December with Python. Since then, I’ve studied several programming languages like C, Rust, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Kotlin, and Flutter (Dart). I tried out different languages used in different areas, such as back-end (C, Rust, Python, and JavaScript), front-end (HTML/CSS and JavaScript), and mobile (Kotlin and Flutter). After testing several different areas, here’s the conclusion I came to:**Front-end and Mobile:** It’s fun and interesting, but I don’t really see myself working professionally with UI — only in personal projects. The languages are manageable, but the problem is that there are thousands of frameworks that do the same thing, and the job market expects you to know several (especially in Web). In the end, it’s hard to pick one to focus on and really master.**Back-end:** I found it really fun to work with connections, APIs, databases, JSON, and making the project work behind the scenes. The languages are good (some are hard), and there are several options as well. However, it’s easier to pick one or two languages to specialize in back-end than it is in front-end. That’s why I decided to focus on back-end.After learning the basics of programming, like: programming logic, algorithms, data structures, and Git/GitHub, I’d like to ask for your opinion — **which language do you recommend I focus on right now?** From what I’ve seen, the most recommended ones are:* Python* Java* C#* Go* RustI was thinking about going back to Python and Rust since I already have some background with them, but I’d love to hear your opinions.",

I can make APIs and I understand HTTP to a good extent and all that stuff, I can make CRUD APIs if I wanted. But I also have this itch to make more complex projects, things that will teach me more than just language or library features. For example, I want to try to make a mini Express.js with the Node HTTP module, but when I try to think of how I would even start this project my mind just goes blank. I feel like I should know this, but I don't.I've been building APIs in raw Node.js, so I think I should at least be able to come up with some sort of abstraction around the HTTP module, kind of like what express does with app.get() and more. But for some reason, I can't. It's like I can understand HTTP, custom middleware, routing, and serving static files, but when I want to make something a step-up from basic CRUD APIs, I feel like I'm back to square one and I actually haven't learned anything. And it isn't just about this project, it's in general. For example, if I go to the \"Project based learning\" github repo and check out the Node section, it says things like \"Build a real-time Markdown editor in Node.js\", \"build a web framework\", \"build a real-time serverless GraphQL API with WebSockets on AWS\". I feel like I should maybe have SOME idea as to what things I would need to do, but I can't even think of one and if I do then I'll realize it's not a perfect solution and then I have to go back and think about it.

We are using cellular to establish communications with it for now, so we are limited on bandwidth, and sometimes the connection will go down for a few seconds.We have about 2000 data points at this remote facility (and more to come) that we are communicating back to our main server at an interval of once every second. Due to the unreliability of our network, we sometime can drop for a few seconds before connection is reestablished.Right now we are using TCP sockets to establish communications and communicate, sending the data as a single Json object (made before I got there).We have a second remote facility being built right now, so we want to improve these performances and fine tune our software before it is completed and in operation.## QuestionsOur main goal right now is to improve the reliability of our data.Since we cannot do much in terms of the actual communications, we were thinking about using a more reliable/resilient protocol like MQTT, or maybe NATS, but we don't have any experience with them. Would these be good options?What are some options for distributed systems with unreliable connections and low bandwidth?",

Is there ANY way to make this less ugly? Again, I'm more of a backend kind of person, so don't go too hard on me for how ugly this is. I'm only building a front-end so I can do more than just CLI.

I can see you reading your responses off a screen, and you know what… that’s fine. You maybe had some canned answers ready.I ask you follow up questions and you need a minute to think, that’s great. Take your time. I can even pretend not to notice you obviously typing something while you “think”, maybe you are taking notes.But if I ask you about your experiences, or why you wrote what you did or said what you did, you *must* be able to answer that question. If I ask you why you used a loop there, you need to be able to explain your choice. If I ask you how you solved that bug you are bragging about, you have to be able to walk me through it.In short: I’m happy to pretend like you aren’t using an AI assist in your interviews if you can keep up the illusion. But people who have actual skills and experiences can go from pleasant high-level summaries down several layers into explaining the details of what they understand. Solving a difficult bug leaves a mark on your soul you don’t forget the details. If I get a word salad of tech jargon as an answer, and every follow up question is a new word salad of jargon, i can’t hire you, because you give me nothing to work with.I don’t know who needs to hear this, but if you want to interview successfully you need to be able to speak coherently like a human about your own choices.",

You are mostly led by non-technical people who fail to grasp how complex what they are asking you to do is and unrealistic deadlines because they are too scared to tell their managers no.Also, endless learning new stupid languages and stacks because someone in the world just has to create \"another language\" for their own ego, that ultimately does not make anything easier. Just makes it a new thing you have to learn.Nevermind the horrible job market in tech specifically. Endless layoffs, one of the highest unemployment rates of any white collar job field (we are higher than the average now), and clear attempts to send any new jobs overseas. So you can't even get a chance to compete for those jobs that go abroad.Ultimately I'm just over it. I'm done. I want out. I just don't see a future in this field anymore.What are some realistic paths I can take to get out of this field given my CS degree and experience? I'm ok with going back to school or pay for some training if it means there is a realistic path to getting employment. As long as it won't take more than 2 years. Ideally 1 year. Open to any idea though. I'm ok taking a paycut too, anything in 80k-100k pay range is ok with me.I'm just over it. What are my options? Does anyone have any suggestions?",

        "content": "After 13 years in software development, I was laid off this past April. And while it hurt, it also felt like a strange kind of relief.The last few years were brutal with constant pressure, toxic teams, and impossible deadlines. I kept telling myself I still loved coding, but the truth is, the spark has been gone for a while. I’m burned out, drained, and the thought of jumping into another dev job just fills me with dread.I want out, not out of tech necessarily, but out of pure software development. I’m tired of the grind, the endless new frameworks, the feeling that my work is just disappearing into the void.But I feel stuck. My whole identity has been “software developer” for so long. I don’t know how to reframe my skills, or even what I’m qualified for outside of coding all day. Starting over is scary, and I don’t know where to begin.Have any of you made a big pivot after burnout or layoffs? What roles still leverage your technical background, but offer something more sustainable, more human? I’m looking at things like solutions architecture or tech-focused product roles, but I’m open to anything that doesn’t suck the life out of me again.",

        "content": "Trying to decide between two PhD L4 Infra offers (0 YoE), both based in NYC.Total compensation is nearly identical (marginally higher base salary @ Google), but Google's RSUs are front-loaded, so I'd earn \\~22% more in Y1 and \\~10% more in Y2 compared to Meta, with things evening out around the 2.5-year mark.The team at Meta is working on something I find a little bit more exciting and definitely more impactful (from a career standpoint, like the work would probably look/sound better on a resume or if I want to switch to another company eventually).One big concern is long-term WLB. Based on convos with the teams, WLB at Google should be solid for the foreseeable future. WLB @ Meta should be comparable for the first year or so, but it sounds like on-call could get rough after that (specifically the on-call severity may worsen next year).Complicating things, I’ve already signed with Meta. Would need to back out if I take the Google offer, which I’m hesitant about due to potential reputational damage.Would appreciate any insight, especially from folks who’ve been in similar situations.",

        "content": "I am interviewing for the first time in >10 years. After taking a few months off to work on a passion project, I'm realizing it's likely not going to produce income soon enough for my family, so I'm reentering the salaried job market.Prior to this I was staff engineer at a public tech company, and prior to that I was CTO of a startup which was acquired by that tech company, so I haven't done any interviewing myself for over 10 years. During that time I would say about half was hands on engineering (coding, submitting or reviewing PRs) and half on architecture/leadership.In conversations with recruiters, I have been forthright in my inexperience interviewing, saying things like I don't expect to do well on things like LeetCode interviews. Most of the recruiters I've spoken to say \"oh, we don't do LeetCode interviews here.\" You know, they want to sound _different than the other companies_. However, the very next call I have with the company will be a tech screen where I am asked to do a LeetCode style puzzle, and inevitably I bomb. There are many factors here--I am self taught--and I discovered have more test anxiety than I realized. Also, these \"problems\" are often just little puzzles that I've rarely if ever seen in my 25 years of software engineering, so I am simply rusty at solving them in the allotted time. My problem solving may also follow a non-traditional sequence that the interviewer is simply not used to seeing (like, incorrect \"order of operations\" even though I solve the problem).Regardless of whether the companies are saying they do LeetCode style questions or not, it seems like I have no choice but to grind it out until I can pass these silly interviews. I'm curious if that is what other people are experiencing? Like, there are obviously ways to get much better signal from candidates--and as a hiring manager for many many years I've developed my own preferences--but as a candidate it seems I can't influence the process at all. I'm curious what the fine folks here would say. Do I just suck it up and grind LC? Have people found success asking for alternative interviews like take-homes, PR reviews, peer coding, etc? Are there companies that I should be looking at? Anyway, thanks for listening and for any feedback or advice you can offer. Best of luck out there on your interview loops!",

Sending in many applications, building my network, tweaking resumes to fit job descriptions, mock interviews, applying to jobs within hours of being posted, attempting to contact recruiters + hiring managers, IDK it's been over a year, so I've definitely tried whatever the \"meta\" advice from LinkedIn and Reddit was. Yet it all feels useless in this current time. Makes me wonder if my school's ranking has been my limiter.I know other people are going through very similar things, yet when someone vents about their struggles on this Subreddit, it's experienced devs currently in the industry regurgitating LinkedIn advice that many of us have tried with no results. In fact, they start to just assume things about the poster and call them a doomer, when all they want to do is be heard. I do agree that some posts are outlandish, and the poster has a poorly written resume or something, but there are many of us who just want to be encouraged to keep going, or receive advice + reality checks of the current market that will actually help us calculate next steps. I try to scroll this Subreddit every day to see if there's encouragement or good advice, but a lot of it is really just putting hard and smart workers looking to just get an opportunity down for not being hardworking or smart enough. Idk, the more that I keep going with no results, the more I feel helpless. At least I want to build / look for a community that can support each other's struggles during these tough times. However, I do understand that many devs who are already in the industry are annoyed by the helpless and doomer posts. So I don't want to invade this Subreddit with that stuff after this post, but if you are struggling like me and reading this, you are not alone, and I hope you take care of your mental health first.

I imagine that I would become something of a linux kernel / GPU driver guru after some time of doing this kind of work.The other role pays better (especially after the one year re-negotiation) and allows for remote work but it's more of a regular C++ SWE engineering implementation job, after a year this would be \\~45k euro at google (net of tax) vs \\~75k euro (net of tax) at the other company.My two questions to people who have experience in the industry are:1. Would having google in my CV have a significant impact on my career compared to experience at some other company?2. Could doing no implementation and essentially only debugging be dertimental to my engineering skills or actually help me grow? I will add that I already know C++ pretty well so I don't believe I could grow all that much in terms of pure C++ skills.I would really appreciate some input.",

He said doing this would speed up the negotiation. What should I do? I feel very unconfortable. Any pros and cons?More information: Recruiter already lie to the committees without my consent. But they are asking for the written confirmation from my end. If this is true and I don’t go with it, will the lie be putting the recruiter in the bad position. Could that also hurt me (my relationship with recruiter) in the process?Update: Just told recruiter that I dont feel comfortable to do this. And he respect my decision and will work magic (maybe lie) on the committee. He added that he asked the committee more than what I asked. Honestly, as long as I got $500ish I am already very happy even if the lie may give me $30K extra or more. I just want to reach my request (and very reasonable) number. Thank you everyone!",

We never have enough work for the 10 work days of the sprint, and whenever any of the devs bring up pulling in new work, it's met with \"well, if we pull something in, odds are we won't get it completed by the time the sprint ends.\" from the Scrum Master and PO. So, the solution is to do research or some bullshit security training that's required every year until the sprint ends, essentially wasting 2-3 days a sprint.I have worked here since graduating college (<5 years), get paid (\\~85k / year, no bonus, no stock), and have good benefits (unlimited PTO, fully remote).That being said, I feel like my skills have been degrading year after year, and I'm really fed up with the red tape of this job. The work I complete has been basically the exact same for my entire time here, and having to spend 5-10 days a month \"doing my own research\" is not helping.

I graduated last year from a top CS uni in Canada with internships.Thankfully I'm currently employed as a Python developer (backend) at a small company in Canada. By small, think very small. Also, it is not a tech company. A lot of the work I've done both in this job and in my internships is not impressive or exciting. In reality, most of it has been work done on internal tooling or your everyday basic crud app. I haven't worked on complex problems, I haven't ever come across a project that I felt would take a stroke of genius to solve. I'm stagnating, and have been for a while.The problem is that I need to make more money. And I don't know where to start. I'm looking for other roles but I'm getting no bites. I'm working on side projects but the things I'm passionate about wouldn't get me hired or paid well. I've done so much Leetcode but I still flop interviews. Hell, I don't even get interviews. But I did flop the ones I got, other than my current job, of course. Now, the question is this: if I want FAANG to look at my resume a year from now, what do I have to do? Hell, it doesn't even have to be FAANG. Any tech company would be enough. Or even any reputable company even. How can I save myself from being out of a job in a year and having to spend 6 months looking for another one?",

Maybe the fact most of my degree was getting stuck 30-60 minutes on each exercise and then seeing the solution; maybe I just don't have a passion for the field, and I thought I'd get to ignite it; maybe I'm a little bitch. If I may get a job, I probably won't enjoy it. Actually, I don't even know what field I want to get into. The things that seem cool to me are physics simulators/math-heavy projects (ML feels kind of boring, unfortunately), but these barely count as related-field projects.Welp, wasted a bit of your time, but hopefully not 3 years of mine.

The demos made it look like you’d just write a prompt and it would crank out production-ready code with perfect architecture. Even our CTO was pushing us to “experiment aggressively.”And sure sometimes it does help. Boilerplate, tests, refactors I’m too lazy to do at 11 PM. No complaints there.But for real design or new features? It’s like pair programming with an overeager intern who refuses to say “I don’t know.” It’ll confidently scaffold something that compiles but is subtly wrong in ways that bite you later. Error handling missing. Boundaries between services fuzzy. Or it’ll suggest a “quick fix” that completely ignores the ADR you spent two days writing.It’s not just that it’s wrong sometimes but it’s that it’s convincingly wrong. Which is worse than useless when you’re moving fast.I’ve even had to consciously dial back my use of it on one of our event-driven services because I noticed I was rubber-stamping suggestions instead of thinking about the architecture myself. Anyway just curious if anyone else has had the same arc. I’m not anti-AI. It’s staying in my toolbox. But I’m starting to treat it more like Stack Overflow: amazing for hints, dangerous for blind copy-paste.Would love to hear how others are using it day-to-day, especially in non-trivial codebases.",

Plus, I didn’t want to leave my stable job during a pandemic.I’ve asked some other US engineers I know to take a look at my resume. They said it looks good (still waiting on one other).

It feels like it’s everywhere for systems engineers.It feels so aggravating at times. For one out of every 4 weeks, I can’t go out to dinner, I can’t go to a concert, I can’t have a few drinks, and I can’t go do fun weekend activities, because I have to be within 15-30 minutes of a response time in the unlikely event that something goes wrong.Usually, everything is fine, and there are no issues. Which, I’m grateful for. But it feels tough when my friends want to plan to go to the beach with our boyfriends on a Saturday, and I have to say no because I need to be somewhere with WiFi in case things go awry.It feels like such a champagne problem; I’m making more than double what any of my other friends make, and I have more money saved for retirement than most people 10 years older than me do. So it feels incredibly entitled to be bitching about this.

I understand from the company's point of view but out of self respect, I would like to be valued more someplace else.Is it a respectful choice to make a year or two with the company, or just ride where the wind takes me?\\*Note: I am aware I got low-balled because my \"best office friend\" is another department head. My boss flips over the paper when it comes around to discussion of my salary. He knows it will come back to me and doesnt want anyone to know I accepted something so low.

Every framework or library we produce aims to reduce the amount of work we have to spend to achieve some result.The western world represents 15-20% of the population, and we can imagine the remaining 80% catching up will keep on producing more and more engineers as years go by, especially as long as IT is considered the holy grail of sure employment and high pay.With software being shipped at light speed, and a single software being usable by billions of users around the world, i'm wondering if we will not hit a ceiling ? A moment where, full stop, we'll have too many CS trained people, and every extra million trained CS graduate will mean an extra million CS trained person not working in a CS related field.

However, in order to bring life to my project and take it out of the database I have been teaching myself Flask in order to create a basic website. Right now I am kind of at a crossroads. I can either finish my basic webpage and focus my energy on deepening my data engineering skills and knowledge (e.g. learning Spark, NoSQL, Kafka, Snowflake, practicing SQL more etc.) or expand my frontend skills and knowledge (e.g. learning Javascript, Typescript, and frontend framework such as React).I ask because I am starting a graduate program (Msc Computer Science conversion) but I will still likely need to build these skills in my own time, but I'll definitely have limited time and won't be able to do both.I also ask because while I find DE very interesting and engaging, I understand that DE isn't something people do right after graduating as it is quite niche and it takes a few years experience either being an analyst or a SWE.My goal is to develop the skills to maximize my chances of employability.Help me help myself Thanks!",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey everyone,I'm currently at a point, where I do not know what to do and would appreciate some perspectives.My background:I have a Master's degree in Business Administration & Economics (studied at a german uni, am german myself). During my masters I started to go down the self-taught dev route. Now I have been working for 2 years as IT consultant and software developer in an enterprise environment (Java Spring Boot). Currently self-studying CS fundamentals through teachyourselfcs.com (working through CS:APP right now). I'm aware I have some gaps in my CS knowledge, which is why I started the self-study route. Now I'm considering going back to university for a CS Bachelor's degree (would do it part-time while keeping my full-time job. Studying evenings/weekends. Would be at a \"Hochschule\" that costs 19k€).The thing is, I could spend those 3.5 years on getting the CS Bachelor's degree OR continuing self-study, building projects, gaining more work experience and getting certifications.From a career perspective, my main question is: What looks better in the (European) job market:1. Having that CS degree on paper after already working in the field2. Having no CS degree, but a few certificates and a couple personal projects and focusing more on my career in the current company.I'm genuinely torn. Part of me wants the \"proper\" CS foundation and having something to show for it, but another part thinks that time could be better invested in practical experience and targeted learning. Also I would basically just do it for the \"academic proof\" for future employers, as I think that some of the stuff learned during the CS-degree is not practical and the important topics are also learnable by self-study, as I am currently doing.Anyone been in a similar situation? How did it work out? Would love to hear thoughts from both hiring managers and developers who've taken either path.Thanks!",

I am a full-stack developer who is planning on changing jobs soon, and I've noticed that experience with React + Node seems to be in high demand, but I have close to zero experience with that setup. Most of my career I have worked with frameworks surrounding php and java, such as Laravel, Spring, Struts, etc.I have plenty of time at the moment and I was thinking that I might as well take some course or pursue some certification that would look good on LinkedIn. Can you recommend something, either for just React for now, or for React + Node? I was thinking of anything I can complete within a few weeks, ideally not much more than that.So far I've been considering Meta's [React Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/meta-react-specialization) on Coursera, or maybe IBM's [JavaScript Programming with React, Node & MongoDB Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/javascript-programming-with-react-node-mongodb?specialization=meta-front-end-developer), also on Coursera. Someone else on a different subreddit recommended the [Full Stack](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course from the University of Helsinki, which looks comprehensive and touches many modern technologies I am not familiar with, but which could be overkill for someone who is already a developer, I guess.Please, I know it might be a boring question, but can you please offer some guidance? Again, what I want is:* Learning about React and Node (or, first one thing and then the other one) * A reputable certificate to add to my resume and Linkedin profile * Ideally, an endeavor that requires not more than a few weeks (a couple of months would be my absolute max)",

Don't really like the job and my team isn't technical at all.# Option 2: Move to Canada for Waterloo’s in-person MEng (includes a co-op term)* **Cost:** Tuition plus rent and living costs in Waterloo, so I would burn savings (but I can afford it)* **Upside:** Waterloo’s name carries weight, and the co-op cycle should drop me into genuine dev roles and help me build a network in Canadian tech* **Downside:** Two years of full-time study at age 24, plus the chance I still end up fighting for the same entry-level SWE spots afterward. And the job market is not great so it's a risk.# About me* Canadian citizen, CS undergrad (was originally in DS and had my internships in that)* Part-time work with two early-stage US startups* Contributing to AI research in my spare hours to bulk up the résumé* Goal: Land a software engineering job in Canada or the US within the next couple of years# Anything else I should weigh before picking comfort now versus a riskier move that might unlock better opportunities later?**What would you do if you were in my shoes?**",

My understanding is that for undergrad, and probably any non-research Master's degree, the (at least perceived) school quality/ranking is very important. What about for a PhD though? Or a research-based Master's degree? My brief understanding is that here things get blurry because it's more about finding a specific research supervisor and field of research, rather than just trying to get into the highest ranking school you can. Of course we need a criterion, so I'd say something like 'future career prospect maximization'. My concern is that as a mature student with a likely weaker applicant profile, I would probably get into a lower ranking school than my undergrad school. So would that end up looking weak on my resume? What should I consider here? Happy to try and answer any clarifying questions, and hopefully this topic will be useful for others as well. Cheers!",

Not to mention, a few updates from these patches can be moved very easily without the drive and I usually move those first anyway and for some reason, I waited till I got the drive to do those too! I assumed the security office only had 1 drive but I JUST went and asked them and they have 3 apparently! I should have done this before.My boss wasn't very happy and there is a meeting with a few members on the team in 1-2 weeks to discuss patching. I feel like this will reflect really poorly on me. My boss also asked that I create an email chain so we all keep track of patching progress in July, so I've been working extra fast to get them all done this month! I hope they don't ask me what I was doing during that one week delay in June because that was 2 weeks ago and I have no idea why I wasn't more proactive. How badly do you think this can affect me?",

I have had a lot of fun, learned a lot, and generally had a positive experience. I enjoy the people I work with and don't mind coming into work on a Monday morning. I realize that these feelings are invaluable, and I am lucky to be in a position like this.That said, I want more. I don't want to look back in a couple of years and regret not having tried something new. I recently got married, and now that I don't have kids, it is the best time to make a change.I'm specifically asking this question to those of you who were in a similar position. A position where you enjoyed your current role, but it was no longer satisfying you. A position where you felt that you had more to do and a lot more to learn.I'm currently studying extensively to prepare myself for interviews and secure a remote role in the coming months. For those of you who transitioned and left an otherwise comfortable job, how do you feel now? Was it worth it? Are you growing a lot more?I recently heard a quote that went something like, \"regret comes from not having tried something, not failing at the thing you did try.\"",

For the past few years I keep getting myself into a severe burnout stage with the most recent getting me into considering leaving app development to seek other options in the tech industry. I am mostly burnt out of constantly being seen as a jack of all trades as a senior developer. I end up being the trainer/mentor/leader of teams wherever I go and while that is a good thing from a career perspective, it leaves me feeling mentally exhausted. I was hoping for some feedback on former software engineers who have made a switch in more of a QA engineer/automation role. Or anyone who is active in QA and would be willing to share their experience. I wonder what the workload looks like, where the QA side of the industry is heading, and any other helpful tips. I have thrown some apps out there but would like to know others thoughts before diving too far into this. Thank you",

I’ve been going through some changes lately and I could really use some honest advice from people already working remotely. I’ve been working with electrical engineering for over 8 years now, mostly with protection and control systems for power substations. Had the chance to lead a team, work abroad a few times (Sweden, China, Paraguay), been in big projects… and I do like the field. But recently I’ve been feeling tired of the pressure, the heavy workload, and the traditional work model. It’s just not doing it for me anymore. So I’ve been looking for something lighter, remote, something that gives me back some time and mental space. I’m even ok with starting part-time or doing something simpler, as long as I get to earn in dollars and move towards a new lifestyle. I’ve been doing some research and even working with ChatGPT (yeah, for real lol) to figure out what kind of remote jobs would make sense for me. We came across roles like tech support, helpdesk, NOC, customer support... but I’d really love to hear from real people here. If you’ve been through a similar transition or if you work remotely and have any advice. What kind of roles do you think someone like me could land in this first step? Any platforms or companies you’d recommend? Feel free to drop a comment or DM me. I’m open to learning, adapting and going all in. I'm male, brazilian, 31 yo. Thanks for reading this far",

        "content": "Hey, I'm contemplating and thinking if it's worth it to change a job. My work experience is: 2.5 YOE (part-time), 1 OE and now almost 2 YOE at a third job. But at my current job I know that I'm kind of capped with my salary: this spring I got 5% increase and my manager mentioned that we are thinking about giving me senior level next fall (not this fall). Maximum what I can get is next year again 5% increase and the best option if I get a senior level then 10% next fall, but it's also possible that I'm not going to get it also. Now I have an offer which is instantly 20% more. Also, important information that currently I'm working in the bank as a .NET developer, and a new role will be .NET + angular. New workplace knows that I have 0 angular knowledge, but they have no problem with it because I show motivation to learn it.On paper new job is of course better, I'm a little bit stressed, because I don't have angular experience, but if I switched jobs I would get 20% increase and also would get an opportunity to learn front-end. How do you approach job changes?",

        "author": "ThomasHawl",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi everyone,I'm a 28-year-old who finished my MSc in Mathematics around 18 months ago. After graduation, I briefly worked as a paid researcher at my university, then struggled to find the right job. About three months ago, I joined Accenture out of financial necessity, but the job was completely non-technical, focused mostly on strategic consulting, presentations, and PowerPoint—basically everything I don’t enjoy. I recently quit this position.I now managed to land a technical role as an Embedded Software Engineer at a large multinational aerospace and defense company. Even though embedded development isn't directly aligned with my studies, I really enjoy programming, problem-solving, and low-level technical challenges, so I'm genuinely excited about the new role.However, I found out that the tech stack relies heavily on C and ADA, which, at least from my perspective, seem somewhat outdated. My main reasons for accepting this role were:1. Escaping traditional strategic consulting (like Accenture's). Even though technically it's still consulting (body rental), at least now I'll focus on one specific technical project instead of juggling multiple non-technical tasks.2. The company offers strong international mobility opportunities (Europe, Asia, USA), which align closely with my personal and professional priorities.My longer-term goals aren’t completely clear yet—I initially thought I’d stay in academia and research (ML), but now I'm more inclined toward working on low-level, latency-sensitive projects, ideally using innovative technologies in C++ or Rust. I'm also quite interested in quantitative finance or joining Big Tech companies primarily due to their innovation. Given my math and ML background, roles involving machine learning or deep learning also seem appealing.I’d also love to explore high-performance systems programming or low-level AI infrastructure (Linux kernel dev, robotics, or high-frequency trading infrastructure among other things). However, I'm not sure how easy it'll be to pivot from ADA/C embedded roles into such fields. I’d prefer avoiding anything frontend or web development-related.In my free time, I'm actively studying C++ and Rust, deepening my knowledge of ML frameworks I've previously used at university (TensorFlow, PyTorch), and contributing to open-source projects, though my free time is currently limited. I’ve considered pursuing certifications but I'm not sure they're valuable enough on a CV.Given this context, my main questions for you are:* **Would you recommend sticking to embedded software (C/ADA) for at least 1–2 years before trying to pivot into a more modern software engineering field (e.g., C++, Rust, or ML infrastructure), or should I aim to switch sooner?*** **Are there examples of people successfully moving from ADA/C embedded roles into fields like Linux kernel development, robotics, Rust systems development, or similar areas?*** **Is my fear of being \"stuck\" justified, or will my embedded experience still be highly valued and easily transferable?**Any advice, experiences, or insights would be greatly appreciated!Thanks!",

        "content": "Hi everyone, i would like some suggestions about my situation: I graduated with a Master’s in Computer Science this February, and I have about 2 years of work experience. I live and work in Mediterranean Europe.I have done a 1 year part-time internship as Data Scientist while I was studying. Then I was linked by a professor to a small/medium size company (50 employees) that had a small AI/research team. With them i signed a part time work / part time thesis contract for 6 months, after wich they hired me as a Junior AI dev.The job is nice, but they pay is very low and I don't have basically 0 growing possibility (and I'm never allowed to work from home!); for these reasons I have started looking for a new job. I am trying to either move abroad to get a better paying job, or find a job in a big tech company here in my country.Well yesterday I was contacted for a position in KPMG in my city, to work in ai/robot automation, which is very interesting to me and i would happily shift towards that sector. Also it's a big company where i could potentially grow both skill wise and carreer wise. BUT the contract they are offering me is an apprenticeship that pays just €2k/year more than where i am right now (so we are talking about **€30k/year** :weary_face:). I *might* accept this kind of offer from a FAANG or similar company because of the long-term benefits, but I’m unsure if it's worth stepping down to an apprenticeship for essentially the same pay, especially when I could potentially find something better abroad.But i have been looking for positions abroad for months, I have sent 40/50 CVs but i've got only 2 positive replies and I didn't get far in the interviews processes.What do you guys say?",
