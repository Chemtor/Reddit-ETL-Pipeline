I went full enterprise when a simple Power BI embedded report in Teams would’ve solved it.Lesson learned: not every client wants “scalable,” some just want usable. Now, before every sprint, I ask, “what decisions will this dashboard actually drive?” It’s made my workflow (and sanity) 10x better.Anyone else ever gone too deep when the client just wanted a one-page view?",

Second try was kafka clusters at each site but management became a full time job, needed way more hardware than budgeted, configuration issues between sites I spent more time fighting it than building features. We went way simpler didn't need maximum speed, just reliable data collection with minimal babysitting that handles network failures because factory internet sucks. Found messaging that runs on cheap hardware, handles hub and spoke setup, saves data so we don't lose anything when connections drop, small servers at each factory, machines connect locally. If the site loses internet local monitoring keeps working and syncs when back we are using nats now it handles 500 machines without drama.Learned edge first matters way more than raw speed for iot, devices should work independently and sync when they can, not depend on constant cloud, simpler beats complex sometimes.",

        "author": "lostmyway573",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Obvious throwaway account is obvious.My job is a data engineer for a medium-ish sized company, been here for just over 4 years. This is my first \"data\" job, but I learned a good bit about SQL in previous roles. Our department / my team manages our BI data warehouse, and we have a couple of report developers as well. When I read and study about modern data engineering practices, or modern development practices / AI usage, I feel like I'm a caveman rubbing sticks together while watching flying cars go by me every day. I'm considering switching to a DevOps position in my company because I enjoy working with Linux and smaller applications, but also because I feel like this position is a complete dead end - I have no room to exert creativity or really learn anything on the job because of the reasons I'll detail below.Until about 2 years ago, our data warehouse was basically one large SQL database (MS SQL). Standard Kimball-style facts/dimensions, with a handful of other nonstandard tables scattered here and there. We also have a few separate databases that act as per-department \"sandboxes\" for business analysts to build their own stuff, but that's a whole separate story. The whole thing is powered by SSIS packages; OLTP data transformed to a star schema in most cases. Most of it appears to be developed by people who learned SSIS before SQL, because in almost every process, the business logic is baked into transformations instead of scripts or code. I expected this from a legacy setup, and shortly after I started working here it became known that we were going to be migrating to the cloud and away from this legacy stuff, so I thought it was a temporary problem that we'd be walking away from.How naive I was.Problem #1: We have virtually no documentation, other than the occasional comment within code if I'm lucky. We have no medallion architecture. We have no data dictionary. Pretty much all the knowledge of how a majority of our data interacts is tribal knowledge within my department and the business analysts who have been here for a long time. Even the business logic of our reports that go to the desks of the C-levels gets argued about sometimes because it's not written down anywhere. We've had no standard code practices (ever) so one process to the next could employ a totally different design approach.Problem #2: Enter the cloud migration phase. At first, this sounded like the lucky break I was hoping for - a chance to go hands-on with Snowflake and employ real data engineering tools and practices and rebuild a lot of the legacy stuff that we've dealt with since our company's inception. Sadly, that would have been way too easy... Orders came down from the top that we needed to get this done as a lift-and-shift, so we paid a consulting company to use machine learning to convert all of our SSIS packages into Azure Data Factory pipelines en masse. Since we don't have a data dictionary or any real documentation, we really had no way to offer test cases for validating data after the fact. We spent months manually validating table data against table data, row by row. Now we're completely vendor-locked with ADF, which is a massive pile of shit for doing surgical-level transformations like we do. Problem #2A: Architecture. Our entire architecture was decided by one person - a DBA who, by their own admission, has never been a developer of any sort, so they had no idea how complex some of our ETL processes were. Our main OLTP system is staying on-prem, and we're replicating its database up to Snowflake using a third-party tool as our source. Then our ADF processes transform the data and deposit it back to Snowflake in a separate location. I feel like we could have engineered a much simpler solution than this if we were given a chance, but this decision was made before my team was even involved. (OneLake? Dynamic Tables?)Problem #3: Project management, or the lack thereof. At this inception of this migration, the decision to use ADF was made without consulting anyone in my department, including our manager. Similarly, the decision to just convert all of our stuff was made without input from our department. We were also never given a chance to review any of our existing stuff to determine if anything was deprecated; we paid for all of it to be converted, debugged it, and half of it is defunct. Literal months of manpower wasted. Problem #4: Looking ahead. If I fast forward to the end of this migration phase and look at what my job is going to be on a daily basis, it boils down to wrestling with Azure Data Factory every day and dissecting tiny bits of business logic that are baked into transformations, with layers upon layers of unnecessary complexity, let alone the aforementioned lack of code standardization.This doesn't feel like data engineering, this feels like janitorial code cleanup as a result of poor project planning and no foresight. I'm very burned out and it feels hopeless to think there's any real data engineering future here. I recently picked up the Snowflake SnowPro Core certification in my downtime because I really enjoy working with the platform, and I've also been teaching myself a bit about devops in my spare time at home (built a homelab / NAS, stood up some containers, gonna be playing with K3S this weekend). Am I crazy, or is this a shitshow? Would anybody else stay here, or how would anyone else proceed in this situation? Any input is welcomed.edit: for clarity, current architecture boils down to: source OLTP > replicated to Snowflake via third-party tool > ADF for ETL/ELT > destination Snowflake",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "In an enterprise setting we spend $100k+, in bigger orgs even $xM+ for transforming data at scale. To create the perfect data source for our business partners. Which often or most of the time is under utilized. To do this we use a data warehouses (Redshift, Snowflake) or lakehouse (Databricks, ADF, …). The new platform made it easier to handle the data, but it comes with a cost. They are designed for big data (TB’s to PB’s of data), but arguably in most organization most data sources are a fraction of this size. Those solutions are also designed to lock you in with proprietary compute and data formats as they say necessary to provide the best performance. Whenever our Redshift Datawarehouse struggled to keep up AWS’s answer was, “oh your cluster head node is not keeping up with the demand you should upgrade to the next bigger instance type” problem solved and cost was doubled. But now with cheap object storage and open data formats like iceberg it should be possible to get the same performance than Snowflake, Redshift and Databricks at a fraction of the cost. But in order to transform your data you need compute and your data need to be ingested into the compute, transformed and written back in the transformed format to your datalake. The object storage and network speed between storage and compute is usually your bottleneck here. I made some experiments with different EC2 instances and duckdb (just saying I am not affiliated with the product). I had a 85GB timeseries data stream (iceberg) that needed to be pivoted and split into 100 individual tables. On a regular general purpose compute instance t3g.2xlarge that took about 6-7 hours to complete. Then I used i4g memory optioned instances with more memory and network bandwidth up 25 Gbps and it halfed the time. Then I found these new instances network optimized c8gn and they managed to do all 100 tables in 20 mins. Compare this to databricks (Databricks was reading from s3), which took 3 hours. Databricks cost for this transform was $9.38 and the EC2 instance did it for $1.70. So huge savings with a bit of engineering.Wanted to share this and wanted to hear some stories from others in their pursuit of cheaper data transformation options EDIT: just to clarify. I am not proposing get rid of data warehouse or lakehouse, just saying you can save by “outsourcing” compute for batch transformations to much cheaper compute options so you can keep your actual warehouse/lakehouse small.",

So how is that possible if it’s supposed to be lazy?

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone, I’ve spent the last few weeks talking with a friend about the lack of a standard for data transformations.Our conversation started with the Fivetran + dbt merger (and the earlier acquisition of SQLMesh): what alternative tool is out there? And what would make me confident in such tool?Since dbt became popular, we can roughly define a transformation as:* a SELECT statement* a schema definition (optional, but nice to have)* some logic for materialization (table, view, incremental)* data quality tests* and other elements (semantics, unit tests, etc.)If we had a standard we could move a transformation from one tool to another, but also have mutliple tools work together (interoperability).Honestly, I initially wanted to start building a tool, but I forced myself to sit down and first write a standard for data transformations. Quickly, I realized the specification also needed to include tests and UDFs (this is my pet peeve with transformation tools, UDF are part of my transformations).It’s just an initial draft, and I’m sure it’s missing a lot. But it’s open, and I’d love to get your feedback to make it better.I am also bulding my open source tool, but that is another story.",

        "content": "Hey everyone,I'm working as an AI Architect consultant for a mid-sized B2B SaaS company, and we're in the final forecasting stage for a new \"AI Co-pilot\" feature. This agent is customer-facing, designed to let their Pro-tier users run complex queries against their own data.The projected API costs are raising serious red flags, and I'm trying to benchmark how others are handling this.**1. The Cost Projection:** The agent is complex. A single query (e.g., \"Summarize my team's activity on Project X vs. their quarterly goals\") requires a 4-5 call chain to GPT-4T (planning, tool-use 1, tool-use 2, synthesis, etc.). We're clocking this at **\\~$0.75 per query**.The feature will roll out to **\\~5,000 users**. Even with a conservative **20% DAU** (1,000 users) asking just **5 queries/day**, the math is alarming: \\*(1,000 DAUs \\* 5 queries/day \\* 20 workdays \\* $0.75/query) = **\\~$75,000/month.**\\*This turns a feature into a major COGS problem. How are you justifying/managing this? Are your numbers similar?**2. The Data Conflict Problem:** Honestly, this might be worse than the cost. The agent has to query multiple internal systems *about* the customer's data (e.g., their usage logs, their tenant DB, the billing system).We're seeing conflicts. For example, the **usage logs** show a customer is using an \"Enterprise\" feature, but the **billing system** has them on a \"Pro\" plan. The agent doesn't know what to do and might give a wrong or confusing answer. This reliability issue could kill the feature.**My Questions:*** Are you all just eating these high API costs, or did you build a sophisticated middleware/proxy to aggressively cache, route to cheaper models, and reduce \"ping-pong\"?* How are you solving these data-conflict issues? Is there a \"pre-LLM\" validation layer?* Are any of the observability tools (Langfuse, Helicone, etc.) actually helping solve this, or are they just for logging?Would appreciate any architecture or strategy insights.

The infrastructure is very \"do it yourself\", and now that I’m near the end of my degree, the data volume has exploded and the organization has become a serious maintenance problem.Currently, I have a Linux server with a /data folder (\\~800GB and growing) that contains:* Climate datasets (NetCDF4, HDF5, and Zarr) — mainly MERRA-2 and ERA5, handled through Xarray;* Tabular data and metadata (CSV, XLSX);* ML models (mostly Scikit-learn and PyTorch pickled models);* A relational database with experiment information.The system works, but as it grew, several issues emerged:* Data ingestion and metadata standardization are fully manual (isolated Python scripts);* Subfolders for distributing the final application (e.g., a reduced /data subset with only one year of data, \\~10GB) are manually generated;* There’s no version control for the data, so each new processing step creates new files with no traceability;* I’m the only person managing all this — once I leave, no one will be able to maintain it.I want to move away from this “messy data folder” model and build something more organized, readable, and automatable, but still realistic for an academic environment (no DevOps team, no cloud, just a decent local server with a few TB of storage).What I’ve considered so far:* A full relational database, but converting NetCDF to SQL would be absurdly expensive in both cost and storage.* A NoSQL database like MongoDB, but it seems inefficient for multidimensional data like netcdf4 datasets.* The idea of a local data lake seems promising, but I’m still trying to understand how to start and what tools make sense in a research (non-cloud) setting.I’m looking for a structure that can:* Organize everything (raw, processed, outputs, etc.);* Automate data ingestion and subset generation (e.g., extract only one year of data);* Provide some level of versioning for data and metadata;* Be readable enough for someone else to understand and maintain after me.Has anyone here faced something similar with large climate datasets (NetCDF/Xarray) in a research environment? Should I be looking into a non-relational database?Any advice on architecture, directory standards, or tools would be extremely welcome — I find this problem fascinating and I’m eager to learn more about this area, but I feel like I need a bit of guidance on where to start.",

        "content": "My main question is at what point and for what aggregations should I switch from SQL to Python?My goals being:1. Not writing endless amount of repeated tedious code (or having AI write endless repeating tedious code for me). What I mean is all of the CTEs I need to write for each bucket/feature requested, so like CTE\\_a\\_category\\_last\\_month with a where clause on category and timeframe. My first thought was doing the buckets in Python would help but upon research everyone recommends to use SQL for pretty much everything up until machine learning.2. Run-time. Because of the sheer amount of features that were requested of me (400 for now, but they want to go more granular with categories so it's gonna be like 1000 more), the 400 take a while to run, about 15 minutes. Maybe 15 minutes isn't that bad? Idk but the non-technical people above me aren't happy with it.Pre-Context:I am not the one coming up with the asks, I am a junior, I have very little power or say or access. This means no writing to PROD, only reading, and I have to use PROD. Yes I can use AI but I am not looking for AI suggestions because I know how to use AI and I'm already using it. I want human input on the smartest most elegant solution.Also to preface I have a bunch of experience with SQL, but not so much experience with Python beyond building machine learning algorithms and doing basic imputation/re-expression, which is why I'm not sure what tool is better.Context-context:I work with transaction data. We have tables with account info, customer info, transaction code info, etc. I've already aggregated all of the basic data and features, runs pretty fast. But once I add the 400 buckets/features, it runs slow. For each transaction category and a bunch of time frames (ie. month buckets for the past two years, so you'll have a\\_category\\_last\\_month, a\\_category\\_last\\_last\\_month, b\\_category\\_last\\_month, etc) I need to do a bunch of heavy aggregations ie minimum amount spent on a single day during given month.Right now it's all done in SQL. I'm working on optimizing the query, but there is only so much I can do and I dread working on the new 1000 categories they want. What is the best way to go about my task? What would SQL handle better and be better/more elegant for code written vs Python? AI suggested to create a row for each feature instead of column for every single customer and then have Python pivot it, is this a good option? I feel like more rows would take even longer to run.",

I am about 3 months into learning and working with databricks and dbt and building pipelines. Recently I received a job offer from a government agency for an analytics manager. The pay is the same as I make and a better retirement pension if I stay long term. One the one hand I want to stay at my current job because doing a full migration will help me better my technical skills for long term. On the other hand this is my chance to step into management and ultimately I want to explore the management route because I am scared that AI will eventually make my mediocre DE skills obsolete and I don’t want to be laid off at 50 without much prospects. Both the current job and the new job offer are remote. Would love your suggestions and thank you in advance. Edit - The new job has been described as overseeing a team of 5 that will start a migration to databricks and duck db from Oracle. They use microstrategy as their semantic layer. I would be initially learn the existing system and then work with vendors and work with the team to migrate the data. I am 42 with a family living in a MCOL area and financially doing alright with decent savings but definitely need to work till 60 unless I get an unexpected windfall.",

The `repartition` option combines everything back into one partition and while there may still be multiple executors, the write seems to be single, and it takes a long time.I have tried `df.repartition(*cols).write.partitionBy(*cols)...`, but this produces multiple files for some partitions.I would like the output of `coalesce(1) / repartition(1)`, but the parallelism of regular `df.write`.Is this possible to do, or will I have to rethink about wanting one file?",

These jobs, responsible for replication from HANA to Snowflake, uses spark.What's the best approaches to achive this? Should I go for ADF only, Databricks only or ADF + Databricks? The HANA is on-prem.Jobs overview-Currently, we have a metadata-driven Glue-based ETL framework for replicating data from SAP HANA to Snowflake. The controller Glue job orchestrates everything - it reads control configurations from Snowflake, checks which tables need to run, plans partitioning with HANA, and triggers parallel Spark Glue jobs. The Spark worker jobs extract from HANA via JDBC, write to Snowflake staging, merge into target tables, and log progress back to Snowflake.Has anyone gone through this same thing? **Please help.**",

Practically, the DB doesn’t see concurrent writers for that key.**Questions**1. If serial order is already enforced upstream, does it still make sense to keep the DB at SERIALIZABLE? Or can I safely relax to READ COMMITTED / REPEATABLE READ?2. Where does **contention** go after relaxing isolation—does it simply move from the DB’s lock manager to my app/middleware (locks/queue)?3. Any **gotchas, patterns, or references** (papers/blogs) that discuss this trade-off?**Minimal examples to illustrate context****A) DB-enforced (serialisable transaction)**```sqlBEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;SELECT stock FROM products WHERE id = 42;-- if stock > 0:UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = 42;COMMIT;```**B) App-enforced (single JVM, per-key lock), DB at READ COMMITTED**```java// map: productId -> lock objectLock lock = locks.computeIfAbsent(productId, id -> new ReentrantLock());lock.lock();try { // autocommit: each statement commits on its own int stock = select(\"SELECT stock FROM products WHERE id = ?\", productId); if (stock > 0) { exec(\"UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = ?\", productId); }} finally { lock.unlock();}```**C) App-enforced (distributed lock), DB at READ COMMITTED**```javaRLock lock = redisson.getLock(\"lock:product:\" + productId);if (!lock.tryLock(200, 5_000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) { // busy; caller can retry/back off return;}try { int stock = select(\"SELECT stock FROM products WHERE id = ?\", productId); if (stock > 0) { exec(\"UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = ?\", productId); }} finally { lock.unlock();}```**D) App-enforced (single-writer queue), DB at READ COMMITTED**```java// Producer (HTTP handler)enqueue(topic=\"purchases\", key=productId, value=\"BUY\");// Consumer (single thread per key-partition)for (Message m : poll(\"purchases\")) { long id = m.key; int stock = select(\"SELECT stock FROM products WHERE id = ?\", id); if (stock > 0) { exec(\"UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = ?\", id); }}```I understand that each approach has different failure modes (e.g., lock TTLs, process crashes between select/update, fairness, retries). I’m specifically after **when it’s reasonable to relax DB isolation** because order is guaranteed elsewhere, and how teams reason about the **shift in contention** and **operational complexity**.",

Devs would rely on reading logs and hoping for the best to justify a behaviour that maybe was normal, maybe was always like that. So grafana just proved it right or wrong.Decisions are now made by people “watching grafana”. This metric here means this, this other means that. And both together means that.While it still a very small side project, now I have been given people to help me to leverage that to the entire pipeline, which is fairly complex from the business perspective, and time consuming, given I don’t have a deep knowledge of any of these tools and infrastructure behind it and I learn as I find challenges.I was just a DBA with a side project hahaa.Finally my question:Where do I start? I mean, I already started, but I wonder if I can make use of ML to create meaning alerts/metrics.

These are difficult to access and update, and we also lack a clear overview of which pipelines are running, when they are running, and whether any have failed. We only get notified by the end users...We’re considering migrating to Azure Container Apps or Azure Container App Jobs. The advantages we see are that we can easily set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to deploy new images and have a straightforward way to schedule runs. However, one limitation is that we would still be missing a central overview of pipeline runs and their statuses. Does anyone have experience or recommendations for handling monitoring and failure tracking in such a setup? Is a tool like Sentry enough?We have also looked into orchestration tools like Dagster and Airflow, but we are concerned about the operational overhead. These tools can add maintenance complexity, and the learning curve might make it harder for our first-line IT support to identify and resolve issues quickly.What do you think about this approach? Does migrating to Azure Container Apps make sense in this case? Are there other alternatives or lightweight orchestration tools you would recommend that provide better observability and management?Thanks in advance for your input!",

I need to anonymize sensitive data, and from what I’ve seen, Google provides some native masking options — but they seem to rely heavily on policy tags and Data Catalog policies.My challenge is the following: I *don’t* want to mask data in the original (raw/silver) tables. I only want masking to happen in the **consumption views** that are built on top of those tables. However, it looks like BigQuery doesn’t allow applying policy tags or masking policies directly to views.Has anyone dealt with a similar situation or has suggestions on how to approach this?The goal is to leverage Google’s built-in tools instead of maintaining our own custom anonymization logic, which would simplify ongoing maintenance. If anyone has alternative ideas, I’d really appreciate it.**Note:** I only need the data to be anonymized in the final consumption/refined layer.",

Does anyone know of any resources, information, or quite literally any helpful ideas for determining where to begin? I am well versed in excel and sheets, I'm moderately capable with basic automations and workflows, although I haven't spent much time yet learning how to use app scripts, API's, nor how to go about developing a system of data consolidation in which the data is being collected using different platforms. For instance our LMS is Powerschool which also serves as our SIS although we use a platform called Dean's list for behavioral monitoring. Additionally our standardized test scores come from 2 different sources. Any help, direction, etc would be incredibly helpful. If I wasn't swamped and overwhelmed with all of my other duties I would take the time to learn it all on my own but we operate so stupidly and in such disorganization most hours of my day are spent doing things that could easily be incorporated into workflows, if I could figure out how to use the API's to allow data to be shared with various platforms(google workspace, Powerschool, Dean's list, etc).",

Browsing our warehouse layer alone (not all the source tables are hooked up to it) you find dozens of schemas and hundreds of tables. Searching for what should be a standard entity \"Order\" returns dozens of tables with confusing names and varying content. Every person who writes queries in the company (they're in every department) complains about how hard it is to find things. There's a lack of centralized reference tables that give us basic information about our clients and the services we offer them (it's technically not crucial to the architecture of the tools) and each client is configured differently so running queries on all our data is complex.The company is still growing and made it this far despite this, **so is it urgent to address this right now?** I don't know. But I'm concerned by my lack of ability to easily answer \"how many clients would be impacted by this Product change.\" (though I'm sure with more time I'll figure it out)**I pitched to head of Product that I dedicate my next year to focusing on upgrading the data models behind our core business areas**, and to do this in tandem with new Product launches (so it's not just a \"data review\" exercise), but I was met with the reasonable question of \"how would this impact client experience and your personal KPIs?\". The only impact I can think of measuring is reduction in hours spent by eng and data on sifting through things (which is not easy to measure), but cutting costs when you're a growing business is usually not the highest priority.My question: **what are metrics have you used to justify data model reviews?** How do you know when a confusing model might be a problem and when?Welcome all thoughts - thank you!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I work for a small organization and we have built an ETL pipeline with Python and SQL for Power BI dashboards. Here is the current process:There are multiple python scripts connected to each other by importing in-memory dataframes. One script runs multiple complex SQL queries concurrently and there are other scripts for transforming the data and uploading to SQL server. The pipeline transfers 3 MB of data each time since it queries the most recent data and takes 2 to 3 minutes to execute each day.This is hard to automate because the databases require VPN which needs 2fa. So we have been working with the IT solutions team to automate the pipeline.The easiest way to automate this would be to deploy the code onto a VM and have it run on a schedule. However, the solutions team has proposed a different approach with Azure Data Factory:* ADF orchestrator invokes \"Copy Data\" activity via self-hosted IR via to the source DB* Data is copied into Azure Blob Storage* Function App executes transformations in the Python scripts* Self-hosted IR invokes \"Copy Data\" with Source as transformed data and the SQL Server as the sinkThe IT solutions deparment said this is the best approach because Microsoft supports PaaS over IaaS and there would be overhead of managing the VM.I am just wondering if this solution would be overkill because our pipeline is very small scale (only 3 MB of data transferred on each run) and we are not a large company.The other problem is that nobody on the team knows Azure. Even though the IT solutions team will implement everything, it will still need to be maintained. The team consists of a business analyst who only knows SQL and not Python, a co-op student who changes every 4 months and myself. I am just a student who has worked here on many co-op and part time roles (currently part time). The business analyst delegates all the major technical tasks to the co-op students so when I leave, the pipeline will be managed by another co-op student who will only be there for 4 months.Management currently support the ADF approach because it is Microsoft best practice. They believes that using a VM will not be best practice and they will need to hire another person to fix everything if it breaks. They also want to move to Fabric in the future for its AI/ML capabilities even though we can just build ML pipelines in Python.I am not sure if I am overthinking this or the ADF solution is truly overkill. I am fine with learning Azure technologies and not opposed to it but I want to build something that can be maintained.",

        "author": "overwhelmed_and_shy",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello everyone,I’m a CTO of a small startup in South America (limited budget, of course) with a background in software development. While I have academic knowledge in Machine Learning, AI explicability, and related topics, I’ve never worked on a professional data team or project. In most academic projects, we work with ready-to-use datasets, so I’ve never had to think about creating datasets from scratch.We’re a 60-person company, with only 5 in tech, working in the accounting industry. We have four main applications, each with its own transactional Postgres database:- Backend: Serves a hybrid mobile/web app for customers and a back-office application for employees. It handles resources for customer enterprises and our in-house CRM.- Tasks: An internal task and process orchestration app (using Camunda).- CMS: A content system for website campaigns, offers, landing pages, etc.- Docs: An internal Wiki with markdown files documenting processes, laws, rules, etc.The databases are relatively small for now: Backend has 120 tables, Tasks has 50, and most tables have around 500k rows from 4 years of operation. We’ve plugged all of them into Metabase for BI reporting. We have some TVs around the office with real-time dashboards refreshing every 30s (for example for the sales team tracks daily goals and our fiscal team tracking new urgent due tasks). Employees also use detailed tables for their day-to-day needs, often filtering and exporting to Excel.We’ve hit some bumps in our performance and need advice on how to scale efficiently. Most BI reports go through a view in the Backend database that consolidates all customer data, which contains many joins (20+) and CTEs. This setup works well enough for now, but I’m starting to worry as we scale. On top of that, we have some needs to keep track tasks in our Camunda system that are late but only for delinquent customers, so I have to join the data from our Backend database. I've tried Trino/Presto for that but it had a really bad performance and now we are using a Postgres Foreign Data Wrapper and its working well so far... Joining data from our Camunda system with the Backend database to track late tasks, the query performance takes a big hit since it's going through the same consolidated view (it was either that or repeat the same joins over and over again). To address this, we’ve decided it’s time to create a Data Warehouse to offload these heavy queries from the databases. We’re using read replicas, indexes, etc., but I want to create a robust structure for us to grow.Additionally, we’re planning to integrate data from other sources like Google Analytics, Google Ads, Meta Ads, partner APIs (e.g., WhatsApp vendor), and PDF content (tax guides, fiscal documents, bank reports, etc.). We’d like to use this data for building ML models and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), etc.We’ve also been exploring the idea of a Data Lake to handle the raw, unstructured data. I’m leaning toward a medallion architecture (Bronze-Silver-Gold layers) and pushing the \"Gold\" datasets into an OLAP database for BI consumption. The goal would be to also create ML-ready datasets in Parquet format.Cost is a big factor for us. Our current AWS bill is under USD 1K/month, which covers virtual machines, databases, cloud containers, etc. We’re open to exploring other cloud providers and potentially multi-cloud solutions, but cost-effectiveness is key.I’m studying a lot about this but am unsure of the best path forward, both in terms of architecture and systems to use. Has anyone dealt with a similar scenario, especially on a budget? Should we focus on building a Data Warehouse first, or would implementing a Data Lake be more beneficial for our use case? What tools or systems would you recommend for building a scalable, cost-efficient data pipeline? Any other advice or best practices for someone with an academic background but limited hands-on experience in data engineering?Thanks in advance for any tip",

Data residency / regional rules in practice**If you’re **outside** the region where the data “should” live (e.g. you’re in the US/UK, data is “EU-only”): what’s the real process?* You still query it directly (VPN/bastion/etc.)* Someone *in-region* runs queries / exports for you* You rely on pre-built tooling / dashboards and never see raw rows Are there any “unofficial” workflows (Slack messages like “hey can you run this query for me from EU?”)?**5. Guardrails & horror stories*** Do you have masking / RLS / separate views specifically for debugging?* Any guardrails like time-limited accounts, strict audit logs, approvals, etc.?* Have you seen any near-misses or incidents related to prod access (accidental UPDATE without WHERE, GDPR concerns, etc.)?**6.

I needed:\\- handles \"real-world\" CSV including edge cases such as double-quotes in the middle of values with no surrounding quotes, embedded newlines, different types of newlines, data rows that might have a different number of columns from the first row, multi-row headers etc\\- fast and memory efficient. None of the python CSV packages performed remotely close to what I needed. Certain C based ones such \\`mlr\\` were also orders of magnitude too slow. xsv was in the right ballpark\\- compiles for any target OS and for web assembly\\- compiles to library API that can be easily integrated with any programming languageAt that time, SIMD was just becoming available on every chip so a friend and I tried dozens of approaches to leveraging that technology while still meeting the above goals. The result is the zsv parser which is faster than any other parser we've tested (even xsv).With parser built, I added other parser nice-to-haves such as both a pull and a push API, and then added a CLI. Most of the CLI commands are run-of-the-mill stuff: echo, select, count, sql, pretty, 2tsv, stack.Some of the commands are harder to find in other utilities: compare (cell-level comparison with customizable numerical tolerance-- useful when, for example, comparing CSV vs data from a deconstructed XLSX, where the latter may look the same but technically differ by < 0.000001), serialize/flatten, 2json (multiple different JSON schema output choices). A few are not directly CSV-related, but dovetail with others, such as 2db, which converts 2json output to sqlite3 with indexing options, allowing you to run e.g. \\`zsv 2json my.csv --unique-index mycolumn | zsv 2db -t mytable -o my.db\\`.I've been using zsv for years now in commercial software running bare metal and also in the browser (for a simple in-browser example, see [https://liquidaty.github.io/zsv/](https://liquidaty.github.io/zsv/)), and we've just tagged our first release.Hope you find some use out of it-- if so, give it a star, and feel free to post any questions / comments / suggestions to a new issue.[https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv](https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv)",

Crucially, the final hiring decision is contingent upon the career path I choose to pursue within the company, based on my current responsibilities.Team Structure and ResponsibilitiesOur current technical data team consists of three individuals: the CDO, myself, and a colleague focused on dashboarding and visualization, who will soon be transitioning to another sector within the organization.For the past four months, I have been solely responsible for the conception and implementation of our data infrastructure architecture, including the deployment of all initial ETL pipelines. A substantial amount of work remains, with numerous ETL pipelines still needing to be developed. If I choose to handle this volume of work entirely on my own and maintain my current pace, there is a risk of significant burnout.To elevate my expertise and ensure I am making robust technical decisions, I plan to obtain the GCP Data Engineer Certification in the coming months.I am proficient in programming, system integration, problem-solving, and I am growing confident in pipeline implementation. However, I occasionally question this confidence, wondering if it stems from the repetitive nature of the process or the current absence of a direct manager to provide supervision and critical technical oversight.I was quite concerned when the CDO asked me to define the role I should assume starting next month, given the upcoming senior hire. * Should I assume the leadership risk and position myself to manage the new senior hire (e.g., as a Team Lead or BI Manager)? * Should I explore an alternative career trajectory, such as transitioning toward a Data Scientist role? * What critical internal questions should I ask myself to ensure I make the most informed decision about my future path?*Should I ask for a salary update? of how much? 15%?I think they see me with leadership potential but I definitely think that I need to improve as a DE to have more confidence in myself.

I soon realized how unrealistic the implementation of it was, especially if you have multiple collections with millions of records each. That's when I started the journey of learning how databases are implemented.After a few weeks of research and coding, I've completed the first version of my file-based database. This version is append-only, using LSN to insert, update, delete, and locate records. It also uses a B+ Tree for collection entries, allowing for fast ID:LSN lookup. When the B+ Tree reaches its max size (I've set it to 1500 entries), the tree will be encoded (using my custom encoder) and atomically written to disk before an empty tree takes the old one's place in-memory.I'm sure I'm there are things that I'm doing wrong, as this is my first time researching how databases work and are optimized. So, I'd like feedback on the code or even the concept of this library itself.Just wanna state that this wasn't vibe-coded at all. I don't know whether it's my pride or the fear that AI will stunt my growth, but I make a point to write my code myself. I did bounce ideas off of it, though. So there's bound to be some mistakes made while I tried to implement some of them.",

How do I deal best with this type of data as a data engineer? Putting data into a quarantine time agreed upon with the owner of the data source, and only publishing it after? If data changes significantly, models need to be re-run, which can be very time consuming.For data exploration, the time series + location data are displayed in a hydrological application, while a basic interface would probably suffice. We'd need a simple interface to display all of these time series (also deducted ones, in total maybe 5k), point locations and polygons, and connect them together. What applications would you recommend? With preference managed applications, and otherwise simple frameworks with little maintenance. Maybe Dash + TimescaleDB / PostGIS?What other theory could be valuable to me in this job and where can I find it?",

Two days ago I've got an advise to use databricks, the free edition, I started learning it. Now I need some help from more experienced people.My question is: If we take the hypothetical case in which I deployed the prefect pipeline and I modified the load task to databricks how can I integrate the pipeline in to databricks:1. Is there a tool or an extension that glues these two components2. Or should I copy paste the prefect python code into 3. Or should I create the pipeline from scratch",

We all know that the advantage of Parquet is that a parquet file stores data in columns, so each column can be decompressed individually and that makes for very fast and efficient access.OK, but Kafka doesn't care about that. As far as I know, if you send a Parquet file through Kafka, you cannot modify anything in that file before it is deserialized. So you cannot do column pruning or small reads. You essentially lose every single benefit of Parquet.So why do these articles and guides insist about using Parquet with Kafka?",

Goal - Build a dashboard in Power BI Background - Client has a retail business and has 25 branches in the country. Each branch uses a POS and we get three files for each branch. Invoice, Invoice Line and Invoice Customer. Initially client was sending excel files with three tabs in it. May be because their Intern or Junior was working on creating these files the files were very erroneous. We had a meeting discussed a few solutions and decided that the client will upload sales data files to the FTP server. Current Process - • Download files from FTP to Local folder named Raw. • Use Python script to add two new columns - Branch Name and Branch Code. • We achieve this by including a dictionary in python code that adds these columns based on file names. For example - file name 045_inv.csv then Manhattan since code for Manhattan is 045. We repeat this for invoice line and invoice customer. • Save these to a new local folder - Processed • Use Python script to read files from Processed load them to PGSql db containing three tables - invoice, invoice_line, invoice_customer• Three python scripts for three tablesMy Request - 1) How can I make this process smoother and more seamless? 2) What is the best way to automate this? 3) what checks can I perform to ensure that data health and accuracy is maintained",

Over the years, one truth keeps proving itself:**Programming isn't about code. It's about clarity.** Early in my career, I thought skill meant knowing everything: frameworks, syntax quirks, cloud configs, you name it. But the developers who actually made things happen weren't the ones who typed fast or memorized docs. They were the ones who could think clearly about problems. When you learn to:* Define the problem before touching the keyboard* Explain your code out loud and make it sound simple* Name things precisely* Question assumptions instead of patching symptoms...you start writing code that lasts, scales, and earns trust. If you're early in your journey, here's my best advice:* Don't chase tools, chase understanding.* Don't fear being wrong, fear not learning from it.* Don't copy patterns blindly, know why they exist.Everything else.. frameworks, AI tooling, languages will follow naturally. *What's something you've learned the hard way that changed how you code?*",

The way I understand it is that they are both based on C and have similar syntax, but C# seems very focused on Microsoft and Windows. C++ seems very very complicated for a beginner however, but I suppose that if I never try it, I'll never do it. I just want to play around, maybe do some little projects and possibly game dev (C# seems like the best language to learn for that?)What do you all think? Thanks!",

Ill make it again. For the rest, I want to thank specially @Reasonable_Run_5529 and @1lann for their support and helping me find solutions and understand the situation, and also to all of you who answered with helpful comments. Media lib is store in a cloud service now and will improve my backup process as well as my non-using-ai-code-without-reading-system (was 3AM in my defence...) :)Hey everyone,I’m completely desperate right now so I hope someone here can tell me if there’s still hope.I had a full Next.js portfolio website on my Mac (macOS, APFS). Everything was pushed to GitHub. The repo had all my source code, the app folder, components, images, everything. But I was having issues with huge file sizes, so I started cleaning the .next folder.Chati told me to use:npx git-filter-repo --path .next --invert-paths --forceThis completely rewrote the repository history, deleted the remote origin, and left only a tiny repo with ~20 objects. When I pushed again, GitHub got overwritten and now shows only a minimal repo with a single package.json. All my commits and file history on GitHub are gone.Worse:During the cleanup, I somehow deleted the actual project folder on my machine too. The folder exists, but it only contains:•.git•.history•package.json•node_modulesAll my source files, images, pages, components, routes — literally everything — are gone.GitHub has no old commits.git fsck shows nothing recoverable.APFS snapshots don’t seem to contain user workspace files.VSCode backups folder is empty.No Time Machine.As a last resort, I ran PhotoRec on the disk. It recovered 130,000 files from the drive, but most are random binary or gibberish. I filtered them down to ~3,000 possible code/text/json files and ~138 files that mention React/Next/framer-motion, but most seem corrupted or system files.At this point I genuinely don’t know if:1.The source files still exist somewhere on disk2.The APFS filesystem keeps deleted user folders in snapshots3.GitHub has any way to restore overwritten commits4.PhotoRec recovery of .ts/.tsx/.js files is even realistic5.I should keep searching through the recovered mess or accept they’re goneIs there ANY way to restore an overwritten GitHub repository, or recover deleted APFS files like a Next.js project?Or am I basically screwed unless I rewrite the entire thing manually?Thanks for your help",

And some concepts just don't click in my mind.like, if learning a concept was like pattern-recognition and pattern-internalisation through memorisation and repetition, then that would be a life-saver, but from reading stuff online, I presume it's more like the solving of abstract problems through some sorta inherent reasoning.Now, I don't wanna get into software engineering, I wanna get into cybersec, and hopefully become a pentester one day.

Everything just keeps coming at me from all directions, I've had multiple breakdowns this week, I feel like a sore loser, and I don't know what to do. I only recently added the CS component of my degree (I study at a top school for CS/AI), now I'm surrounded by all these people around me who's insanely cracked and lives like a robot, sleeps 4 hours a day, who had years of advantage ahead of me.I love the tech field, I would love to work here, but I am so lost. I am really behind on school, busy networking here and there, trying to grasp the basics of coding, working on projects, all while taking the hardest courses offered at my uni (pure math, statistics proofs, etc). I got myself a mentor, she has worked at almost all of the FAANG companies, Palantir, interviewing for Citadel, HRT, Google, OpenAI, etc, and she has insanely high expectations on me. She asked me to leetcode with her, and when I told her I am very busy (I didn't do well this mid term szn, I need to lock in for finals, I even pulled 4 all nighters this week and I'm still behind in my courses), she was very disappointed in me and basically said goodbye? I had a 4.0 gpa first year, but because of all these external pressures, I haven't been doing as well. All the men in my classes think I'm stupid too (I'm a girl). I also signed an offer for a data analyst role at a major bank, and no one even congratulated me, I'm guessing even a role like DA is a useless job to break into the tech industry?I hate feeling like a disappointment, and it doesn't help that I'm being rejected left and right for all tech roles including Career prep programs (which aren't even a real job btw), I don't know what I can do at this point to catch up to everyone. My friends are out there implementing the most complicated code / models that I can't even understand at all, coding in a million different languages, and I can only ace academically. I feel like there is no space in the tech industry for late entries like me, and mind you, I started coding at 18, and I just turned 19 last week.I don't know if it's just imposter syndrome, or if there genuinely no space for people like me in this field. I see myself working in cool tech jobs in the future, perhaps research, cutting edge technology, but I'm really scared and skeptical of myself right now.Would love some advice or stories of people who's experienced/experiencing the same things. What can I do to catch up or just get my shit together. I hate feeling like such a burden and disappointment. Thank you :')Edit: also, I grew up as an athlete and a social butterfly, I was working out everyday and running marathons, a gazillion hobbies, piano performances, all that fun stuff, until I switched into this field the previous summer, then I basically got depressed and constantly feel like I need to prioritize work. My life is just messed up atp, I haven't even exercised in 2 months...",

I’ve realized that what we learn from textbooks and what’s used in real-world programming are totally different things.I’ve thought about switching to another language, but I still believe that C is the foundation of programming. Python feels simpler, but sometimes harder to fully understand.I know it might be a bit surprising to see a Korean student pop up here, but I wanted to ask this question in a big, experienced community like this one.I’ve read some posts here, and many people seem super knowledgeable and kind.

This is my pragmatic breakdown of monads in practice.In essence there are two distinct topics that concern monads:* Purity* Chaining of operations / compositionKey points i have gathered so far, correct me please:* Monads wrap around other \"things\"* The \"thing\" the monad wraps around can be operated on within the monad * This operation can also be a \"chain of operations\", monads can do many things internally while appearing to be \"one abstract step\" on the outside* Monads that \"do something\" (= arent simply context), like IO, are \"lazy\". They are representation for computations that are yet to run (unrelated to lazy vs strict languages)* The \"result\" of the monad can be retrieved/calculated and we call that retrieval \"unwrapping\"* Making, baking, and eating the monad are pure operations, from an outside perspective, while the inside of the monad *could* practically do whatever impure nonsense it wants * They always are 100% pure \"representations of 1) a value within a context or 2) an operation that produces a value\" * Some have impure operations. For example doing I/O * The impure operation is abstracted away (into oblivion) so the process that \"runs\" the monad does not have to and cannot care about the purity implications of the operation, it simply cares about \"in -> out\"If all above points are correctly describing them, monads are not \"that difficult to understand\", so I have to have missed something, right?I guess the biggest hurdle towards understanding monads stems from them coming in many different flavors... Maybe *seems different* from IO when looking from the side, But looking each of them straight in the face they both \"let you get a value, no matter what they have to do to get that value\".",

        "content": "I run into this situation a lot when programming full-stack apps. Paricularly, with my most recent project.I am making a Chrome extension, and without getting into details, it has a Flask backend that the app needs to request in order to work, because the library it uses is not available in JavaScript land.Naturally, when I found out that you have to deploy the backend in order to use it in production, I was hesitant, because if it's just going to be on the web, anyone can take the URL and request it even from outside the extension. I don't have anything expensive going on now, but if I did, that would not be good at all. I can't imagine tech companies deploying backends that way. So, what can I do?Ideally, I would only allow the backend to be requested from inside the app itself, not as a separate thing, but I haven't heard of a way to do that.I suppose what I'm getting at is: if your project has some API on the backend that you want to protect, what can you do about it? Is it even worth doing? How do companies do it?",

What should I be learning and what should I understand by now? What should I be building? API? ML? Networking? Concurrent programming? Another Language? ........Also second year means I have taken classes like C++ ,Java, Data Structures, meaning its not enought knowledge for me to do want i wanan do.

It was definitely aimed at girls and had something explaining that in the title like \"she codes\" or \"her code\" but I can't remember. There may have also been lessons related to famous women such as Ada Lovelace. Some of the games were the classic \"use the arrow buttons to queue the robot's movement\" and teaching kids about loops etc.I'm asking around because I remember it being such a fantastic resource when I was younger and would love to know if it was still around.Thanks for any help anyone can give!",

I could really use some advise on where and how to start studying in general. I'm still researching what would be of best interest for me but what i may find here could help me more so please anything may be of assistance to me.I have my mind set on Software Engineering or Software Development, anything coding and program developing related. My concern is I had Bio, CAT, EGD and Math Literature in school and I fear what I want to study I should have something Science related with Math. Is there a way to work around this? Maybe a Foundation course? If so which would be best? I also don't want to limit my options to universities or colleges in South Africa (Cape Town specifically) I would like to expand it to the US and try to get a job there with my degree or something in that line but i would have to do it as an international student. I absolutely have to add that I will be doing this ALONE so financial advise and help would also be needed for either International student or here in South Africa. I'm specifically talking about available sponsorships, costs or any type of financial help.So to conclude:Where should I start?What are my options?What financial help could I get?",

Just copying the code and seeing it work does not satisfy me, and I want to genuinely *learn* as much as I can.So how do I go about having this code taught to me? I can't ask the teacher as it is not a live course I am taking. Do I peruse the internet and Github and find people who have already explained similar functions? Or do I ask AI to explain the code line by line function by function? Do I find a better course?

I'm incredibly interested in learning how to code, and would like to know your opinion on which entry point is more accessible according to the projects I would like to work on and the languages that (I read) are linked to each of them(In order of priority)1. Just knowing what the hell is going in my computer and being able to comfortably use terminal (zsh?) (I couldn’t even install Puppeteer properly lol). I imagine the language also may depend on the process being run? Honestly i don’t know. This is the only thing in the list I cannot think of a specific project for.2. Coding for after effects; I’m interested in automating “randomized” movement for grid photo collages with very specific parameters which I’d love to modify as the video goes on.3. Making a website for my portfolio (I work with audiovisual media) in such a way I feel I have control over it (I used Cargo but, because I don’t understand the HTML and barely get the CSS, I’m not getting the best out of it). I’d like it to be as interactive as possible!4. Making a repository style wiki to post online (Tried and failed with mediawiki, that uses PHP(?)) and compile essays, bibliography, etc. Think monoskop but way smaller and very very open to publish its community’s work.5. Using touchdesigner’s code (JS) to creatively alter and enhace live visuals (I know the gist of the software by now, but knowing how to use it with code will give me much more control over it!)6. Making tiny games in godot (C++), I just want to make a one level platformer as a gift to a friend who loves platformers. And the tiniest visual novel for a friend who loves those but ik I could use ren’py for that, which would be a separate thing+language (I read Python can be used for renpy as well as its DSL).I know there is no “right” or “easiest” way to approach coding as a beginner, and that no language is better than the other, I’m just mostly wondering which of these projects specifically appears to be feasible in the shortest amount of time or least amount of steps/smaller learning curve, if that’s even something that can be answered.Is these are way too ambitious, I would start off by the closest project that is actually accesible for a beginner and work my way to one of these.Take all this in the context that I don’t even know what the simplest coding terms mean lol. Also! I don't intend to use AI to do this, because I like the challenge of figuring things out, so it's not something I'm factoring in to consider how \"easy\" something would be.I have read about this and checked out this subreddit's linked posts, but I love hearing from people one on one. Also, as I’m truly a newbie, I apologize for any uneducated approach or obvious mistakes I made!",

Basically now, when I program:I look at a problem or an exercise or something I can't do. * I break it down into chunks of what I need to do. * Bash my head too solve each chunk, looking up stuff OR using AI too explain what I need and why for chunks I just have no idea what do do. So for example, when I needed to make a basic Farenheit too Celsius Java Program. * I broke it down too reading user input, formula, and output answer. * So I looked up the Java MOOC course on how too program user input, use something called scanner. And asked AI for the formula for Farenheit too Celsius. F -32 times 5/9, with \\* and decimal points in Java. Okay. And I know System.out.println. But wait, program is still not outputting. I ask AI to explain the issue. Turns out, I declared a variable wrong. Then, I try too improve it. I ask AI what I can do too make the program better. They suggest how to do While Loops. Okay, I ask for an example and look that up in Java MOOC and try too implement it. I've been doing it on my Lab exercises, and I find I retain more information this way. Is this an effective method of programming? or am I better off just going full no AI?",

I would like to understand how to improve my position, both in terms of skills and job opportunities.At the moment I work mainly with Angular, but I also have some experience with React. Lately I've been very passionate about the mobile world, more out of personal curiosity than a strategic choice. However, I am open to any advice on how to broaden my skills and improve my professional profile, even in other sectors.My main objectives are:1. ⁠Increase my skills to propose myself to companies with a higher RAL.2. ⁠Gain experience abroad, perhaps in the USA or in any case in an international context.What would you advise me for 2025/26? Is it better to focus on mobile (native or cross-platform) or invest in other technologies that are more in demand internationally? And, in general, what steps would you suggest to make me more competitive on the market?Thanks to anyone who wants to share an opinion or their experience!",

        "content": "As I observe the rise of tools like Interview Coder, I find myself questioning the very concept of \"merit\" in the tech industry. When an AI can assist you during a live coding interview by providing support with logic, syntax, and hints, can we truly claim we are testing merit, or are we merely assessing access to the right tools? Let’s face it: tech interviews have never been solely about skill. They have always been a complex mix of several factors:* How well you can recall patterns you studied the previous week,,* How fortunate you are with the problem set you receive, and,* How composed you can remain while someone observes your screen.,Now, with the introduction of AI tools, the fragility of this entire system is being exposed. If someone using Interview Coder performs like a top 1% developer, should we consider that \"cheating,\" or does it suggest that our interview process was never as robust as we thought? Perhaps the definition of merit is evolving from “I can solve this alone” to “I know how to use tools effectively.”",

I could really use some advice on how to dig myself out of this hole.What I Built (The Good part): · Tech Stack: React Native, TypeScript, React Native Reanimated · The Look: A custom iOS 26 \"Liquid Glass\" inspired UI. · The Feel: Buttery 60fps animations, a type-safe codebase with zero errors, and optimized transitions. · Status: The entire frontend is basically done. It's a high-fidelity prototype. I can even show you a screen recording of how smooth it is.Where I Failed (The ugly part ):· The Mistake: I started coding with ZERO backend design or data model. I just started putting stuff in Firestore as I went along. · The Stack: Firebase Auth & Firestore. · The Problem: My database structure is a complete mess. It's not scalable, the relationships between users, universities, professors, and reviews are tangled, and I'm now terrified to write more queries because nothing makes sense anymore. I basically built a beautiful sports car with a lawnmower engine.What I’m blabbing about is:1.⁠How do I approach untangling this? Do I just nuke the entire Firestore database and start over with a clean plan?2.⁠What are the key questions I should be asking myself when designing the data structure for an app like this?3.⁠Are there any good resources (articles, videos) on designing Firestore structures for complex relational data?4.⁠If you were to sketch a basic data model for this, what would the top-level collections be and how would they relate?Infact what should be my best approach to transitioning to backend then to a Fullstack Developer? I learned a ton about frontend development, but this was my brutal lesson in the importance of full-stack planning. Any guidance you can throw my way would be a lifesaver.Thanks for reading.",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I’m a first-year Electrical Engineering student and recently completed CS50x. I ended up really liking C and want to stick with it for a while instead of jumping to another language.While building small CLI programs, I noticed that making the output look neat takes a lot of repetitive work, especially when dealing with colors, cursor movement, or updating parts of the screen. Most solutions I found either involve writing the same escape sequences repeatedly or using heavier libraries that are platform-dependent.So I’m considering making a lightweight, header-only helper library to simplify basic CLI aesthetics and reduce the boilerplate.My question is: Is this idea actually feasible for a beginner to build?And if yes, what should I learn or focus on to make it happen?Would appreciate any honest feedback—just want to know if I’m headed in the right direction or being unrealistic.

Advanced programming appeals to me because I like deeper problem solving and backend logic.I’m torn because:* The Web Dev diploma seems like the fastest path to land a junior dev role and start gaining experience.* The Advanced Programming diploma seems more “deep engineering” focused and probably better for long-term backend / software roles.For devs working professionally today — which route actually translates better into real employability + upward salary mobility faster?

So don’t bogged down by the hype.[Twitter post](https://xcancel.com/AndrewYNg/status/1989003741316673714)[Blog post](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-327/)Highlighting the most relevant bits:> Andrew Ng @AndrewYNg > I recently received an email titled “An 18-year-old’s dilemma: Too late to contribute to AI?” Its author, who gave me permission to share this, is preparing for college. He is worried that by the time he graduates, AI will be so good there’s no meaningful work left for him to do to contribute to humanity, and he will just live on Universal Basic Income (UBI). I wrote back to reassure him that there will still be plenty of work he can do for decades hence, and encouraged him to work hard and learn to build with AI. But this conversation struck me as an example of how harmful hype about AI is.> […]> Even though LLMs can handle a much more general set of tasks than previous iterations of AI technology, compared to what humans can do, they are still highly specialized. They’re much better at working with text than other modalities, still require lots of custom engineering to get it the right context for a particular application, and we have few tools — and only inefficient ones — for getting our systems to learn from feedback and repeated exposure to a specific task (such as screening resumés for a particular role).> […]> AI has stark limitations, and despite rapid improvements, it will remain limited compared to humans for a long time.> […]> Modern AI is a general purpose technology that is enabling many applications, but AI that can do any intellectual tasks that a human can (a popular definition for AGI) is still decades away or longer. This nuanced message that AI is general, but not that general, often is lost in the noise of today's media environment.> […]> Similarly, the progress of frontier models is amazing! But not so amazing that they’ll be able to do everything under the sun without a lot of customization. I know VC investors who are scared to invest in application-layer startups because they are worried that frontier AI model companies will quickly wipe out all of these businesses by improving their models. While some thin wrappers around LLMs no doubt will be replaced, there also remains a huge set of valuable applications that the current trajectory of progress of frontier models won’t displace for a long time.",

I'm a dual citizen. Having looked at the job postings in my other country (small country in the Balkans) I've noticed that there are tons of positions for senior software engineers. These are jobs from American companies. I have heard even seniors mentioning that it's harder to get a job. Well no shit that's the case if even senior roles are being outsourced. Not only that, every story I've heard so far of a senior switching jobs ended up with many downsides. Going back to office, pay cut, even shittier work conditions. I'm trying to think about the end goal here. No manufacturing jobs. No IT jobs. Where the hell is the legislation to save the U.S. from collapsing because I don't see any way that it can continue in this trajectory without mass upheaval. Not everybody can be a doctor. Not everybody can be a plumber, especially with how fragile most human bodies are. Not everyone can open a restaurant (which you see tons of them failing and closing down). Not everyone can sell crap. In fact if everyone is selling crap.Is it normal to feel this disgruntled and worried? Based on the legislation that allowed this (coming from both sides of the political spectrum) it seems like a deliberate attempt to sink the U.S.",

        "author": "JagoffAndOnAgain",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "**tl;dr** 1. Paid an expert to redo my resume, and 2. Ignored LinkedIn/Indeed completely. Bookmarked and applied directly through company Careers/Jobs pages for brand new positions only.---In 2023, I was laid off from a full stack job I loved and was at for 9 years. The severance package provided some \"career coaching and resume assistance\" via Randstad. So I used them to redo my resume which I had always done entirely myself with no external help, including AI. I thought it was a lot better.I was wrong. Throughout the next 6 months in the spring and summer of 2023, I applied to 171 jobs (with 13 YoE at the time). I heard back from 12 (7%), was ghosted by 5 of those and rejected by 4 more. When I accepted my contract position, I ended two other interviews.Cut to this summer 2025. I was thankful for the contract position but wasn't particularly interested in the domain. Also, I got cabin fever working remotely. My new apartment's home office is a lot sadder than the old one. I need to get out of the house and see the sun which I don't do when WFH. I totally understand why most people love WFH- I did it for years. It's just not great for me personally long term. For all this reasons, I began hunting despite the doom and gloom around the current job market.For a few months, I stuck to my old habits. I added my current position to my resume but kept it basically the same as before. I applied to LinkedIn posts along with hundreds of other people. And I was back to my 2023 numbers. In fact, it was worse. I was only hearing back 5% of the time (which this time was only one job) and they ghosted me after one interview. Fuckers.---**1.** I realized I needed a change. I had a gut feeling my resume wasn't great. It wasn't getting me the first look. I'm a software engineer, not a resume expert. These are two entirely different skillsets. A younger me scoffed at the idea of resume writing being valuable: \"I write great code on cool systems, that should be easy enough for anyone to glean from my resume!\" Idiot. I searched \"software engineer resume coach\" and found one with great TrustPilot reviews. I spent $300 for someone to take my old resume, ask me clarifications, and return a brand new resume back to me about a week later.I cannot tell you how much of an upgrade the second resume is. The first one looks like dogshit by comparison. My old resume was a massive wall of text combining some tech keywords with the resume guidance of the late 2000's (my college era when I learned to write a resume). This new version had largely the same information, but it was presented in a much more impressive way. I was impressed by my own resume. It also surprisingly gave me a new sense of confidence going into interviews. It had way more metrics and quantitive points than I had on there.My callback rate when from 5% to 25%. Post-resume glow up, I applied to 12 positions and heard back from 3. Pretty stunning turnaround.But an improved resume wasn't the only thing I changed in this round of job hunting. I changed my application tactics.---**2.** In 2023 and part of my 2025 hunt, I spent a lot of time on LinkedIn applying to jobs according to filters and advanced searches. This just never felt particularly useful. You're adding another layer of software between your resume and a human being's eyes. Also, I just hate LinkedIn. People are so strange and phony on there. So I abandoned it.Instead, I started searching for lists of companies based in my city. I would then bookmark their Careers or Jobs pages in a folder in my browser. By the end of my hunt, I bookmarked about 55 pages. And a few times per week, I would spent about half an hour looking at every single one.I was looking for jobs posted within the last 48 hours but ideally that day. If a day was posted longer than 3 days ago, I considered it a dead end. You want to be in the first 50 in a stack of resumes.Job posting aggregators are a wasteland. I think these days HR looks at the stack of applications in their domain first, then looks to LinkedIn and Indeed if they see nothing promising.---With these two tactics, I interviewed with a few places, narrowed it down to two, and chose the one I was most excited about. It's been off to a good start so far.Anyways, that is my advice from my past few years of job hunting in the frustrating market/economy/country/existence. Good luck!When I posted this to r/experienceddevs I got accused of being an ad almost instantly, so FYI I will not be recommending the resume service I used. Just search around and I'm sure you'll find someone capable. This is merely advice for what seemed to work for me.",

I tell my manager about the bugs and what my approach is to fix it, but he said he doesn't know the logic either as he has workload of his own (and to just speak with other colleagues) and probably just gave me this \"simple\" task which i can't even resolve.

Most companies that were listed on stock exchanges 100 years ago are *gone*. Many tech stocks today have high P/E ratios and other indicators that suggest they are overvalued. If the AI bubble bursts, it is highly likely that your company's stock will take a hit, regardless of how you perceive their level of exposure to that area.Imagine having a large percentage of your net worth tied up in one stock you picked. This is what you have, effectively. I'm not going to give people here a full rundown on basic investing, but a diversified portfolio is always a strong choice. Speak with an investment professional.

I was laid off ~1.5 months ago from my previous firm and worked with a specialized headhunter who focuses on placing prop trading SW and FPGA engineers. I didn't personally submit any applications—everything was handled by my HH. We applied to eight firms/quant funds in a targeted fashion. My HH's relationship with certain firms allowed me to bypass a few bureaucratic HR stages and get in front of hiring managers immediately.This was my first time on the market as a Senior and my interview experience mostly aligned with how I chose to prepare. The mix of questions I encountered was roughly 9:1 domain-specific C++ to LeetCode-style DSA. There were a bunch of questions on deep C++ features, trading-specific minutiae (exchange protocols, executing a low latency strategy on a particular exchange), lock-free algo knowledge, etc. Ironically, the rounds that tripped me up the most _were_ LeetCode-style questions, so I regret not doing more than the 10-15 questions I practiced but overall my preparation was accurate.I withdrew from the interview process at three firms since I received a solid offer from a firm I liked (on a desk/team I liked as well). I anticipate I would've gotten another 1-2 offers had I seen those through to the end but I was satisfied.* Timeline from start of search to offer: 1 month* TC: ~$500K* Location: Chicago* Preparation: 10-15 LeetCode questions and implementing dozens of lock-free/high-performance data structures in C++. Reading a few intermediate to advanced C++ books to refresh (think Nicolai Josuttis, et al.). Playing around with some language features in the newer standards (C++23/26).",

I think I need a reality check, especially from those who have worked in this field for a number of years.**TL;DR:** Top-tier education (CS PhD). Landed a quant developer job at a fund in a low-tax / no-tax region. Pay is relatively good (\\~$185k tax-free money). Job was a \"bait-and-switch\", which went from building cool new tech to endless data-munging. I'm miserable and have lost passion for coding.**My Background:*** **Education:** PhD in CS (Systems and Networking) from a top Asian university. BSc from another top Asian university.* **Current Role:** 1 year as a quant developer at a financial firm (think HFT or fund) in a major hub with very low / no taxes.**The \"Golden Handcuffs\":*** **Salary:** In the $180-190k USD range, tax-free.* **Perks:** Good vacation and remote policy.**The \"Bait-and-Switch\" Problem:*** The first 6 months was great. I was tasked with a challenging R&D project using a modern tech stack (Rust), which I had to learn on the fly. It was exactly what I wanted.* Afterwards, that project was suddenly and quietly de-prioritized. My manager reassigned me to what is effectively a data integration role. My entire job now is just endless, repetitive grunt work, fighting with terrible data formats from vendors and doing basic ETL.* To make it worse, the senior devs on the team have all managed to get themselves onto new, interesting projects, leaving me and other juniors to handle this \"data plumbing.\" Management is vague when I raise concerns. Changing teams isn't an option either.I feel that my passion for coding is gone, extinguished by this job. I feel miserable and am experiencing burnout symptoms. I have zero energy or interest in side projects or open source (which I was quite keen on before).**My Questions:**1. Is this loss of passion just a temporary reaction to this specific job? Or is it a sign I'll just end up in another \"boredom -> misery\" cycle if I change jobs?2. Am I just being an entitled or lazy person who \"hates all work\"? The relatively decent salary makes me feel incredibly guilty for complaining.3. What's a viable path? Other quant firms, tech companies, crypto, or simply stop complaining and keep cleaning data?I feel like my career is stalling and I'm wasting my life. Any advice would be appreciated.",

Any newly invented tool/process is assumed to be a must-have, no matter how shitty or irrelevant it is, then puts it in the requirement.3.

Then even asking for a certificate or even degree.5. \"N many years of experience\" is a must. So if the requirement is 6 years but you only have 5.75 years, then auto-disqualified.6. Asks for corporate experience from fresh grads.7. Worse, ask for both extensive commercial as well as extensive academic experiences. Especially, in data science/ML. \"Cool, you simple baseline model bring X revenue? But did you also spend amount of time outside main work for reading academic paper about new algo ?...\" or \"Tell me the interesting academic paper you've read recently...\". While a lot of time simple baseline in production out-performs the complexity in the long run. Probably \"we need the complexity to sell our solution to be relevant...\"8. Even worse, for corp job, asking for academic publication; have no clue if the pub is high quality or notThis list is just at surface level. Don't even mention the mid process as well. Answers must be correct for some arbitrary standard. One wrong and you're out. Thinking too long or a bit hesitation for the answer = out.... on and on.

        "content": "I’m currently a junior SWE at LinkedIn in Bay Area(~1.5 years experience) and recently got an offer for an IC3 role at Robinhood. I’m conflicted on whether to take it.The team’s work isn’t super exciting product-wise, but the tech stack is modern and the career growth seems stronger than at LinkedIn. The work is also technically complex, which is appealing.My main hesitation is location — I’ve been in the Bay Area for ~1.5 years, but I really want to move to NYC, where most of my friends and family are. I can see my social life improving drastically there.Option A – Take the Robinhood offer- Location: Menlo Park (Bay Area) — I really wanted NYC- Pay: ~10% increase from LinkedIn- Equity: Better long-term upside than Microsoft/LinkedIn, but possible short-term downside- Career growth: Likely stronger (faster-paced team, more technical scope)- Mobility: Can’t change location while on the same team — I’d need an internal transfer to move to NYC- Promotion policy: Must stay at least 1 year in a role before being eligible (regardless of total experience)- So realistically, I’d be in the Bay for at least a year before I could transfer or get promoted (IC3 → IC4 after ~2.5 YOE)- Promotion timelines at LinkedIn are similar anywayOption B – Stay at LinkedIn- I could ask the recruiter to pause my Robinhood application and reopen it in January to see if any NYC teams open up (not guaranteed)- In the meantime, I’d stay at LinkedIn, though I’m feeling stagnant and unmotivated- LinkedIn has better WLB and is easy to coast at (though that may hurt long-term growth)- I could also interview for other NYC roles in early 2025, but the prep/interview grind is taxing and affects my current job performancePriorities (in order)1.Long-term career growth2.Being in NYC3.Compensation / equity4.Work-life balanceRobinhood would push my career forward technically, but I’d have to stay in Menlo Park for at least a year working on a product I’m only moderately excited about.Staying at LinkedIn feels stagnant, but gives me flexibility to pursue NYC roles sooner — though that path is uncertain.Would you:- Take the Robinhood offer as a growth move, stick it out in the Bay for a year, then try to transfer to NYC or pivot externally?or- Decline and wait to reapply in January for potential NYC roles (and keep searching in the meantime)",

        "content": "I’m 32, originally from Eastern Europe, and moved to the U.S. about ten years ago. I taught myself front-end development in 2017 while living off savings, and during that time I started using weed heavily to cope with stress. It turned into a long-term dependency. I’m not functional when high. My focus and code quality drop and that has definitely slowed my growth. I’ve also struggled with anxiety and burnout cycles along the way.My first job was rough: I was the only front-end dev, no mentorship, no code reviews, just figuring things out alone. Since then, I’ve mostly worked in digital agencies doing CMS-heavy work. I’ve stayed employed and I can ship features, but I feel like my foundational skills never solidified. **My code works, but the quality often isn’t good** it feels like I’m assembling things rather than understanding them at a deeper level (architecture, state management, patterns, testing, etc.).On top of that, **my career progression has been slow and has gaps field with very questionable freelance work.** Some people move from junior to senior/tech lead in 3–4 years. In my case, after \\~7–8 years, I’ve only just reached mid-level. I know why — lack of mentorship, inconsistent learning habits, mental health struggles, and the weed dependency but it still leaves me with the fear of becoming *stuck* or even **unemployable** if I don’t level up soon.I’m trying to cut down on weed, rebuild discipline, and take my growth seriously. But I’m overwhelmed and unsure how to structure the path.**I’d really appreciate advice on:**1. **How to improve code quality** when you didn’t develop good habits early on?2. **How to rebuild fundamentals mid-career** — patterns, architecture, testing — in a structured way?3. **How to break out of the “just making things work” mindset** and develop more intention in coding?4. **For anyone who has dealt with weed dependence / burnout:** what helped you actually regain clarity and momentum?5. **How to focus** when everything feels important and the learning path feels endless?Not looking for pity, just experiences from people who’ve been through similar and found a way to turn things around.Thanks to anyone who takes the time to reply.",

I tell my manager about the bugs and what my approach is to fix it, but he said he doesn't know the logic either as he has workload of his own and probably just gave me this \"simple\" task which i can't even resolve.

I actually thought in college that I'd go into software engineering, but I stumbled into DevOps instead. It sounds cool on paper, but in practice it's been thankless, unfocused work where I'm staring at YAML all day.So now I've started reading Clean Code, following along with teachyourselfcs, and brushing up on programming via online crash courses. I intend to start working on personal coding projects (maybe dusting some old ones off) and building up a portfolio. I'll start the Leetcode grind once I've got more of my ducks in a row.I have no professional software engineering experience, but I do have a Bachelor's in Computer Science from a decent university.My goal is to become hireable as a backend software engineer of whatever level it takes to get me in. Would my current trajectory be enough to even get me an interview? Is there anything else I could be doing?",

        "content": "For context, I'm 27m and I used to work as a team lead for high-level FE development (HTML/JS/CSS only work, basically). My role was basically Technical Project Manager (who sometimes writes code or makes websites) by the end of it, and I was hating it. I wanted to leave management and get back to development, so I self-taught Vue and React basics to the point of being able to pass an interview and learn on the job.About 9 months ago, I got a new job as a Vue developer. During the interview process, my now-boss said that she understood the level to which I understood Vue was below what they'd expect of an employee, but they were willing to train me.Perfect! That's exactly what I was looking for, especially since the money was a significant increase compared to what I was earning in my old role as a team lead, so I thought I'd struck gold. And for the first 6 months, it felt that way.Going from knowing Vue at a hobby/passing activity level to a professional level was a difficult climb, but I felt like I was still making progress each day.Lately, however, I have felt like a wasted paycheck and a burden to the team. My main mentor figure changed departments as experienced resource was needed elsewhere, and while I have people I can still reach out to for help, I just keep hitting block after block and feel over-reliant on them.We use Sentry for bug management, and I absolutely cannot stand it. I keep trying to investigate issues, get stuck, reach out to a colleague only for them to say \"Oh, that's likely due to xyz\" when \"xyz\" never even crossed my mind.It feels like I've been plateaued for months now, and I can't get past it. I asked my now-boss for help a while back, and she's given me the advice of \"When you encounter something you don't understand, research the technology.\" along with \"Create a simpler, working version of the part that's broken, then try and apply that logic.\"This advice is great...for simple issue that can be Googled or technology I understand the concepts of. If I see \"Axios error 123\" or \"Apollo error: this is what's wrong...\" then brilliant! I can read the documentation!But for more vague issues like \"This is our component that's nested in 13 other components, it's not working as intended, figure out why.\" I can SOMETIMES get to the bottom of it, but I have just kept hitting walls of bugs where someone who wrote the system is needed because they understand how it works (the company seems entirely averse to adding comments explaining their code).What I'm struggling with is I just don't know if I enjoy this anymore. A few months ago, I LOVED my job - I'd hit the gold mine and life was going great.Lately though...I have spoken to a therapist and three separate GPs who signed me off for the last two weeks due to \"Acute stress reaction\" (probably not allowed to go into detail on this sub). I'd done a lot of thinking and soul-searching over the last two weeks, hit today (my first day back) with a positive attitude, and yet within 4 hours I'd returned to my habit of crying at my desk.It doesn't help that I work from home, since I'm alone in my room all the time. We go to the office once a week, but I'm the only one from my department and actually works on this codebase who goes in, so I just end up working in a room full of people who are more intelligent and experienced than me, but have never looked at a single line of code that I'm responsible for working on.I just feel stuck. I want to love this job and this career, but the way this job has made me feel lately...it's not living.Has anyone else experienced this? Going from light FE work (HTML, JS, and CSS only) to Vue/React development, picking up the basics, and then just hitting a brick wall 9 months later?Does anyone have any advice?P.S. My therapist has recently advised she thinks I have ADHD, and that perfectionism and unreasonable standards for myself are some of my symptoms and trigger my mental overload/shutdown when I hit my fifth brick wall of the day. I wonder if that's relevant... /s",

I'm trying to find a remote role but that's pretty challenging now. Luckily I have enough savings to last a decade. Even if I don't get a remote role in the short term, I still want to keep my skills sharp and avoid having a big employment gap on my résumé.My plan is:* take care of family for a bit* work with a co-founder on an AI/ML startup using my existing skillset. It's something I've wanted to do for awhile.* build an MVP, deploy some ML-powered APIs, maybe onboard a some pilot usersIf later I want to return to full-time employment, is it acceptable to list my startup as real experience (e.g., *ML Engineer at \\[Startup Name\\]*) with bullet points describing the technical work I did?I wouldn’t exaggerate funding or success, but I would be doing real engineering, ML, and product work.Is this a normal thing to do in tech? Would recruiters see this as legitimate experience or as a red flag?Again, money is not a concern for me or my family. I'm also at a point where money don't mean as much to me compared to other things. I just need a good idea to not let the gap hurt me in a presumably tough job market 6 month or a year from now, if my startup don't take off.Thanks",

He said that he understood, but in the last year or so I keep getting shifted off projects and I am not able to acclimate myself to a single workflow.* Before this I was doing OS automated testing in Python with Pytest.* I was switched to a new team which does Python testing with Squish. So I was brought up to speed on that.* One of the other testers introduced a new way to run our automated tests through Jenkins. So I was brought up to speed on that and got a Jenkins pipeline we as testers could deploy from for verifying changes we did to our branches before merging to master. Eventually having to update existing tests because they were having issues running through Jenkins.* There was some drama from management and the testers on workflows. Not going into it, but it led to a lot of flip flopping between the old and new workflows.* The last PI there was a high priority project that needed assistance and I was told to assist for 6 weeks on manually running complex test scenarios that hadn't been automated yet.* I feel adrift, useless, and unproductive. I cannot focus and I am still trying to find ADHD techniques to focus but am having trouble finding one that works.I don't know what is happening, I was good at my job up until COVID and now I feel as though I am worse than when I was entry level. I have a massive headache and my brain feels like its trying to escape my skull because of the anxiety.Edit: I am getting medication.",

I was blessed to work with technologies like Kubernetes, AWS, Azure DevOps, Argo and opportunities to work on big projects. Then I got laid off. At the same time, bunch of people in my life passed away. I've been depressed and turned off from tech for a year now. Meaning no studying leetcode or interview prep.

        "content": "I am a tech guy with over 10 years of experience. I got my PhD in CS from a good US school, and perhaps just as relevant for the topic, I got a minor in history. I worked in tech in the US, Germany, UK, the Netherlands, and visited China many times for work.To various extents, I've seen the the development of AI, dot-com bubble (indirectly), big data boom, cloud revolution, the Bitcoin inception, the LLMs, and a few side-hypes like the quantum computing.I'm also well-aware of the overall crisis of science, especially with respect to publishing and funding, that spans far beyond the boundaries of Computer Science. Nevertheless, I would argue that no major scientific discipline is in a worse danger than CS, and I'm proceeding to expand on that.Tech has generated an unprecedented amount of wealth over the last three decades. That wealth produced the political power that influenced the society. Unlike some other historically influential movements, this one chose an unsubtle method of societal influence that generates unprecedented amount of discontent, and therefore I denote the people who hold this power as \"moguls.\" Worse even for the tech community, the moguls hid their ideological underpinnings and political ambitions behind their \"tech nerd\" images. History teaches us that the majority of the upcoming backlash will center around the images the moguls perpetuate and not their chosen ideologies. Although one could argue that a scientific or engineering discipline may spontaneously evaporate upon fulfilling its historical role, I assume that CS is not at that stage. That is to say that there still exist problems that CS can help humanity with.Under the above assumption, how do we defend CS (and tech) as a discipline once the \"shit hits the fan,\" pardon my French? How do we argue that it's not tech that is evil, but the ideologies fueling the tech moguls?",

I'm plenty fine working on coding, I kind of even enjoy it. In my whole career, coding has *never* been the problem. I'd say the main problem has been that managers, which feel like a flip of a coin in terms of if it's gonna be a problem. Half the time, we get along perfectly and there's no problems whatsoever. The other half, it seems like the manager disdains me on a nearly personal level. At times, some have even explicitly told me this, saying they don't like me and don't like working with me. It seems like there's nothing I can do to change their mind. I've tried to be perfectly compliant in every way, but it never worksI don't really have a problem working with \"co-equal\" engineers though.

I'm also the only developer without 5+ yoe.The current situation is an unmitigated disaster. * The team doesn't have a shared linter or formatter, doesn't conduct code reviews, devs commit directly to the main branch, and there is zero oversight for adding unmaintained dependencies. * The codebase lacks a coherent directory structure, naming conventions, and is riddled with with monolithic components doing too many things. There is a significant amount of duplicated logic/JSX, and components are often built more than once. The applications I've seen currently \"work\" but are going to be a nightmare to maintain.This environment feels toxic for learning how to be a good developer, as I am essentially being trained in anti-patterns. I suspect the answer is to find new employment ASAP, but since that is becoming increasingly difficult:1. Should I keep my head down and focus on finding a new job?2.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey fellow dev,The job search has been rough these past couple of months. Ever since the H1B visa tax changes, I’ve seen an uptick in interview requests, but landing offers is still proving to be a real challenge. Many companies have packed interview calendars, which makes scheduling and momentum tough. Out of all the interviews I’ve done, I’ve only made it to one on-site so far. In one case, an interviewer even called in sick mid-interview, so I had to reschedule.One company had me go through three phone interviews. The recruiter later told me they’re considering down-leveling me because I don’t have experience with Java Spring—even though I’ve been solid on the technical side. They want one more phone round to “get more signal.”I’ve noticed a pattern: when the phone screen is purely technical, I tend to do well—about half the time I make it to the onsite. But I’ve never cleared a hiring manager screening round in my entire career. Ironically, I’ve passed hiring manager interviews during onsites, probably because they’ve already seen strong technical feedback by then.Over the past month, I’ve been working on STAR-formatting my past impact stories and aligning them with the usual “ideal corporate teammate” attributes. Still, I’m not sure if I’m hitting the mark.One recent hiring manager screen was especially tricky. It was a 30-minute video call. The first half was standard—what I’ve worked on, what technologies I’ve used. Then came the curveball: “Is there anything you don’t like about your current company or would want to change?” I figured dodging it would tank the interview, so I answered honestly. I said that if I were to start a company, I’d invest more in engineering processes and development environment, since I currently spend about 20% of my time firefighting. He followed up by asking what I’ve done about it. For the record, I had raised concerns with my manager (who brushed them off). I told the interviewer that I’ve been pushing for simplification in all aspect.I’ve seen this pattern before—where the interviewer asks what language I prefer for the next step in the interview process (I said Python), and it feels like a setup to give me false hope. Maybe I’m reading too much into it, but these interviews are really tough when you’re not naturally social or charismatic.I guess I’m wondering: am I overthinking this? Or are hiring managers just extra picky right now? I’d love to hear how others have navigated this, especially if you’ve struggled with the same kind of behavioral hurdles.Thanks for reading.------------------------------------I've been employed a lot.

        "content": "I'm 24 with almost 5 years of IT experience. I started as \"tech refresh\" deploying machines for hospitals and now I’ve been fully remote doing Tier 2 support with some light IAM work for 3 years. The job is comfortable, but I feel stuck and I don’t want to stay in end user support or move into sysadmin work either.I’m trying to pick a degree through WGU, but I’m torn between the IT degree, Cybersecurity, and Computer Science. I’m leaning toward the general IT degree since it’s broad and I'd be able to complete it in 1 term, but I also feel pressure to pick Computer Science because I worry that the IT degree might not hold up long term.I also feel like I’m running out of time and I don’t want to leave my current job until I finish a degree. For anyone who’s been in a similar situation, which degree actually helped you move out of support and specialize? And if you were in your mid 20s again, what path would you choose?Note: The roles I'm most interested ATM are cloud and security.",
