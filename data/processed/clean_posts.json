We are heavily invested in databricks and power biProblem: Our business users want to drilldown, slice, and re-aggregate across upc, store, category, department, etc. it’s the perfect usecase for a cube, but we don’t have that. Our data model is too large to fit entirely into power bi memory, even with vertipaq compression and 400gb of memory. For reference, we are somewhere between 750gb-1tb depending on compression. The solution to this point is direct query on an XL SQL warehouse which is essentially running nonstop due to the SLAs we have. This is costing a fortune. Solutions thought of:- Pre aggregation: great in thought, unfortunately too many possibilities to pre calculate - Onelake: Microsoft of course suggested this to our leadership, and though this does enable fitting the data ‘in memory’, it would be expensive as well, and I personally don’t think power bi is designed for drill downs- Clickhouse: this seems like it might be better designed for the task at hand, and can still be integrated into power bi. Columnar, with some heavy optimizations. Open source is a plus. Also considered: Druid, SSAS (concerned about long term support plus other things)Im not sure if I’m falling for marketing with Clickhouse or if it really would make the most sense here. What am I missing? EDIT: i appreciate the thoughts this far. The theme of responses has been to pushback or change process. I’m not saying that won’t end up being the answer, but I would like to have all my ducks in a row and understand all the technical options before I go forward to leadership on this.",

Another problem in the project was, the data is full of PII information that only the data owner can access the data. We, the data engineers that doing the migration do not have any permission to see the production data. Hence for development, we rely on sandbox env of the SaaS app that filled with dummy data and just hope it will works in production. If there are any problem in prod migration? we need to get approval from security team, and then need to sit down with the data owner and then fix it there.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "The idea of a \"Database OS\" has been a sort of holy grail for decades, but it's making a huge comeback for a very modern reason.My colleagues and I just had a paper on this exact topic accepted to SIGMOD 2025. I can share our perspective.**TL;DR: Yes, but not in the way you might think. We're not replacing Linux. We're giving the database a safe, hardware-assisted \"kernel mode\" of its own, inside a normal Linux process.**# The Problem: The OS is the New Slow DiskFor years, the motto was \"CPU waits for I/O.\" But with NVMe SSDs hitting millions of IOPS and microsecond latencies, the bottleneck has shifted. Now, very often, the **CPU is waiting for the OS**.The Linux kernel is a marvel of general-purpose engineering. But that \"general-purpose\" nature comes with costs: layers of abstraction, context switches, complex locking, and safety checks. For a high-performance database, these are pure overhead.Database devs have been fighting this for years with heroic efforts:* Building their own buffer pools to bypass the kernel's page cache.* Using io\\_uring to minimize system calls.But these are workarounds. We're still fundamentally \"begging\" the OS for permission. We can't touch the real levers of power: direct page table manipulation, interrupt handling, or privileged instructions.# The Two \"Dead End\" SolutionsThis leaves us with two bad choices:1. **\"Just patch the Linux kernel.\"** This is a nightmare. You're performing surgery on a 30-million-line codebase that's constantly changing. It's incredibly risky (remember the recent CrowdStrike outage?), and you're now stuck maintaining a custom fork forever.2. **\"Build a new OS from scratch (a Unikernel).\"** The idealistic approach. But in reality, you're throwing away 30+ years of the Linux ecosystem: drivers, debuggers (gdb), profilers (perf), monitoring tools, and an entire world of operational knowledge. No serious production database can afford this.# Our \"Third Way\": Virtualization for Empowerment, Not Just IsolationHere's our breakthrough, inspired by the classic [Dune paper (OSDI '12)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usenix.org%2Fconference%2Fosdi12%2Ftechnical-sessions%2Fpresentation%2Fbelay). We realized that hardware virtualization features (like Intel VT-x) can be used for more than just running VMs. They can be used to **grant a single process temporary, hardware-sandboxed kernel privileges.**Here's how it works:* Your database starts as a normal Linux process.* When it needs to do something performance-critical (like manage its buffer pool), it executes a special instruction and \"enters\" a guest mode.* In this mode, it becomes its own mini-kernel. It has its own page table, can handle certain interrupts, and can execute privileged instructions—all with hardware-enforced protection. If it screws up, it only crashes itself, not the host system.* When it needs to do something generic, like send a network packet, it \"exits\" and hands the request back to the host Linux kernel to handle.This gives us the best of both worlds:* **Total Control:** We can re-design core OS mechanisms specifically for the database's needs.* **Full Linux Ecosystem:** We're still running on a standard Linux kernel, so we lose nothing. All the tools, drivers, and libraries still work.* **Hardware-Guaranteed Safety:** Our \"guest kernel\" is fully isolated from the host.# Two Quick, Concrete Examples from Our PaperThis new freedom lets us do things that were previously impossible in userspace:1. **Blazing Fast Snapshots (vs. fork()):** Linux's fork() is slow for large processes because it has to copy page tables and set up copy-on-write with reference counting for every single shared memory page. In our guest kernel, we designed a simple, epoch-based mechanism that ditches per-page reference counting entirely. **Result: We can create a snapshot of a massive buffer pool in milliseconds.**2. **Smarter Buffer Pool (vs. mmap):** A big reason database devs hate mmap is that evicting a page requires unmapping it, which can trigger a \"TLB Shootdown.\" This is an expensive operation that interrupts every other CPU core on the machine to tell them to flush that memory address from their translation caches. It's a performance killer. In our guest kernel, the database can directly manipulate its own page tables and use the INVLPG instruction to **flush the TLB of only the local core**. Or, even better, we can just leave the mapping and handle it lazily, eliminating the shootdown entirely.So, to answer your question: a full-blown \"Database OS\" that replaces Linux is probably not practical. But a **co-designed system where the database runs its own privileged kernel code in a hardware-enforced sandbox** is not only possible but also extremely powerful.We call this paradigm \"Privileged Kernel Bypass.\"If you're interested, you can check out the work here:* **Paper:** Zhou, Xinjing, et al. \"Practical db-os co-design with privileged kernel bypass.\" SIGMOD (2025). (I'll add the link once it's officially in the ACM Digital Library, but you can find a preprint if you search for the title).* **Open-Source Code:** [https://github.com/zxjcarrot/libdbos](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fzxjcarrot%2Flibdbos)Happy to answer any more questions",

I’ve been working on this project on-and-off for a while, and I thought I would see what [r/DE](https://www.reddit.com/r/DE/) thinks.The basics of the pipeline are as follows, orchestrated with Airflow:1. Download and extract bill data from [Congress.gov](http://congress.gov/) bulk data page, unzip it in my local environment (Google Compute VM in prod) and concatenate into a few files for easier upload to GCS. Obviously not scalable for bigger data, but seems to work OK here2. Extract url of voting results listed in each bill record, download voting results from url, convert from xml to json and upload to GCS3. In parallel, extract member data from [Congress.gov](http://congress.gov/) API, concatenate, upload to GCS4. Create external tables with airflow operator then staging and dim/fact tables with dbt5. Finally, export aggregated views (gold layer if you will) to a schema that feeds a Streamlit app.A few observations / questions that came to mind:\\- To create an external table in BigQuery for each data type, I have to define a consistent schema for each type. This was somewhat of a trial-and-error process to understand how to organize the schema in a way that worked for all records. Not to mention instances when incoming data had a slightly different schema than the existing data. Is there a way that I could have improved this process?\\- In general, is my DAG too bloated? Would it be best practice to separate my different data sources (members, bills, votes) into different DAGs?https://preview.redd.it/153iiz683llf1.png?width=2158&format=png&auto=webp&s=31e735c54db6bf536fa52d7f8e4fa246feb62f7b\\- I probably over-engineered aspects of this project. For example, I’m not sure I need an IaC tool. I also could have likely skipped the external tables and gone straight to a staging table for each data type. The Streamlit app is definitely high latency, but seems to work OK once the data is loaded. Probably not the best for this use case, but I wanted to practice Streamlit because it’s applicable to my day job.Thank you if you’ve made it this far. There are definitely lots of other minor things that I could ask about, but I’ve tried to keep it to the biggest point in this post. I appreciate any feedback!",

My passion lies in data and AI, not necessarily in core engineering or people management. My background leans more toward the “type B” data engineer, I have an analytical, business-focused mindset and a love for working with data, rather than being deep into systems or heavy software engineering.Lately, I’ve been considering a few possible paths:* Pivoting into product management for data/AI products* Transitioning into AI engineering and building more ML-focused skill sets* Becoming a more well-rounded data engineer by leaning into software engineering skills* Or perhaps focusing on strategy and leadership roles where I can influence how businesses create value with data rather than being hands-on with execution.Ultimately, I know I want to become a leader in data or AI in 5 years issh (head of data, director of AI team), someone shaping direction and strategy rather than just pipelines, but I’m still unclear on what the right stepping stones are to get there.If anyone has been through a similar crossroads, or has insights on the best ways to transition toward more strategic, data-driven leadership roles, I’d really appreciate your thoughts.Thanks in advance!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "We recently took a dive into comparing Delta Lake and Apache Iceberg, especially for batch analytics and ML pipelines, and I wanted to share some findings in a practical way. The blog post we wrote goes into detail, but here’s a quick rundown and the approach we took and the things we covered: First off, both formats bring serious warehouse-level power to data lakes think ACID transactions, time travel, and easy schema evolution.That’s huge for ETL, feature engineering, and reproducible model training. Some of the key points we explored: \\-Firstly, the delta Lake’s copy-on-write mechanism and the new Deletion Vectors (DVs) feature, which streamlines updates and deletes (especially handy for update-heavy streaming). ﻿ \\- Iceberg’s more flexible approach with your position/equality deletes and a hierarchical metadata model for a fast query planning even across a lot(millions) of files. \\- We also covered the partitioning strategies where we have Delta’s Liquid Clustering and Iceberg’s true partition evolution and they let you optimize your data as it grows.  \\- Most importantly for us was the ecosystem integration iceberg is super engine-neutral, with rich support across Spark, Flink, Trino, BigQuery, Snowflake, and more. Delta is strongest with Spark/Databricks, but OSS support is evolving. \\-Case studies went a long way too where we have doordash saved up to 40% on costs migrating to Iceberg, mainly through better storage and resource use.Refer  [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRKHEA8-3bYFinal) thoughts: \\- Go Iceberg if you want max flexibility, cost savings, and governance neutrality. \\- Go Delta if you’re deep in Databricks, want managed features, and real-time/streaming is critical.We covered operational realities too, like setup and table maintenance, so if you’re looking for hands-on experience, I think you’ll find some actionable details. Would love for you to check out the article and let us know what you think, or share your own experiences!",

        "author": "BankEcstatic8883",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all,I’m curious about the apparent gap in tooling around using database transaction logs (like MySQL binlogs) for **incremental batch processing**.In our organization, we currently perform incremental loads directly from tables, relying on timestamp or “last modified” columns. This approach works, but it’s error-prone — for example, manual updates or overlooked changes sometimes don’t update these columns, causing data to be missed in our loads.On the other hand, there are many streaming CDC solutions (Debezium, Kafka Connect, AWS DMS) that consume binlogs, but they feel overkill for small teams and require substantial operational overhead.This leads me to wonder: why isn’t there a **more lightweight, batch-oriented binlog reader and parser** that could be used for incremental processing? Are there any existing tools or libraries that support this use case that I might be missing? I’m not considering commercial solutions like Fivetran due to cost constraints.Would love to hear thoughts, experiences, or pointers to any open-source approaches in this space.Thanks in advance!",

Raw (Bronze): Source data and simple views like renaming, parsing, casting columns.2. Staging (Bronze): Further cleaned datasets. I often end up finding that there needs to be a lot of additional work done on top of source data, such as joining tables together, building out incremental models on top of the source data, filtering out bad data, etc. It's still ultimately viewing the source data, but can have significantly more logic than just the raw layer.3. Catalog (Silver): Datasets people are going to use. These are not always just whatever is from the source data, it can start to be things like joining different data sources together to create more complex stuff, but they are generally not report specific (you can create whatever reports off of them).4. Reporting (Gold): Datasets that are more report specific. This is usually something like aggregated, unioned, denormalized datasets.Overall folder structure might be something like this:* raw * source\\_A * source\\_B* staging * source\\_A * source\\_B * intermediate* catalog * business\\_domain\\_1 * business\\_domain\\_2 * intermediate* reporting * report\\_X * report\\_Y * intermediateHistorically, the raw layer above was our staging layer, the staging layer above was an intermediate layer, and all intermediate steps were done in the same intermediate folder, which I feel has become unnecessarily tangled as we've scaled up.",

Define Postgres tables with SQLAlchemy, then append the cleaned data into the tableAlso, is Pydantic useful in either of these workflows for validating data types, or is it kinda superfluous since we are defining the data type on each column and casting appropriately?If there are better recommendations, please feel free to free to suggest as well.

Like instead of SCD2 tables with e.g **dbt\\_valid\\_from** and **dbt\\_valid\\_to,** there would be just **date** column.It would lead to massive increase of row counts but we could utilize partitioning on this column and because we use Dagster for orchestration it also make backfills easier (reload just 1 partition, change of history in SCD2 is more tricky) and we could also migrate the majority of dbt models to incremental ones.It is basically the trade-off between storage and compute. (1 TB of storage costs 20 USD/month, whereas 1 TB of processed costs 6.25 USD and sometimes forcing BQ to utilize partition is not so straightforward (but we use capacity based pricing to utilize slots).So my question is, has any body crossed the Rubicon and made this change ?",

I wasn’t even trying a job anymore; I was trying to do work for free to put it in my portfolio and it turned into an opportunity. I started brushing up against DE work and I started getting really interested and thought I wanted to transition into that, so I started learning, reading books & blogs, etc. The first thing people tell me is that working in a startup is terrible as a junior because you’re not working under seniors with experience and I realize this is true and try to make up for it by engaging in the community online. Admittedly I *like* my job because 1) I like what I’m doing, and I want to learn more so I can do more DE work, 2) I believe in the company (I know, I know) I think they are profitable and I really think this could grow, and 3) outside of technical stuff, I’m learning a lot about how business works, meeting with new people with way more experience from different places, 4 ) honestly I need money, and the money is *really* good considering my area, even when compared to other entry positions. I couldn’t afford dental care, meds, etc, and now I can so that is already lifting a mental load, and I have time to self-study. Thing is I don’t want to be bad at what I do, even if I’m still learning. Is this really such a horrible decision? I don’t have a senior to guide me really.",

The tricky part is that the data comes from two different systems, and everything needs to be filtered and deduplicated before it lands in a final Excel file.Here’s the setup:General rule: In both systems, I only need data from the last business day.Source 1 (Excel export from SAP BO / BI4):We run a query in BI4 to pull all relevant columns.Export to Excel.A VBA macro compares the new data with a history file (also Excel) so that new entries neuer than 10 years based on CCID) are excluded.The cleaned Excel is then placed automatically on a shared drive.Source 2 (CSV):Needs the same filter: last business day only.only commercial customers are relevant (they can be identified by their legal form in one column).This must also be compared against another history file (Excel again).customers often appear multiple times with the same CCID (because several people are tied to one company), but I only need one row per CCID.The issue:I can use Python, but the history and outputs must still remain in Excel, since that’s what the other department uses. I’m confused about how to structure this properly. Right now I’m stuck between half-automated VBA hacks and trying to build something more robust in Python.Questions:What’s the cleanest way to set up this pipeline when the “database” is basically just Excel files?How would you handle the deduplication logic (cross-history + internal CCID duplicates) in a clean way?Is Python + Pandas the right approach here, or should I lean more into existing ETL tools?I’d really appreciate some guidance or examples on how to build this properly — I’m getting a bit lost in Excel/VBA land.Thanks!",

        "author": "hzburki",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "> I plan to move all my business logic to a separate API service and call endpoints using the HTTPOperator. Lesson learned! Please focus on my concerns and alternate solutions. I would like to get more opinions. I have created a pipeline using Airflow which will process social media profiles. I need to update their data and insert new content (videos/images) into our database.I will test it to see if it handles the desired load but it will cost money to host and pay the external data providers so I want to get a second opinion on my implementation.I have to run to run the pipeline periodically and process a lot of profiles;1. Daily: 171K profiles2. Two Weeks: 307K profiles3. One Month: 1M profiles4. Three Months: 239K profiles5. Six Months: 506K profiles6. Twelve Months: 400K profilesThese are the initial numbers. They will be increased gradually over the next year so I will have time and a team to work on scaling the pipeline. The daily profiles have to be completed the same day. The rest can take longer to complete. I have split the pipeline into 3 DAGs. I am using hooks/operators for S3, SQS and postgres. I am also using asyncio with aiohttp for storing multiple content on s3. ## DAG 1 (Dispatch)- Runs on a fixed schedule- fetches data from database based on the provided filters. - Splits data into individual rows, one row per creator using `.expand`. - Use dynamic task mapping with TriggerDagRunOperator to create a DAG to process each profile separately. - I also set the task_concurrency to limit parallel task executions. ## DAG 2 (Process)- Triggered by DAG 1- Get params from the first DAG- Fetches the required data from external API- Formats response to match database columns + small calculations e.g. posting frequency, etc. - Store content on S3 + updates formatted response. - Stores messages (1 per profile) in SQS. ## DAG 3 (Insert)- Polls SQS every 5 mins- Get multiple messages from SQS - Bulk insert into database- Delete multiple messages from SQS ## ConcernsI feel like the implementation will work well apart from two things.1) In DAG 1 I am fetching all the data e.g. max 1 million ids plus a few extra fields and loading them into the python operator before its split into individual rows per creator. I am doubtful that this my cause memory issues because the amount of rows is large but the data size should not be more than a few MBs. 2) In DAG 1 on tasks 2 and 3, splitting the data into separate processes for each profile will trigger 1 million DAG runs. I have set the concurrency limit to control the amount of parallel runs but I am unsure if Airflow can handle this. Keep in mind there is no heavy processing. All tasks are small, with the longest one taking less than 30 seconds to upload 90 videos + images on S3. All my code on Airflow and I plan to deploy to AWS ECS with auto-scaling. I have not figured out how to do that yet. ## Alternate SolutionsAn alternative I can think of is to create a \"DAG 0\" before DAG 1, which fetches the data and uploads batches into SQS. The current DAG 1 will pull batches from SQS e.g. 1,000 profiles per batch and create dynamic tasks as already implemented. This way I should be able to control the number of dynamic DAG runs in Airflow. A second option is that I don't create dynamic DAG runs for each profile but a batch of 1,000 to 5,000 profiles. I don't think this is a good idea because;1) It will create a very long task if I have to loop through all profiles to process them.2) I will likely need to host it separately in a container.3) Right now, I can see which profiles fail, why, when and where in DAG 2.I would like to keep things as simple as possible. I also have to figure out how and where to host the pipeline and how much resources to provision to handle the daily profiles target but these are problems for another day.Thank you for reading :D",

        "content": "Hi all, First of all, i'm a beginner.Currently, were using a low code tool for our transformations but planning to migrate to a SQL/python first solution. We're applying data vault although we sometimes abuse it as in that besides strict link, hub and sats, we throw bridge tables in the mix. One of the issues we currently see in our transformations is that links are dependent on keys/hashes of other objects (that's natural i would say). Most of the time, we fill the hash of the object in the same workflow as the corresponding id key column in the link table. Yet, this creates a soup of dependencies and doesn't feel that professional.The main solution we're thinking off is to make use of a keychain. We would define all the keys of the objects on basis of the source tables (which we call layer 1 tables, i believe it would be called bronze right?). and fill the keychain first before running any layer 2/silver transformations. This way, we would have a much clearer approach in handling keys without making it a jungle of dependencies. I was wondering what you guys do or what best practices are?Thanks.",

Features like materialized view or aggregating mergetrees seems also super interesting to us.We have made the decision to incluse CH into our infrastructure, knowing that it's gonna be a key part for BI mostly (metrics coming from sensors mostly, with quite a lot of functional logic with time windows or contexts and so on).The question is: how do we host this?There isnt a single chance I can convince my boss to use a managed service, so we will use resources from a cloud provider.What are you experiences with self-hosted CH? Would you recommend a replicated infrastructure with multiple containers based on docker-compose ? Do you think kubernetes is a good idea?Also, if there are some downsides or drawbacks to clickhouse we should consider I am definitely up for some feedbacks on it![Edit] our data volume is currently about 30GB/day, using Clickhouse it goes down to ~1GB/dayThank you very much!",

What tools or architectures are you using for this pipeline (Fivetran, Airbyte, Stitch, custom scripts, etc.)?2. How do you manage HubSpot schema changes without triggering a full, multi-day table resync?3.

This consists of techs like kafka, snowpipe streaming for real time ingestion and also snowpipe/copy jobs for batch processing of files from AWS S3 and then Streams, Tasks, snowflake Dynamic tables for tramsformation. The snowflake account have multiple databases and in that multiple schemas exists but we only want to have the DR configuration done for critical schemas/tables and not full database.Majority of the component hosted on the AWS cloud infrastructure. However, as mentioned this has also spanned across components which are lying outside the Snowflake like e.g kafka, Airflow scheduler etc. But also within snowflake we have warehouses , roles, stages which are in the same account but are not bound to a schema or database. And how these different components would be in synch during a DR exercise making sure no dataloss/corruption or if any failure/pause in the halfway in the data pipeline? I am going through the below document. Feels little lost when going through all of these. Wanted some guidance on , how we should proceed with this? Wants to understand, is there anything we should be cautious about and the approach we should take?

Are there any simple end-to-end examples (like pulling from a database into Kafka, then writing to another DB)? Should I focus on local Docker setups first, or move straight into cloud?Any resources, tips, or advice from your own experience would be super helpful :folded_hands:Thanks in advance!",

We can ask for more storage via IT tickets, add compression and look into partitioning for performance. But none of those will really solve the issue in the long term.I’m wondering a couple of different things here:1) Does something like Hadoop need to be considered? Is a sql rdms the best opinion for data of this size on-prem?2) What learning resources to you recommend for understanding how to navigate this kind of thing? The all knowing gpt keeps suggesting designing data intensive applications and the data warehouse toolkit, both of which I have and neither really touches on this.Anyway, thanks to any on-prem homies who know the struggle and have advice.",

I've also been taking note of tools people mention here to know what I want to use during the project. SQL is a given, as is Python. And AWS, as I already have access to a well-regarded course for it(from some time ago when I was panicking trying to learn everything, figured I may as well make that the cloud platform to learn if I already have a course on it). My issue mainly is I want to keep this on a scale that won't make me overwhelm myself too fast. Again, I'm new to this, and so I want to approach this in a way that's going to mainly help me in learning more and then showing what I've learned on my portfolio.

I’d read entire documentation sets before typing. I’d spend days researching best practices instead of just building *something*. And then I’d wonder why nothing stuck. My learning speed is really too slow. The effect of doing something after reading is definitely not as good as reading while learning.Every senior dev says “just build stuff”, and beginners hear that as “just build stuff *correctly*.” That mindset kept me paralyzed. Bad code teaches more than no code. I’ve started using beyz coding assistant, not to hand me solutions, but to help me debug my own broken logic. Explaining *why* something doesn’t work turns out to be the fastest way to understand it. Now my rule is build → break → understand → rebuild. The understanding comes *after* the mistakes, not before. When did you stop watching “just one more tutorial” and start producing bugs instead?

I’d love to get advice from this community.Here’s what I’ve found so far (please correct me if I’m missing something):Postman → Probably the most popular. Great GUI, lots of tutorials.Hoppscotch → A lightweight, open source alternative to Postman. Runs in the browser or self-hosted.Bruno → Stores collections as plain text, easy to version control (great for teams).Hurl → CLI-based, tests APIs using simple text files. Super clean for automation.Yaak → Made by the original Insomnia founder. Sleek UI.SoapUI → Bit older but strong if you need SOAP and more complex protocols.Apidog → Similar to Postman, but I noticed it has a neat offline mode and works well for designing + mocking APIs.Thunder Client (VS Code extension) → Really handy if you don’t want to leave your editor.For someone still learning programming, what would you recommend focusing on first?Should I start with a GUI tool like Postman/Bruno/Hoppscotch, or dive straight into CLI stuff like Curl/Hurl to build stronger fundamentals?Would love to hear what worked for you all when you were learning API testing.",

        "author": "yughiro_destroyer",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi! I have been working as a web developer for two years and when I am looking at the codebases of the projects I am a part of I am unable to understand what is exactly going on. I simply believe that a lot of the code that is written today is unreadable but I am not sure if that's really the case or I am simply not skilled enough. I used to be a perfectionist and when I was working on my own projects it would take even 30 minutes or more to simply decide on naming a variable. Overthinking kept me away from creating and that's the primary reason for which I've wasted a lot of time. I tried to aim for perfection but such thing doesn't exist. I remember once I had the ocassion to talk with a popular car designer at Renault about sketching cars and getting the perfect drawing and he answered me with \"Only God can be perfect.\". Later now, I was able to quit this toxic and not productive mindset of \"aiming at perfection\". Still, that doesn't mean I don't have a sense for order and beauty (I think?). Yes, nothing can be perfect but there are worse or better ways of doing something. When it comes to code, I am a big fan or consistency. What do I mean by that? Be consistent in naming conventions, in programming paradigms and in the location of the created and used modules. I admire simplicity and I dislike complexity.For example, one of the most recallable thing is that in the place where I work, when there is an request to update the CSS on a page, we overwrite the element rules. Instead of trying to locate and modify a class on a HTML tag they would write new rules using that tag's ID, would add style directly in HTML or use the !important rule specifier.When it comes to what is JS, code is split around everywhere, hard to trace or reason about. That's something I noticed studying other online smaller projects. I am studying game development on my own at home and when I am reading the source code of some indies... code is literally a weird combination betweeing polling and event driven. I respect both paradigms but combining them, especailly with no comments or no consistency, turns into a nightmare to track. I prefer those 10000 lines of ifs in GameMaker than this weird combination of callbacks and procedural.More than anything, I admire code that is consistent and ordered. If a module is chaotic, then that chaos is the module's chaos and trapped in there. If the module has proper wiring between input, outputs and isn't tangled with the main application as a complete monolith, that specific part can be much more easily refactored or replaced in case of need (for later optimization or other stuff).Also, tutorials. Everytime and then when I want to start learning a new library or framework or whatever, tutorials simply get into unnecessary specifics. For example, I want a 2 minute tutorial to teach me about creating an endpoint. But most tutorials start to delve inside unrelated stuff like ORMs or authentification. Yes, these are important, but right now we were talking about url endpoints, right? That's like learning the piano and out of nowhere \"yo, check out these guitar strings\" when trying to become a musician.I hope I didn't write too much BS but to end this post gracefully I will leave here my question (which is also present in the title) : Are some codebases really unredable or am I simply dumb? Is reading codebases a skill in itself? Then how do you become better at it? Has it ever occured to you to find a codebase where your first impression was \"that's pure art!\" ? Thanks for reading.",

My dad's a programmer and dealt with carpal tunnel in his 40s, so I'm trying to be proactive about this stuff.Here's what I've started doing that seems to help:Taking breaks: Set a timer for every 45 minutes, get up and stretch for 5 minutes. Actually doing this consistently has been harder than I expected but it makes a difference. This is necessary, the rest will pay off in the ling run guys. Wrist stretches: Found some good ones on YouTube. The prayer stretch and wrist flexor stretches seem to help the most.Better posture: Raised my monitor so I'm not hunching over. Best way to go about it is a standing desk but I don't have enough to invest in an automatic one (Magnus Pro looks so so good!) yet so I haven't gotten one yet. On the other hand, I am still working on keeping my shoulders relaxed, the anxiety I feel constantly keeps them clenched.Split keyboard: This was probably the biggest change. Switched to a NocFree Lite about 4 months ago and honestly my wrists feel way more natural now. Takes some getting used to but the angle just feels right. NocFree Lite is just so light and easy to carry around. You'd think that the carrying part was annoying because of the 2 piece product but they provided a carrying bag with the board as well. Proper mouse positioning: Moved my mouse closer and have been on a lookout for a vertical mouse. I've been checking out the Anker wireless vertical ergonomic mouse as well as the Logitech MX vertical, which one is better? Any other ergonomic mouse that I should check out?Anyone else dealing with this early in their programming journey? What's worked for you?

Currently I’m working towards either getting my Azure AZ-204 certification or continue learning Rust (I am on chapter 7 of the rust book currently). I’m just wondering if fully reading the rust book online would be better before starting the certification or not?Edit: this is more about what’s a better use of my time. I would like to get a backend microservices programming job and so I want am trying to prioritize what’s more important first. So would fully learning Rust to improve my programming skills be more beneficial than getting an AZ-204 Azure certificate? I know I could do both at the same time but I just want to full commit to only one and finish it before starting the other.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I'm not sure if I'm the only person this applies to, but it's certainly very weird for me. For context, I am a sophomore, and in my two math classes Honors Algebra 2 and Honors Geometry, the concepts in there are not exactly impossible to understand, but a bit more difficult to grasp. However, when I learn mathematics for programming, it's much easier compared to math inside school. For more context, I am an ML Engineer, and I've learned much harder topics such as matrices, partial derivatives, derivatives, vectors, and overall just a good amount of calculus and linear algebra for programming. Although it's obvious that I'm not going into incredible depth with those topics, and it's only a basic understanding for what I need, I have created an entire AI from scratch before, and I'm creating another one with a shitty Scratch ripoff called MIT App Inventor, and for any AI nerds out there, that is not an easy task. You must be proficient in your understanding of programming & math, so how the hell can I do that but I can't learn what a domain and range is??I'm not exactly sure why this happens to me, but it certainly is weird. I should also mention that I learn much better when watching YouTube videos on math compared to learning math in school, so maybe it's just the way I learn. I have an Honors Algebra 2 test on domain and range and a bunch of other things tomorrow such as like increasing intervals and stuff like that, so I'm going to try and figure out a way that I can implement those concepts into programming somehow. If anyone wants an update, I'll post it here. Edit: I tried implementing programming into my studying, but by the time I did I had already understood everything so there was no need (I'm not sure that makes sense, but when studying how to implement it into code I just eventually learned it so there was no need to..? It's hard to explain.) I was also learning on little sleep & food for the past few weeks or so, so that's probably another factor that should've been mentioned before. My test got pushed back to Tuesday due to people not having their notes filled out, so I guess I'll have to wait until then to see how I do.",

The few programming tasks I’ve done were either simple or brute-forced with AI. For example: “You’ve never seen Java before, but here’s a website to pentest and refactor. You’ve got a month, and it’s 50% of your grade. Good luck.” That’s basically been my experience.I’ve tried doing small projects, but I always get stuck in a cycle:- Start something (like Langton’s ant in JS + HTML).- Hit a wall (e.g., “how do I make a grid?”).- Bang head on it for an hour, then ask AI. -Repeat until I have something that “works,” but I don’t feel like I actually learned much.- Try to extend it (e.g., Game of Life), realize I don’t understand enough, and give up.A month later, I’ve forgotten everything anyway.I’ve gone through this same cycle with Godot, React, etc. — learn a little, get stuck or bored, forget it.Now, I’ve got a month before uni starts again, and this year I’ll be working on a big, team-based project. My last team project ended with me being kicked out because the others were way ahead (lifelong coders, or just had way more time). I really don’t want that to happen again.TL;DR: I have one month to get vaguely comfortable coding in some language so I don’t drag down a team project. What’s the best way to break out of the “learn → stuck → forget” cycle and actually build usable coding skills?(Sorry for the whinge)",

I started taking a course “ztm python developer” on udemy because I like structure. I’ve learned all the python syntax, but for each project in the course I do, it all seems to be an excercise in reading library documentation. Instead of feeling more confident in myself as a python dev, I am just constantly looking up libraries and how to use them, most of which I will not remember the exact syntax for, only that they exist. Due to this I feel like I am not getting better at python, only reading and essentially copy and pasting over solutions from the docs. From a c++ perspective I built everything myself, yet in python I know absolutely nothing about how many of these libraries work under the hood. I find myself questioning the use of these projects for learning if I will just forget everything later due to the libraries being endless, it’s not like syntax where I can lock it down and improve. I feel relatively incompetent here, like I couldn’t do anything in python without an internet connection. Has anyone else felt this way?",

What I do enjoy is building stuff people actually use — whether it’s a little game, a Chrome extension, a script, or an app, it honestly makes my day when someone says they’re using something I made. Now I’m wondering with all the AI hype and the tough job market if it’s still worth going deep into software engineering, because ideally I’d like to land a dev job (preferably web or mobile) while also launching my own apps on the side. For context, I know Python/JS/C/C++, built some games in Godot, made a Chrome extension and some simple web apps (mainly using django), done a fair bit of LeetCode, and I’m already comfortable with HTML/CSS/JS/SQL. The thing is I’m not sure how to take it to the next level — is it just “keep building projects” or is there more to it? Should I focus on one tech stack, try different ones, or do something structured like The Odin Project even though I already know the basics? Would love to hear from anyone who’s been in a similar spot. Thank you in advance :)",

That way, people can grow step by step and tackle challenges that fit their journey.For now, all exercises will be in Python :snake:, but I believe they could be just as valuable as a starting point for people who later want to work with other technologies too. Please send me a private message and I will share the challenge with you.I’d love to hear your feedback :folded_hands:—does this approach feel useful, fun, or motivating to you? Any suggestions to improve it are more than welcome!Thanks a lot for taking a look :blue_heart:",

So which should I learn first? I'm willing to commit 5-6 hours daily for the next 8 months for reference.",

Someone else also told me that using a enum would yield a compile time error if a color is not found -> talking compile time, could I write the whole header with template metaprogramming or constexpr to have my looking happen hat compiletime and not runtime ? currently I might have to iterate tru the whole array to find the color I need. ...",

I built my first pc when I was 17, but have done nothing in terms of programming.Before I enlisted, I maintained a 3.0gpa in 2015 and attained around 40 credits (but no degree) at community college. I took some computer classes, and have been a degenerate gamer online since I was 12 or 13. Like Asmon levels of gaming before I enlisted, 18-20 hours a day until I was 23, then I enlisted, got honorably discharged under medical conditions two years ago because of ankle injury (complete fhl and fdl tear and retear) Last year, I fired up the GI bill and got back into school to support my family. I am currently living in Dallas, Tx. And i’m going to Dallas College. I am not strong algebraically. This semester, I switched my degree plan from[ AS.Science](http://as.science) (General Studies here in Texas) to the Bachelor's of Applied Technology in Software Development program. My current GPA is good, I am around a 3.2 and I study hard. Currently unemployed and living off of my disability and GI bill, I am also doing under the table work, cleaning apartments with the abuelas (ICE might put us out of business). I’d much prefer to do something else lol.I legit struggle to do some daily activities because of this bum leg but we are thuggin' it out for now. I was wondering if doing things like customer service IT, help me on a resume with Programming related work or am I just wasting my time? It’s just supplemental income at the end of the day.I’m currently taking Programming Logic and Design, Mobile Applications and Development, Intro to Python Programming, and ITSE - Web Design Tools. Honestly, I am just looking for any pointers from anyone who may have been in the same boat at some point. I am stressed. Seeking some form of employment within the industry in the future, I just don’t know where to start. I would plug ports in some dudes basements for a modest wage for the next 15 aslong as it’s taxable, ngl.TL;DR: Is there some general beginner level stuff I can start doing that will benefit me? I know in the future there is hackerrack, leetcode, tryhackme etc. I’m nowhere near that. We are doing Atomic Kotlin in my classes and only going two sections deep this semester. Anything is appreciated.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey,I’m a fresher trying to build a project around data architecture concepts like bronze/silver/gold layers and all that jazz. I’m using MySQL for this because I want to get better with it for interviews and projects. I know i can use other tools to clean the messy data but i want to do it using sql to get some hands on experience wigh itThe trouble is, I have CSV files that contain a bunch of empty strings. MySQL won’t let me import those directly when my columns are typed as INT, DATE, etc. So I thought of two ways but both feel kinda inefficient:1. Create the table with all columns as `VARCHAR(50) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4`, import the raw data, then *later* clean the data by replacing empty strings with NULL or proper values, and finally convert each column to the right data type.2. Same as above but instead of replacing empty strings with proper values right away, I replace all empty strings with NULLs first, then work on cleaning/converting.I’m stuck because both approaches feel like extra work — importing everything as text then cleaning and converting feels like a hassle, especially since I’m still learning.I’m also wondering if maybe I should just switch to MSSQL since I heard it’s more flexible with empty strings on import, but I really want to stick with MySQL for now.So, any tips or best practices for importing messy CSV data with empty fields into MySQL? Am I missing a better way? How do you pros handle these kinds of data issues in real-world projects? Also, if you were me, would you stick to MySQL or try MSSQL instead?",

        "content": "I am writing an LSP in Rust. This is the first time I have had a project that I felt needed more than just basic error handling. By that, I mean I sent a get request. Handle the possible error case at the call site. With this project, I have several kinds of errors, and some of these kinds of errors require a specific response, as defined by the Microsoft spec.I'm using the \"?\" and a Result to push errors up the call stack, and right now, most of them just crash the program. This choice was deliberate. I didn't know how I wanted to handle this yet, and for the purpose of development, having the server crash is better for me because I know when and where I have a problem. I dont have to worry about noticing it in my log file or stderr.I've found the first point where I want to start to handle errors. The client sends messages to the server. I read, deserialize, and parse this message and produce an enum that tells the server what the client wants. Right now, I am reading the bytes out of stdin. I handle io errors here. I have two other functions that handle deserialization using serde to convert the bytes to concrete types and then read the method out of the concete type and match it to a corrisponding enum that the server can do things with.This is where I'm hoping for feedback. When would you want to see the three kinds of errors I can expect in this process to be handled? The resulting enum for this process includes an error variant with the option to include the specification defined response error code for the LSP.Should I push all the errors up from the reader and deserialization process so that I can handle everything at one focal point?Would it be better to keep the kinds of errors handled at different points? So, reader errors get handled at one spot. Deserialize errors at another point. Method parsing errors at another point? Is there another approach I've not considered? What does a good error handling strategy look like to experienced programmers, and what advice can you offer to ensure verbose error handling for my project?Thanks for your time.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I’ve been working with Angular and React, and I noticed a big difference in how they handle binding values in templates.* In Angular: * `{{ }}` is only for string interpolation (text nodes). * `[prop]` is required for property binding (booleans, numbers, objects).* In React: * `{ }` works everywhere. You can pass strings, booleans, numbers, functions, etc. directly in JSX, and it just works.This makes me wonder: isn’t React’s approach obviously more advantageous? With `{ }`, you don’t need to remember different syntaxes, it feels like “property binding that always works”.So my question is: **why didn’t Angular just make** `{{}}` **work the same way?** Is there some hidden benefit in Angular’s stricter separation (interpolation vs property binding), or is it just a design philosophy thing?I would be very thankful to hear from you, especially from people who’ve used both frameworks.",

I just feel it does not bring me the joy It used to bring back then. I tried myself in starting own business as startup founder. Didn't work out. Tried to pair with other founders - same stuff. Anywho...What would you recommend me to check for a new part of the journey? I was thinking of Machine Learning or Data science. Or maybe dive deep into native mobile development with SwiftUI for iOs.Or maybe Web 3.0, blockchain and IOT?I know quite little about any of above and should've probably studied what each and every does and responsible for.

(When process 1’s program is considered by itself, it does not matter in which order these two operations are performed.)”My confusion comes from the fact that the code for P1 does not have the b := 1 operation. But the text seems to emphasize that both of these instructions belong to P1, and that under isolation reordering them has no impact on correctness.It vaguely makes sense to me that reading the flag before updating it could lead to both processes entering the critical section.Appreciate any help on how to think about this!",

        "author": "cs-grad-person-man",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "This subreddit has a huge FAANG obsession, and it completely distorts the perception of software engineering. Every other post seems to be about insane comp packages, grueling interviews, layoffs, or burnout stories. But if you look at the actual data, the reality for most developers is completely different.[Resume.io (2025)](https://resume.io/blog/which-professions-are-the-happiest-at-work) found that 87 percent of software developers reported being “very happy” in their jobs, the highest of any profession surveyed. [Career.io (2024)](https://career.io/career-advice/careers-that-make-americans-happiest) analyzed nearly 756,000 job ratings and found software developers among the most satisfied six figure earners, with a median salary around 130K. [Market.biz (2025)](https://market.biz/job-satisfaction-statistics/#job-satisfaction-statistics-in-different-industries) reported that 74 percent of tech professionals worldwide are satisfied with their jobs. So why does this subreddit feel so negative compared to those numbers? Because the voices dominating here are FAANG engineers or startup employees, and their experiences are extreme. Life inside FAANG is often miserable. Long hours, constant pressure to ship, endless internal politics, and the looming threat of layoffs make it feel like a treadmill you can never step off. Software is the company’s entire product, so everything you do is under constant scrutiny and pressure. Burnout is common, and that is exactly what this sub amplifies.Meanwhile, the average developer lives a completely different life, and that is what drives the high happiness statistics. Most are not in San Francisco or New York. They live in mid sized cities or suburbs where their salary goes much further. They are not chasing the next billion dollar app. They work at hospitals, insurance companies, banks, logistics firms, or government agencies. The work is steady, respected, and meaningful, even if it never makes headlines.They make 100K to 130K, comfortably above the national median. Their hours are closer to forty a week. They get PTO. Their managers are competent but not tyrannical. And because software is a support function rather than the company’s core product, the pressure to grind nonstop is low. That is why surveys consistently show high satisfaction.The quiet majority of developers who live this life rarely post here. Nobody makes a thread to say “My job is stable, I like my team, I worked normal hours, and I had a great weekend hiking.” The loud minority who post are often FAANG engineers or startup refugees talking about their misery. That is why this subreddit can make software engineering seem miserable, even though for most people it is not.The truth is that chasing FAANG is often what ruins people’s perception of software engineering. It is the exception, not the rule. The average developer is happy, balanced, and living a peaceful, stable, and well-compensated life. Even in 2024 and 2025, software engineering remains one of the happiest and most rewarding professions you can choose, as long as you understand that most developers do not live the FAANG nightmare that dominates this subreddit.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Novel warning, but it's a good one IMO, tldr at the bottomThis is probably a common scam, but it was new to me so I figured I'd post it here in the off chance it helps someone avoid unwittingly destroying their entire company.For some time we had been getting flooded with nearly identically formatted resumes that were all very low quality. They were loaded with random keywords from our postings to try to maximize automated ranking but used very poor grammar or just nonsense word soup.They were all PDFs and all of them had similar metadata that was unique to them so I just wrote a script for our recruiters to auto-reject all of them.We got tons of them for every pure-remote posting, never in-office, or even hybrid.Curiosity got the better of me so I tried to schedule a tech screen with a few of them. Most ghosted, but I was able to actually get on a call with one.* The name was very English, first and last.* Age was late 20's which was a bit young given the timeline shown in the work history and education, but not impossible. It put them finishing their BS right at 21.* Location was listed as Austin, Texas and indicated that they were legal to work in the US without visa endorsement.* They listed a BS in Game Programming from Full Sail University (private, for-profit, online). I've had limited but mixed experience with their grads. Not an auto-reject school, but it's not going to help your resume really.* They had some work history with several short-term contracts with random non-us based small game studios and one 2-year stint with a well-known, but long defunct American studio. The timeline was a a bit dense with their first 2 contract gigs overlapping with their last year of college.Unfortunately for this person, the games industry is fairly small and I have close friends who were at the studio they listed at the time they reported having worked there. One of my friends would have been the director of the team this person reported having been a junior engineer on. My friend confirmed without question that this person was never at that studio and was never on his team.Once I got on the call (zoom), it was clear the the person was not a native English speaker. Which isn't a problem, they were conversational, just incongruitous with the name. The age also seemed unlikely; this person was probably over 40, though I've been more off on age guesses before. I'm familiar with Austin so I asked about the city a bit. It was clear that the person had never been there, let alone lived there.I poked at their technical skills and they actually seemed like they had some programming knowledge, but nothing close to what their experience and education would suggest. They used jargon more in-line with a very junior web developer than a mid-level game engineer. C++ was very weak, no knowledge of basic game design principles, and they couldn't speak at all to basic game development team structure or workflows.I was ready to get to the truth so I asked where they were calling from, making up some bullshit their IP address looking unusual (lie, zoom doesn't expose that). They said they were visiting family in Delhi but would be back in the US before the start date. I asked to confirm their legality to work in the US and they confirmed what was in their application and added that they were a natural born American citizen.I asked about their experience at the US-based game studio. I asked some specifics about their internal processes that you would only know if you were actually working there as an engineer (they had an unusual source-control workflow). Candidate had no clue and made up some bullshit. I asked about their responsibilities on the team and who they reported to; more bullshit.Time to take the mask off.I told them I know they never worked at that studio. I told them I know they've never been to Austin. And I asked directly: what's your goal here? They tried to redirect, and doubled down on the bullshit, clearly not understanding that the scam was over. So I asked about the name on the application: Is that a real person? Did you steal their identity? Are they in on it like some sort of employment mule? They immediately dropped from the call.After the call, I hit up our legal department and asked them to see if the name on the application could be identified as a real person (possibly in Austin). Turns out the name was just uncommon enough and we had just enough PII that it did match a likely real person in Austin. Legal notified the Austin PD about the probable identity theft (or possibly an accomplice to fraud) and that was the last I heard about it.My theory is that the scammers get enough info about an American to secure a remote job with that identity (really they just need a name, DoB, and SSN). They rely on companies not verifying their education and employment history (which they make difficult using small and defunct companies). Then they spam every possible remote job listing hoping to overwhelm their recruiting pipeline and sneak someone through. I imagine they would do just enough to not get immediately fired and collect a paycheck while exfiltrating as much source code, data, and other assets of value as possible once they have access. I would be surprised if they didn't also try to plant ransomware or other malware to company systems or worse, customers.This was a few months ago, and I'm no longer at that company, but their current director has told me that the resume script is still working and hitting about a hundred resumes per posting, still only for remote roles.If you have this issue, look at the PDF metadata and it should be pretty obvious what pattern I'm talking about. My script was very simple using PyMuPDF to read metadata to identify and filter them.tldr: Got lots of similar, sketchy resumes for remote postings only. I investigated and actually spoke to one of them. It was a scam.",

I want to share what I learned over 10+ years that could save you from making the same mistakes I did.The Reality Check:When I started, I thought being a good developer meant:\\- Memorising every framework and language\\- Writing perfect code from day one\\- Working insane hours to \"prove myself\"\\- Never admitting I didn't know somethingAll of this was wrong and held me back for years.What Actually Matters:For Job Applications:You don't need to meet 100% of job requirements. I got interviews, meeting 60-70% of the requirements. Companies hire for potential and problem-solving ability, not just current skills.For Learning:Stop trying to learn everything. Focus on core concepts (data structures, algorithms, design patterns) and learn specific technologies as you need them. The best skill is learning how to learn quickly.For Career Growth:You'll never feel \"ready\" for the next level. I spent 2 years over-preparing for senior roles I was already qualified for. Apply anyway, volunteer for challenging projects anyway, give that tech talk anyway.For Productivity:Working 45 focused hours produces better results than 70 exhausted hours. Burnout isn't a badge of honour, it's a career killer. Take breaks, have hobbies, maintain relationships outside tech.For Code Quality:Nobody cares about your clever algorithms. They care about solutions that work and code that's maintainable. Write for the human who will read your code at 2 AM during an outage.I've written a comprehensive blog post with detailed examples and actionable advice for each of these points: [https://medium.com/@pcodesdev/10-years-of-programming-hard-earned-coding-lessons-to-save-you-a-decade-of-mistakes-d63fd848e62e?sk=5bad34c41e6426a28387e89f4e1f5412](https://medium.com/@pcodesdev/10-years-of-programming-hard-earned-coding-lessons-to-save-you-a-decade-of-mistakes-d63fd848e62e?sk=5bad34c41e6426a28387e89f4e1f5412)Current developers: What do you wish you'd known earlier?Job seekers: Which of these resonates most with your current struggles?",

HAF had earlier tried to intervene in the Cisco case but was denied by California state courtsFour key outcomesThe court’s 31-page judgement outlined four major outcomes:> Affirmation of state authority: The CRD has the constitutional right to enforce anti-discrimination laws, including against caste-based discrimination.> Legitimacy of CRD actions: The lawsuit against Cisco Systems, a major California tech firm, was found to be a legitimate public enforcement action, not a private legal dispute.> Rejection of religious freedom argument: The court ruled that the CRD’s enforcement did not violate any First Amendment rights of Hindu Americans, dismissing the argument as “entirely unpersuasive.”> No standing for HAF: The court held that HAF does not represent all Hindu Americans and failed to show concrete links to the broader community. “Plaintiffs have shown no facts demonstrating actual activities, engagement, or funding mechanisms,” the judge wrote.https://www.thenewsminute.com/news/us-federal-court-backs-californias-fight-against-caste-discrimination",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Lately, I have been seeing a lot of posts around how engineers feel burnt out, stuck, or afraid AI will take their jobs.I can relate to this as well because not too long ago, I myself was that engineer who did good work like just working really hard, doing as many tickets as fast as I can, working overtime or on weekends, etc., but still felt completely invisible. Being introverted, I’d also join meetings, and just mostly stay quiet and never really contribute much. Honestly, it made me question if I’d ever stand out in any way.What surprised me was that things started changing not when I worked harder, but when I worked differently. I began focusing on things like communicating my work so people could actually see the impact, building trust and alignment with teammates, finding small ways to speak up and make my contributions more visible, etc.That shift made a huge difference. I actually started working less, got a better work-life balance, and finally started getting the recognition I wanted. Also made me realize that promotions and opportunities ended up coming as a side effect of that shift, not because I was grinding harder.I know it’s tough because “just do more tickets” feels like the safe path, but in my experience, it rarely leads to visibility. For me, changing how I worked gave me both better career growth and more fulfillment in the job.Curious if anyone else has felt the same? Do you feel like you’re in the grind stage, or have you found other ways to break out of burnout?",

        "content": "I work at a tech company in London, UK, and we recently opened up a junior developer position, which we posted online. Within minutes, applications started pouring in, tens of them right away, and within just two hours, we had hundreds. The applicants ranged from those with a couple of years of experience to developers with over 10 years in the UK tech industry.This really highlights how competitive the tech job market has become. It feels like there’s a growing imbalance, far more developers than available positions. I don't recall this situation in the old hires. With new graduates entering the field each year, it’s unlikely the situation will improve anytime soon.If you're job hunting, my best advice is to find a way to stand out. Do something that helps your application rise above the noise, because often the hardest part is simply getting your CV seen by a recruiter in a sea of hundreds.**Update** : I've previously received some questions about the role and would like to clarify a few things. I will not be able answer all questions but I would like answer some of them here;\\- The role is not a remote job, it's a hybrid role based in London Office.\\- We required right to work in the UK and no sponsorships.\\- The majority of applicants are based in UK with some exceptions of South Asian (India, Pakistan etc.), African (Nigeria, South Africa etc.) and North American (Canada and US) applicants in 10s.\\- We posted on multiple platforms like Indeed, LinkedIn and company website.\\- The whole process is overwhelming as human review will take quite some time to process all the applicants unless we switch to AI based CV reading tools.\\- The number of applicants surpassed a few hundred in the first few hours, and 1,000+ by the end of the first day of the job posting.\\- The salary is inline with average junior salaries in the UK which is between £30k to £40k.\\- There are a lot of uk based mid and senior engineers who apply, which shows stagnant job market which once only affected juniors, now clearly started to hit mid and senior levels too.\\- Additionally this is my burner/junk account, not my main account. I don't want to risk my job by making myself and my company identifiable, which could easily happen if I posted from my main account. I made sure, obviously, not to be the person who shares the company’s internal recruitment information on the internet.\\- Also I want to clarify that I craft and rephrase my paragraphs using ChatGPT and Grammarly, which is quite standard practice in this day and age.\\- If you have more questions feel free to reach me out via chat, I can't promise a response to all messages, but I will do my best.

I know the job market is ultra-competitive right now but it's still my responsibility to work with what I have, and I haven't been.I realized during the five years I've studied Computer Science that even though I love video-games and thought robotics was alright (I did robotics programming in highschool & during my senior project, mentored by AmazonRobotics), I have no confidence in programming, and frankly, problem-solving in general. Everything is so reliant on connecting/social engineering now that my anti-social ass hasn't been doing. My parents have gotten people from my church and extended family, to give advice to me and frankly I've mostly been ignoring them when they repeat the same stuff I've been hearing for a while now. I apply to X position a family/family friend tells me to apply to, I get rejected/ghosted, repeat ad-nauseam until I stopped applying months down the line out of frustration, lying to them saying \"yeah I applied to plenty of places\". Confidence is at an all-time low.Today my mom yells at me on how much I've been freeloading and threatens to kick me out, and I couldn't talk back at her because I know she's right. **For the short-term,** I have $2,700 in my bank account, pretty much nothing to live on my own for. I hate being around my family but really want a remote position to show to my parents ASAP, so I don't get the boot. At this point I don't care what field it is, it doesn't have to be CS/programming--I really want to get a remote job in SOMETHING I can tolerate, in the next couple weeks or so while I try and gather my bearings for my future, or else I am likely getting kicked out. Preferably something that doesn't get too in the way of me studying for certs.**For the long-term,** If it helps, again, I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science, a AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification, and am currently studying for the CompTIA A+ certification because I figured maybe I can try the IT space if I hate programming so much (already paid for a voucher, planning to take the exam in \\~2 weeks). Unfortunately had no real work experience/internships in the Comp. Sci. field as I was too busy just trying not to drop out; took me 5 years to graduate. I've worked Doordash for a couple months using the family car, until my parents forbade me from doing so (for asinine reasons but it's their car so I can't talk back). I thought I was passionate in programming, I'm not. I have pretty much no passion in anything except games and anime, both industries sound awful to actually work in. Last week I started brainstorming a Unity game since I randomly thought it would be nice to work on something, anything, and put it on GitHub. **I'm well-aware that my story is not rare. Again, this is my fault. I've been too passive, and arrogant. But today I might as well ask for advice, both for the short and long-term. Thank you.**",

I chose the longer path, a Computer Science degree, which meant an additional year of prerequisite coursework before I could even begin.I finally graduated in 2022, just as the tech job market began its downward spiral. Over the next few years, I managed only a handful of interviews. To stay in the game, I took on low-paying part-time contract work to build real-world experience, and I went to meetups to network and keep learning.Fast forward to today. I’ve just landed my first full-time role as a Backend Engineer in a mid-cost-of-living area, earning a decent starting wage for that area. It may not be the biggest salary, but to me, it represents something much greater, a milestone I’ve been working toward for years.My biggest takeaway: don’t give up.

Is it bad rn? maybe, idk I'm too young to know how was it back then. scrolling on reddit at this point is mostly just... desperation porn.For me as a student, I've decided to focus only on my data science studies and stop worrying about the \"latest career tips\" and \"The Perfect Roadmap\" and just do the thing that I'm supposed to do, study. I don't have to make a plan for my career or know how it's gonna be for me, I'm just gonna do the best chess move for me rn which is learning. \\*sigh\\* it's hard to mention the job market here without getting downvoted, at least this is my opinion. I would love to hear yours",

What I see instead is this sense of, “I’m better than you because you don’t know X, and I do”. It’s like people are just waiting, frothing at the mouth for their chance to elevate themselves over another person, instead of just helping that person learn, or at the very least not shaming and degrading them for not knowing something. The reality is that many things are easily teachable and once you get it, you get it. Most people can learn if the information is presented to them in the right way. So why isn’t that approach adopted in today’s working world, to build happier, healthier teams? What is with all the elitism? Don’t these people realize that the second someone else knows more than they do, that person is then considered “better” by the rules of this stupid game? And what’s the solution there - to keep rabidly trying to outdo everyone around you? It’s just not viable.",

I kinda fell in love with this discipline since it blended technical expertise with human factors. It also seemed to be of very practical application as the projects always ended in some kind of testable prototype.However, I noticed it's probably the CS domain with fewer jobs, and the ones which exist, separate the \"computer\" skills from the \"human\" skills into different roles, killing what makes this specialization interesting in the first place. I also noticed it's not considered an attractive discipline amongst my CS peers.In your opinion, what makes HCI feel so 'singled out', as a CS field? And why does it fail to get market traction?",

        "content": "I had a task to make a button component in a shared library as part of a larger initiative. However, in this initiative, there was a ticket which was for making “design tokens”. I read through it, and it detailed we’d have design tokens for broad things like “primary color” and “accent color”. However, it also stated that individual components would have their own design tokens, so if it was a button, it might have “button primary color”. I brought this up to my manager, that I’m not sure if I should be working on the button because it seems dependent on this other ticket. I think there was a whole lot of misunderstandings, but she kinda seemed to get pretty hostile about itI guess I noticed that I really wasn’t getting anywhere with this conversation and everything I said seemed to make her even more angry. She threatened to put me on PIP at least once during this conversation, which I felt was unmerited, so I disengaged entirely and went to my previous manager. My previous manager is super chill so I was hoping we could just resolve it somehow. She set up a meeting with my skip. I just simply told him the exact situation, kinda in an emotionless, anodyne way. He seemed very receptive to it, surprisingly. He brought up that my manager had negative feedback about me “not following processes”, which we had a long conversation about, and he seemed much more “on my side” than I thought he would be. From my manager’s feedback, you’d think I’m doing everything wrong — but the skip was like “yeah it’s a new thing everyone is adjusting to. You’re fine”. I think this did get my manager in trouble, thoughI never did get an answer on the design tokens thing, but I was told to start work on the button. At first I made the button following the design tokens as the document stated, but I was told to remove this. No problem, AI was quickly able to resolve that. But then she started nitpicking pretty much every, insignificant detail. Mind you, this is really just a `` with some tailwind classes applied, with 100% unit test coverage. Specifically, she goes after the storybook (which is just a preview for the components), and constantly changes her mind there. “It should be like this” then I’ll submit it and she’ll be like “no I changed my mind make it like this”. They’re not things I would know as a developer, they’re just subjective preferences like “I want this story to be called (whatever) instead”. I find it all kinda odd, cause there are controls on storybook that let you change the preview. You can configure it to show whatever button you want using thoseI also have another ongoing PR for another component. Same thing here, she nitpicks it to death, especially the storybook. It feels like she always has a new thing to add or remove, which at some point just feels entirely unproductive, so I wonder why she’s doing it as my manager if it would reflect poorly on her. Like, even I think this is a waste of everyone’s time at this point, so I get suspiciousThen going back to the other one that originally used design tokens, she insists that I remove a css file that we would use for the design tokens in the future. This is a bit more complex than you’d think because it requires changing the build around and the exports in the package.json and I’m _pretty sure_ it might break tailwind when used in an app. I told her that I don’t think this is a good idea cause we’ll just have to revert it in the future, but she absolutely insists that we must do this. I actually feel kinda uncomfortable with it. I’m essentially making extra work for future me, for no gain and a potential bugAll this time I notice that she said I would have to ship this button this week _and_ replace all instances of the button in 3 apps. I still think she’s mad about the meeting with the skip manager we had. I really don’t wanna go to him again, but I’m concerned that she’s just trying to justify letting me go by making it impossible for me to get my work done. What should I do?",

If you want to filter people out, can't you just do it the easy way?I'm tempted to create an open-source list of trash companies that don't respect applicants' time. Likewise, I don't care how prestigious you are - you're a TRASH company to me if you show no respect for applicants' time.\\--- UpdateI might not have explained myself clearly and caused some confusion based on the comments I received. Think about two different recruiting workflows:1. AI screening -> manual screening -> applicant completes the OA -> interview process...2. Applicant completes the OA -> AI screening -> manual screening -> interview process...The second approach doesn't make any sense, unless the screening algorithm gives the OA result high weight/priority (even so you can still apply AI screening without OA before the OA). It's a huge waste of applicants' time as they could have been rejected in the first place instead of wasting huge amount of time and energy grinding down the OA tasks. However, AFAIK, it feels like a bunch of companies have implemented their workflow as #2. Why on earth is this? Feel free to correct me if my speculation is wrong.",

I want to upgrade and sharpen my skills as a dev and improve my resume at the same time, my resume since my current work is not anything too special to highlight. But I am confused on what direction I need to take in order to improve as a mid level to senior level developer. I don’t think building some boilerplate projects like a to do list or a note taking app would be helpful for my skills or resume, since I am not at entry level(though I doubt if it even works for them these days). Nor would leetcode. I do study system design on the side, which might help me if I get some interesting work or while interviewing, but it does not help in strengthening my resume. What should I do then in order to get noticed more for opportunities while also improving my skills? Some people have advised to build software projects to solve problems that I personally face and not some common course project. But I am completely out of ideas and inspiration to solve any issues that I might face. I can’t think of any problem that I need to desperately solve by building an app. What else should I do?

I'd take a bit of time each week to dig into the technologies I was using at work to try and find non-functional areas we could improve in as I was grinding out functional stuff. over time this built up to an okay understanding of the SDLC overall.there are plenty of areas I'm still not very strong, but at this point I have enough experience with enough different things that its relatively uncommon i encounter problems totally out of band from what I've seen before, and have a fairly decent understanding of many of the popular technologies used today across a wide span of problems. Ive worked in a lot of different domains over my career. ive generally left most of the parsing of those domains to domain experts. sure, I'd pick up things here or there, enough exposure to particular verticals will do that, but I generally focused my time and energy on developing my tech knowledge, as it is more portable between jobs than domain specific stuff.that said, I can now see the limits of this approach. I've been working in the same shop now for four years and I wish I had spent a little bit of time each week better learning the domain I am working in from first principles. I dont feel like I am lacking in technical ability. I have enough technical tools at my disposal. I feel I am lacking in domain specific insight, and so are the others surrounding me. If i had been studying my current domain a little bit more here and there over the past 4 years, I suspect I wouldn't feel this way. I suspect I would be able to crack some of the tough nut problems we've been dealing with sensibly.looking back, there were plenty of times in past roles where I wasnt able to see the forest for the trees as a result of a little too much domain blindness & outsourcing of that knowledge to others who perhaps didn't know the domain all that well either.anyways, the advice I wish I had gotten was to carve out a bit of time for myself to learn the domain I was working in outside of the context of tech and programming. SWE skills are important, and most of the time we can learn the bits and pieces of a domain we need at the time, but some insights are locked behind both a general understanding of the tech and the domain.",

I'm running low on savings and getting desperate. Honestly, I don't even know if I'm looking for jobs the right way or if I'm missing something obvious about the process. Edit: I use LinkedIn and Glassdoor, I suck at socializing and barely have a network.

I don't enjoy watching youtube videos or reading about computer science, I don't really care about learning some new coding language and only learned the ones I currently know because it was required for the major, algorithms and the math of it don't really interest me, and I don't really have any side projects that interest me enough to code it.Maybe I just haven't found the right area of computer science that'll eventually hook me or maybe all my friends are just outliers and their passion isn't the norm, but I feel a little stuck as I'm trying to force myself to find something enjoyable about it, but besides the pay nothing else sticks out. I'm assuming the typical FAANG and SWE jobs are similar to the projects and assignments we did for my major, and if they are I just don't know if I can find myself doing that as a 9-5 for years of my life even if the pay is good.So I guess my question is, how do you know when computer science as a career just isn't for you? At what point do you just shift to something else?",

I was moved from Dev to QA Automation. Still within the same tree. But now after 2 months on the new team, I am being told, my velocity is too slow, I need too much help, im stuck on simplistic things, etc. and because of that, they are now placing me on a PIP. I AM and STILL am not fully finished with their awful “TRAINING” for the new team, which is no help.On my other team I did great. I delivered several projects and a huge rework for our MAIN web app.I also had a separate meeting about my PIP where I express my concerns. My boss explained to me she MOVED me onto this team because it’s a dumpster fire. She told me “they don’t know write and deliver code, there needs to be guidance for the QA”. Etc. ALSO these people when they write commits write the most bare minimum simple messages. What I am trying to get at is I was transferred to a UNSTRUCTURED AWFUL SPAGHETTI CODE REPO.My boss said oh you can do this, don’t worry. We need to see growth here, velocity increase here, and make sure you do all the trainings etc… but there is no growth at this company. No promotions. No motivation.So what are my options? First, is this PIP even allowed after a transfer so short?Secondly I feel im being mistreated, is there a path I can go towards?Thirdly I’d even go as far as taking SHORT TERM DISABILITY and riding on their money. If anyone has advice on this im curious.",

        "author": "omunaman",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi Reddit, I need some outside perspective on a situation at my remote project that's making me extremely uncomfortable.I'm 16 and working on a tech/coding project with people from all over the world. One of my collaborators is a much older man (I think 40s) from another country(japan).How it started: Initially, everything was great and super professional. We communicated on Discord. He would compliment my work, like \"Good job on that template,\" which felt nice and motivating. He was very polite about scheduling meetings across our different time zones.**When things started to feel weird:** After a few days, he learned my age during a call. After that, the dynamic slowly started to change.1. He suggested we move our conversation from the public Discord to WhatsApp and shared his personal number.2. His compliments started shifting from my work to me as a person.3. He found out I was interested in some media from his country (like anime/manga) and offered to teach me his language one-on-one.4. He started talking about me potentially working in his country in the future and asked if I was interested.**The part that is freaking me out now:** Last night, the conversation escalated quickly. I asked for his LinkedIn to learn more about his professional background. He sent it, then immediately followed up by saying if I ever came to his country, he would \"show me around.\"Then he sent these messages back-to-back: \"You are such a kind person.\" \"You are a genius.\" \"I'm serious.\"This is where my internal alarms went off like crazy. It felt like a switch flipped from \"polite colleague\" to something intense and personal. It feels like he's trying to build some kind of deep emotional bond, and the \"I'm serious\" part felt like he was pressuring me to accept the compliments.**My question for you:** Am I overreacting? Is this just a case of \"super politeness\" from a different culture, or is this classic grooming/love-bombing behavior? My gut is screaming that this is wrong, but my logical brain keeps trying to find excuses like \"maybe he's just being nice.\"What do you think is happening here, and more importantly, what is the safest and most professional way to handle this and create distance?**TL;DR:** I'm 16, my much older male colleague moved our chat to WhatsApp, and his praise has escalated to \"you're a genius, I'm serious\" after inviting me to visit him in his country. I feel creeped out and don't know if I'm misreading politeness or if this is predatory. Need advice.",

My team went from data scientists to “AI engineers” building production software, and I’ve basically been pushed into leading a small AI software team despite having no real software dev background.I keep telling leadership that software engineering and data science are very different skill sets, but it doesn’t matter — they expect me to lead, teach, and deliver. The stress has been brutal and I’m burnt out.I’ve been applying to data science roles since April (remote, similar pay to my current salary) but haven’t had much luck. My network is mostly engineers, so not super helpful for data roles. I feel like if I lowered my salary expectations I’d probably land something sooner, but I’d be taking a pay cut.Meanwhile, my company is shaky financially — they’ve already had a few rounds of layoffs and I’d guess they’ve got maybe a year or two of runway left. Part of me wonders if I should just coast, stop caring so much, and wait to be laid off while applying to better jobs. The other part of me feels like I should just cut my losses now and more aggressively seek a lower-paying but more sustainable role.What would you do?",

        "content": "Hello everyone,I'm feeling stuck in my career and don't know what my next move is. I have been working in tech support since 2019, primary in the web-hosting space. While it's always been a grind with the nonstop chats/calls/tickets, I legitimately enjoyed it at first for the first two years or so. My first company was awesome. They are one of the best web hosts to work for. I was a level 2 tech and a top performer, easily knocking out 80+ chats a day. My manager would constantly tell me how good of a job I was doing. Despite that, I struggled to afford living in the city the company was based in. I eventually asked for a raise and was offered a one thousand dollar per YEAR raise. It wasn't sustainable to keep waiting around for an actual raise, so I quit very shortly after that to move to a major cloud computing company as a cloud support engineer. I ended up hating that company almost immediately because of their lack of training, vague protocols, poor documentation and how they clearly viewed their support department as an after thought. Only 2 or 3 months out of training, they laid off 10% of their staff including me.I've since landed a different job at another web host as a support manager. I thought I would enjoy this role but truth be told I absolutely despise my job and my company. I feel that my work is meaningless and repetitive. The agents under me are basically un-coachable and uninspired. The tech debt is immense. The higher ups are too focused on pushing out half baked products that barely work. Our back end infrastructure is a nightmare. I spend most of my time troubleshooting stuff that should have been fixed years ago, yet engineering has no plans of doing so. Essentially, I'm stuck in support hell.I really like working with computers but the past three years have left me feeling so drained that I hardly have the energy to upskill and find a better, non-customer facing role. I don't like working in tech support and I don't like working in tech support management. I constantly think about working on certs to get a job as an SRE or DevOps engineer, but I'm worried that I'd find myself in the same position of not finding any satisfaction in it. Plus the tech market is so competitive now that I feel like I don't know where to even start. I'm left with the question of \"do I want to leave the tech world or do I just hate working in support?\"Has anyone else broken out of support hell into a more technical, non customer facing role? What did it take? Did it reshape your opinion of your work? Do you find it more fulfilling?",

Not complaining, just genuinely curious and lost right now as im sure many of us are.",

        "content": "\\[Senior DevOps Engineer, 17 YOE\\]Hi. I'm at a crossroads in my life and I don't know what to do. I'm terrified and fearless at the same time.I'm 46 years old and so tired. Not just from work but tired in a way that's way deeper. A life of illness, stress, chaos, C-PTSD and then when I finally got back on my feet again - four more years of illness, cancer, surgeries. My body is scarred and worn down, even as my brain still wanting more of something. It's exhausting being in a brain that still dreams, in a body that can't keep up. No friends, no one to love. Just me.At work, I tried to find meaning by stepping up. Looking at the bigger picture, connecting people, fighting for the things that make engineering great - systems that work, accountability, sustainability. What I really want to do is to bridge gaps, to build something... with joy. I'm operating at the Staff Engineer level alone - because no-one else is - and it's like threading mud in minus 20 degrees. Reality is fcking brutal and is weighing me down; it's eating away at my core values and taking all the fun out of my life.While management has fantastically supported me during my illness, they also lack true leadership. Fourteen years after starting the company the structure and behaviors are still stuck in start-up mode and often ends up looking for simple solutions to complex problems - or hope they will go away by themselves. The inertia is frustrating like... fck!!! Then there is the \"senior founder dev\" who only cares about code, knows he is untouchable, makes everything harder, belittles others, poisons the culture. And the colleagues I love and respect; the ones I thought could carry this with me, I can feel them pulling away, finding their own exits.It has left me doubting; if that is the right word... what am I even holding onto? What the hell am I doing? What is the point??? :( I've lost joy in the work, but I still have passion when I can help people become better. My values haven't changed, but I have to push them aside every day, compromise after compromise, and that has slowly eroded my self-confidence and self-worth. I still want to work with smart, passionate people, to build something that matters - a product, a service, something that makes life a little bit better for someone else. I really do care about things running well. I care about people. But instead of feeling part of that, I feel stuck. I keep falling behind in technology while I fight my body (that tend to just shut down for three hours after lunch time). I'm trying to \"catch up\" and but I never quite get there...And outside of all this what I really crave is something... simpler and slower, I just don't know what. A house in the countryside maybe. A place that feels like home. Work that connects to who I am, not just what I can grind out. Maybe I should move back north and try to reconnect with my old friends and just do something outside of tech?What I don't know is how to get there without breaking more pieces of myself in the process. How to leave without bitterness and to stop running on fumes and start moving toward something I can actually love again.*tldr; my life isn't perfect, but I'm still here fighting - but there is no joy left and I've lost myself.**PS. English is my secondary language and I closed my Grammarly account so apologize if the text is messy.*",

My ideal route would be to complete my bachelors with a specialization in ML and then get a masters in ML. It’s a field I have been interested in since I can remember but I’m having doubts as to the career prospects both out of my bachelors and after my masters. The Canadian job bank in my area has categorized CS as having a “good” job outlook meaning there’s expected growth in the market. I also checked the statistics for CS in California and I was met with a similar outlook despite everything online saying the market is oversaturated and to pivot while you still can. Is this just anecdotal vs statistical evidence or is there something of note there?It would suck to give up on CS as I genuinely enjoy it but would it be wise to pivot into something else while I still can? If so what would have good prospects? If I continue with CS how would I go about breaking into the industry with a seemingly disappearing entry point? Are internships my only hope?CS has kind of been my only plan as it’s what my father does and what I’ve grown up around.",

        "content": "I’ve been working with a client for the past 7 years. The pay is decent and there used to be a fair amount of flexibility, but there’s always this constant rush to deploy things.Two years ago, two new devs joined the team. The client is the CEO of the company, not very technical, but he often pushes “shortcuts” to speed up development. Usually they’re hacky and add technical debt. Because he messages devs individually instead of going through a single point of contact which should be one of the devs that can convert his request into a technical solution, the result is a messy codebase where people step on each other’s toes. One of the newer devs is inexperienced and sometimes pushes changes that break other people’s work. I do code reviews on his work whenever we have time, but those are happening in a rush because I always have something that I need to deploy myself asap.On top of that, there’s never enough time to write clean code. Almost everything is for a demo or “needs to be deployed ASAP.” We start working on big changes on reporting a week before the end of the month, with the target of having it ready at the beginning of the next month. We end up doing daily production deployments on a fairly large app. This app is used by big company clients' employees, the entire marketing team which is the main activity of the company, and even manages customer relationships, so it’s not a toy project.My concern is that after 7 years, I don’t feel like I’ve gained much real experience because of the constant rush and hacky workarounds. For context, I’m a full stack developer with 14 years' experience.Is this normal? Or am I just stuck in a dysfunctional setup that’s holding me back?",

Now, it seems as if you meet every bullet point, you're still not the ideal candidate unless you have a lot more.

Do you know Angular?\" Even saying yes, they didn't ask me any questions to demonstrate that I knew it. So, the reason I haven't been applying much is that because when I finally do get an interview, I either nailed it and still get rejected for silly reasons, or I didn't get anything out of it, and with all that time of preparation and then the interview, I could have made 400 dollars driving Uber instead, so it's not really me being negative and thinking nothing is worth it, but more that interviews have become too much of a time investment with no return on it of either getting the job or getting more relevant interview practice. A bit about my background, I worked with Cognizant for 2 years mostly on the bench and on projects they ended up offshoring before any relevant experience and one job I got with an airline company, a month in they decided to disband the team because there wasn't enough work to be done and they just combined the services to other teams because we were spending several hours per day doing almost nothing.I don't feel I've ever been given a chance on any of my consulting projects as they seemed to only be using me as a contractor for a possible project not set in stone and ended up releasing me after budget cuts or offshoring. So, at interviews, I know the programming languages, many of the challenges, and how to answer questions about how frameworks and APIs work, but they only ask about what projects I did and then agile related questions and nothing about coding, so I've not been finding any reason to take more interviews. Does anyone else feel the same way, or am I being ridiculous and a negativity spreader?",

At first I thought it’s a no brainer to take the job, any income is better than no income, right? But as I’m thinking about it more, I’m not sure if this could put me in a worse position down the line.1. The job keeps emphasizing its fast paced environment and long hours and I think I’m likely to burn out and be miserable in that kind of role. 2. I currently have close to zero living costs staying with parents. This job would require me to move to SF and I’m worried startup instability could leave me unemployed again in a couple months but now also locked into a pricy lease.3. My real goals are to transition away from the tech industry & start building revenue generating projects now for the long term. But till that happens I do need income and structure. At a slower moving corporation this would be easy to do in the evenings but not when I am working 12 hr days in this startup.My logical mind is saying take any job I can to get a foothold back in the SWE industry, try to survive, and pivot to a better job when the market hopefully gets better down the line. My gut says this is the wrong decision for me that brings its own risks. WWYD?",

He then said he'll send an assessment for me to complete and I said I'll do it (this is for a tech job, similar to my current one but it seemed to be a tad better). I had that random burst of inspiration so at the time I was going to do it. However I got busy, work had a lot of tasks for me to do, and I couldn't find the time. He even followed up after the assessment expired 2 weeks later and said to let him know if I'd like it renewed, or no longer interested.I'm very bad with replying to messages, because I get a lot, and I usually prioritize ones from my immediate circle. I'm also pretty disorganized so I was going to respond, but the days passed by am I didn't. Now it's been 2 weeks and I basically ghosted him, not telling him I'm not interested (I wanted to interview anyway just to see if I could have the option, but I probably wouldn't take it because I got good feedback at work so my confidence in my company is renewed for now).I feel really bad! Should I message him now, saying I'm so sorry for ghosting and I meant to reply but lost track of time?? I also don't want to be blacklisted from that company and would like the option to resume the recruitment process for this role if things at my job change.",

I don’t find software particularly fun, and I don’t see myself doing this long term. It was the only job I could get with my skill set at that point of time. I’ve always found ML to be really cool and I’ve done a research internship in this field. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to get any ML engineer or data scientist jobs right out of undergrad (they wouldn’t even interview me). I suspect the lack of a graduate degree to be the reason, and many job postings I find interesting ask for or prefer one. How can I pivot to a more quantitative role from SWE. If I continue working as a SWE I’m afraid I will be stuck. I’ve been contemplating going back for a Masters but a few things irk me:1. I don’t want to pay 5 figures for a masters, and funded masters often ask for TA and research experience, which I lack. I did go to a competitive school so maybe my GPA can be contextualized — hard to say though. I am in state for Texas, and I could potentially pay for TAMU or UT for a semester and gamble on getting a TA position.2. Opportunity cost. Say I do get a masters, there’s no guarantee I will get a job in ML, and I would end up working as a SWE anyway. Minus 2 years of comp3. There’s millions of MS CS grads in the market and I would be competing with them for jobs in an already shaky market.Anyone who’s been through this song and dance want to chime in? In my company moving internally to a research role is very rare so that’s not possible. I really enjoyed my ML research and coursework, and I am open to working for a university lab as a researcher, as a pathway for a PhD. The lab I interned at has changed direction and focuses more on computational biology, the ML project was a one off I guess. So there’s no going back to that. My long term goal is doing applied ML at a company or in academia. This is highly coveted and competitive, so any input would be appreciated.",

The first interview was behavioral, which was amazing because that lessened SO MUCH PRESSURE, but now I'm concerned about the second interview!I was studying data structures & algorithms; seemed to be the thing I forgot the most of, and will most likely continue studying it to get it back in my head, but I keep having small hiccups. One main problem I am noticing is my organizational skills regarding programming. Don't get me wrong, I know how to code, but by the time VSC or PyCharm is opened in front of me, I blank on where to start. A great example of this is when I'm writing code, I'm mainly using ChatGPT to get the baseline, then modify it from there, or look at examples and modify it to my liking. Is there any methods I should be doing? Finally, is there anything that I definitely need to remember? It's been a while and was just wondering for a great place to start again, back to basics for a refresher if that's the case? Any help is greatly appreciated. I truly wish to succeed with this job interview and I'm nervous that I'm going to fail. Thank you, From a Grad Student who's never been in the Software Developer field and lost some knowledge on programming <3",

        "content": "I’m a Spring Boot / Java backend developer, and I’m at a bit of a career crossroads.Right now, I see two clear paths for upskilling:1. Learn GenAI / LLM-related development (prompt engineering, integrating LLMs into applications, fine-tuning, vector databases, RAG, etc.)2. Double down on my existing backend/dev skills – improve depth in Java/Spring Boot, testing, microservices, system design, cloud-native concepts, Kubernetes, DevOps pipelines, observability, and scaling distributed systems.Here’s my situation:* I’m not really interested in GenAI at the moment. It feels like a hype-driven bubble, and I don’t want to learn a stack just because it’s trendy.* My main focus has been building solid, scalable backend systems, and I enjoy working in that space.* I don’t mind picking up GenAI *if it becomes unavoidable in backend roles*, but I don’t want to spread myself too thin. To be clear:* I am not the type of person who chases the latest tech hype unless it directly benefits my day-to-day work.* Even though I am interested in GenAI personally, right now what I want to focus more on is being employable and relevant in the upcoming years as a Java backend developer.* I am also focusing on a specific side-hustle which I want to turn around into a full time business in the future, so I don't have the time to pursue/learn something new from the scratch unless it is absolutely necessary.My questions are:* Will I be missing out on backend job opportunities now (or in the next few years) if I don’t learn GenAI?* Is GenAI integration actually becoming a *must-have* skill for Java/Spring Boot developers, or is it still more of a niche?* From a long-term career perspective (5+ years), would I be better off becoming a stronger backend engineer with deep cloud/microservices/devops skills, or should I invest in GenAI sooner rather than later?* For those of you working in the industry — are companies actually *expecting* backend developers to know GenAI, or is it more of a nice-to-have skill for specific roles/domains?I’d love to hear from people in the industry (especially those hiring or working on enterprise systems). Is the future of backend development leaning toward “every backend dev should know AI/LLM integration,” or will strong fundamentals in backend + cloud still carry the most weight ?",

They are asking me to meet with hiring managers etc.**Issue 1: Should I be considering this job with <1 yoe?*** The new job is better paying (by about 20k looking at base, and 60k if I expect their stock to have any value anytime soon).* Has better benefits (free food, better RTO policy)* Has less name recognition and isn't in an interesting field, IMO* Looks like it may have better WLB than my better gig, but not by much, and the startup does have busy oncalls For reference, I'm... mostly happy with my current gig - it is very busy, but I am learning a good amount, have a good team and feel like I'm on path to get promoted by next year. The product I'm working on is somewhat interesting, but still better than what I would work on at this new startup. I am worried about layoffs in my current company (there has been some chatter about it happening next year) but nothing has happened yet, so I can't really make a decision on that. Another consideration is I'm on an open work visa, so though I can easily switch companies right now, sticking to my current big company may be safer later on if I need immigration support.**Issue 2: If I say no, how do I say no?**IDEALLY I would like to be on good terms with this company in case things turn south and I NEED to switch companies. I'm not sure what excuse to give here - I decided to stay because of promotions? Make up a raise or some other reasons? Also, if I want to say no, I should say no NOW before meeting with the hiring managers, right? I think meeting up with HMs with no intention of joining is a bit too much, and I don't want to waste their time (interviews I don't mind because they probably do a ton of them anyway).Thoughts?",
