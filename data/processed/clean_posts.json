        "content": "Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about how often companies use Spark by default — especially now that tools like Databricks make it so easy to spin up a cluster. But in many cases, the data volume isn’t that big, and the complexity doesn’t seem to justify all the overhead.There are now tools like DuckDB, Polars, and even pandas (with proper tuning) that can process hundreds of millions of rows in-memory on a single machine. They’re fast, simple to set up, and often much cheaper. Yet Spark remains the go-to option for a lot of teams, maybe just because “it scales” or because everyone’s already using it.So I’m wondering:•How big does your data actually need to be before Spark makes sense?•What should I really be asking myself before reaching for distributed processing?",

        "author": "ssinchenko",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I often hear the question of why Apache Spark is considered \"slow.\" Some attribute it to \"Java being slow,\" while others point to Spark’s supposedly outdated design. I disagree with both claims. I don’t think Spark is poorly designed, nor do I believe that using JVM languages is the root cause. In fact, I wouldn’t even say that Spark is truly slow.Because this question comes up so frequently, I wanted to explore the answer for myself first. In short, Spark is a unified engine, not just as a marketing term, but in practice. Its execution model is hybrid, combining both code generation and vectorization, with a fallback to iterative row processing in the Volcano style. On one hand, this enables Spark to handle streaming, semi-structured data, and well-structured tabular data, making it a truly unified engine. On the other hand, the No Free Lunch Theorem applies: you can't excel at everything. As a result, open-source Vanilla Spark will almost always be slower on DWH-like OLAP queries compared to specialized solutions like Snowflake or Trino, which rely on a purely vectorized execution model.This blog post is a compilation of my own Logseq notes from investigating the topic, reading scientific papers on the pros and cons of different execution models, diving into Spark's source code, and mapping all of this to Lakehouse workloads.Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with Databricks or its competitors in any way, but I use Spark in my daily work and maintain several OSS projects like GraphFrames and GraphAr that rely on Apache Spark. In my blog post, I have aimed to remain as neutral as possible.I’d be happy to hear any feedback on my post, and I hope you find it interesting to read!",

        "content": "\"Start right. Shift left.\"Is that just another marketing gimmick in data engineering?Here is my opinion after thinking about it for the last couple of weeks.I bet every data engineer who's ever been exposed to data quality has heard at least one of these two terms.The first time I heard “shift left” and “shift right,” it felt like an empty concept.Of course, I come from AI/ML, where pretty much everything is a marketing gimmick until proven otherwise. :face_with_tears_of_joy:And “start right, shift left” can really feel like nonsense. Especially when it's said without a practical explanation, a set of tools to do it, or even a reason why it makes sense. Now that I need to get better at data engineering, I’ve been thinking about this a lot. So...**Here is what I've come to understand about \"start right\" and \"shift left\".** (please correct if wrong). **Start right**Start right is about detection. It means spotting your first data quality issues at the far right end of your data pipeline. Usually called downstream.But not with traditional data quality tests. The idea is to do it in a scalable way. Something you can quickly set up across hundreds or thousands of tables and get results fast.Because nobody wants to set up manual checks for every single table.In practice, starting right means using data observability tools that rely on algorithms to pick up anomalies in your data quality metrics. It's about finding the unknowns.Once that’s done, it’s way easier to prioritize which tables need a manual check. That’s where “shift left” comes in. **Shift left**Shift left is about prevention. It's about stopping the issues you found earlier from happening again.You do that by moving to the left side of the pipeline (upstream) and setting up manual checks and data contracts.This is where engineers and business folks agree on what the data should always look like. What values are valid? What data types should we support? What filters should be in place? \\---By starting right and shifting left, we take a realistic and practical approach to data quality. Sure, you can add some basic checks early on. But no matter what, there will always be things we miss, issues that only show up downstream.Thankfully, ML isn’t just a gimmick. It can really help us notice what’s broken.",

        "author": "godz_ares",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey all,[https://github.com/RubelAhmed10082000/CragWeatherDatabase](https://github.com/RubelAhmed10082000/CragWeatherDatabase)I was wondering if anyone had any feedback and any recommendations to improve my code. I was especially wondering whether a DuckDB database was the right way to go. I am still learning and developing my understanding of ETL concepts. There's an explanation below but feel free to ignore if you don't want to read too much. **Explanation:**My project's goal is to allow rock climbers to better plan their outdoor climbing sessions based on which locations have the best weather (e.g. no precipitation, not too cold etc.).Currently I have the ETL pipeline sorted out.The rock climbing location Dataframe contains data such as the name of the location, the name of the routes, the difficulty of the routes as well as the safety grade where relevant. It also contains the type of rock (if known) and the type of climb.This data was scraped by a Redditor I met called u/AmbitiousTie, who gave a helping hand by scraping UKC, a very famous rock climbing website. I can't claim credit for this. I wrote some code to normalize and clean the Dataframe. Some changes I made was dropping some columns, changing the datatypes, removing nulls etc. Each row pertains to a singular route. With over 120,000 rows of data.I used the longitude and latitude of my climbing Dataframe as an argument for my Weather API call. I used OpenMeteo free tier API as it is extremely generous. Currently, the code only fetches weather data for only 50 climbing locations. But when the API is called without this limitation it has over 710,000 rows of data. While this does take a long time but I can use pagination on my endpoint to only call the weather data for the locations that is currently being seeing by the user at a single time..I used Great-Expectations to validate both Dataframe at both a schema, row and column level. I loaded both Dataframe into an in-memory DuckDB database, following the schema seen below (but without the dimDateTime table). Credit to u/No-Adhesiveness-6921 for recommending this schema. I used DuckDB because it was the easiest to use - I tried setting up a PostgreSQL database but ended up with errors and got frustrated.https://preview.redd.it/vkb85ebk7y6f1.png?width=661&format=png&auto=webp&s=38f13454a40df069957a5aaec7b2df111830c316I used Airflow to orchestrate the pipeline. The pipeline is run every day at 1AM to ensure the weather data is up to data. Currently the DAG involves one instance which encapsulates the entire ETL pipeline. However, I plan to modularize my DAGs in the future. I am just finding it hard to find a way to process Dataframe from one instance to another.Docker was used for virtualisation to get the Airflow to run.https://preview.redd.it/7rpquq7c8y6f1.png?width=1351&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c3720d0188006c25aabbf9931956bb63cf98637I also used pytest for both unit testing and features testing.**Next Steps:**I am planning on increasing the size of my climbing data. Maybe all the climbing locations in Europe, then the world. This will probably require Spark and some threading as well. I also want to create an endpoint and I am planning on learning FastAPI to do this but others have recommended Flask or Django**Challenges:**Docker - Docker is a pain in the ass to setup and is as close to black magic as I have come in my short coding journey.Great Expectations - I do not like this package. While flexible and having a great library of expectations, is is extremely cumbersome. I have to add expectations to a suite one by one. This will be a bottleneck in the future for sure. Also getting your data setup to be validated is convoluted. It also didn't play well with Airflow. I couldn't get the validation operator to work due to an import error. I also couldn't get data docs to work either. As a result I had to integrate validations directly into my ETL code and the user is forced to scour the .json file to find why a certain validation failed. I am actively searching for a replacement.",

To make it ***feel*** instant.We accidentally built an insanely fast rendering mechanism for large tables. I found it to be so fast that I was curious to see how much I could throw at it...So I shoved in 100 million rows (and 16 columns) of test data...The results... well... even surprised me...[100 million rows preview](https://reddit.com/link/1lb13ep/video/yeivgrn7wt6f1/player)*This is a development build, which is not available yet, but wanted show here first...*Once the data loaded (which did take some time) the scrolling performance was buttery smooth. My MacBook's display is 120hz and you cannot feel any slowdown. No lag, super smooth scrolling, and instant calculations if you add a custom column.For those curious, the main thread latency for operations like deleting a column, or reordering were between **120µs-300µs**. So that means you hit the keyboard, and it's done. No waiting. Of course this is not for *every* operation, but for the common ones, it's extremely fast.Getting results for custom columns were **<30ms**, no matter where you were in the table. Any latency you see via ### is just a UI choice we made but will probably change it (it's kinda ugly). ***How did we do this?***This technique uses a combination of lazy loading, minimal memory copying, value caching, and GPU accelerated rendering of the cells. Plus some very special sauce I frankly don't want to share ;) To be clear, **this was not easy.**We also set out to ensure that we hit a roundtrip time of <33ms UI updates per distinct user action (other than scrolling). This is the threshold for feeling instant.We explicitly avoided the use of Javascript and other web technologies, because frankly they're entirely incapable of performance like this.***Could we do more?****Actually, yes.* I have some ideas to make the initial load time even faster, but still experimenting. ***Okay, but is looking at 100 million rows actually useful?***For a 100 million rows, honestly, probably not. But who knows ? I know that for smaller datasets, in 10s of millions, I've wanted the ability to look through all the rows to copy certain values, etc.In this case, it's kind of just a side-effect of a really well-built rendering architecture ;)If you wanted, and you had a really beefy computer, I'm sure you could do 500 million or more with the same performance. Maybe we'll do that someday (?)Let me know what you think. I was thinking about making a more technical write up for those curious...",

There are little guardrails and very little testing and it bothers me when I have to clean stuff up and show them how to fix it but the process I have in place wasn’t designed for so many ingestion workflows, automation workflows, different SQL objects and etc.I’ve been working for the past week on standardizing and switching to a full blown orchestrator, along with adding comprehensive tests and a blue green deployment so I can show the team before I switch it off, but I just feel like maybe I’m doing too much, but I feel as if I work on fixing stuff instead of providing value for much longer I’m going to want to explode!Edit:Rough high level overview of the current system is everything is managed by a YAML dsl which gets popped into CDKTF to generate terraform. The problem is CDKTF is awful at deploying data objects and if one slight thing changes it’s busted and requires normal Terraform repair.Obsevrability is in the gutter too, there are three systems, cloud, snowflake, and our Domo instance that needs to be connected and observed all in one graph, as debugging currently requires stepping through 3 pages to see where a job could’ve went wrong",

I also feel haunted by the time I lost — like I’ve wasted the past decade drifting.Anyone who’s made a pivot after years of feeling stuck — how did you decide? What worked for you?

        "content": "I am a data analyst mostly focused on business intelligence and data analysis. Know SQL, Python, Metabase (BI Tool).The company I work for hires a third-party software company that has built and maintains custom apps and software for us including POS (point-of-sale) and Inventory Management software. Additionally, they built us a customer facing mobile application (we're a restaurant group).They (the software company) uses a Mysql version 5.7 database which I understand reached end of life in 2023. This has caused some annoyances like not being able to use dbt or upgrade past version 0.47.9 of Metabase. Recently, I asked them if we can/should upgrade to Mysql 8 at some point and if there is anything we should worry about since version 5.7 reached end of life (like security, tech debt, etc.).Their response was \"It (5.7) is still widely used today and we don't need to worry about any vulnerabilities, we'll look into upgrading though\". Then after they \"looked into it\" they said it is best for us to stick with 5.7 for \"stability\". I am not a data or software engineer, but it SEEMS like what they really mean is \"It would be a lot of work for us to migrate everything over to version 8 and we don't want to deal with that\". I'm not saying it wouldn't be a lot of work, but my feeling is that using 5.7 is not as common as they try to make it out to be and they just don't want to deal with the upgrade and all that it entails.I'll say again, I know migrating over to 8 would likely take days/weeks/months(?) and is not just a \"click here to migrate and...done!\" kind of thing. The benefits may seem small - me being able to use things like ctes, window functions, the latest version of Metabase (which has some feature that would really benefit us) - but would nonetheless be a great improvement. 1) Is mysql 5.7 still that commonly used?2) Would most company's have already upgraded?3) Besides being an inconvenience, are there actual security issues to worry about if we don't upgrade?",

The whole platform becomes this brittle, fragile mess, and the whole thing ends up getting rebuilt.Synapse is a great example of this - I've worked with several clients in a row who built some crappy Rube Goldberg machine using Synapse pipelines and notebooks 4 years ago and now want to switch to Databricks because they spend 3-5x what they should and the whole thing just fell flat on its face with zero internal adoption. Traceability and logging were nonexistent. Finding the actual source for a \"gold\" report table was damn near impossible.I got a client to adopt dbt years ago for their Databricks lakehouse, but it was like pulling teeth - I had to set up a bunch of demos, slide decks, and a POC to prove that it actually worked. In the end, they were super happy with it and wondered why they didn't start using it sooner. I had other suggestions for things we could swap out to make our lives easier, but it went nowhere because, again, they don't understand the modern DE landscape or what's even possible. There's a lack of trust and familiarity.If you work in the industry, how the hell do you convince your boss's boss to let you use actual modern tooling? How do you avoid the trap of \"well, we're a Microsoft shop, so we only use Azure-native services\"?",

The team here is quite small, and there might be some Data Lake projects coming later, but nothing is confirmed yet.Is it normal for DE interns to be doing this kind of work? Should I be concerned that I’m not working on traditional DE projects like pipelines, data warehouses, ETL, etc.?

There's a setting in the *Analysis Services Processing Task* to use separate transactions, but the setting won’t save — every time I reopen the task, it resets. So I’m not sure if it’s being applied at all. Possibly a bug?As a workaround, I thought of scripting each table process using XMLA and scheduling it in steps. But that would mean one step per table — which is messy and hard to maintain. I also saw references to  and  in XMLA, but it looks like you can’t run multiple transactions in a single XMLA script unless you’re using a SOAP/XMLA client — not SSMS or Invoke-ASCmd.**My questions:**1. Is there a clean way to process each table in its own transaction (automated)?2. Is the \"separate transactions\" checkbox in SSIS known to be buggy? Or is there a workaround?3. If XMLA is the best approach, how can I structure it to avoid memory crashes without having to create 20+ steps manually?Any help or experience appreciated",

I know this is generally forbidden in Kimball modeling, but its unclear to me what the right solution should be. In my scenario, I need to merge two concept from different sources: Stripe invoices and a Salesforce contracts. A contract maps 1 to many with invoices and this needs to be connected at the line item level, which is essentially a product on the contract and a product on the invoice. Those products do not match between systems and have to be mapped separately. Products can have multiple prices as well so that add some complexity to this. As a side note, there is no integration between Salesforce and Stripe, so there is not a simple join key I can use, and of course, theres messy historical data, but I digress.Does this relationship between Invoice and Contract merit some type of intermediate bridge table? Generally those are reserved for many to many relationships, but I'm not sure what else would be beneficial. Maybe each concept should be tied to a price record since thats the finest granularity, but this is not feasible for every record as there are tens of thousands and theyd need to be mapped semi manually.",

I think DE is probably less relevant than DS/DA, and I have some experience in that realm under my belt as well, but I also think the need for specialized domain knowledge is likely to be very key, in which case I'd probably have to fall back on portable expertise and develop the specialized knowledge along the way.",

I'm using dbt with DuckDB for transformations.I've been following best practices and have defined a silver base layer where type conversion will be performed (and tested), but I've been a bit underwhelmed by dbt's support for this.I come from a SQL Server background where I previously implemented a metadata catalog for type conversion in pure SQL - basically storing target strong data types for each field (varchar(20), decimal(38,4), etc.) and then dynamically generating SQL views from the metadata table to do try\\_cast operations, with every field having an error indicator.It looks like I can do much the same in a dbt model, but I was hoping to leverage dbt's testing functionality with something like dbt-expectations. What I want to test for:* Null values in not-null fields* Invalid type conversions to decimals/numerics/ints* Varchar values exceeding max field lengthsI was hoping to apply a generic set of tests to every single source field by using the metadata catalog (which I'd load via a seed) - but it doesn't seem like you can use Jinja templates to dynamically generate tests in the schema.yml file.The best I can do appears to be generating the schema.yml at build time from the metadata and then running it - which tbh isn't too bad, but I would have preferred something fully dynamic.This seems like a standard problem, so I imagine my approach might just be off. Would love to hear others' opinions on the right way to tackle type conversions and validation in dbt!",

I'm working on a data engineering problem and would love to hear your thoughts on my solution and how you might approach it differently.**Problem**: I need to create a unique user ID (cb\\_id) that unifies user identifiers from multiple mock sources (SourceA, SourceB, SourceC). Each user can have multiple IDs from each source (e.g., one SourceA ID can map to multiple SourceB IDs, and vice versa). I have mapping dictionaries like {SourceA\\_id: \\[SourceB\\_id1, SourceB\\_id2, ...\\]} and {SourceA\\_id: \\[SourceC\\_id1, SourceC\\_id2, ...\\]}, with SourceA as the central link. Some IDs (e.g., SourceB) may appear first, with SourceA IDs joining later (e.g., after a day). The dataset is large (5-20 million records daily), and I require incremental updates and the ability to add new sources later. The output should be a dictionary, such as {cb\\_id: {\"sourceA\\_ids\": \\[\\], \"sourceB\\_ids\": \\[\\], \"sourceC\\_ids\": \\[\\]}}.**My Solution**: I'm using Spark with GraphX in Scala to model IDs as graph vertices and mappings as edges. I find connected components to group all IDs belonging to one user, then generate a cb\\_id (hash of sorted IDs for uniqueness). Results are stored in Delta Lake for incremental updates via MERGE, allowing new IDs to be added to existing cb\\_ids without recomputing the entire graph. The setup supports new sources by adding new mapping DataFrames and extending the output schema.**Questions**:* Is this a solid approach for unifying user IDs across sources with these constraints?* How would you tackle this problem differently (e.g., other tools, algorithms, or storage)?* Any pitfalls or optimizations I might be missing with GraphX or Delta Lake for this scale?Thanks for any insights or alternative ideas!",

We were rewriting the same queries, juggling multiple tools, and losing past work and context in Slack threads.So, I built **ToolFront**: a local, open-source server that acts as a unified interface for AI assistants to query all your databases at once. It's designed to solve a few key problems:* Useful queries get written once, then lost forever in DMs or personal notes.* Constantly re-configuring database connections for different AI tools is a pain.* Most multi-database solutions are cloud-based, meaning your schema or data goes to a third party (no thanks).Here’s what it does:* Unifies all your databases with a one-step setup. Connect to PostgreSQL, Snowflake, BigQuery, etc., and configure clients like Cursor and Copilot in a single step.* It runs locally on your machine, never exposes credentials, and enforces read-only operations by design.* Teaches the AI with your team's proven query patterns. Instead of just seeing a raw schema, the AI learns from successful, historical queries to understand your data's context and relationships.We're in **open beta** and looking for people to try it out, break it, and tell us what's missing. All features are completely free while we gather feedback.It's open-source, and you can find instructions to run it with Docker or install it via pip/uv on the GitHub page.If you're dealing with similar workflow pains, I'd love to get your thoughts!GitHub: [https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront](https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront)",

The DAGs would potentially contain any operator / plugin that airflow supports and even include custom developed ML models as part of the greater pipeline. However, ideally all of this gives rise to a detailed data lineage graph that allows to track all transitions and transformation steps each dataset went through. Even better if this graph can be enhanced with metadata for each row that later on can be queried (like smth contain PII vs None or dataset XY has been processed by ML model version foo). What is the best way to achieve a system like that? What tools do you use and how do you scale these processes? Thanks in advance!!",

Based on the job description and discussion with the manager, their tech stack is the following:**SQL, Python (Pyspark), Azure Databricks, Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure DevOps, SAP BW, SAP BO, Qlik Sense**According to the manager, my responsibilities that align with data engineering work include ELT/ETL pipeline development, as well as data warehouse design and development.Tbh, I’m leaning toward the BI Developer offer from the other company because of better compensation and benefits. With this, I’m concerned that it might affect my chances of moving into a data engineering role in the future. From what I understand, AWS is more in demand than Azure in the current job market in my country.If you were in my position, would accepting the job 2 offer still be a good stepping stone toward becoming a Data Engineer?For context, I’ve been working as a BI Developer for 4 years:* Previous company, I used **Azure** for 3 years.* Current company, I’ve been working with **AWS** for almost a year.Thank you in advance for your insights!",

Am I overthinking this? Should I just use more regex and call it a day?2. Is there a better way to preprocess these texts before GPT3.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I am an junior data engineer and I have recently started in a project here at my company. Although it is not a critical project, it is a very good one to improve my abilities in data modeling. So when I dove into it, I have got some questions. My main difficulty here is *how to and what to start thinking of when modeling the data from the original relational model to a start schema data model where it can be used by the dataViz people in PowerBI*.Below is a *very* simplified table relationship that I built to illustrate how the source tables are structured.[Original relational model](https://preview.redd.it/htaxxfp5o38f1.png?width=1278&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb45d6238590975b76a78cb3676fa2e8089211b3)*Quick explanation of the original architecture:*Here, it is a *sort* of snowflake architecture, where the main table is clearly Table A, which stores the main reports (type A). There are also a bunch of tables B's which are from the same type of report (type B) with some columns in common (as seen in the print) but each table has some exclusive columns, which depends of the report the user want to fill (TableB\\_a may have some type of infos that do not need to be filled in TableB\\_d, and so on).So for example, when a user creates a main report in TableA in the app interface, they can choose if they will fill any type B report and, if so, which reports of type B they will fill. There must be a type A report and each one of them can have 0 or many type B reports.Each type B tables can have another two tables:* one for the participants assigned to the type B report* and other to the pictures attached to each of the type B report.There are also many other tables seen in the left side of the picture that connects to TableA (such as Activities and tableA\\_docs) and user related tables, like Users, UserCertificate and Groups. Users, specially, connects to almost every other table by the column CreatedBy.*My question:*I need to create the new data modeling that will me used in PBI and to do so I will use views (there is not a lot of data, so the performance will not be affected). I actually do not know how to start and which steps I can take to start the modeling. But I have an idea:I was thinking about using star schema where I will have 2 fact tables (FT\\_TABLE\\_A and FT\\_TABLE\\_B) and some dimension tables around them. For FT\\_TABLEA I may use TableA directly. For FT\\_TABLE\\_B, I was thinking of joining each trio of tables (TableB\\_x - TableB\\_x\\_pics - TableB\\_x\\_participants) and then union them all using the common columns between then. The exclusive columns may be kept to be consulted directly in the original tables since for the dashboard their data is not important).For the dimensions, I think i can join Users, Groups and UserCertificate to create DM\\_USERS, for example. The other tables can be used as dimensions directly.To link the fact tables between themselves, I can create a DM\\_TA\\_TB, where it will stores the IDs from tables b and the ids from table A (like a hash map).So is my approach correct? Did I start well? I really want to understand **which approach I can take** in this kind of project and **how to think** here. I also want to know great references to study (with practical examples, please).I also do not master some concepts, so I am open to suggestions and corrections.EDIT: Here are some of the metrics I need to show:\\* the status of the reports of Type A and B's (are they open? are they closed?) for each location (lat long data is in TableA and the status is in each TableB) and the map plot to show where each report where filled (independently of the B type of the report)\\* The distribution plot for the level of criticality: how many B reports for each level (10 for low level, 3 for mid level and 4 for high level) (this will be calculated using the data from the reports)\\* alerts for activities that are next to deadline (the date info is in TableB)\\* How many type A and Type B reports are given to each group (and what are their status).\\* How the Type B are distributed between the groups (for example, Group 1 have more activities related to maintenance while Group 2 are doing more investigations activies)And etc. There are other metrics but these are the main onesThanks in advance!",

This feels risky. If someone makes a mistake, it can end up in the production environment immediately, especially since the platform (e.g. Hubspot) is actively used.In software development, I’m used to working with DTAP (Development, Test, Acceptance, Production) environments. That gives us room to experiment and test safely. I’m wondering how to bring a similar approach to data engineering.Some constraints:* We currently have a single datalake that serves as the main source for everyone.* There’s no sandbox/staging environment for the external APIs we push data to.* Our team sometimes modifies source or destination data directly during dev/testing, which feels very risky.* Everyone working on the data environment has access to everything, including production API keys so (accidental) erroneous calls sometimes occur.**Question:**How do others in the data engineering space handle environment separation and safe testing practices? Are there established patterns or tooling to simulate DTAP-style environments in a data pipeline context? In our software engineering teams we use mocked substitutes or local fixtures to fix these issues, but seeing as there is a bunch of unstructured data I'm not sure how to set this up.Any insights or examples of how you’ve solved this—especially around API interactions and shared datalakes—would be greatly appreciated!",

I'm looking to implement highly customized **commit logic**, or to directly manipulate the list of files that logically constitute a \"table\" or \"partition\" in a transactional way.I know that PySpark gives us access to the Java/Scala world through `spark._jvm` and `spark._jsc`. I've seen isolated examples of manipulating `org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem` for atomic renames.However, I'm wondering **how exactly am I supposed to use internal Spark/Hadoop methods like** `commit()`**,** `addFiles()`**,** `removeFiles()` **(or similar transactional file operations) through this JVM interface in PySpark?*** **Context:** My ETL needs to ensure that the output dataset is always in a consistent state, even if failures occur mid-process. I might need to atomically add or remove specific files from a \"logical partition\" or \"table,\" or orchestrate a custom commit after several distinct processing steps.* **I understand that solutions like Delta Lake handle this natively**, but for this particular use case, I might need very specific logic (e.g., managing a simplified external metadata store, or dealing with a non-standard file type that has its own unique \"commit\" rules).**My more specific questions are:**1. What are the **best practices for accessing and invoking these internal methods** (`commit`, `addFiles`, `removeFiles`, or other transactional file operations) from PySpark via the JVM?2. Are there **specific classes or interfaces within** `spark._jvm` (e.g., within `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.FileFormatWriter` or `org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem` APIs) that are designed to be called this way to manage commit operations?3. What are the **major pitfalls to watch out for**? (e.g., managing distributed contexts, serialization issues, or performance implications).4. Has anyone successfully **implemented custom transactional commit logic in PySpark** by directly using the JVM? I would greatly appreciate any code examples or pointers to relevant resources.I understand this is a fairly low-level abstraction, and frameworks like Delta Lake exist precisely to abstract this away. But for this specific requirement, I need to explore this path.Thanks in advance for any insights and help!",

Eventually, I went back to my original major (computer science), got my associate’s degree, and was accepted into a university to finish my bachelor’s.That same month, I moved into a new apartment and met my (now) wife. We hit it off immediately, and after a year of dating, I proposed. Life was moving fast... and for once, in the right direction.After graduation, I spent about a year job hunting. I submitted over 500 applications, spending mornings writing tailored cover letters and revising my resume to match each company’s stack and values.The first company to interview me ended up hiring me after three rounds.1. **Initial screen (google meet)**: resume, background, and intro to the company.2. **Technical interview (google meet.. 4 hours!)**: a mix of debugging, CS fundamentals, and even some brain-teaser-style problems (think: goblin guarding a bridge).3. **Final interview**: in-person, 3.5 hours away. They covered the hotel, gas, and meals.Coming from 15 years in food service, I had never felt so professionally respected. I know this might be standard for many in tech, but it meant the world to me. I worked hard for it and it finally paid off.If you’re out there feeling discouraged, unsure if you’ll ever make it... I’ve been there. More than once. Don’t give up. You’ve got this.",

Nothing too complex. Just practical enough to build confidence and show me how Python works in real life.Here are five that really helped me level up:1. File sorter Organizes files in your Downloads folder by type. Taught me how to work with directories and conditionals.2. Personal expense tracker Logs your spending and saves it to a CSV. Simple but great for learning input handling and working with files.3. Website uptime checker Pings a URL every few minutes and alerts you if it goes down. Helped me learn about requests, loops, and scheduling.4. PDF merger Combines multiple PDF files into one. Surprisingly useful and introduced me to working with external libraries.5. Weather app Pulls live weather data from an API. This was my first experience using APIs and handling JSON.While i was working on these, i created a system in Notion to trck what I was learning, keep project ideas organized, and make sure I was building skills that actually mattered.I’ve cleaned it up and shared it as a **free resource** in case it helps anyone else who’s in that stuck phase i was in.You can find it in my profile bio.If you’ve got any other project ideas that helped you learn, I’d love to hear them. I’m always looking for new things to try.",

I don't feel like a real software engineer. I often wonder how people reach the level needed to land a $200K job at Google. How smart do you have to be to work at Uber or Meta? I just don't see myself there. I work for an average salary at an average company, as an average \"senior\" developer—though, honestly, I don’t even feel senior.How can I become a real engineer?Is it even possible to reach the level of a Google engineer—or at least learn what I need to pass a Google-style interview? I'm not necessarily aiming to work at Google, but my goal is to become a real engineer one day.Edit: Thanks very much to everyone , I really appreciate you taking the time to comment and share such kind words and advices. I truly means a lot to me.A lot of comments out there make a lot of sense so I will work on that, thanks again !",

I tried to undo the last commit but at first it said something about a soft reset not being possible, but I tried again and accidentally ended up uncommiting older changes and the previous revisions my team had done didn't get changed back.

Never worked for me. I feel like I've learned better and more effectively through having a MAIN course for something I want to learn and documentation as a SIDE-RESOURCE that I use to refresh my memory or learn new concepts quickly for a technology I'm already comfortable with. I want to learn the bigger picture, not just learn the modules in Node, and I feel like courses are great at explaining WHY something works and in what situations it is best in. I believe this is why I've enjoyed The Odin Project so much even though they heavily push on reading documentation. They don't just send you the link to JavaScript.info and tell you to read the whole thing, they give you little bits and pieces from the website and other websites for you to learn that specific concept and in their article they teach you the bigger picture of why you're even learning said concept and why the resources they're linking are good resources.Now, this is not to say that MDN, JavaScript.info, W3Schools and other websites are bad resources. I just feel like if my friend tells me tomorrow, \"Hey I want to learn HTML\". I wouldn't just tell them to download VSCode and read W3Schools. I'd give them different options like freeCodeCamp, programming with mosh's video, udemy courses, etc, and then they can read MDN to refresh their memory or revise new concepts. Or I'd ask them what their preferred method of learning is and we go from there.At the end of the day, not everyone is going to feel comfortable learning the same way. Which is why we should keep that in mind and not tell the beginner, \"just dive in and read MDN when you get lost\". I feel like a lot of documentation out there isn't very beginner friendly, or doesn't go slow enough for that person to grasp the why's and how's of that technology.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey everyone,I wanted to put this out there because I’ve been struggling a lot with my growth as a developer and I think I need some external perspective and advice.I’ve been working as a developer for about 4 years now. Recently graduated with a degree in CS, but most of my college years were during the pandemic—so, let’s just say the education wasn’t the most hands-on or practical.To be honest, I feel like I’ve skipped a lot of important steps in my learning journey. I learned (more or less) the basics for starters such as algorithm, datastrucutres and OOP, then jumped straight into building things with frameworks without really understanding the underlying principles or best practices. On top of that, I’ve become overly reliant on AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.). They help me get things done fast, but I’m painfully aware that they’re also masking my gaps in knowledge and critical thinking when it comes to code design, architecture, and problem-solving.On the job side, I’ve never worked on a big team. All of my jobs and freelance projects have been solo. I’ve literally never had a code review in my life. No senior devs to learn from. No one to point out my bad habits. As a result, I have no real benchmark for how “good” my code actually is. I’m constantly second-guessing myself—am I writing maintainable code? Am I using the right patterns? Am I leaving massive performance or security issues behind without realizing it?My main focus has been backend development—working with NestJS, building REST APIs—that’s the part I actually enjoy the most. But I’ve mostly worked fullstack because that’s what companies have been hiring for. I know I need to broaden my skills—GraphQL, performance tuning, security best practices, proper testing strategies, etc.—but I’m honestly lost on where to start and what’s most important to prioritize.Another weakness: I’ve never developed the habit of properly reading and understanding documentation. I’ve mostly been learning through random tutorials, StackOverflow, and now AI. I know this is unsustainable long-term, but every time I sit down to “study” or deep dive, I get overwhelmed and default back to just shipping code.So yeah… I guess I’m at a crossroads. I want to level up. I want to break this cycle. But I feel like I’ve built my developer career on shaky foundations and now I don’t know how to rebuild while still working full time.**If anyone has been through something similar (or has advice on how to build real confidence and technical depth after years of winging it), I’d love to hear your perspective.**What would you focus on first if you were in my shoes? How do I realistically improve my fundamentals while balancing work?Thanks for reading.",

Then I moved for full stack development for the best 3 years. I can do different frameworks, I can create beautiful production ready websites using React,...etc.The issue is, I still cannot fit myself in any stack. I tried in my free time game development I was stuck because I failed to learn shaders (I couldn't build a connection with the logic) Also, I am so bad at designing 3d or 2D. I tried low level coding and contribute to open source projects I got bored fast,...etc. Also, I tried AI for some time got bored fastI don't know what to do. Whatever field I join I get bored or I be like man that's not my place. The best thing I can do is full stack development but it's boring some random CRUD operations and doing the same security measures over and over.I hope to get answers from really old dudes in the field.One last thing I forgot to mention: I’m currently a full-time software engineer, but I’m not specifically doing full-stack work. Instead, I’m assigned random tasks across many parts of the company’s systems, mostly to avoid getting stuck doing just one thing.An Edit, Should I start game development for fun (again), and Will I be able to do something in game engines.

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "In high school (grades 9–11), I was the best student in my class at math. I really liked it and wanted to study higher mathematics.Now I’m studying Computer Science at university and aiming to become a software developer. My question is about the actual level of higher mathematics knowledge required for a programmer.Of course, math is essential, but the specific areas you need depend on your field. For example, machine learning and systems programming require deep knowledge of probability theory, statistics, linear algebra, mathematical analysis, and discrete math.To create new algorithms or be an advanced developer, you definitely need higher math.However, here’s my problem: I struggle to memorize all the theory presented in lectures. I don’t remember all the integration or differentiation methods. When I face a mathematical problem, I usually can't solve it right away. I have to look up the method or algorithm, study some examples, and only then can I solve it — which takes time.So I’d like to ask developers who regularly deal with advanced mathematics: When you're faced with a math-heavy problem, do you immediately know which method to use and remember the formulas by heart? Or do you also have to look things up and review examples?Also, will I fail an interview for a systems programmer or ML developer if I don’t know all the higher math theory by heart? What if I can't solve a math problem on the spot?Lastly, I’m worried that in real work I’ll spend too much time solving math problems, which might not be acceptable for employers.",

        "content": "Currently I have failed intro to data structures and algorithms once and had to withdraw a second time. A pattern I noticed is that most students in my class had experience in hackathons, programming clubs or even just working on projects through tutorials enough time to be fairly familiar with a programming language, whereas I only had occasional sporadic 1-2 hour studies of a programming video, mainly copying the code line by line and aimlessly googling every keyword in the documentation while being confused by the meaning of the syntax and still unable to make anything by myself, mainly being more concerned with schoolwork. I would focus heavily on trying to understand math on a more conceptual level or at least get enough practice to be prepared for theoretical computer science, but I consistently failed when implementing algorithms for projects. I initially thought this failure came from not understanding the algorithm enough as a concept, and I tried to ask myself at which point I usually get stuck, since I could get through the basics taught in 'intro to java/x language' courses where they introduce variables, data types, pointers, etc.I tried to ask myself the simplest 'algorithm' I could imagine implementing from scratch- I thought creating an algorithm to make the number 4 was not complicated, I could make int x =2 and write the following print(x +x). I thought that this analogy proved that any issue I had in terms of reading documentation and implementation came because I needed to reach a point of understanding where the algorithm was as familiar and intuitive as basic arithmetic, but this was not the case as when I asked my professor they said it is more important to focus on understanding the algorithm enough to properly implement it, but there was not enough time within the course to develop too deep of an understanding and such an understanding could not be developed without implementation regardless. I felt stuck in a catch 22 because I could not move past \"tutorial hell\" due to a lack of theoretical computer science knowledge but I could also not gain computer science knowledge because I had not programmed enough. Even if I reached a rough understanding of how to draw a bubble sort on a whiteboard I didn't understand programming languages enough to write the comparison statements properly from scratch and plan for exception cases. I want to start completely from scratch similar to how you would introduce computer science to a child but am not sure where to start- I even tried scratch but it seemed to be more of a game with algorithm building elements to keep a child's attention rather than an appropriate place for someone to learn about computers and computation from the ground up. How should I move forward?",

Ideally, I would like to create a wide range of creative projects using both together. Apps, websites, games for consoles, web-based games, AR and VR experiences, and so on. Whatever I get inspired to create. So, the past month or so I've been using online and book resources to try and learn coding on my own. I started with basic HTML, CSS, and entry-level JavaScript. I haven't gone in-depth with anything just yet. Just chipping at studies an hour or so a day.I wasn't sure if JavaScript would be the best investment as my first coding language for my creative goals. I've been dipping my toes in C# this last week after learning about the recent innovations to C# that covers all the areas I'm interested in listed above. However, I hit a wall trying to setup and implement Visual Studio Code.With JavaScript, I could just make a js file in any text-based editor, even notepad, and just go. But C# it feels like I need all these add-ons, libraries, plugins and more just to START learning what I can do besides Console.WriteLine(). I feel like I'm being sold dependency on one specific program than learning a language. That I have to become dependent on Microsoft and the .NET framework just to get anything done in the future, even learn Unity and so forth while moving away from web-based options for creativity.Is C# always like this? It feels heavy and sluggish compared to the flexible JavaScript. I don't want to use up hours and weeks moving in a direction just to backtrack and have to unlearn it.Any coding kung-fu masters care to share insights about this? Thanks for any input.",

I've been using freecodecamp to learn about syntax and I've been going through Microsoft's Coursera 12 course full-stack engineering program to understand more syntax and the lifecycle. I've been building projects using VSCODE (without co pilot until I'm more comfortable with programming) and I'm wondering if people really hire developers with no degree. I plan to finish the courses and build my web portfolio with projects. And apply to everything and everywhere (apprenticeships, entry level etc) is this a good idea? I also may have the option to have centriq full stack training paid for by a non profit. Is software engineering extremely heard to break into without a cs degree? Am I going about this the right way?",

I read how something works if I need it and then program it at the same time. For example I am going through The Odin Project right now. Nearly done with the react course. And for example if I learn a new topic without programming it yet, reading the documentation is so boring to me. Yes I do like to read to understand the main concept but really reading the whole documentation is soooo dry to me.DId anyone ever suffer with that kind of problem? Is programming maybe wrong for me?

Sounds all great, right?But i feel like a total fraud. The topics *seem* easy to understand/grasp, and I'm able to get everything bundled together. But not really without constantly searching and watching tutorials. Don't get me wrong, i can make things in Python, and django, without much help. But when it comes to React, REST Apis and Docker. I basically need to look things up the entire time. I *want* to add all these to my resume, but i feel like i shouldnt, if I'm ever asked IRL a question, i feel like I'll just panic. I know the only way to fix this, is by practicing it continually. But i just feel.. like a total imposter. Like im not actually *good* at programming, im just good at looking things up. Granted, i don't use AI, so i atleast have that backing me, but i still have to search everything, whether its docs, Stack Overflow, here, or just general google/youtube. Is this normal?

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "It's the summer after HS graduation, right before I enter my first semester of University in my Data Science major. I thought, \"Maybe I should learn code before anything else, get ahead, and make some time for math when I'm actually in uni. My 11th-grade Pre-cal teacher recommended learning code first even.\" There weren't many free online structured courses for learning Python that had hands-on practice but I did find Kaggle. I completed the short \"Intro to Programming\" course on there with relative ease. Some exercises were mildly tricky but I was able to get through them with minimal hints and criticism from ChatGPT. After that, I headed onto the main Python course. This was also relatively easy in the first few topics but when it got to lists, list comprehension, dictionaries, for loops and stuff, the exercises became increasingly difficult. The reading part before the exercises page weren't the hardest to understand and I even tried my best to truly understand the content. I would try a code first, see if it's correct, if it isn't, I send it to ChatGPT to see what's wrong with it without providing a hint to the solution, and try again. I'd even uncomment the \"q.solution()\" to see the solution when I'd given up after hours of head banging, trying to figure this out. I'd check out the solution, read through it line by line to see what the hell it's even doing and how it makes sense, not get it, send it to ChatGPT to explain it in practice, still get confused, explain bit by bit, go back, solve the same problem, move on to the next problem, and struggle with even getting *started*. I've been *especially* stuck on the \"Exercise: Strings and Dictionaries\" on problems 2 and 3. holy hell I can not even think of what to start with, I can not brainstorm. I've heard the advice \"just code dumb stuff that pertains to the problem, fix it, expand it, and slowly work towards the solution\" but I feel like I can't even code dumb stuff either. I thought maybe Kaggle goes to quick with questions that go from simple syntaxes, to abstractions of those syntaxes, and then abstractions UPON abstractions on those syntaxes that just overload my working memory. **Is Kaggle actually the problem? Or am I approaching this terribly wrong?**",

However, I made a similar weather api project 2 years ago when I first started learning to code with SheCodes- a beginners course. Over the past two years I’ve done further Python courses, and a software engineering bootcamp with CodeFirstGirls where we went over JavaScript, Python and MySQL. Right now I’m a web designer for a law company - we can both use html bootstrap css, so nothing technical. I do enjoy front end so these qualities aren’t pointless to write on my cv, but I’ve been here for 13 months but I’m not challenge enough. I feel like I’ve gone backwards. Even this weather app seemed a bit difficult. The reason I say self sabotage is because I went back to JavaScript, something I began learning years ago. I felt like I didn’t know it enough so I went right back to the beginning rather than going onto react which I now feel like I should have. I never know how much JavaScript I should know before I move on. Also another thing that gets to me, is during my bootcamp, the instructors encouraged us to use ChatGPT. They said in their jobs they use it everyday and the skill is know what it ask and where to add this in your code, so some times I use ChatGPT but maybe more than I should. Is this normal? I’m also 26 in 5 months, and I’m on 31k right now. I honestly expected to be doing better and I just don’t know if I’m being dramatic or impatient.",

I am not necessarily a stranger to graphics, as I worked alongside the LearnOpenGL book and finished most of it up to the section on PBR. However, I am not sure if my approach to that book was the best and it ended up taking me a really long time to internalize the concepts, and even at that, now I wouldn't even know simple things like more advanced yet standard lighting techniques. To prevent wasting a lot of time and actually learn better, I was wondering what is the best way to read a programming/CS book/textbook? I am at the moment reading the Raytracing in a weekend series (going to read all 3 books), and then I would like to read the PBRT book. I noticed that there is a lot of given code and concepts in raytracing in a weekend, as well as PBRT, and I am wondering if I should just read it, or if I should be programming alongside it. Or maybe I should read it first and then try to apply it? but then by then I have forgotten everything.I dont know but any help I very much appreciate.

However, to me, what they call \"opinion-based\" questions are the most interesting type of questions and they tackle the problem of possible ways of solving something.I'm a newbie programmer. I'm developing a C# program. My program has a Configuration class, where I basically need only 1 instance of the object for an entire run of the program, which tells me the class could be designed as a Singleton. However, there is a twist. My program is able to do calculations. A calculation takes some while to complete. My program can only do 1 calculation at a time, but it is possible to set multiple calculations in a queue. A calculation requires the Configuration. When I set a calculation in a queue, I want to take a \"snapshot\" of the state of the Configuration at the specific time, therefore create some sort of a copy of the Configuration. Now my question is - does this go against the Singleton principle? Please be lenient with me. As I say, I'm a newbie, not a C# world champion, so some constructive points would really help me. Thank you very much for any recommendations.",

If I'm taking in html form input though the express.urlencoded middleware, what do I need to watch out for? I know I should validate the input format with something like the express-validator middleware, but what about for something like a text-area where a user might have a perfectly valid reason for including \"dangerous characters\"? I've tried escaping/encoding the input, but at least with the express-validator `.escape()` method, this literally displays the output as encoded symbols. I've discovered that if I don't use `.escape()` and just display the content in the view either with the `.textContent` DOM method or with a templating engine like ejs, it will display the proper text content on the page and literally display any `` or other html tags instead of running the code inside of them. However, is there still a risk of an attacker manipulating the code on the back-end if I don't escape the input?Finally, I know I should use parameterization for Postgresql queries. Will this alone protect my database from SQL injection (I'm use node-postgres for queries)?Thank you for your responses and assistance.",

        "content": "Hi everyone,I'm starting my MCA this year. Before this, I completed a BSc (non-CS), so I have no formal background in programming. My ultimate goal is to get into the AI/ML field, and I’ll have 3 years during MCA to build my skills.I’ve been researching roadmaps, and most of them recommend Python and strong math foundations—which actually works well for me since I studied a lot of math in depth during my BSc. So I started learning Python and brushing up on math side by side.I also spoke to my cousin who works at Boeing as a full-stack developer. He told me that full-stack/frontend/backend roles are getting saturated, and if I'm starting fresh, AI/ML is a better long-term direction. That motivated me even more to stick to this field.However, a friend of mine told me that companies don't just want Python developers. He said that languages like C++ and Java are often preferred too, and since Python is more \"readymade,\" it might not be enough alone. He suggested learning C++ or Java first, then Python later—which has left me confused.Now I’m also wondering—should I be open to development roles too? Like learning full-stack or backend frameworks (Django, React, etc.) along with Python and AI/ML stuff? Or should I just stay focused on AI/ML and not try to juggle too many things at once?Has anyone been in a similar situation—coming from a non-CS background and aiming for AI/ML? I'd really appreciate any guidance, suggestions, or roadmaps.Thanks in advance!",

Every tutorial tells me to install dependencies such as Thymeleaf and use Maven from Spring Intializr, but I have no idea what that means. I know Maven is a database thingy, but that's about it.I also get very confused about the folder structure of things like templates for Spring-React projects and so on. I don't know what many of those files or folders are there for, and tutorials don't seem to teach it. Even worse, they often have a different structure and names for files that may or may not be there.I have a feeling that the actual linking of front-end to back-end would be quite simple, and with React I don't think I'd even need a template language like Thymeleaf. I really want to know how to learn this kind of thing, but doing the research and getting nowhere is really getting me burned out. I've worked with a bit of Spring React in an internship and understand a bit of how MVC looks at the URL and uses a file based on the return of a controller as the view, but setting it up is confusing me. My internship even somehow used .jspx instead of the default .html and I don't know how they did it.These are the sort of things I'm stuck with. Some may be more easily searchable, but I'm just getting so frustrated and burnt out with the others. If anyone is willing to help me, then thank you in advance.",

AI really can’t do real engineering work. I think for the startup I’ve been working on, there’s definitely been moments where I feel like we’re going really fast but eventually end up in a point where we need to think of real engineering solutions (particularly in case of software startup) and get stuck. It’s good for the early stages when you need to validate an idea or get something out there but you do eventually hit a wall and need to actually start thinking rather than relying on AI.Vibe coding doesn’t create solutions that scale and exponentially increases technical debt if you’re putting no thought into what’s being engineered. Over the past few months, I’ve seen some terrible code written with single / long files and no kind of abstraction and modularization done in many cases. This makes it hard to actually build on top of what’s already written and certainly doesn’t scale. I think AI is pretty far away from replacing real engineers.",

Copilot in my editor, ChatGPT open in one tab, pasting console errors like it was a team member. But now? I’m kinda over it.Somewhere between the half-correct suggestions, the weird variable names, and the constant second-guessing, I realized I was spending more time editing than coding. Not in a purist way, just… practically speaking. I’d ask for a function and end up rewriting 70% of what it gave me, or worse, chasing down subtle bugs it introduced.There was a week I used it heavily while prototyping a new internal service. At first it felt fast code was flying. But reviewing it later, everything was just slightly off. Not wrong, just shallow. Error handling missing. Naming inconsistent. I had to redo most of it to meet the bar I’d expect from a human.I still think there’s a place for these tools. I’ve seen them shine in repetitive stuff, test cases, boilerplate, converting between formats. And when I’m stuck at 10 PM on a weird TypeScript issue, I’ll absolutely throw a hail mary into GPT. But it’s become more like a teammate you work with occasionally, not one you rely on every day.Just wondering if there are other folks feeling this too? Like the honeymoon phase is over, and now we’re trying to figure out where AI actually fits into the real-world workflow?Not trying to dunk on the tools.

        "content": "Hey Guys,I finally got my first job offer since applying for the last 4 months, and the culture, people, and pay is great for my first job out of college. The only thing is that the majority of my job will be using COBOL/JCL and the more I learn about the language the less I like. I'm also not wanting to get trapped in a hole where the only jobs I'm qualified for are legacy systems or ones using COBOL. Tbf they said that they were trying to migrate off of it, but it will most likely take a long time before that can happen.I'm having trouble figuring out if I should keep applying to other jobs while I work this one or not look a gift horse in the mouth. I would feel guilty about leaving say a month after they finally train me as I told them that I had no prior COBOL experience and are willing to train me. Can anyone else give me advice about whether this experience will carry over to a new job or if I should just keep applying and leave whenever I get a new offer. Update: I took the job! Thanks so much for the replies, It's helped me see the job in a new light. A lot of you guys had some good points, especially about keeping a COBOL consulting job in my back pocket in case I need to fall back on it. Luckily I like the company and I'm really grateful that they gave me a shot even though my experience isn't in COBOL. I'm excited to start with them and like other people were saying, maybe I can get my hands in modernizing or working on some of their other projects while I'm there. Also to the people who saw this and were like duhh take it, I have some things that would make me very marketable to the field I'm interested in and got myself a couple of interviews for those companies, but there just aren't jobs for it in my state and I was weighing whether I can stay here and gain experience while being close to my family and do that in a couple years, or I should just leave now and try for that even if I have to move a little farther than I would like.",

After talking to him for multiple times, he told me that I could be working from home at least 3 days a week. I made it clear that my employer was requiring 1 day in the office and 2 days was the max I could accept. Fine, I accepted to have my resume sent to the hiring manager by him. Got 2 interview with the hiring manager which I asked about the work from home policy. I asked him how many days per week can we work from home. Today I realize that he never gave me a straight up answer because he simply said that he's going 4 days a week, while never directly say that my presence is required 4 days a week. So I took the recruiter's word ( 2 days a week in the office).Fast forward now. First day in the new workplace and they informed me that it is 4 days in the office. I tried to talk about this situation with my new manager to find an arrangement and he told me that nothing can be done and this is a policy company wide.How should I approach this situation?

Every single one of my CS jobs has been a temporary contract. I worked as a data scientist for over a year, an ABAP developer for a few months, a Flutter dev for a few months, and am currently on a contract as a QA tester for an AI app; I have been on that contract for a year so far, and the contract would have been finished a couple of months ago, but it was extended for an additional year. There were large gaps between all those contracts.As for my educational background, I have a bachelor's degree with a math major and minors in physics and computer science, and a post-graduate certification in data science.My issue is this: I see generative AI as contributing to the ruination of society, and I do not want any involvement in that. The problem is that the entirety of the tech industry is moving toward generative AI, and it seems like if you don't have AI skills, then you will be left behind and will never be able to find a job in the CS field. Am I correct in saying this?As far as my disgust for the tech industry as a whole: It's not just AI that makes me feel this way, but all the shit the industry has been up to since long before the generative AI boom. The big tech CEOs have always been scumbags, but perhaps the straw that broke the camel's back was when they pretty much all bent the knee to a world leader who, in additional to all the other shit he has done and just being an overall terrible person, has multiple times threatened to annex my country.Is there any hope of me getting a decent CS career, while making minimal use of generative AI, and making no actual contribution to the development of generative AI (e.g. creating, training, or testing LLMs)? Or should I abandon the field entirely? (If the latter, then the question of what to do from there is probably beyond the scope of this subreddit and will have to be asked somewhere else.)",

It was a fully remote job (this was before covid when remote jobs weren't even that common), I got hired at a mid-sized company and my job was to maintain several very old java applications. Most of the team was non-technical, there were a few other devs on the team but they worked on other stuff, I was the only one working on these java applications so no one really knew what I was doing, as long as the applications worked they were happy. I quickly realized my boss knew very little about development. I would do about 1-2 hrs of work each day then spend the rest of the day doing nothing, and my boss was still impressed and gave me great performance reviews. After 2 years I found another job because I was underpaid and honestly I was bored. My current job has the opposite problem, I work pretty hard and often even work more than 8 hours a day just to keep up with the other devs. The pay is a lot better but it's kind of stressful. I am starting to wish I stayed at the other job even though I made less money. Or I wish I could find a middle ground where the work is challenging enough so I am not bored, but not stressed either.I am curious how hard you work, is there anyone here who does nothing or almost nothing?",

Joining FANG was a dream come true, after working hard in college. But over time, I started getting feedback that I was too slow. Eventually, I was put on PIP (and failed). It was tough pill to swallow since I had always assumed that as long as I delivered work, that would be enough. Apparently, speed matters as well.Post that chapter, I joined a startup. But, few months in here, I'm getting the same feedback. Management is again raising concerns about my speed and deliverables.It's a bit frustrating, since I do put in the hours. A typical day is like 7-8 hours, with 3-4 hours of focused work. But, when things get heated to meet deadlines, I find myself pushing the hours to 13+ hour days for stretches, to keep up.I'll admit I'm introvert by nature. I don't engage a lot in casual conversations, but I try to communicate clearly about anything related to my work. I document my designs, processes, task breakdowns etc - Anything that might clear things for the management, or, might help others for future reference.And, still I find myself tagged as a \"slow developer\". It's very hard and honestly, I'm not sure how to improve from here. This breaks down my workplace confidence completely.If anyone has been in a similar situation, how did you overcome it? What would you suggest to improve if you were in my shoes? And, are there alternative career paths I can explore?Edit - Since some people asked about situation based examples:\\- I was assigned a deliverable, which took me about 9 months (as single developer on the project). About 4 months went into testing, which wasn't even on me since the testing process was completely ad-hoc. Looking back, I could have communicated a bit better, but it would still take me about \\~3 months for that project.\\- In my current startup, since the last 5 months, I'm working on a totally different aspect than what my team's functional domain is. This required me to understand a ton of things to enable myself to start delivering. Also, since there is shortage of documentations, I mostly had to rely on people & codebases to get the understandings. This took me significant time, and was labelled as slow. Not sure what could have been done differently.",

I mean the bubble around creating chat applications or other Gen AI applications that are just wrappers around models from the big 4-5 companies. I want to get some opinions from people who know this field. People who work in the trenches every day. I work at a small company (or I did, I'm in the process of being laid off). They do contracts for small companies, and some sub contracting for the government. My Ceo, my CTO, and the head of software engineering are all obsessed with Gen AI, agentic frameworks. They are having us build internal tools to create our own chatbot, that they want to market out to other companies and sell. The other day, we were working on a translation \"tool\" within the mcp architecture. One of our senior devops guys, who is very smart and great at the job, asked point blank \"why would a company want this service can't they just ask chatgpt to translate the document?\" The answer, right now, is that chatgpt is a black box. You don't really have any concept of auditibility, how long it actually took to translate the document, what it cost, how accurate it is, etc, just using chatgpt. When you use tools like Langchain and Langfuse with an LLM engine you can track these things. Today, this is useful and I understand the business argument for doing it. But to me it feels like a giant bubble waiting to pop. All we are doing, and anyone else claiming to have a chatbot or agentic system, is putting a wrapper on llms developed by the big 4-5 companies. This seems unsustainable to me as a business model. Let's say tomorrow, Anthropic comes out and says now we have an agentic tool that works directly with Claude models, it's configured to work with them out of the box, and it includes full tracing and auditibility of everything you do. And then 2 months later, Open AI releases their competing tool. Why then would anyone use a bunch of cobbled together 3rd party tools to accomplish the same thing, instead of just signing deals with one of those companies? I feel that once that happens, and I am positive it will happen, the whole ecosystem around agentic applications/MCP/chat applications will collapse. Does this sound crazy to everyone?

        "content": "I applied to Apple about a month ago for an LLVM GPU Compiler Engineer position. For context, I currently work at Intel as an LLVM Compiler Engineer (3yrs here, 7yrs total experience), working almost exclusively on the optimizing middle-end. Plenty of CPU experience, but not much GPU experience, which I was upfront about and they were totally fine with throughout the process.Over the course of 4 weeks or so, I went through a pretty grueling hiring process (1 manager screen, 1 technical screen, 4 technical interviews + 1 behavioral interview) that mostly seemed to go well. Hiring manager seemed impressed by my personal projects and professional experience, and the interviewers all seemed like smart and capable people. At this time, I'm also in a process with Qualcomm for a CPU LLVM Engineer position and they also seem very interested (though I'm a bit skeptical of them, tbh the team seemed very demoralized and overworked). At this point, Apple said they want to move forward and we're in the offer phase.I just had a conversation with the recruiter this morning just checking the team was something I was interested in and starting the conversation about salary expectations. I told him I like the team and I'm very interested in what Apple has to offer. However, when I told him I'm expecting something in the base pay range of $200k - $250k he seemed very shocked. He used the phrase \"strongly misaligned\" on salary expectations. I told him the truth: I'm currently making close to the middle of that range at Intel, plus stock and bonuses (about another $20-40k). I panicked a little when I heard that, so I backpedaled a bit and told him that compensation wasn't necessarily the most important factor and hopefully it wouldn't be an impediment to them making an offer. He said he'll need to talk to the senior hiring manager and get back to me.I have another call scheduled with him tomorrow to talk again, but I'm worried I screwed up. The online posting says the base pay range is between $175,800 and $312,200, so I don't think I highballed them or made a ridiculous offer. I understand experience may be a mitigating factor, but I'm still really worried. Intel has been doing really poorly since I started working here, and while I like the work overall and have a good relation with my manager, working with my team can be pretty exhausting, and the layoffs have taken a heavy toll. All in all, I'm ready to get out.Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks if you've read this far.",

My relationship with my manager has always been rocky - he has a non-technical background and is currently only an L5. I've spoken to my Sr. SDE and others for advice - they have also had issues with him prior, being very assertive and not taking differing opinions well. I will admit that I can be very combative/vocal (I'm American, he's international).Nevertheless, from 2024 to 2025, I was top of the team in code output and was getting “promo-track” feedback every 1:1. However, long story short, we've had a series of increasingly bad arguments that have broken our relationship: * Early Jan, I pushed back on my manager’s micro-managing, and he got angry, called me into a meeting immediately* He's called me \"defensive\", \"lacking ownership\", and having a \"victim mentality\" for asking for examples for growth areas during end-of-year reviews* I started documenting 1:1s with emails, and he said it felt overly formal and asked me to stop* He prevented me from mentoring an intern because he \"didn't trust me\" after I told him not to micromanage me again in AprilI escalated to my skip last week because it was affecting my mental health. During my meeting with my skip, he even said (verbatim), \"Your manager has a very, very big ego and is hard to work with, it's not just you\". My skip just had a meeting with me today and said that all the managers (my manager, him, and their manager) met and discussed allowing me to transfer to a sister team, effective immediately, as a change of scenery and environment.I desperately need help as to what to do here. I'm just very burnt out from the situation and want to leave. I feel like I failed somehow and want to quit. Here are my options:1. Transfer under sister team now (new tech stack, new manager)1. Stay, wait for focus + pivot, trigger FMLA 1. Stay, invoke FMLA ASAP for mental healthI'm really just done with this company and want to go for option 3. All thoughts appreciated, feeling boxed in.Edit w/ Update:Ended up choosing option 1 thanks to everyone’s advice. Felt like a rock has lifted off my chest really. Went around and gave notice to those on my team whom I’m close with, it was nice but bittersweet :smiling_face_with_tear: They all agreed I made the right choice, lamenting they should all do something collectively to complain against the manager.",

        "content": "I have been a software engineer for 13 years now. I've been web frontend focused since 2019 since I took a liking to it at the end of my first job. Anyway, my career has had its ups and downs, but it feels way way down right now.My career was going pretty well until I got laid off in March, 2023. Since then I have had two jobs, and both ended poorly. I am currently unemployed yet again, but unlike previous job searches, I am not feeling hopeful this time.One of my last two jobs ended with being fired and my previous one ended with resignation. Both lasted less than 1 year. I felt productive at both jobs, and I made an effort to help less experienced devs. However, after a while, I would inevitably clash with leadership and not behave that well, and the reasons were different at the two companies.At one, I felt overly constrained by controlling product managers and wasn't able to make any code change that was not ticketed, since every single PR needed manual QA before being merged into prod. I felt that the React code was the worst I'd ever seen, such as ~25 components that were 1000+ lines long. One component had an ENORMOUS switch statement for conditional rendering that I badly wanted to refactor, but it wasn't a business priority. I also wanted to introduce tests since there weren't any at all, but it wasn't a business priority. Anyway, after trying to take initiative on these things and being blocked, I handled things without much tact, empathy, or whatever else is necessary to maintain good relations with people. Eventually I was fired.The most recent job I thought was going to be better. It took me 7.5 months to get it and I liked the industry it was in and the novelty of the service they offered. The code was better than at the other company, and there was more room to make code changes I felt were important to make (after making a Jira ticket myself first). About midway through I got to greenfield a frontend for an internal software overhaul, and it was pretty cool honestly. But then the head of engineering was fired and never replaced, and another engineer that I got to know somewhat was fired without backfill. At one point I was split between a new modern website the company was building and the greenfield internal project, which signaled that I was valuable, but I also couldn't handle it. We had only two frontend devs, myself and a more junior person, working on two huge projects, both rewrites meant to modernize software that had been tried and true for 15+ years.I was in a good position on the one hand, but on the other I just got burned out. Both projects had unrealistic deadlines given our dev resources. Engineering leadership felt non-existent since the fired head was never replaced. I couldn't balance the responsibilities with the rest of my life, which includes daughters aged 1 and 3.Then, since I was so frustrated by what was happening, I told the Owner/Founder of the company, who also wrote most of the original code, that we weren't going to hit the deadline, plus some other thoughts. He actually was open to what I was saying and he ended up convening a 2 hour meeting where we changed course with the internal project, and he thanked me for speaking up. I should have felt good about this, but everyone else on the project looked upset with me. At some point, it became clear to me they didn't approve of what I did for some reason, and they wouldn't tell me why, or in some cases talk to me at all. This became an unbearable situation for me and I ended up resigning.Throughout these two experiences, I had a lot of negative thoughts and kind of vented at people more than is helpful. Looking back, my intentions and my technical performance seem fine, but I just went about it all in a disruptive and heavy-handed way. I wanted to bring about change, but I didn't want to be patient in the process, and I assumed ill intent by others when it probably could have been explained by incompetence, ignorance, or simply an unfortunate set of circumstances.Now I'm in this all too familiar position of lacking employment. AI is ravaging all except senior+ positions, and my two shots at senior responsibilities did not go well on the whole. I can probably get there, but it would take more time than I have to invest, realistically. The amount of coaching, therapy, preparation, and practice I'd need to land a job, and more importantly to succeed in it, feels overwhelming. We don't have much help with the kids, and daycare is WAY too expensive.What's the path now? It's not like it once was where the only huge hurdle was passing an interview. I've failed at two roles now, even if I feel there were positive aspects. I've replayed the reasons for these outcomes dozens of times in my head, and the positive things too, but the poor end results remain.",

In Canada, 240K USD is a crazy amount, especially for a New Grad - it's about about how much Google & Apple pays for senior engineers.**Which offer should I choose?** I'd love to hear all of your opinions. Especially if you're a Canadian who has worked in the US before (and either stayed or come back to Canada after a few years).\\---**Edit:** Someone in the comments said that my usage of big tech was too broad. To clarify, the company I was referring to is one of the leading LLM model companies in the US. There's very few, so take your guess.**Edit 2:** I'm obviously just gonna put \"Software Engineer\" on my resume if I accept the Canadian company offer, not \"Tech Lead\". I'm 100% not claiming I'm anywhere near as experienced as a senior software engineer. This is just the title the company gives me, which is why I put it in the post.**Edit 3:** The startup is more stable than the US company because they've existed for a decade without firing/laying off a single person. I guess they're more of a small business than a startup since they've been around for awhile.",

        "content": "I joined a tech startup as a Data Analyst in mid-April 2025 so it’s been about 2 months. Just found out there’s a 50% company-wide layoff happening and we’ll know who’s impacted in 10 days. I'm pretty stressed out and anxious because I've heard that the last to get hired is usually the first to get fired.Before this, I was unemployed for a year (after graduating in April 2024). To cover the gap, I listed some freelancing work on my resume. I did work on 2–3 small projects, but the contributions were honestly pretty minimal(it was more about filling the gap while job hunting).Now I’m wondering:* Do I include **my current job on my resume** if I get laid off after just 2 months?* Is that better than keeping the freelancing gap longer? So basically saying that I freelanced from April 2025- June 2025* Or does having a super short job stint raise more questions than it’s worth?* Any other tips or advice that you might have",

Let’s see if the folks here can change my view.If you want specific natural language instructions on what code to generate, why sell the product to programmers? Why should they program in natural languages over the programming languages they are already productive in? It, also, causes learning loss in new programmers like handing a calculator to a kid learning arithmetic.If you are selling the ability to program in natural language to non-programmers, you need a much more mature product that generates and maintains production-grade code because non-programmers don’t understand architecture or how to maintain or debug code.If you are selling the ability to automate repetitive tasks, how is GenAI superior to a vast amount of tooling already on the market?The only application that makes sense to me is a “buddy” that does tasks you are not proficient at - generating test cases for programmers, explaining code etc. But, then, it has limits in how good it is.It appears companies have decided to buy into a product that is not fully mature and can get in the way of getting work done.

        "author": "Seinhauser",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I waited a while before making this post because it didn't feel real at first, and felt like it could all be taken away. But it's been a short while so maybe I feel okay sharing now. Hope I don't jinx it.I was laid off in October of 2024 from a small consulting company. The company had been contracted at a \\[big tech company\\] for my first year there, and then work dried up so I ended up doing something else for the company. Though, \\[big tech company\\] legally requires that as a contractor, when describing work experience, you're not allowed to say you work for \\[big tech company\\]... you have to point out you are contracted by another company, at \\[big tech company\\]. In other words, my work experience leading up to my job hunt was:* \\[big tech company\\], contracted by \\[consulting company \\] (1 year)* \\[consulting company\\] (1 year)I have severe imposter syndrome, get stuck on Leetcode mediums, feel like I don't possess anything that really makes me special. I've **never** interviewed for a big company before, as I never imagined I could even qualify through technical screenings. I didn't do much job interview research either, other than the \"Blind 75\" lineup of Leetcode problems.I frequently see people saying doing X or being Y will ruin your chances of getting a job, but I went a step further and really made some major \"mistakes\" during my interviews. So here I was incredibly lucky that things worked out. So the point of this post is just to highlight the absurdity and randomness that can factor into your search. So just believe anything can happen, apply to anything, and be optimistic. Things I see around this sub that people say will hurt your odds, and I did ALL of them.* Two column resume layout* Not a \"top\" school, public (ranked 30-40)* Work at contracting companies* Told every interviewer that asked, that I was laid off* Late to an interview by 5 minutes* Less than average Leetcode skills (50 easy, 50 medium, 3 hard)But with each failed interview, I clearly knew where I was lacking, and took home lessons that I focused on hard for the next interview. For example, my first interview was with a FAANG company, and it was my first interview in YEARS, let alone my first interview with a big tech company. I was stuttering and stumbling over my words. The company is heavy on behavioral questions so I totally embarrassed myself. I started practicing my storytelling a lot.With the next, a medium-sized tech company, I was really enjoying the interview and things were going well. I scheduled each round 2+ weeks away to maximize my preparation time for each one. Just before the hiring manager round, I was told that another candidate accepted an offer and they were cancelling the rest of my interviews. Lesson learned: I should be prepared before any interview is scheduled, and schedule everything at my first availability.I ended up giving interviews for 6 medium-to-large companies, and received 2 offers. One from FAANG and one from a comparable company. It took me around 7 months – I just accepted an offer in April, and started working a month ago. Both offers were way better than anything I was making before, to the point where I felt relieved I didn't make it through the Amazon interview.I just want to remind everyone that luck is a major factor in the interview process. Good luck everyone, don't give up and remember anything can happen.",

I couldn't be more excited and grateful (but also a bit nervous).I've never had an industry expererience (or even an internship). All my undergrad and grad years were spent in research, although I picked up a lot of coding skills along the way. I ultimately chose this role as it seemed like the best fit for my goals compared to the other offers I was considering.Since this is my first day “in the wild,” I have no clue what to expect or how to set myself up for success. I'd love any advice on:1. Anything I should do on the first day to create a good, lasting impression?2. Beyond coming early, leaving late, and generally working my ass in-person and at home these first few months, is there anything else I can do to shine?3. Any pitfalls that you wish you'd have known about?4. Is there anything you wish you’d have known when you started your first SWE position?I'd love any advice—even if it seems super basic/obvious. Since I have no knowledge of industry, I want to make sure I'm setting myself up for success.Thanks in advance for pointing a clueless newbie in the right direction!(P.S.

        "author": "SheSaidTechno",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi everyone !In the French tech industry — especially in software engineering — companies relies massively on external contractors through infamous service companies called ESNs (between us, we call these companies \"les marchands de viande\" (translation : 'meat dealers')). But does this model exist to the same extent in the US, Canada, UK, Australia..., or do companies there prefer a more direct approach to hiring ?**Here’s how it typically works in France, and why it feels problematic :*** **Heavy use of ESNs (consulting companies)** : Most engineers work on long-term projects (sometimes several years) for client companies, but are officially employees of a consulting company* **Claimed flexibility** : Companies say it’s easier to end a contractor’s mission but the same is true for permanent employees on a trial period* **Supposed lighter HR workload** : In theory, ESNs handle hiring, but the client still interviews and evaluates candidates themselves* **\"Temporary\" reinforcement :** Most missions last so long that consultants become de facto internal staff but without the benefits or recognitionIn reality, the drawbacks are significant :* **More expensive** over time than hiring internal staff* **Little to no training** from ESNs : consultants have to upskill on their own* **High job insecurity** : consultants can be removed or relocated with very little notice* **A general lack of respect** : Many ESNs treat software engineers like interchangeable resources rather than skilled professionals. Since a business developer gets a 2000€ bonus each time he places a consultant on a project, some business developers may not give a fuck whether the mission matches the consultant’s skills or career goals or if the project is far from the consultant's home. And if the mission fails put all the blame on the consultant. Btw, since ESN have to pay compensations to fire an employee, their \"secret\" technique to get rid of an someone is to repeatedly relocate consultants across the country to uninteresting projects, hoping the employee will eventually resign on their own. But I won't elaborate on all the bad practices of ESNs in this post, because I could write a whole book on this subject.* **And definitely the worst of all : LOWER SALARIES** compared to internal employees with similar skills. Half the money the consultant earns goes to the ESN.This system creates a kind of vicious circle :low pay —> less savings —> more pressure to accept poor conditions —> repeatAt the end, I don’t see who actually wins here aside from the ESN profiting from both sides.**The English-speaking countries model (as I understand it)*** Companies hire engineers as full-time employees, even for short-term needs — it's the 'hire quick, fire quick' approach* There's less protection, but also more autonomy and transparency* Workers can earn higher salaries because there’s no intermediary between them and the employerTo me, this seems healthier even if it’s more unstable.But maybe it's just an impression, so I’d really like to know : Is this accurate ?**To sum up, my questions for engineers in English-speaking countries :**1. Do companies rely heavily on contractors, or is direct hiring the norm ?2. Are there equivalents to the French-style ESN system ?3. Does the “hire quick, fire quick” approach actually make the work more efficient ?I’m asking all this out of curiosity and a bit of frustration. This is quite a hot topic in France. Here, the current system seems to serve the interests of consulting firms more than the people actually doing the work. So I wonder : is the “Anglo-American” model actually better, or does it simply have different drawbacks ? Because honestly, if the French model turns out to be significantly worse for building a career, I'm seriously considering moving abroad to have a decent quality of life.Looking forward to reading your perspectives.Thanks in advance!",

In both technical rounds, I was able to explain my logic clearly and write working code. However, I've noticed that I take a bit of time to fully understand the problem, ask clarifying questions, and walk through my approach. This usually takes around 10 to 15 minutes, so by the time I start coding, there's only about 10 to 15 minutes left to finish up and answer any follow-up questions (for each question).In mock rounds with friends, the main feedback I received was that I start coding too late. At first, I thought that was okay since I’m still a new grad and learning, but now I wonder if interviewers expect someone faster and someone who's a perfectionist. Even when I do well, I feel like taking extra time to think things through or making rare syntax mistakes might be working against me.",

While I'm underqualified for most regular SWE and traditional DS jobs. And due to the nature of research internships, there could never be a return offer.Most of my undergrad was focused on research: computational geology with publications, pure math, applied ML. Right now, I’m working in one of the top ML labs in Europe under a well known prof. I’m part of a joint project with a big pharma company for cancer drug discovery LLM. Before this, I did a research internship on protein design using Transformers (similar to AlphaFold) at an institute here, and another ML Research Engineer internship at a biotech startup in Toronto, which I got by cold emailing them.The problem is, my current contract ends in December, and I don’t know what’s next. I didn’t get into the master’s program at my own school, and I’m not sure I’ll get into Waterloo either.Most of the people (PhDs) in our lab have published at top conferences, they’re doing internships at like Anthropic, DeepMind, Meta AI, etc.I asked my prof if I could work on a theoretical ML paper and he said yes. The PhD girl I’m supposed to work with is on an internship, so I’m gonna be doing most of it alone. Although knowing the lab's track record we should be able to get it published in top conferences.I started doing Leetcode a couple months ago for the first time, tbh its not that bad. But regardless, I feel too researchy for many engineering jobs, but also not experienced enough for industry research roles.I had a recruiter reach out from DE Shaw Research (the hedge fund's biomedical arm) and after the interview he was like you're too research focused for a data engineer position and dont have a PhD for a researcher positions.I'm in Switzerland right now, where most of my network is but because of their immigration laws the government won't approve a work permit even if i find a job, and I don’t really know anyone working in ML back in Canada outside of academia. Since my profs network is predominantly the big AI companies im not sure id be able to get far even if he could get me an interviews with any of them which itself is a huge \"if.\"I feel like im racing against the clock with no options left.TLDR: Too ML research focused without grad school and underqualified for regular SWE and non-ML DS.",

My lead was away. I took the initiative to pull ArgoCD credentials from AWS Secrets and started troubleshooting. It wasn’t reckless, just needed. Client first. When my lead came back, he blew up.

I’ve started building my own projects and am studying for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate cert. I want to be intentional now. Not wasting time on random thimgs.

Are you mostly just training ML models? Is this just similar to interacting with an api? Are there opportunities in this field as a web developer?Again, I know next to nothing about AI/ML so some of these questions may sound stupid lol. Thanks! :)",

I thought I did badly because I didn’t actually have any working code but walked through my thought process. I actually passed and moved on to the next step.The next step is 1 technical screen, 2 coding, 1 architecture and design, and a behavioral interview. So what should I expect for the next coding interviews? I’m sort of confused because they say study LeetCode problems, but they also said that for the last interview, and that wasn’t LeetCode and was more JavaScript problems. Also, if they are LeetCode, do you have to have a working solution to continue, or is talking through the code and writing some code enough? I’m not good with LeetCode; this is the first time I have ever done this before. I never did them in college. What should I expect? Is this supposed to be extremely more difficult?",

While I know I'll be spammed with '400 isnt nearly enough' I still want to do what I can to improve my odds, of course I am still applying and will continue to till I get something.I have heard its better to look in the US. I was already considering this due to having a lot of family in NY and was applying from linkedIn to both Canada and NYC. I know to check the 'authorized to work here' as yes and to check 'sponsorship needed' as no (then later explain that you're a Canadian and a TN visa is far easier) but despite that I've only gotten 1 response from the US. I'm sure my resume isn't perfect, but I've had some Sr engineers that I've gotten to know over the years as well as a recruiter I know well look it over and say its quite good for a new grad especially the 2 years of industry experience so I don't think its holding me back.I've heard someone mention to apply to US from LinkedIn you need to buy a US phone number or you get filtered instantly. Furthermore I've noticed of course my LinkedIn profile has my location as within Canada, I figure I'd have to change this too but currently I'm applying everywhere in Canada and in NY and I worry doing that will then blacklist me from Canadian roles and I just don't know if that's a good idea? I also worry that maybe thats just uneeded steps and has nothing to do with why I'm hearing nothing from the US applications.Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated. While I would love to be picky with a job the reality is I'm graduating in a few days and I need income asap to support myself and start my career, at this point I just want to break into the industry idc where or the salary I just need to get my foot in the door.",

In general, I would expect finance to be a little more toxic and demanding but from what I hear tech has gotten to that point itself. Overall, if you were someone whos worked in both, is there a major difference and how much did it impact your satisfaction with your role?",

        "content": "Hi,my current software development job requires me to work with three different repositories, each is in different programming language, each has it's own micropatches, tweaks and peculiarities.Our testing flow for new features basically requires me to run code from one repo, to use stuff that was built locally in other repo, and third repo is basically a locally hosted backend. The thing is: patching and making a small change here in there is required, just so I can then easily analyze the results and the whole flow can actually run without problems.Also, the testing results need to be noted down manually...In some cases I had opened at least five different VS Code instances opened, each with multiple files opened st once. I am not counting the browsers and other apps.I find this extremely exhausting and tiresome to even test one feature since everything needs to be in sync. This really makes me lose my sanity with each flow I run, show to the general public at work, but then I actually need to correct my findings since I noticed a bug in one of the patches in one of the repos. I don't think if I should waste so much time with running that testing flow, where it is mostly expeced of me to create new features and fixes, not to struggle to manage mentally my attention between that many windows.In most of my career, or even in my free time programming - I mostly end up working comfortably and window-exhaustion never gets me. This current job I have pays extremely well, but chaos in the work organization is scary.Am I just bad with multitasking and juggling between repos? Is this normal? I don't have a comparison and I really don't know how to deal with it, can anybody relate or suggest what is wrong here, and how can I help myself?",

        "content": "Hello I am IT consultant specializing in data engineering. In this topic, I would like to know what effective communication or soft skillsmeans to you, how to practice it and how to present it. During each half or full year evaluation, my direct manager comes to me with feedback on what the client(s) and other colleagues (usually senior managers) have said about me - it is always along these lines: technically exceptional but should work on communication. I tried to ask what does it mean but got only vague answers.On my part, I am always nice and open to other people - at least thats what I think of myself, but sometimes I have to draw a thick line when, for example: someone entrusts me with a task that goes beyond my competence or scope of duties - think of setting up infrastructure, when its managed by client infra team and I got no permissions. Of course, I do not say \"no\" leaving the person alone with the problem, I suggest who can help and how to do it, sometimes I even engage people to help. I have the impression that any objection, which is not really an objection, and I really cannot do certain things myself, is perceived as my flaw. Of course, it doesn't work the other way around - sometimes people, like the product owner from the client's side, doesn't speak kindly to me, or uses micromanagement but it's fine, no one pays attention to it, arguing \"it is what it is, he was probably nervous\". If the situation were reversed, I would probably be removed from the project. Often, even despite previous suggestions that something might go wrong, my opinion is ignored until the thing happens and then there are complaints about it. Here I come to the conclusion that communication is simply taking everything upon yourself, nodding to everything (being a yes-man) and pretending that everything is going well, even when it isn't? I don't think so, that's why I'm asking you. I would be grateful for any feedback and materials regarding soft skills and communication.",

        "author": "Gapmeister",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I got my first dev job after college by basically just saying I had taken a few classes on LLVM. I spent my time there working on an AI compiler stack (Torch-MLIR) doing relatively menial things like implementing ops and fixing packaging issues. After 2 years with the company, it got bought by AMD. The team's focus shifted away from the flagship product and into more internal things, leaving me as one of the few people working on it. Since there wasn't much development happening, I worked mostly on GUI and even less on compilation. Then, after a year at AMD, I got laid off. I haven't been able to find work in almost 8 months now.There were a number of reasons for my layoff, I think. I was one of the only people on the team without a Master's degree. I've been having ADHD issues that caused my performance to drop for a month or two before the layoff. But more importantly, I don't think I had the skills to keep up with the trajectory of the team. Everyone was moving off of supporting models on hardware and onto optimization and other such stuff internal to AMD. And as I've gotten out into the field again, a field that's changed a lot since 2021, I find that I'm lacking basically everything I'd need to get another compiler job.I don't have a Master's, I don't have any optimization knowledge. My expertise is PyTorch, Torch-MLIR, and IREE. PyTorch knowledge is useful, but only insofar as it applies to building models. Torch-MLIR and IREE seem to just not be used by anyone but my former company, and now no one at all. Hell, AMD's even hiring for my old position. I've applied and been denied multiple times.I really like compilers, but if there's no future in this for me I'll switch to doing something else. Can anyone give me some advice on this? I've tried asking my old coworkers for career advice but none of them have responded, and I'm starting to get desperate.[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/cHA7eV9.jpeg) my resume.",

I found computers cool when I was a kid and liked the idea of building programs that could do stuff. I am/was an average student in school and didn't create a new programming language when I was 13. I was oblivious about IT taking over the world and didn't know anything about programming until I was 17. I studied Comp Sci in an average university in my hometown and passed with average grades. I took a software dev job in a small firm with an average pay. I was suffering with a severe inferiority complex because I wasn't exceptional.I moved to Germany from India to pursue a master's degree in CS and left my job. Now I see people from all over the world doing amazing stuff. I'm sitting in a class where there are undergrads who are 18 years old, who have been coding since they were 12 (real nerds), interned at big tech or selling their own SaaS products. I'm 26 and barely know 3 programming languages. It takes me quite a lot of time to understand mathematical concepts. I'm happy that I'm now exposed to rigorous math stuff which I skimmed through in undergrad, but still I feel lagging so far behind.To people who aren't computer nerds but have a decent career while managing other interests, how did you make it? How do you not get disappointed with yourself when people who are much younger than you are faring far ahead in their career? Is being average okay in a field where we compete with millions of people all over the world and also a looming threat of AI taking over our jobs?",

Since i am from a third world country, there are only handful of game dev companies and the pay doesn't scale very good. And every post i read about game dev career is horror story about employee exploitation one after another.I am in second last year of my college and was thinking of switching to .net since i am experienced with c# and there are more opportunities in such roles. But the problem is there are 0 internships opening. Every job opening i see are asking for 4-8+ of experience in required field. I just read yesterday that for a single QA traineeship role there were 5k applicants for a big named company. Everyone is familiar with the current job market situation. So here is my problem - a good mobile dev company who has 100m+ downloads in the appstore has opened a hiring post for a developer. I am in dilemma whether to join it looking at the market condition or keep grinding and keep on applying on other fields??(asking for a friend u/ElectricalAnt3 because he couldn't post here due to reddit karma restrictions)",

So I’m hoping to find 1 or 2 people (max) who are also committed to prepping regularly and want to hold each other accountable. Ideally, we’d meet at least twice a week to mock interview, share progress, and keep each other on track to practice daily until the end of the year.I know it’s not January 1st, but I still think we can crush this goal in 2025. I’m based in the US (EST), so I’d prefer folks in the same time zone to avoid scheduling issues.

The only thing is - maybe i'm trippin' and maybe I did absolutely fine overall....?",

        "content": "Hello. I have an issue as most people in my age who finished the university like me. Everytime I find an entry job or even an internship on linkedin, it requires 2 years of experience it drives me nuts in technologies they didn't publicly released.I have github account with projects, decent cv with 2-3 personal projects and diploma in engineering. Even with that, I find many aspects of job search irritating, like the multiple questions about my background if I'm white, black, Latino, to complete again my cv details in forms and even to make multiple accounts in job boards.Everytime I complete the 1st job interview, they reject me with a typical rejection email, even the recruiter says that I did well or ghost me completely. Are there any alternatives to job search?",

        "content": "Graduated May 25 and I am currently doing an internship (SWE, company knows I graduated). There is an internal listing for Cyber Security Engineer, but the description also uses \"*Cyber Security Compliance Analyst*\". I had no luck applying for SWE NG roles before graduation, but now with an internship on my resume, I am hoping I have more luck this coming cycle. But I wonder if it would be worth going for the Cyber Security role or if it could hurt my chances trying to get into SWE. I want to have applicable work experience, but given my lack of experience, any tech opportunity might be one worth taking. Thoughts?",

        "content": "Hey guys, I’m about to begin my senior year and am looking for some advice on how to prepare for the job market. I’m a pure math major and for a long time I was dead set on doing a math PhD, but have since realized that it’s not for me (at least for now). I’ve recently re-discovered my love of programming and have been thinking more and more that I’d enjoy a job in the programming realm. I love math and am pretty good at it (3 semesters of linear algebra, high level stats/prob, 2 semesters of abstract algebra, etc.), and have a decent programming background. I’m well versed in C/C++ and Python, and have done a few projects for fun in the past (game engines, emulators, some tensorflow stuff). Although people tell me I could land a job, I’m not as hopeful. Looking through entry-level job listings, the sheer number of possible technologies / frameworks I’d need to know is so vast, and I have no idea where to begin. Should I focus my efforts on one niche area and spend the next year learning it super well, or should I dip my toes in as much as possible? If anyone else went from pure math to a programming role I’d love to know what your path was like",

        "content": "Hi everyone,I’m a Java backend developer with 1 year of experience, specializing in Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes, and Python. I previously worked at XYZ MNC, but due to personal reasons, I had to take a break. Now, I’m eager to transition back into tech full-time, but the job market has been tough.Despite applying to many job portals, responses have been scarce—or the offers come with extremely high expectations for a near-fresher or significantly low CTC. Instead of waiting indefinitely, I want to build real-world experience through side projects, contributing my skills to meaningful work.Currently, I have a stable but low-paying non-tech job, so I can’t commit full-time—but I can dedicate 2-3 hours daily + more on Sundays to collaborative projects or side projects where I can apply my backend development expertise. I also have some exposure to C++ from LeetCode, so I’m comfortable tackling algorithmic challenges if needed.I’m open to projects where I can assist with backend development, API integration, database management, and containerized deployments. If you’re working on an interesting project and need help, I’d love to contribute—free of charge, purely for learning and experience.Feel free to DM or reply here.",
