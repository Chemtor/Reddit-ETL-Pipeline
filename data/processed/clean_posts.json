And I know that my team will be held responsible for these errors, even though their use is imposed and they are inevitable.Here are a few examples that we are working on across the team and that are currently suffering from this:* Data Extraction from PDFs/Websites: We used to use a case-by-case approach with things like regex, keywords, and stopwords, which was highly reliable. Now, we're using LLMs that are more flexible but make many more mistakes.* Fuzzy Matching: Matching strings, like customer names, was a deterministic process. LLMs are being used instead, and they're less accurate.* Data Categorization: We had fixed rules or supervised models trained for high-accuracy classification of products and events. The new LLM-based approach is simply less precise.The technology we had before was accurate and predictable. This new direction is trading reliability for perceived innovation, and the business is suffering for it. The board doesn't want us to apply specific solutions to specific problems anymore; they want the magical LLM black box to solve everything in a generic way.",

        "content": "Hi everyone!Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve been working on a small library that generates **column-level lineage** from SQL queries **directly in the browser**.The idea came from wanting to leverage column-level lineage **on the front-end** — for things like visualizing data flows or propagating business metadata.Now, I know there are already great tools for this, like [sqlglot](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot) or the [OpenLineage SQL parser](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/tree/main/integration/sql). But those are built for Python or Java. That means if you want to use them in a browser-based app, you either:* Stand up an API to call them, or* Run a Python runtime in the browser via something like Pyodide (which feels a bit heavy when you just want some metadata in JS :smiling_face_with_tear:)This got me thinking — there’s still a pretty big gap between **data engineering tooling** and **front-end use cases**. We’re starting to see more tools ship with WASM builds, but there’s still a lot of room to grow an ecosystem here.I’d love to hear if you’ve run into similar gaps.If you want to check it out (or see a partially “vibe-coded” demo :grinning_face_with_sweat:), here are the links:* [Repo](https://github.com/nickBes/meta-sql)* [Demo](https://nickbes.github.io/meta-sql/)**Note:** The library is still experimental and may change significantly.",

Now I've become curious as to it's usecases and found a few confusing comparison, which lead me to two different questions still unanswered:1. Is DuckDB really a database? I saw multiple posts on this subreddit and elsewhere that showcased it's comparison with tools like Polars, and that people have used DuckDB for local data wrangling because of its SQL support. Point is, I wouldn't compare Postgresql to Pandas, for example, so this is confusion 1. 2. Is it another alternative to Dataframe APIs, which is just using SQL, instead of actual code? Due to numerous comparison with Polars (again), it kinda raises a question of it's possible use in ETL/ELT (maybe integrated with dbt). In my mind Polars is comparable to Pandas, PySpark, Daft, etc, but certainly not to a tool claiming to be an RDBMS.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey guys,I want to share with you the latest Quantum Odyssey update (I'm the creator, ama..) for the work we did since my last post (4 weeks ago), to sum up the state of the game. Thank you everyone for receiving this game so well and all your feedback has helped making it what it is today. This project grows because this community exists.In a nutshell, this is an interactive way to visualize and play with the full Hilbert space of anything that can be done in \"quantum logic\". Pretty much any quantum algorithm can be built in and visualized. The learning modules I created cover everything, the purpose of this tool is to get everyone to learn quantum by connecting the visual logic to the terminology and general linear algebra stuff.Although still in Early Access, now it should be completely bug free and everything works as it should. From now on I'll focus solely on building features requested by players.Game now teaches:1. Linear algebra - vector-matrix multiplication, complex numbers, pretty much everything about SU2 group matrices and their impact on qubits by visually seeing the quantum state vector at all times.2. Clifford group (rotations X, Z , S, Y, Hadamard), SX , T and you can see the Kronecker product for any SU2 group combinations up to 2\\^5 and their impact on any given quantum state for up to 5 qubits in Hilbert space.3. All quantum phenomena and quantum algorithms that are the result of what the math implies. Every visual generated on the screen is 1:1 to the linear algebra behind (BV, Grover, Shor..)4. Sandbox mode allows absolutely anything to be constructed using both complex numbers and polars.5. Now working on setting up some ideas for weekly competitions in-game. Would be super cool if we could have some real use cases that we can split in up to 5 qubit state compilation/ decomposition problems and serve these through tournaments.. but it might be too early lmk if you got ideas.TL;DR: 60h+ of actual content that takes this a bit beyond even what is regularly though in Quantum Information Science classes Msc level around the world (the game is used by 23 universities in EU via [https://digiq.hybridintelligence.eu/](https://digiq.hybridintelligence.eu/) ) and a ton of community made stuff. You can literally read a science paper about some quantum algorithm and port it in the game to see its Hilbert space or ask players to optimize it.Improvements in the past 4 weeks:In-game quotes now come from contemporary physicists. If you have some epic quote you'd like to add to the game (and your name, if you work in the field) for one of the puzzles do let me know. This was some super tedious work (check this patch update [https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2802710/view/539987488382386570?l=english](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2802710/view/539987488382386570?l=english) )Big one:We started working on making an offline version that is snycable to the Steam version when you have an internet connection that will be delivered in two phases:Phase 1: Asynchronous Gameplay FlowWe're introducing a system where you no longer have to necessarily wait for the server to respond with your score and XP after each puzzle. These updates will be handled asynchronously, letting you move straight to the next puzzle. This should improve the experience of players on spotty internet connections!Phase 2: Fully Offline ModeWe’re planning to support full offline play, where all progress is saved locally and synced to the server once you're back online. This means you’ll be able to enjoy the game uninterrupted, even without an internet connectionWhy the game requires an internet connection atm?Single player is just the learning part - which can only be done well by seeing how players solve things, how long they spend on tutorials and where they get stuck in game, not to mention this is an open-ended puzzle game where new solutions to old problems are discovered as time goes on. I want players to be rewarded for inventing new solutions or trying to find those already discovered, stuff that requires online and alerts that new solves were discovered. The game branches into bounty hunting (hacking other players) and community content creation/ solving/ rewards after that, currently. A lot more in the future, if things go well.We wanted offline from the start but it was practically not feasible since simply nailing down a good learning curve for quantum computing one cannot just \"guess\".",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "This article and many others say that Databricks is much faster/cheaper than Snowflake. [https://medium.com/dbsql-sme-engineering/benchmarking-etl-with-the-tpc-di-snowflake-cb0a83aaad5b](https://medium.com/dbsql-sme-engineering/benchmarking-etl-with-the-tpc-di-snowflake-cb0a83aaad5b)So I am new to Databricks, and still just in the initial exploring stages. But I have been using Snowflake for quite a while now for my job. The thing I dont understand is how is Databricks faster when running a query than on Snowflake.The Scenario I am thinking is - I got lets say 10 TB of CSV data in an AWS S3 bucket., and I have no choice in the file format or partitioning. Let us say it is some kind of transaction data, and the data is stored partitioned by **DATE** (but I might be not interested in filtering based on Date, I could be interested in filtering by Product ID).1. Now on Snowflake, I know that I have to ingest the data into a Snowflake Internal Table. This converts the data into a columnar Snowflake proprietary format, which is best suited for Snowflake to read the data. Lets say I cluster the table on Date itself, resembling a similar file partition as on the S3 bucket. But I enable search optimization on the table too. 2. Now if I am to do the same thing on Databricks (Please correct me if I am wrong), Databricks doesnt create any proprietary database file format. It uses the underlying S3 bucket itself as data, and creates a table based on that. It is not modified to any database friendly version. **(Please do let me know if there is a way to convert data to a database friendly format similar to Snowflake on Databricks).**Considering that Snowflake makes everything SQL query friendly, and Databricks just has a bunch of CSV files in an S3 bucket, for the comparable size of compute on both, how can Databricks be faster than Snowflake? What magic is that? Or am I thinking about this completely wrong and using or not knowing the functionality Databricks has? In terms of the use case scenario, I am not interested in Machine learning in this context, just pure SQL execution on a large database table. I do understand Databricks is much better for ML stuff.",

        "content": "I started working at a pretty respected company about three years ago. There was never really a proper learning pathway here. It is more of a watch and try to do it yourself type of setup. Over time I have built a decent number of reports and have become one of the few people on the team who consistently does actual work. Out of a team of 10 it feels like only about three of us really contribute. Honestly it is kind of crazy.The biggest issue I am dealing with is the most senior guy on the team. For some reason he seems to have it out for me. I have taken feedback from plenty of stakeholders without any problem. They treat me with respect. But this guy is never happy with anything I do. I can follow his instructions exactly and he still finds something to criticise. He has even called me names in front of the team and regularly insults my work. I am not claiming to be the best data engineer in the world but I do put in the effort. Meanwhile there are people on the team who have not done real work in months yet he treats them like gold.The tricky part is that despite how he treats me he is the only person I can really go to for help because he knows everything. The problem is if he is wrong about something he will just double down and act like he is right. For example last week he claimed we could not use Power BI for a report because the stakeholder’s PC could not handle it even though I am pretty sure most of the heavy lifting is done by PowerBI.com.The team has been together for over 30 years so even if I went to HR I doubt anyone would back me up. And the newer people would not want to stir the pot since they have it easy getting paid for doing almost nothing.I have mentioned my concerns to my line manager and he says that I am being to sensitive to the feedback on my work and its just how the guy is. There may be some truth to that, but its kinda hard to take feedback when every other comment is laced with a snide/condescending comment Some of the team members say that he's been talking about me on calls for hours after I leave, and I told him that it makes me feel like I am not safe here, to which he said \"That's because you are not safe x\" and the entire call went silent. I also kinda wanted to ask if anyone had gone down the HR path before with this kinda problem? any advice appreciated",

Democratizing our data reporting in this way has been a huge time-saver for me, and we're slowly cutting down on the number of custom report requests we get from users and other departments because they realize they already have access to what they need. Big win. Maybe AI-generated reports could increase this time savings if it were offered as a tool to data consumers? * Has anyone had experience using AI to *effectively* handle any of the reporting steps? * Report generation seems like one of those fiddly things where AI could be used - does it do better for cosmetic changes to reporting than it does for field mapping and/or generating calculated fields? * Any advice on how to incorporate AI so that it's actually time-saving and not a new headache?",

Everytime I ask for clarifying questions all i get in response is another question. Nobody is willing to be assertive and I have to reach out to my manager for every small details pertaining to business logic. Thankfully my manager is helful in such scenarios. Technically team mates lack lots of skills,they once laughed that nobody knows SQL on the team to which I was flabbergasted. They certainly lack skills in docker, kubernetes, general database, networking concepts and even basic unit testing, sometimes its really trivial stuff. Now thanks to copilot they are atleast able to sort it out but it really takes considerable time that just keeps delaying our project. Some of the updates that I get in daily stand ups are quite ridiculous like \"I am updating the tables in a database\" for almost 2 weeks which is basically 1 table with regular append. Code is copy pasta from other code bases when I question their implementation i am directed to a different code base from where it was copied and let original author take the responsibility. Lot of times meetings get hijacked by some very trivial things, Saying a bunch of hypothetical things but adding nothing of value.Sometimes it really gets on my nerves. Is this how a normal functioning team looks like? How do you deal with such team members? Sometimes I feel I should just ignore which i do to a degree when it does not impact my work but then ultimately it is causing delays in delivering the project which is very much doable within the timelines. There is definitely atleast 1 person on the team who is a complete misfit for a data engineering role however for god knows why they choose that person. It does seem like typical corporate BS where people portray they are doing a lot when they are not. Apologies for the rant but like I said sometimes it really gets on my nerves with the way this team operates.Just looking for tips how to tackle such members/culture and should some of this \"in efficiencies\" be called out to my manager?",

        "content": "HiI work on core data ingestion project which is the gateway for all internal/external data providers’s data to come through. Our data platform is completely built on data bricks. We have a basic UI that is built using retool. This UI handles users upto 1000 (light weight operations), and it currently uses dynamoDb as its backend. We are planning to move to Azure in future, so wondering which back end database would be a good choice. Our top options are Postgres and mongoDb. Postgres is less expensive, and offers good features of a traditional transactional database.However, dynamoDb to Postgres migration would require a lot of functional changes as we move from a Nosql to an RDS. Could someone please weigh in like pros and cons of these two?Another unusual idea floated was - using data bricks as the backend for the UI. Though I am not a fan of this idea only because of the fact that Databricks is an analytical database, not sure how it might handle concurrency of UI application. But, I might be wrong here, is Databricks good at handling these concurrent requests with low-latency ? Need everyone’s valuable opinion here.Thanks in advance.",

The author also shared this idea in his \"Turning the database inside-out\" talkThis journey convinces me that stream processing is not only suitable for data analysis pipelines but also for building high-performance, consistent backend services.I am curious about your industry experience from the data engineer perspective.DDIA was published in 2017, but from my limited observation in 2025* In Taiwan, stream processing is generally not a required skill for seeking backend jobs.* I worked in a company that had 1000(I guess?) backend engineers across Taiwan, Singapore, and Germany. Most services use RPC to communicate.* In system design tutorials on the internet, I rarely find any solution based on stateful stream processing.Is there any reason this architecture is not adopted widely today?

        "content": "Hey everyone,I've been working on a command-line tool called nail-parquet that handles Parquet file operations (but actually also supports xlsx, csv and json), and I thought this community might find it useful (or at least have some good feedback).The tool grew out of my own frustration with constantly switching between different utilities and scripts when working with Parquet files. It's built in Rust using Apache Arrow and DataFusion, so it's pretty fast for large datasets.Some of the things it can do (there are currently more than 30 commands):* Basic data inspection (head, tail, schema, metadata, stats)* Data manipulation (filtering, sorting, sampling, deduplication)* Quality checks (outlier detection, search across columns, frequency analysis)* File operations (merging, splitting, format conversion, optimization)* Analysis tools (correlations, binning, pivot tables)The project has grown to include quite a few subcommands over time, but honestly, I'm starting to run out of fresh ideas for new features. Development has slowed down recently because I've covered most of the use cases I personally encounter.If you work with Parquet files regularly, I'd really appreciate hearing about pain points you have with existing tools, workflows that could be streamlined and features that would actually be useful in your day-to-day workThe tool is open source and available through simple command `cargo install nail-parquet`. I know there are already great tools out there like DuckDB CLI and others, but this aims to be more specialized for Parquet workflows with a focus on being fast and having sensible defaults.No pressure at all, but if anyone has ideas for improvements or finds it useful, I'd love to hear about it. Also happy to answer any technical questions about the implementation.Repository: [https://github.com/Vitruves/nail-parquet](https://github.com/Vitruves/nail-parquet)Thanks for reading, and sorry for the self-promotion.

I would appreciate any advice or guidance.**The Current Situation:**We have an ETL pipeline that ingests data from Firestore. The source of this data is JSON outputs generated by the OpenAI API, based on dynamic, client-specific prompts. My boss and the CTO decided that this data should be stored in structured tables in a PostgreSQL database.This architecture has led to two major problems:1. **Constant Schema Changes & Manual Work:** The JSON structure is client-dependent. Every time a client wants to add or remove a field, I receive a request to update the OpenAI prompt. This requires me to manually modify our ETL pipeline and run ALTER TABLE commands on the SQL database to accommodate the new schema.2. **Rigid Reporting Structure:** These PostgreSQL tables directly feed client-facing reports in Metabase. The tight coupling between the rigid SQL schema and the reports makes every small change a multi-step, fragile, and time-consuming process.**My Question:**How can I handle this problem more effectively? I'm looking for advice on alternative architectures or key concepts I should learn to build a more flexible system that doesn't break every time a client's requirements change.**ETL Details:*** The entire pipeline is written in Python.* The data volume is not the issue (approx. 10,000 records daily). The main pain point is the constant manual effort required to adapt to schema changes.Thank you in advance for any suggestions",

We use Google Workspace so I think the best option is using Looker Studio for data visualization. Right now we have some simple reports to allow the operations team to download real-time information from our database (AWS RDS) since they lack SQL or programming skills. The thing is these reports are connected directly to our database so the data transformation occurs directly in Looker Studio, sometimes using complex queries affects the performance causing some reports to load quite slowly.So I've been thinking maybe it's the right time for setting up a Data Warehouse. But I'm not sure if it's a good idea since our database is small (our main table storages transactions and is roughly 50.000 rows and 30 MiB). It'll obviously grow, but I wouldn't expect it to grow exponentially.Since I want to use Looker Studio, I was thinking on setting up a pipeline that replicates the database in real time using AWS DMS or something, transfer the data to Google BigQuery for transformation (I don't know what the best tool would be for this) and then use Looker Studio for visualization. Do you think this is a good idea, or would it be better to set up the data warehouse entirely in AWS and then use a Looker Studio connector to create the dashboards?What do you think?",

I have some experience with data mining: I’ve used Elsevier’s API for my MS in Chemical Engineering thesis, so I know how to structure my queries and write the code. So that’s not where I have questions.Based on how janky the job market is, I have a feeling some of you have probably tried this. Can any of you recommend some job boards that allow for this type of scraping? LinkedIn is a no-go, but Greenhouse and Lever allow for it, I think. It’s such a pain going through each website’s TOS, so it’d be super helpful to at least get a list of websites as a starting point. I’d be happy to post a link to my script when it’s finished, if anyone ends up being interested in using it.",

        "author": "gloritown7",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey folks, Crossposting here from r/python. I have a pretty general question about best practices in regards to **creating ETL pipelines with python**. My usecase is pretty simple - download big chunks of data (at least 1 GB or more), decompress it, validate it, compress it again, upload it to S3. Now my initial though was doing asyncio for downloading > asyncio.queue > multiprocessing > asyncio.queue > asyncio for uploading to S3. However it seems that this would cause a lot of pickle serialization to/from multiprocessing which doesn't seem the best idea.Besides that I thought of the following: * multiprocessing shared memory - if I read/write from/to shared memory in my asyncio workers it seems like it would be a blocking operation and I would stop downloading/uploading just to push the data to/from multiprocessing. That doesn't seem like a good idea.* writing to/from disk (maybe use mmap?) - that would be 4 operations to/from the disk (2 writes and 2 reads each), isn't there a better/faster way?* use only multiprocessing - not using asyncio could work but that would also mean that I would \"waste time\" not downloading/uploading the data while I do the processing although I could run another async loop in each individual process that does the up- and downloading but I wanted to ask here before going down that rabbit hole :))* use multithreading instead? - this can work but I'm afraid that the decompression + compression will be much slower because it will only run on one core. Even if the GIL is released for the compression stuff and downloads/uploads can run concurrently it seems like it would slower overall.I'm also open to picking something else than Python if another language has better tooling for this usecase, however since this is a general high IO + high CPU usage workload that requires sharing memory between processes I can imagine it's not the easiest on any runtime.",

        "content": "Hey, I used to work at a Scala Spark shop, and we cared a lot about code optimization, we avoided writing UDFs, ensured the vast majority of operations were using the Dataframe API when possible, and although sometimes we had to leverage UDFs that was the exception. We ran all our jobs in batch and were able to run ETL jobs where data was in the 100s of GBs in 10-15 minutes. I recently got a new job at a Java Spark shop, and we use the spark streaming API. Our code starts with a foreach, and all of our code base is assuming we're operating on a single row. But then I took a java spark udemy course and it seems like it's teaching the very thing we're doing in java. But we end up streaming \\~20gb of data and our jobs take hours. Now I know we don't even really need to use spark with data that size, but given we have a spark code base, I guess I just have a few questions:1. Is it normal in java spark to use foreach and treat each row differently, and does the java spark engine recognize common transformations written in foreach and leverage it to create a plan that operates on the larger dataframe in a performant fashion? Is the scala logic of ensuring we focus on Dataframe operations rather than row-level UDFs the same in Java? 2. Is java spark, if written well, less performant than Scala Spark? 3. Is it possible that the streaming part could make Spark less performant when looking at \\~20gb of data? We're streaming data in json format via Kafka, whereas our Spark Scala batch jobs at my old company were using data both sourced from and creating new parquet files. 2.",

Healthcare company, I know this automatically carries a premium.2. Just one source system, around 20 instances, 1 for each location. Standard enterprise healthcare software that many businesses use.3. Refresh once a day.4. Around 60GB of data, so not much, as far as my understanding goes.We want to unify this data to have a view of all the company. Right now we have a bunch of people working with Excel and it has become extremely burdensome and time consuming. What a surprise!On top of the data warehouse, we'd also like reporting, so that we can extend it in the future when we get someone that knows the reporting tool. We have no one in IT right now.Now, these are some of the offers we got and found.1. 20k and around 3 weeks: install application on each server that dumps source databases at night to a Linux VM that we purchase in our Microsoft environment, where they get processed in Postgres. Reporting they would use Power BI. Costs would be the 20k, plus VM and licenses costs on our side, nothing else unless we want their support. This sounds incredibly cheap and fast. I'm sure there are more details that I don't understand.2. ~50k and 1 month + 2k monthly: they would set us up in Snowflake and use some cloud reporting tool that I don't remember the name of.3. ~80k and around 1 month + some ongoing maintainance: similar to above, Snowflake and something else.4. ~120k and 3 weeks + 5k monthly: some pre-made application that they already implement multiple times on the same system.5. ~200k and around 3 months + maintainance: well, similar as above, Snowflake and something else.6. ~300k and anything between 3-6 months: one time payment, \"custom solution\" whatever that means, they take care of everything and give us support for 5 (yes, five) years.How am I supposed to pick between any of them. If I researched more I'm sure I would find pretty much everything in between all these... a guy I know currently hired some consultancy for 500k for some job, more complex I'm sure but still... This consultancy has like 20 directors, 15 vice directors, 20 managers, but no one technical on their team, seemingly. Most of them weren't precise about how and what they would be doing, except number 1, and he made it sound hilariously easy... I'm at a loss.",

The company I work for is pretty weird, and I'd bet most of the work I do is not quite relevant to your typical data engineer. The layman's way of describing it would be a data wrangler. I essentially capture data from certain sources that are loosely affiliated with us and organize them through pipelines to transform them into useful stuff for our own warehouses. But the tools we use aren't really the industry standard, I think?I mostly work with Python + Polars and whatever else might fit the bill. I don't really work with spark, no cloud whatsoever, and I hardly even touch SQL (though I know my way around it). I don't work on a proper \"team\" either. I mostly get handed projects and complete it on my own time. Our team works on two dedicated machines of our choice. They're mostly identical, except one physically hosts a drive that is used as an NFS drive for the other (so I usually stick to the former for lower latency). They're quite beefy, with 350G of memory each, and 40 processors each to work with (albeit lower clock speeds on them).I'm not really sure what counts as \"big data,\" but I certainly work with very large datasets. Recently I've had to work with a particularly large dataset that is 1.9BB rows. It's essentially a very large graph network, with 2/2 columns being nodes, and the row representing an outgoing edge from column\\_1 to column\\_2. I'm tasked with taking this data, identifying which nodes belong to our own data, and enhancing the graph with incoming connections as well. e.g., a few connections might be represented likeA->BA->CC->Bwhich can extrapolate to incoming connections like soB<-AB<-CA<-CWell, this is really difficult to do, despite the theoretical simplicity. It would be one thing if I just had to do this once, but the dataset is being updated daily with hundreds of thousands of records. These might be inserts, upserts, or removals. I also need to produce a \"diff\" of what was changed after an update, which is a file containing any of the records that were changed/inserted.My solution so far is to maintain two branches of hive-partitioned directories - one for outgoing edges, the other for incoming edges. The data is partitioned on a prefix of the root node, which ends up making it workable within memory (though I'm sure the partition sizes are skewed for some chunks, the majority fall under 250K in size). Updates are partitioned on the fly in memory, and joined to the main branches respectively. A diff dataframe is maintained during each branch's update, which collects all of the changed/inserted records. This entire process takes anywhere from 30 minutes - 1 hour depending on the update size. And for some reason, the reverse edge updates take 10 times as long or longer (even though the reverse edge list is already materialized and re-used for each partition merge). As if it weren't difficult enough, a change is also reflected whenever a new record is deemed to \"touch\" one of our own. This requires integrating our own data as an update across both branches, which simply determines if a node has one of our IDs added. This usually adds a good 20 minutes, with a grand total maximum runtime of 1.3 hours.My team does not work in a conventional sense, so I can't really look to them for help in this matter. That would be a whole other topic to delve into, so I won't get into it here. Basically I am looking here for potential solutions. The one I have is rather convoluted (even though I summarized it quite a bit), but that's because I've tried a ton of simpler solutions before landing on this. I would love some tutelage from actual DE's around here if possible. Note that cloud compute is not an option, and the tools I'm allowed to work with can be quite restricted. But please, I would love any tips for working on this. Of course, I understand I might be seeking unrealistic gains, but I wanted to know if there is a potential for optimization or a common way to approach this kind of problem that's better suited than what I've come up with.",

Data infrastructure is all AWS based using DBT on top of Athena. We have use cases where the schema of our tables are restricted due to the name and description of the columns giving too much information.The only solution I could come up with was leveraging AWS secrets and aliasing the columns at runtime. In this case, an approved developer would have to flatten out the source data and map the keys/column to the secret. For example, if colA is sensitive then we create a secret “colA” with value “fooA”. This seems like a huge pain to maintain because we would have to restrict secrets to specific AWS accounts.Suggestions are highly welcomed.",

To fetch the record, then I see if the record based on a UID column exists in the destination table. If not, i insert (currently the one table can insert before the other, which leads to the other source table to do a update on the UID). So, when the records (UID) exists, i need to update certain columns in the destination table. Currently I am looping (python) through the columns of that record and doing a update (on the specific column). The table has 150+ columns, the process is being triggerd by Eventbridge (for both source tables), and the proicessing is being done in AWS Lambda. THe source tables are both PostgresSQL (in our AWS enviroment) and the destination table is also PostgresSQL on the same Database, just a different schema. THe problem is, this is a heavy Load processing for Lambda. I currently batch the pricessing for 100 record (from each source table). SOmetimes there can be over 20 000 records to summarise.

All numbers in usdI’m currently in a good stable holding pattern for my work but it’s basically just money with not a ton of growth.

I’m also doing what is equivalent to 20 hours a week at 150/hour for my mentors new consulting startup, the work is all deliverable based so I’m doing it all before and after the contract job to keep things ethical.My work life balance is ok but not awesome, I have time on weekends to go on trips but my weeks are pretty packed and the contract role wants me to be going into the office minimum twice a week which is fine but a little exhausting.My mentor approached me and has another gig that would pay 40 hours a week through this new consulting startup and he’s asking me to come on full time at this startup, still do the 20 hours I’m currently doing and then do these 40 hours at roughly 100/hour. The gig is for three months but there would likely be more work after the three months but obviously there’s zero guarantee.Contractor role doesn’t really have healthcare and no pto so it would be a raise per hour and since the work is deliverable based rather than a corporate 9-5 I’ll have more flexibility to take time off as long as my work is keeping up.I think this current contract gig is probably pretty stable, there was a round of layoffs recently but I’m on a pretty critical tech project so I could probably just coast here if I wanted to but it’s been made reasonably clear that fte conversions are gonna be on hold since the purse strings are held pretty close. It’s essentially a money printing machine as long as things go well enough.I’m 25, no kids so my gf, parents and friends are all telling me to full send it since on paper it’s more money, way better leadership and if it takes off I’m lining myself up to be the most senior consultant on the team but just looking for more opinions.",

I wanted to create a data pipeline utilizing this, and I finally finished it with hours of tinkering with docker. You can see the code here: [https://github.com/rohand2290/cytoscape-data-pipeline](https://github.com/rohand2290/cytoscape-data-pipeline).It supports exporting a graph of associated proteins involved in glutathionylation and a specific pathway/disease into a JSON graph that can be rendered into Cytoscape.js, as well as an SVG file, through using a headless version of Cytoscape and FastAPI for the backend. I've containerized it into a Docker image as well for easy deployment with AWS/EC2 eventually.",

Our main bottleneck is running and merging two separate queries, one for KNN and one for BM25, which currently results in an average response time of 7–10 seconds. Has anyone optimized a similar setup or found effective ways to reduce latency for this kind of hybrid search? Any advice or suggestions would be much appreciated!",

        "author": "-XxFiraxX-",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone,I'm working on a complex document processing pipeline in Python to ingest and semantically structure content from PDFs. After a significant refactoring journey, I've landed on a \"Canonical Tokenization\" architecture that works, but I'm looking for ideas and critiques to refine the alignment and post-processing logic, which remains the biggest challenge.The Goal:To build a pipeline that can ingest a PDF and produce a list of text segments with accurate layout labels (e.g., title, paragraph, reference_item), enriched with linguistic data (POS, NER).The Current Architecture (\"Canonical Tokenization\"):To avoid the nightmare of aligning different tokenizer outputs from multiple tools, my pipeline follows a serial enrichment flow:Single Source of Truth Extraction: PyMuPDF extracts all words from a page with their bboxes. This data is immediately sent to a FastAPI microservice running a LiLT model (LiltForTokenClassification) to get a layout label for each word (Title, Text, Table, etc.). If LiLT is uncertain, it returns a fallback label like 'X'. The output of this stage is a list of CanonicalTokens (Pydantic objects), each containing {text, bbox, lilt_label, start_char, end_char}.NLP Enrichment: I then construct a spaCy Doc object from these CanonicalTokens using Doc(nlp.vocab, words=[...]). This avoids re-tokenization and guarantees a 1:1 alignment. I run the spaCy pipeline (without spacy-layout) to populate the CanonicalToken objects with .pos_tag, .is_entity, etc.Layout Fallback (The \"Cascade\"): For CanonicalTokens that were marked with 'X' by LiLT, I use a series of custom heuristics (in a custom spaCy pipeline component called token_refiner) to try and assign a more intelligent label (e.g., if .isupper(), promote to title).Grouping: After all tokens have a label, a second custom spaCy component (layout_grouper) groups consecutive tokens with the same label into spaCy.tokens.Span objects.Post-processing: I pass this list of Spans through a post-processing module with business rules that attempts to:Merge multi-line titles (merge_multiline_titles).Reclassify and merge bibliographic references (reclassify_page_numbers_in_references).Correct obvious misclassifications (e.g., demoting single-letter titles).Final Segmentation: The final, cleaned Spans are passed to a SpacyTextChunker that splits them into TextSegments of an ideal size for persistence and RAG.The Current Challenge:The architecture works, but the \"weak link\" is still the Post-processing stage. The merging of titles and reclassification of references, which rely on heuristics of geometric proximity (bbox) and sequential context, still fail in complex cases. The output is good, but not yet fully coherent.My Questions for the Community:Alignment Strategies: Has anyone implemented a similar \"Canonical Tokenization\" architecture? Are there alignment strategies between different sources (e.g., a span from spaCy-layout and tokens from LiLT/Doctr) that are more robust than simple bbox containment?Rule Engines for Post-processing: Instead of a chain of Python functions in my postprocessing.py, has anyone used a more formal rule engine to define and apply document cleaning heuristics?Fine-tuning vs. Rules: I know that fine-tuning the LiLT model on my specific data is the ultimate goal. But in your experience, how far can one get with intelligent post-processing rules alone? Is there a point of diminishing returns where fine-tuning becomes the only viable option?Alternative Tools: Are there other libraries or approaches you would recommend for the layout grouping stage that might be more robust or configurable than the custom combination I'm using?I would be incredibly grateful for any insights, critiques, or suggestions you can offer. This is a fascinating and complex problem, and I'm eager to learn from the community's experience.Thank you",

I really like Data Engineering and data more broadly and want to continue working on it over the long term. However, I'm in kind of a rough job right now where I'm not treated well and I don't expect that I'm going to last here much longer. It's also been taking a pretty serious toll on my mental health and I want to get out of here pretty quickly if possible.I'm sure I don't need to go on a tangent about the job market right now but I've been applying like crazy with very little luck (a handful of interviews, only one went particularly far). I did however get a callback from one of the tools that I work with on a pretty consistent basis and they are interested in hiring me for a technical instructor role where I would walk clients through how to use the tool. It is a data engineering tool and part of the modern tech stack so that's good but this is obviously a step away from actually working directly with data which is what I like doing. Normally, I wouldn't take this job because it's not what I'm interested in but given my situation, it might be the best move because I don't really want to wind up unemployed for several months if things don't work out in my current role. So I guess what I'm wondering is, how will this sort of thing look on my CV? If I spend a year or two here is it going to functionally look the same as if I had just taken off for a year? Should I try to wait it out for a better opportunity or just take what I can get here?",

Not gonna pretend I know everything - I'm only mid-senior myself, but here's what I've picked up from both sides of the fence.**Stop obsessing about languages**Everyone's like \"which language should I learn???\" and tbh it doesn't matter that much. Just pick one that seems cool and focus on getting comfortable with the basics - functions, loops, etc until you don't have to think about syntax. Then grab a web framework for whatever langauge you picked and build some actual stuff.JS is probably the easiest recommendation since it works in browsers, handles JSON without extra headaches, and you can make UIs right away. I personally like TypeScript these days cuz it catches my dumb mistakes, but I started with Python. My team at work uses Go for backend stuff and I'm still learning it lol. Languages are just tools.**What companies acutally look for**I've been on both sides of interviews and helped with hiring at my last company. Gonna be real - the worst junior devs aren't the ones who don't know stuff, its the ones who don't improve fast enough.Your starting point matters way less than how quick you pick things up. What I care about when interviewing juniors isn't what you know right now - it's how fast you'll become usful and how much babysitting you're gonna need. Being able to read documentation and understand existing code is honestly MORE valuable than writing it perfectly from scratch.One of the best devs I know beat me at Chess after only reading about strategy for a few days. Same energy - they can just absorb new info super quick.**Portfolio stuff - simpler than you think**One legit project that YOU built (not copy/pasting a tutorial) beats a dozen generic portfolio projects. I need someone who can solve problems when stuff breaks, and personal projects show me you've actually dug yourself out of holes.If you're stuck on what to build - thats kinda a warning sign tbh. You should want to build SOMETHING. Clone spotify. Make a task app that doesn't suck. Build that game idea. What did you think would be cool before you realized coding is hard af?As for how big the project should be - there's no magic answer. You should feel like you've made something that works, or that you're proud of parts of your code, or that you've fixed enough annoying bugs that you've learned some real lessons.**Find ppl who get it**You need someone who'll help keep you going, but they can't push you - that's on you. A decent mentor answers questions and helps when you're stuck, but YOU gotta stay motivated til things click.Stack overflow and reddit are fine but sometimes u need someone who gets YOUR specific confusion. Don't be afraid to ask stuff that seems stupid - I asked sooo many dumb questions when I started (and still do in our team slack lol). Learning to code is legit painful, but it does get better!I was stunned when i started mentoring how many questions are so context-specific that googling just doesn't help. Like sometimes you just need a human to explain something in YOUR terms.**Just. Pick. Something**\"People keep saying mixed things about X\" is something I hear ALL the time. But mixed reviews just mean nothing is perfect - welcome to programming lol. Try like 2-3 options for a day each and then just commit to one. Don't feel like you have to finish every udemy course - I've prob completed like 3 out of the 20 I've bought because I usually get what I need halfway thru.Every \"wrong\" choice actually makes you better in the long run. I started with Django bcuz I thought I wanted to be a python dev, then moved to Node, then React, and now I'm doing Go microservices. None of it was wasted time.Also don't worry about frameworks changing or whatever. Once you know one, picking up others is 10x easier.**The secret sauce**Consistency > motivation. Make a habit of coding everyday, even if its just 30 min. Some days you'll hate it. Some days you'll love it. But your brain needs the repetition to build those neural pathways.I still have days when I feel like an absolute fraud and other days when I'm like \"damn I'm good at this\". It's normal.Hit me up if u got questions. Not guaranteeing I'll answer but I'll try if I have time.Edit 1: Been getting a bunch of dмs with similar questions — I’ll write small posts on Medium / [Substack](http://typedweekly.com) so it’s easier to share in next days.",

For someone just starting their programming journey now, what would you recommend they focus on?Some specific questions I'm wondering about:\\- Are traditional fundamentals (algorithms, data structures, etc.) still as crucial when AI can handle a lot of implementation?\\- Which programming languages or technologies seem most future-proof right now?\\- What soft skills or ways of thinking are becoming more important as the technical barriers lower?\\- How should new programmers approach learning alongside AI tools rather than competing with them?I'd love to hear from both experienced developers and fellow newcomers about what you think will matter most going forward. What are you focusing your learning on, and what gaps do you see in the current market?Thanks for any insights!",

Dynamic typing does not even serve its own special purpose. You want polymorphism: use inheritance. You want a beginner-friendly language: well then why would you abstract away something as important as data types. Why does dynamic typing exist?",

Visualizing how they behave in memory made stuff like recursion and pointers suddenly make sense. I also began explaining my solutions to myself, and every time I stumbled, it exposed what I didn’t really understand. However, if you wanna make great progress, you also need feedback to every explanation. I used Beyz for record and suggestions,but there are many similar software available on the market now. You can choose the one that is the most affordable. Later, I tried re-implementing basic structures in 3 different languages, Python, JavaScript, and Java, just to separate concept from syntax. It helped a ton.Now, I spend more time on *why* a solution works than memorizing *what* the solution is. It feels slower, but it’s way more durable.Anyone else go through this shift? What actually made data structures *stick* for you, more reps, or changing how you approached them?",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I'm a CS student who's really into metacognition and how people learn programming. I get to see lots of students at university and talk with them about their code (sometimes JavaScript), and I've noticed something that I think is a huge problem.The fundamental concept that causes the most trouble for beginners is that **they don't understand evaluation** \\- what it actually means to evaluate an expression until it becomes a value.People always say universities are rigorous and full of definitions, but they (or at least my university) seem to completely fail at teaching the definitions that actually matter. I can't count how many friends have told me that programming suddenly \"clicked\" once they understood these basic definitions:* **Value**: an expression that evaluates to itself* **Evaluation**: transforming an expression, step by step, into a valueOnce you get this, everything else builds naturally. Assignment makes sense because it's basically a function that takes two arguments: a name and a value. If there's an expression on the right side, you have to evaluate it first, step by step. Functions only accept values, so arguments have to be evaluated first - boom, functional composition becomes way easier to understand. and same for functions calls, because the student start seeing the call as an operator that takes a function on its left, not just syntax to memorize.Later when you study first-class functions, a statement like \"functions are values\" actually makes sense. Students start asking the right questions: \"But what kind of value? How does it look?\" And that naturally leads to closures and understanding that the value contains a reference to the environment where the function was defined.Here's the thing - I truly believe understanding these basic concepts early helps students ask the right questions. When they face something unexpected with a new expression, the first thing they think is \"How does this evaluate? There must be some evaluation rules.\"I think all CS 101 classes should start with (or at least teach at some points) these fundamentals: evaluation, values, the difference between statements and expressions, etc. Instead we get thrown into syntax and algorithms without understanding what's actually happening under the hood.

Do you think that would be sufficient? Or should I plan on getting a second major in my future.I grew up in a very poor area, and neither my high school or early college had a CS program.

By this I mean code simple stuff that I, myself has built from scratch but when it comes to working in a large group and have to tap into other people’s mind and their code, all of a sudden I feel like a black sheep.For example when I was tasked with creating a simple web app to serve some users it was pretty easy at the start since there was a lot of documentation about the language and the framework so I just googled the questions that I have and 9 out of 10 times it would come up for me and I just Copied it and changed some of the lines but I feel like I still didn’t learn as much. And as the codebase grew over 20k lines of code, I could answer less and less questions about it.And now with all this AI hype it’s even harder to not be lazy.

No matter, anyway, i still have the Final Thesis to complete and took one year to focus on it since i can continue working my student job, which is great for me. So i was mostly stumbling through the 3 years, managing to get where i am with hope and prayers. The teachers said how they are teaching us the basics and how to learn to learn (their words). So i am asking for any advice how and where to learn. Those who have experience and learned online through forums and sites, what do you recommend? How did you memorize the important bits, how did you start understanding it, any tricks how to be better at programming, what learning technique could be applied to learning different languages and so on... We learned some c++ and python, but mostly c#, xml, php. In my free time i've focused mostly on javascript, html and css since i'm interested in making websites and web applications. Let's say i'm a noob with basic knowledge, what would you recommend? Got 1 year before i need to look for a job and alot of free time.",

Codefinity’s step-by-step lessons were great for breaking down concepts into manageable chunks, and I found the small projects really helpful for practicing what I learned.That said, it’s not perfect some parts felt slow, and if you’re already confident with basics, you might find it a bit repetitive. Still, it gave me the structure and confidence to move from “I know Python syntax” to actually building things I can show.For those interested, my goal is to eventually work in robotics, and I’ve been using a Raspberry Pi alongside the course to try out small hardware projects. The combination has been helpful to connect coding with real-world applications.I’d love to hear from others who’ve tried Codefinity did it help you move forward?

I have already completed my diploma back in 2020, and gotten mostly through my BSc, and finished more than 90% of the program. Because of a recent change in my financial situation, I need more cash in order to finish it. I want to get work that uses the skills I learned, specifically in low-level languages such as C, C++, or assembly, and leverages my knowledge of network security.After consulting with people who know more about the hiring process than I do, I was told that the projects I have on my resume are not sufficient evidence of said skills. Because of this, I have to work on projects that would resolve this issue. I was advised to volunteer for organizations that would need computer science skills. There are a couple of options I came up with independent of the career agent's advice, but upon their review they only gave encouragement:* Contribute to open source projects* Create an indie gameObviously the path towards creating an indie game is, at the high level, straightforward. In spite of this, such games require time and creativity to reach completion. For that reason I have decided that while it's an okay idea, it would be best if I expand my resume through more than one vector.* [https://up-for-grabs.net/#/](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/)* [https://goodfirstissue.dev/](https://goodfirstissue.dev/)* [https://www.codetriage.com/](https://www.codetriage.com/)* [https://github.com/ravendevteam/betanet](https://github.com/ravendevteam/betanet)* [https://kernelnewbies.org/](https://kernelnewbies.org/) (NOTE: Subject is about developing patches to the linux kernel.)That leads me here. I have opened some sites for open source projects that require assistance in the links above. However, I am lost as to how I would be able to digest the requirements given to me in regards to what these projects want, and convert them into a list of chores for me to follow through on.So how would I accomplish that?I will not consider taking a minimum wage job to attempt to stabilize my finances. The effect it would have on my schedule would be irrecoverably debilitating, and it will not resolve my financial difficulties. I also have enough mental health problems to deal with as-is, and this will worsen them.",

But I feel that every time I get started, my interest starts waning, and I find it hard to stay on track.For example, I was working through *Crafting Interpreters* recently, and I feel like at some point, was unable to continue on, not due to difficulty but due to a lack of motivation. Similarly, whenever I try to start my own projects, I feel like I get stuck between the fear of failure and how big the task seems, and my own (perceived) lack of skill.How do I overcome this and get started working on projects more consistently? Any tips?",

        "content": "Hey everyone,I've been noticing something interesting in the tech world lately: it seems like **Java** for the backend and **React** for the frontend are everywhere! I see so many job postings and new projects built with this combination. I'm really curious to hear your thoughts on why this happens.Is it simply because they're a \"safe\" and established choice? Are there specific technical advantages that make them so popular, or is it a kind of self-perpetuating cycle where everyone learns them because they're popular, which in turn makes them more popular?On a related note, this got me thinking about languages that were once super popular but have since fallen out of favor. For example, **PHP** used to be huge, powering a massive chunk of the web. What do you think led to its decline in popularity compared to other options? Was it a lack of features, performance issues, or did other languages just innovate faster?I'd love to hear your insights and experiences! No wrong answers here, just genuinely curious about the community's perspective. Thanks in advance!",

It’s a simple simulation right now — it includes:* An order book with support for basic market and limit orders.* Matching logic for buy/sell orders.* A basic mean-reversion strategy (just for testing).* Multithreaded architecture: one thread ingests mock market data, another executes strategy logic.* Data structures optimized for quick access and low overhead.* Performance benchmark scores and graphs to showcase real performance.* Basic tests to make sure every build runs smoothly.It’s very much a work in progress and far from perfect, but building it has taught me a ton already about threading and performance bottlenecks in real-time systems.I don't have any idea how C++ code is written in a professional environment so I’d really appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or ideas for what I could improve. Whether it’s around architecture, C++ patterns, or trading engine design principles — I’m all ears.Thanks in advance, please give my project a star if you like it![Link](https://github.com/ArjunXvarma/mini-quant-trading-engine) to the project.",

        "content": "https://inventwithpython.com/blog/leap-of-faith.htmlI've written a short tutorial about what exactly the vague \"leap of faith\" technique for writing recursive functions means, with factorial and permutation examples. The code is written in Python.TL;DR:1. Start by figuring out the data types of the parameters and return value.2. Next, implement the base case.3. Take a leap of faith and assume your recursive function magically returns the correct value, and write your recursive case.4. First Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call cannot be the original argument.5. Second Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call must ALWAYS get closer to the base case.I also go into why so many other tutorials fail to explain what \"leap of faith\" actually is and the unstated assumptions they make. There's also the explanation for the concept that ChatGPT gives, and how it matches the deficiencies of other recursion tutorials.I also have this absolutely demented (but technically correct!) implementation of recursive factorial: def factorial(number): if number < 0: raise Exception('number must be a positive integer') if number % 1 != 0: raise Exception('number must be an integer') if number == 100: # BASE CASE return 93326215443944152681699238856266700490715968264381621468592963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223758251185210916864000000000000000000000000 elif number < 100: # RECURSIVE CASE return factorial(number + 1) // (number + 1) else: # ANOTHER RECURSIVE CASE return number * factorial(number - 1)",

It was like assembling IKEA furniture with the lights off and lighting matches every once in a while...but I did it.There is an assembly line of data collectors down stream from me that take about 2-4 hours to harvest data via human eyeballs and brains to give me (they are paid separately), and then I take hours to write a report...now it is, click-done. I just need to refine the process a bit and make it into a data secure workflow.The only reason that I could do this is that I have thirty years of experience in the field, and I could write a seven page multistep comprehensive prompt to give to AI, and I have the ability to get in the flow and lose all touch with the outside world for 10 hours at a time (Thank you Oblivion and League of Legends!).The government currently pays for and processes 20 million of these reports every year.

        "content": "I know this is a very broad question but I’ve been self studying full-stack the entire summer and will be starting my CS classes this fall for college. I never really knew what type of position I wanted in the SWE industry so I kind of selected a stack prematurely. After using JavaScript for about 2 months and doing some leetcode easy problems, I found that solving problems really excites me. Even though I’d sometimes look up the solution when I didn’t understand the problem, just being able to sit and read the code and study it contributed a lot to my learning. My original plan after spending some time with full-stack was to just learn programming with JavaScript, do all the nit and gritty, get a job, then pivot into AI/ML or AWS. From what I see I think companies nowadays value specialization more than generalization. I’m starting to think maybe I had it all backwards and should’ve committed to a single stack rather than a full stack. I tried surfing subreddits for similar experiences but always came across mixed opinions. Overall, I like backend and I’m willing to learn it with Python or Java (my cs classes will be taught in either of these), JavaScript is cool but I don’t think it’s healthy to learn with a tool I’m not passionate in using. Just a knowledge list of where I’m at rn, I’m very beginner level rn:- variables & data types- conditionals- functions- currently learning control flow & data structures",

        "author": "YangLorenzo",

        "content": "Hi everyone! :waving_hand:I'm excited to announce **WallpaperSwitcher 3.0**, the latest release of my first actually useful C# WinForms project!#### What is WallpaperSwitcher?A minimal, fast, and practical desktop wallpaper switcher for Windows (8/10/11), written in C# with WinForms and .NET 9. It allows you to manage wallpaper folders and switch wallpapers with ease—ideal for those who prefer static wallpapers and want something simpler than Wallpaper Engine.**Core Features**:* **Next wallpaper**: Switch wallpapers with a click.* **Folder management**: Add, remove, or switch between wallpaper folders.* **Hotkey support**: Assign hotkeys to switch wallpapers or folders quickly.* **Startup support**: Enable launch on Windows startup.* **System tray support**: Runs in the background with tray icon support—hotkeys still work.* **Settings UI**: Easily manage folders, hotkeys, and other settings via a dedicated window.* **Two wallpaper switch modes**: * **Native Mode**: Uses Windows SlideShow API (smoother but slower switching). * **Custom Mode**: Direct wallpaper setting via Win32 API (faster, emulates slideshow behavior).#### Why I built thisAs a long time **Wallpaper Engine** user, I started growing tired of dynamic wallpapers high power usage, choppy animations during frequent `Alt + Tab`, and lack of portability made me look for alternatives. I began using static wallpapers manually and realized I didn’t need all those extra features. I just wanted a fast, reliable wallpaper switcher and so I built one.Originally considered WPF, WinUI 3, or even Avalonia, but chose **WinForms** for its simplicity and low learning curve. I was able to build a working prototype in just a few hours after watching some tutorials and reading Microsoft docs.--- **What’s new in 3.0.0*** :check_mark_button: Full settings UI (no more editing config files manually!)* :check_mark_button: Hotkey system* :check_mark_button: Dual wallpaper switch modes: Native vs Custom* :check_mark_button: Better folder switching logic* :check_mark_button: System tray + auto-start support* :check_mark_button: UI improved using hand-written `.Designer.cs` (more on that below :backhand_index_pointing_down:)---**About the UI**I initially relied on Visual Studio’s WinForms Designer. But I wanted a cleaner, more modern look—something like Java Swing’s *FlatLaf*. I couldn’t find a suitable theming library for WinForms, so I turned to AI assisted code transformation.I uploaded my `*.Designer.cs` files and asked AI to refactor the UI styling. After several iterations, I got a design I was happy with. The catch? The updated UI broke Designer compatibility in Visual Studio so now I maintain the UI purely via code. It’s a tradeoff, but acceptable for a mostly stable project.---**Architecture decisions*** **Two-project structure**: * `WallpaperSwitcher.Core`: Logic layer (hotkeys, folder mgmt, wallpaper APIs). * `WallpaperSwitcher.Desktop`: UI layer (WinForms).* Started with `DllImport + SystemParametersInfo`, later switched to `LibraryImport` for better AOT support.* Eventually migrated all native API calls to **[CsWin32](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32)**. This made the code much cleaner and easier to manage—highly recommended if you deal with Windows APIs.---**Tech stack*** C# (.NET 9)* WinForms* CsWin32 (for Windows API interop)* Visual Studio + Rider (design/code split)---:package: **Project & Source Code**:backhand_index_pointing_right: GitHub: [https://github.com/lorenzoyang/WallpaperSwitcher](https://github.com/lorenzoyang/WallpaperSwitcher)Any feedback, suggestions, or code critiques would be super appreciated. I'm still learning C# and desktop development in general, and I’ve learned **a ton** during this project—especially around COM interop, hotkey registration, and Windows APIs.Thank you all for reading! :folded_hands:If you’re someone like me who just wants a simple, no bloat wallpaper switcher give it a try!",

If you don't consider yourself to be a beginner, include about how many years of experience you have.This thread will remained stickied over the weekend.

Clicking on an ability or move should trigger an API call to fetch and display detailed data about that ability.Currently, I plan to create a `Pokemon` class with properties like `Name`, `Image`, and collections for `Moves` and `Abilities`. For abilities, I want to store both the ability’s name and its URL together in a single property. In JavaScript, I’d typically use JSON objects for this, but since I’m using C#, I want to represent this using a class or similar structure.",

For example, I might be assigned to fix a bug, and I don't know what's causing that bug in the first place.How do you estimate how long a task will take (especially when there are a lot of unknowns)?And how do you defend your estimates when others disagree?How do you break large projects into smaller stories?Sometimes people will say my story descriptions are too detailed, and other times, people will say they're not detailed enough. The idea is that an outsider should be able to quickly see what's going on after quickly skimming the story.What do you typically put in story descriptions? How do you prevent them from containing too much or too little information?Any other advice for Agile?",

        "content": "I’ve been keeping an eye on ChatGPT as it’s evolved, and with the release of ChatGPT 5, it honestly feels like the improvements have slowed way down. Earlier versions brought some pretty big jumps in what AI could do, especially with coding help. But now, the upgrades feel small and kind of incremental. It’s like we’re hitting diminishing returns on how much better these models get at actually replacing real coding work.That’s a big deal, because a lot of people talk like AI is going to replace software engineers any day now. Sure, AI can knock out simple tasks and help with boilerplate stuff, but when it comes to the complicated parts such as designing systems, debugging tricky issues, understanding what the business really needs, and working with a team, it still falls short. Those things need creativity and critical thinking, and AI just isn’t there yet.So yeah, the tech is cool and it’ll keep getting better, but the progress isn’t revolutionary anymore. My guess is AI will keep being a helpful assistant that makes developers’ lives easier, not something that totally replaces them. It’s great for automating the boring parts, but the unique skills engineers bring to the table won’t be copied by AI anytime soon. It will become just another tool that we'll have to learn.I know this post is mainly about the new ChatGPT 5 release, but TBH it seems like all the other models are hitting diminishing returns right now as well.What are your thoughts?",

Here are a few examplesGoogle Current Employees: 187K, 2019 Employees: 119K **57% higher**Meta Current Employees: 76K, 2019 Employees 45K **68% Higher**Microsoft Current **US** Employees: 126K, 2019 Microsoft US Employees 96K, **31% Higher**And I could post a ton more examples, but I think you should all get the point. I also specifically said US employees for MSFT, because I know the first comments would be \"yeah but all the jobs are in India now\" otherwise.And to put these numbers into context, the overall US population grew by about 4-5% during this time. All the hair on fire shit here is not based in reality.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Working with LLMs I noticed at least four important shortcomings that make them unsuitable to really replace software engineers.1. Non-deterministic, software engineers like other engineers usually chose this career path because they are able to thinker with things and expect a specific response, it doesn't take much tinkering to start to dislike the LLMs prompts.2. Highly inconsistent code, often code produced with LLM happens to lack [consistency](https://medium.com/@jonfinerty/consistency-in-software-42626ac4219f) from line to line.3. Lack of precision of the generated code. Code is highly imprecise compared with a mediocre coder, and even a beginner coder, at this section is the fact that most of the time there is superfluous code. Also generated code cannot be made more precise by a human, because usually best code come in the engineers mind through ideation and abstraction among others things LLM are incapable of doing. This precision thing is also one reason a specific kind of people are attracted to software engineering.4. Speed, coding speed is not improved by LLMs if you count for quality, debugging and code-coverage, actually if you account for fixing the other 3 shortcoming enumerated before it is much, much slower needing more developers to fix these shortcoming introduced by the LLMs.Another shortcoming I wanted to add is the total lack of congruence but that can be derived from the lack of consistency, also this term is not well defined and used in software engineering. Given at least these four shortcomings you would think that LLMs are not fit to replace software engineers, at least at this stage, you would think that they could try first replacing customer support or marketing or other sections from the corporate structure. Not that I think it can replace these people either, but I mean for the sake of the argument that shows software engineers are specifically selected from a bunch of people.I think is a selling point, software engineers are the most expensive people that don't belong to the [PMC ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional–managerial_class)crowd or their flunkies. And a lot of the [PMC ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional–managerial_class)is heavily invested in this AI thing on a metaphysical level.I think the AI bubble is about to pop and the Tech bros are selling replacing software engineers to the [PMC ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional–managerial_class)bunch as a last resort since it wasn't able to make any profit and also lately not making any visible progress, Thus [PMC ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional–managerial_class)was sold on the idea hopes to obtain two things:\\- a lot of profit from replacing most of software engineers;\\- drag the price down for the remaining software engineers the way customer service robots did for entry customer service people.But both of these are not reachable.I think this move is the most dangerous move for our guild and our careers: \\- Layoffs are already happening;\\- Hiring market is in disarray;\\- And massive amounts of capital from software industry is already gone and going on a ruse;My two cents.",

This will help every industry that's facing outsourcing - tech, accounting, project management, all the jobs that people want!Edits:1. We are not taxing outsourcing itself as that's hard to implement. We are raising the whole corporate tax rate and then giving tax rebates to companies that show a large American payroll. This puts the burden of proof on the company to show they are hiring Americans. Harder to loophole this.2. This is more like EV/Clean Energy incentives rather than tariffs. It's a transfer payment from American companies that outsource to American companies that hire Americans.3. This is not targetting H-1Bs/immigrants. H-1Bs are separate but atleast they recycle money back into the American economy. I get it that PhDs and top talent should come to the US, I am not targetting H-1Bs but rather targetting outsourcing.4. Rich tech companies that earn more money will get hit harder by corporate tax rate and thus need a larger American payroll to get credits. How much Americans a company needs to hire is proportional to the amount of money they make.5. We are hiring the best. We want to make an 150k American salary = 40k Overseas Salary + 110k in missed rebates. Now that both hiring and Americans and overseas cost 150k, please hire the best.6. No extra tax cost to give rebates. The funds come from higher corporate tax rate. It will be a transfer payment from outsourcing companies to ones that are hiring American.7. It's a free market, but why do big oil, big pharma, military industrial complex get protectionism but American citizens don't?",

On the bright side, i feel like AI replacing jobs also implies that AI will be creating thousands of NEW jobs, as did the industrial revolution but i'm just curious",

Training and running these models costs a fortune. All the big boys are fighting to become THE definitive AI provider adopted by the corporates. Its looking like it might be Microsoft with its Co-pilot integration. And one things that Microsoft is famous for is getting you fully integrated into their stack and then whacking the prices up. The AI providers will have no choice once the infinite investor money hose stops. Once that happens I wonder exactly how much AI will be saving them money when they are having to pay massive licencing fees, and per-token costs increasing into the dollars, rather than the pennies like right now.A similar situation is happening with a lot of companies Cloud bills increasing massively. In fact, a lot of companies are looking for way to bring things back on prem and regretting their decisions. Many companies wish they could move back on prem, but can't afford to due to getting rid of all their infrastructure guys and the cost of migrating back being too much.I am thinking that should AI replace entire dev teams, a lot of these companies will regret it when the rug-pull happens.",

If you're not learning Python in 2025, you're missing the boat. It's dominating AI/ML, data science, and increasingly backend development.2. **Docker**: +17 points (highest single-year increase ever). Container literacy is now a basic requirement, not a nice-to-have.3. **Cloud platforms**: Still growing steadily across AWS, Azure, GCP**The AI Skill Paradox:**Here's what the survey reveals about AI: usage is up, but trust is down to 60%. Translation for your career:\\- Learn to collaborate WITH AI tools, don't depend ON them\\- Develop skills that complement AI rather than compete with it\\- Focus on verification, architecture, and strategic thinking**Technologies to Consider (But Don't Panic About):**\\- Rust: Growing but still niche\\- Go: Solid for specific use cases\\- Kubernetes: Important for infrastructure roles**Technologies That Remain Solid:**\\- JavaScript: Still the most widely used\\- PostgreSQL: Database of choice\\- Git: Universal (obviously)**My Practical Advice:*** **If you're starting out**: Learn Python first, then JavaScript, then Docker* **If you're mid-career**: Add containerization and AI collaboration skills to your existing stack* **If you're senior**: Focus on architecture and team leadership while staying current with Python/containers**Career Strategy:**Don't chase every new framework. The survey shows that sustained success comes from mastering fundamentals and selectively adopting innovations that solve real problems.**The numbers don't lie**: developers with Python + Docker + cloud skills are seeing the most opportunities right now.What's your experience?

I had been at the company for a little over 2 years at that point and had purchased a house in October of the year before. The first few months, I wasn’t that worried, I had rented out the house and was also doing Airbnb to keep the mortgage payments covered. I was interviewing and hearing back, getting ghosted, getting reached out to by recruiters. My former company had a career counselor program for everyone who was laid off, but obviously it yielded no success. Winter came, airbnb bookings were low and I really started to feel the pressure. April came around again and I started to just feel like a straight up failure.Anytime people would talk about CS (I did computer engineering tho not that it really matters) being a dying field now or just about how horrible the job market was, I just didn’t think much of it because I figured there would always be something.I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I was in a forbearance period for my mortgage but the forbearance period is over and I’ve missed 2 payments. I got a notification in the mail from my mortgage company with a pamphlet about “Tips to avoid foreclosure”. It feels like there’s a noose around my neck. I don’t know if I’m being dramatic. I don’t want to ask my parents (who I live with) for money because it seems like money is tight right now, but I know they would find the money if I did ask. I just feel so hopeless, it’s like nothing is working. I have no money. I don’t even respond to my friends anymore because I’m tired of telling them that I have no money. I’m in credit card debt too from the money I spent to furnish my airbnb. It’s like no one around me can even comprehend how much money occupies my mind. I’ve been going outside in nature a lot more recently and in those moments it feels like everything will be okay but then I get home and I remember.Honestly I’m kind of tired of typing so I’m gonna stop here, I guess I just wanted to vent a bit.",

The second interviewer was just rushing. He gave a 5 min monologue about the problem statement and dropped two matrices and asked me to solve it. When I asked any follow-up questions he said “Lets stick to the initial requirements?” Like wtf. Moreover they rejected me but they rejected me for a different position altogether but I assume that they rejected me for this position I interviewed for because I know I fucked up the second round leetcode problem.I expected better standards from Amazon. I didn’t know that they were this lazy and disoriented and disorganized lol. What are your thoughts? Has any faced something similar to this in recent times?",

No FAANG experience. I was looking for remote work in Canada, and felt like I was just on the cusp of applying to senior roles. I was careful in what roles I applied to - I didn't really want to work in advertising or wacky new AI start ups. The roles I applied to I either thought I'd absolutely love working there, or they would be a great fit for the specific skill set I was starting to build for myself. 3 YOE did turn out to be the edge of non-senior: I was offered a senior role by one company, a non-senior for another, and rejected by a third company because I wasn't quite senior enough. I think if you have a few years of experience, the job market is not as bad as people say it is. If you don't, then you might be SOL. I was also pleasantly surprised, none of the interviews were very leet-codey. They were mostly common sense, real-life kind of scenarios. I prepped about 100 leet code mediums before applying, which was a bit useless, but I think it gave me the confidence I needed in these interviews.",

Everybody else are co-founders, etc. I'm working on a huge part of project dev, mainly software related, and I'm in for only a month. so the contract has 1.5 months left, yet I was told to leave at the end of this month. Like man I'm only 5 weeks in. This is not a rant post (well kinda cuz it's just an intern) though, I just wanna know if there's any reflection I can get out of this. My leader told me my progress was not as good as he expected to be, and that I'm lacking communication, etc, and more closely they decided to hire someone else with years of experience, not to replace me but to work on completely different part. In a nutshell, they feel like my part is not good enough so they kinda give up and work on other things to raise opportunity for the funding round, at least from my understanding. I won't go deep into my work, but basically I'm developing a huge part of the project from stratch to a workable demo, which involves sub system and sub sub system, etc etc. they're blaming me for not talking with my colleagues enough, but I'm essentially doing this R&D work all alone. From what I know, they made the decision to pause whatever I'm working on cuz they feel like it's far from good enough for the funding round demo, to \"save the money to hire somebody else to work another more promising end of the product\". I wonder if this is common for early startup, not the fact that they hired a summer intern as one of the earliest employees, but do huge change on product features for the demo. Other than this, I'll greatly appreciate any advice on my case, did I dodged a bullet, etc. Personally, I can definitely improve the communication part even though it's pretty much useless for my work, but all my colleagues got all these meetings I don't need to attend, so they're pretty much occupied with talking to investors, suppliers, etc etc all these \"big things to solved\".

Experience? A coding history since your age was single-digit? There's something totalitarian about this profession- not in the sense that it's authoritarian, but that it demands absolute commitment, that your identity is to be subsumed into the totality of the hustle. It would also sting less if companies weren't so *bubbly* about selling themselves. \"Oh we welcome you. Oh we're a family.

I was tasked to create a bottom sheet using a Figma design as a reference. I got too caught up in the functionality, which I did implement correctly for the most part. But the bottom sheet was supposed to show over all the other components in the UI, which I forgot to do. My team lead reviewed the task and pointed it out to me.2. I created another bottom sheet that was supposed to have a certain appearance in both landscape and portrait mode. I was able to implement it correctly, and tested it in both orientations, as well as landscape -> portrait and portrait -> landscape (or so I thought). Later, it was discovered that despite my thorough testing, i missed the portrait->landscape scenario, leading to the UI looking bad. Once again, an obvious mistake that should have been avoided and pointed to me by my team lead.It is a problem because \"needs to get better at testing\" has appeared far too many times in my performance review which comes every 3 months and instances like these are cited to me far too often.We only get performance based increments, and because of this, I have never been able to get one, as I believe their perception of me is \"Makes too many obvious mistakes\".I have tried the advice of \"write down all test cases beforehand\", but as scenario 2 shows, even that doesn't stop me from making errors like those.I seem to have hit a wall, one that I can't get over.Has anyone ever faced a problem like this before?

The more intense, algorithm-heavy, grindy SWE work doesn’t excite me.What I am really good at is managing, organizing, and coordinating. I thrive when I’m planning, running projects, and keeping people on track. Because of that, the only path I can see right now is forcing myself into a SWE internship to eventually move into a PM role. But even then, I’m not sure I’m cut out for any of this.I’m also an international student and currently in the process of applying for an EB-5 visa, which adds a whole other layer of pressure and uncertainty to figuring out my career.Meanwhile, my friends are doing coffee chats every week, interviewing, and already have internships lined up (some are even returning to previous ones). I spent my summers hanging out with friends, doing artsy projects, watching TV, basically nothing “competitive” or career-boosting. Now I’m feeling the weight of that.Part of the problem is that I’ve had almost zero exposure to what jobs are actually like. My dad’s retired and never really talked about work, my brother just tells me to “focus on learning and chill,” and I’ve never been in an environment where I could see what a day in a tech or PM role is like. Any time I think about doing a personal project, I feel like it’s pointless because there are already better versions out there and mine won’t be “competitive” enough.I just feel… lost. I don’t have genuine interest in what I’m learning right now, I don’t have a clear vision of what kind of job I’d like, and I feel like I’m already behind compared to my peers.If you’ve been in this position, what did you do? How do I figure out what I might actually enjoy and build toward it without wasting more time? Is SWE → PM really the only path if I don’t want to code forever? And is it possible to “catch up” if I’ve essentially wasted my first two college summers?I’m looking for honest, no-BS but kind advice from people who’ve been here before.",

        "content": "Hello!So for context I'm 18 currently doing a bachelors on computer science. For the past two years taking coding classes (Specifically on C++, which is my preferred language) I've noticed that in reality I haven't learned anything important or new, most things I see in class are logical extensions to what I already know, or as a fact, things I already know. But in reality, forget about university because what matters is the job. Obviously I don't have a job on the field nor any experience, but I believe that I would be smart for me to start early and have something to show, make myself valuable.The problem? I don't know what to do or how to do that, most of what I've coded on c++ are simple console programs. Yes I know about classes, structs, lambdas and all of that yet I lack any important project. Meanwhile, I see all this people on the internet with GitHub repos, working or interesting apps to showcase their skills, and I've noticed that I have basically nothing, and I want to, and change that, I just need some advice on the right direction. So truly, any advice on this topic would be highly appreciated because I feel like im falling behind and someday in the next two years imma be 20 and probably still have nothing so I better prepare for that starting now.",

I did a whole bunch of interviews. I saw my progress going from completely blanking out in technical interviews to acing every technical interview. I aced my interviews and it still didn't work out and I'm devastated. This past year has completely destroyed my self confidence and honestly I don't know how I'm gonna go through this same application stress again next year. My family has been very understanding and supportive because they understand that the market is fucked right now. The fact that they understand and still support me makes it much worse because after every failed interview, I feel like I am disappointing them and letting them down. I gave my absolute best preparing for the interviews. Coding, making my own notes, everything. One thing I hate is not giving my best, but with this, I did give my absolute best and it still didn't work out. I did get into a master's program and I do have a back up but I really don't want to do it. I think it's time I finally make peace with it and accept that I failed and do the masters.",

There’s a red flag on my CV that I can’t get over: I graduated three years ago but only started working two years later due to personal issues.I once got an interview at a big company in my country, and the manager kept asking about that two-year gap and told me how doomed I am like she had to chill. She was very rude, and I can’t forget her words. I answered most of the technical questions, and the engineers who interviewed me were very happy with my knowledge, but the manager was the opposite. She asked where I graduated from (not a well-established university) and other personal things, like where I live, even though she could see it on my CV. It’s okay to ask such questions, but you don’t have to give me a judgmental look.Many well-known companies here place a lot of importance on the university you attended and I know I have to put a lot of work to pass that already.I am now trying my best not to dwell on it and instead focus on improving my weak points.I’m 26, restudying the math behind ML and deep learning for who knows how long, working on LeetCode, and on my redemption arc, doing things people at better companies never did because of connections but whatever.I feel sad about those wasted two years, and I mostly hate how insecure I feel, my brain keep telling me that my colleagues see me as a failure or a weak person, and the reason is Many of my colleagues started working immediately after graduation, and even people younger than me are at senior levels and work at much better companies. I’m not saying I deserve more than them, but I feel very insecure about myself, even though I’ve received many positive comments on my technical knowledge. Sometimes it feels like I’m working so hard to achieve something that others reached easily because they had better connections or graduated from specific universities.TLDR; I am playing it hard mode and just venting about it.",

This job had near impossible standards to meet, so I'd be fixing roughly 10-20 tickets a day every day working \\~7am to \\~5pm. I told him explicitly I can't work from 5PM - 7PM, but could work after that. Despite this, every single time the manager would have a meeting with me, he would ask these questions that seemed to imply I wasn't working. He would say things like \"where are you working from\", \"when did you start working today\", \"how many hours have you been working\", stuff like thatHe tried scheduling a meeting at 6pm my time. I told him, I could not make it to this time and he would have to schedule it at either 4pm or 7:30pm. He took a heavy amount of offense to this and started saying some cryptic stuff about how it's not acceptable that I \"disappear\" at that time. I didn't want to explain to him the reason (why's it his business?), but I had to have this time off to do physical therapy due to a busted hip, which will prep me for a surgery. I simply can't put this off, because it was causing a lot of painFinally, I think the \"breaking point\" was one day when I woke up at 6am and looked at my phone to see a bunch of notifications from around 2AM, one after the other, asking me if I was online. I messaged back (at now 6AM) and said I just woke up, was it something urgent? He said it wasn't, but I should have been awake. I was not on call. Anyway, I ended up getting fired and when I asked HR why, they said I \"disappeared\". I asked for any tangible proof and pointed at the github contributions, which were every hour 7am-5pm every weekday. They did not respondSimilarly, I just got a new manager at my company who seems to be doing the same thing. She's constantly saying I'm not doing enough, not doing the right thing, \"not working\", but when I ask for tangible examples, she will not provide them. To counter, I show an exact audit of everything I did over the past few weeks, which was at least 2-5 tickets per day with correspondence over slack. She still says she's upset by itThis doesn't seem to help, at all. Like every time I bring up \"actual proof\", it feels like that just makes the problem so much worse.

I’m in a tough spot right now because I’m in the running for a promotion to the next job grade but also have a lease starting in a new city with my girlfriend.The lease starts in 3 weeks, and I have an internal job offer in the new city for my current job grade. I’m feeling very indecisive though because I’ve had a strong year on my current team and was told many months ago that I had been nominated to be promoted at the end of this year.Part of me wants to wait and secure that because it would be another 1-2 years before that opportunity arises again. However, my girlfriend really wants me to move with her. I did try to suggest we wait but she’s very eager to go now, and have since signed for a place.I have a place in our current city so that’s not the issue, it’s mainly leaving a promotion for my relationship or staying and risk missing out on 5+ months in the new city with her.I know this is a bit between career/relationship advice but as someone relatively new to their career I’m very curious what others in the field think.EDIT: Thanks everyone for sharing your insights, I really do feel a lot more at peace now. Given that I don’t want to stay with this company much longer anyways, and the realization that having the promotion won’t necessarily give me that much more leverage for a new position, I’m going to take the new opportunity and move. Like some of you said, relationships are more important than a job and I need to prioritize what matters most to me.",

Last year, i spent the first 8 months not working looking for SWE jobs, that didn’t get me anywhere. No responses. No interviews. Just idle. The last couple months I decided maybe it’s time for me to make a switch into Solutions Engineering. Does anyone have any advice on this? I just feel that competing with people who are extremely talented when it comes to coding won’t put me in a good spot. I’m rusty with coding (out of practice), but I’ve also never been phenomenal at it. An average joe engineer. I’m just exhausted. Everyday I study something new for a company hoping I get somewhere. I don’t imagine myself doing leetcode questions everyday and studying like I’m back in college again. It seems so unfair. I went to college. I did the work. I have the degree. I want to work and make money. I’m dedicated and ambitious, but that is not enough for this career. I need some guidance. I’m at a halt and feel so hopeless. I feel that my career is going down the drain. I’m in more debt now than I was when I was a teen and working at a coffee shop. Endless amount of studying for a few interviews that have gotten me nowhere. There’s just so much information in the technology world, it’s overwhelming. I’m at a loss. If anyone has some suggestions when it comes to Solutions Engineering, which I feel fits my personality more, or another job with my degree that’s more niche, I would appreciate the guidance.",

I'm going to lay out my career path, how I got here, and essentially ask for help on what I need to do to get out of this dead end in the next six to 12 months.Very long story short, one unexpected kid at 20 and I didn't get my college degree until 2019 at the age of 33. It was incredibly brutal to get there but I had a compsci degree from the University of Minnesota.Despite that, all of my efforts at job fairs were a bust. My best guess was my age was a factor, but I can't know. Regardless, the only job I could get my hands on at graduation was for a local embedded linux hardware company of \\~400 employees for \\~$70k. It was a bit of a tough pill to swallow given all of the guys I studied with (and often performed better than) landed at either Amazon or Target for significantly more money.I got some moderate Yocto experience and enough C++ to know I'd rather write in straight C than untangle legacy bowls of spaghetti. Covid hit almost immediately after I was hired and my subpar wage dipped into straight up rough territory within a year. When they called me back into the office I said no and flailed to look for a new job.That too was utterly brutal. I only really had \\~1.5yrs of Yocto/embedded experience and was still very green. The only job I could find was a remote gig in another embedded device company in Fargo. The pay was $100k. It wasn't great, but it was a raise, and they promised me I would continue my embedded Yocto experience. This struck me as a deal as I could continue to transport my kids to school and work on the same skillset. Id eventually be a marketable embedded developer in +/- 3 years I felt.It was also a lie. I never, ever touched anything embedded, leaving all of my experience at my first job to largely rot before I could get it to the magic \"5 years\" point. Instead it was secretly full Reactjs/Swift/XCode/C# userspace server code. I now have \\~3.5 years of that when my company was bought and I was thrown out of that team into a.... yocto embedded team. I now have 6 more months of experience there. Most of that time was spent remembering things I had completely forgotten.I have been looking for a job to get off this roller coaster since early 2023. I barely even get callbacks. I've gotten two interviews. One was a dud, the other was a trap that offered me $80k without asking me a single tech question. I know this Reddit is aware of the pitfalls and stressors of looking for a job in this field right now so there is no reason to go further.My work history is essentially in shambles and looks horrible on paper from all this thrashing. Both companies do not have names that make my resume stand out in any meaningful way. I realize (or presume) that the only way out for me is to work all day, then code all night and create a portfolio in a space that mildly interests me.I have been working in Rust, which I thoroughly enjoy, and have been messing around in Ratatui crate, which I also enjoy, but work is slow between two high school kids I teach how to drive simultaneously, being the one breadwinner, the one adult that drives, and the one person who does household shopping and cooking. I am too stretched thin to not be attacking this with maximum efficiency.I need to stop wandering in the dark and find the straightest line possible to get me out of my stagnant job/wage. I came to this whole industry late and dont have either the best discipline or sense on how one furthers their career as quickly as possible and becomes marketable in the most effective way, and I'm up to my eyeballs in all the extraneous \"life\" stuff that is non-negotiable. I basically need a road map.Thank you for spending any amount of time on that. I am 100% serious and have the work ethic, I just don't have the direction. I appreciate any constructive first steps.",

        "content": "Hi all I am back again with another question I keep getting calls from recruiters about contract to hire positions at Walmart with $50-60/hr rates for senior software engineer positions. They keep insisting that this is a good opportunity and Walmart will definitely convert at the end of contract term, usually 3-6 months.I am tempted to take this because Walmart full time pay is pretty decent. But at the same time I know we use to hire contract to hire at my last company and never convert them because why would you pay someone $300k when they were ok working for $100k.So I am here trying to figure out how often? If they ever convert?P.S. I am definitely going to apply for this position because I got let go a couple of months ago. Moneys not an issue yet but I am starting to feel like I am useless lol.",

There’s always a lot of info on interview prep but some seem unrealistic. I never took a DSA course or learned Neural Networks in university. I just landed a software engineer (Machine Learning) position a year after I graduated. Here’s how I prepped in around 6 months to be FAANG and big tech ready.Book: A common sense guide to data structures and algorithms (ruby and javascript) i use python and this book is fine Course: Leetcode Data Structures and Algorithms Crash CourseYoutube: Andrej Karpathy Zero-To-HeroNeetcode 150: did around 100 problems twice. That was enough for me but I studied Math so my problem solving skills were already kind of highFor the MLE position it was a mixture of leetcode, OOP, and neural network architecture. Had to build a Multilayer Perceptron model from scratch in PyTorch (didn’t prep for this at all but i pulled through). Had a medium leetcode type of problem for first round.Tips: Be consistent but you don’t have to do 1000 problems to break into FAANG. MOCK INTERVIEW. leetcode isn’t enough to be good in a technical interview. I did a mock technical interview 1-2 times a week for 3 months straight. You need a good resume to break into FAANG there isn’t a way to just break into FAANG. Your linkedin and resume needs to be peak.",

We talked about my experience, my projects that I have been working in,... as well as his feedback for my performance. He said I am a great team member and I have the qualities and passions of becoming a software developer, and then he told me that no offers are extended at this time. One of my friend immediately got his return offer and some high school interns are invited to continue their internships at T the upcoming summers (even a high school intern I am working with got hired to work full-time that he did not even have to attend university).Several of my friends also did not get anything too. It's strange. Even though I expected at some point that I might not get any return offer but I don't know why am I still disappointed and depressed right now. I keep telling myself that it is OK, I can try again next time but I am not OK. I feel like all of my hard work and contribution go to waste now. Since the beginning of my internship, I have done my best at every work, be nice, and network with as many people as possible. I have always shown my passion and initiative, done every project the best I could, and even asked for more work a lot of time (I did not get much work). I even won competitions/hackathons (1st place) for this company. I kept thinking what did I do wrong or what did I miss, and what do others have to get hired but I don't. So many things are going on in my mind right now. I feel absolutely embarrassed when facing my friend or anyone who gets hired. I feel like a failure. I am even scared to talk to my family about this. They have sacrificed and expected so much for me.I have put in a lot of my blood, sweat, and tears for the past three years for this first internship, and always aim for return offers so my career is secure and stable. I will graduate in May 2026 and I don't want any days or weeks or months of being unemployed. I feel like I am not ready to go back to job hunting again and even grinding technical assessments (LeetCode/Hackerrank/CodeSignal). Just thinking about job hunting makes me a bit scared again.",

I do know whats a big O and i can give a few examples , just not quick sort, not off the head.At the coding assessment i forgot the syntax of Array's method(js).

I failed a technical at a mid-size because I had gotten a bit nervous, but I have two interviews coming up for small startups. One is an internship, which is still okay in my book as they stated there is a possibility for conversion. However, the other is a full-time role, but seems to be giving off a bad feeling.The full-time startup is a company that has been around for 5 years but has not seemed to produce anything of value. They have an app with no users and that is actually outdated on the current Android version. All their engineers seem to be scooped straight out of college with no prior experience (no internships, no work history, unprofessional LinkedIn profiles), and it doesn't look like there's a Senior developer on the team? The CEO's daughter seems to be the 'recruiter', and the GlassDoor reviews? The developers seem like they despised the CEO with all the reviews implying he is a nightmare to work with and goes on firing sprees when he's not happy with the work. Low pay, no benefits, no evidence of producing any actual software. I applied thinking they were simply small and starting out, but I didn't know they had even been around for 5 years because all their employees have 1 year or less of experience, and I just assumed that's probably when they started.Is it even worth going to the interview at that point? I know the mantra is that 'any foot in the door is good' but I think I'd rather spend the next several months searching for other roles than being part of this company. But I'm also being told by peers that they would kill for any opportunity and I'm not being serious about my job search if I will turn down interviews.",

I basically just exist so that my company can pretend that they do something with AI.In my current company I have a 3 month notice period. I think this will make it harder to find a new job because it seems as though companies want someone to start soon.It's tempting to just tell new companies I have a one month notice period and only give my current company one month's notice.If I ask my current company to reduce my notice period they will know I'm leaving and start looking for someone to replace me.I'd love to know what you guys recommend doing!Many thanks :)",

Can I or should I just reach out directly to the hiring managers and explain my interest in the role?

I know Python can get me some roles like automation or data analysis, but full-stack skills might open up more opportunities.I’m worried about balancing everything though — school workload plus learning a whole new stack might be a lot.So I’d love to hear from anyone who’s been in a similar spot:* Is focusing on Python enough to get an internship after first year?* Has anyone landed an internship with mostly Python skills?* If you learned full-stack on the side during first year, how did you manage it without burning out?* What kinds of projects helped you stand out when applying?",

This week my Product Owner which is kinda like the manager aswell has told me that I have to start building an internal system for the stakeholders something similar to HR management system, with a tech stack which I’m not really familiar with. Now me being the intern and the pressure for performing well whilst given any task is making the use of AI whenever I’m stuck especially when it’s tasks which I’m not familiar with that tech stack. Normally other engineers should be included on the project like a senior engineer but the guy there is just pretending to be a senior he actually has no idea how things work about 70% of the time and his decisions for the tech stack, which database we’ll use and other technical decisions are based on Chat GPT answers. The manager and the CEO himself are really AI oriented in terms that they’ll use AI for basically ANYTHING which is making them believe that I, as an intern can develop this system they want. I can do it with the help of AI and basically vibe code the whole thing although my goal is to improve as a software engineer aswell as reach my deadlines. What are your best tips that could help me escape this situation or just close my eyes this time and vibe code the thing.Thnx bye!",

But at the school I’m currently at, Colorado Technical University - Online, I just feel like I’m not getting that sort of experience using actual real-life software that people use in the field. They use intellipath for general education classes and zyBooks for their coding classes. They don’t offer any type of certifications help, no internship, no mentorship, and no help with job placement after graduation. Plus I’m almost 2 years in and I’m at $30,000 in school debt, which I have no idea if that’s about where I should be or what.But I’m wondering if all online schools are the same kind of learning platform where you just read and answer multiple choice questions and post a discussion board post every week. I’m really getting burnt out on the same type of learning structure every session for ever class.I’ve also looked into other online schools and I haven’t found any that actually have the computer science with a cybersecurity concentration at any of them. They’re all either bachelors in IT, bachelor in cybersecurity, or bachelor in computer science with no choice of a cybersecurity concentration (idk if that’s matters much or not..) I’m wondering if I should continue with this degree or if I should look into somewhere else where maybe I can get help with certifications, mentorship, or at least some experience with real-world software learning how to use them and search for vulnerabilities.If anyone can help me, I’d greatly appreciate it!",

        "author": "fleethead",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey everyone,I’m hoping to get some guidance or perspective from this community. I’ve been feeling lost for a long time now.I'm 26 and studied Computer Science in Australia (where I'm from and live now) and have always seen myself as a systems thinker. I like to see how everything connects, not just code but tech, people, economic and social systems. I’ve had a rough few years between life setbacks, grief, and demoralising work environments. I feel like I've stagnated and lost confidence in my abilities, or never really developed them further than university level.I’ve held two jobs since graduating:* One was an \"application specialist\" role, mostly user support and QA testing - no real development. (1.5 years) \\[Australia based\\]* My current job is a support engineer role maintaining legacy WinForms tools in C#. I fix minor bugs, occasionally touch Blazor or SQL, but I wouldn’t even know how to build one of these apps from scratch. There's little mentorship, PRs only get reviewed by the boss once per week if you're lucky, and every other team member is spread thin. (2 years total, with 2x 5 month gaps in between due to multiple deaths in the family) \\[Australia based, but worked remotely for 9 months from London\\]It’s been a mixed, somewhat toxic environment. I was the only new person to last longer than two weeks in three years. My boss often humiliated me which wrecked my self-worth, and I find it hard not to feel panic that I’m falling behind while everyone else is moving forward.That said, I have done a few things I’m proud of:* At uni, I had a job building Python software for Raspberry Pi devices (e.g., an NFC security system, e-ink display widgets). I don’t have access to these any more.* I’ve participated in two blockchain hackathons (first a team of three which I led/did most of the project, and second I did solo), working with Solidity and JavaScript. Both times something went wrong at the very end and I couldn’t demo properly, but I want to revisit those projects and finish them.* I’ve also started writing about cybernetics, AI, and cognitive security/cogsec on my blog.I have so many project ideas, but I’m overwhelmed. I don’t know whether to double down on the blockchain stuff, explore AI/ML (I’d even go back to uni if I felt it was the right path), or start a new project using something more marketable like React. I often feel FOMO seeing the focused, driven people on this sub. I know I’m capable and think deeply, but I feel stuck and don’t know where to aim.I’ve also been able to find a few thinkers/leaders online who I look up to. In 2023 I flew internationally to a tech conference and networked with, met and conversed at length with the founders and staff of this company, which is probably the highlight of the last few years for me. This is the same company I did the hackathons for. In my mind, I’m working toward having some diverse portfolio that really demonstrates me and my strengths which I could present to any of these people and ask for mentorship.So here’s what I’m hoping you might help me figure out:* How do I find a path in CS I can truly thrive in, that makes use of my strengths?* Should I try to finish the blockchain project or start fresh with something more mainstream like a React app?* Is it worth exploring AI/ML or systems design formally? Or should I just build, build, build and let the path emerge?* How do I rebuild confidence and skill after years of support roles and a toxic work environment?Any advice or shared experiences would mean a lot. Thank you.",
