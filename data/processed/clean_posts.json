But 90% of the data quality issues we get paged for are because the business logic changed and no one told us.A product manager wouldn't launch a new feature in an app without defining what quality means for the user. Why do we accept this for data products?We're treated like janitors cleaning up other people's messes instead of engineers building a product. The root cause is a lack of ownership and clear requirements *before* data is produced.Discussion Points:* Am I just jaded, or is this a universal experience?* How have you successfully pushed data quality ownership *upstream* to the product teams that generate the data?* Should Data Engineers start refusing to build pipelines until acceptance criteria for data quality are signed off?Let's vent and share solutions.",

I went full enterprise when a simple Power BI embedded report in Teams would’ve solved it.Lesson learned: not every client wants “scalable,” some just want usable. Now, before every sprint, I ask, “what decisions will this dashboard actually drive?” It’s made my workflow (and sanity) 10x better.Anyone else ever gone too deep when the client just wanted a one-page view?",

It’s been running great ever since… but now I’m starting to wonder what’s next — because I need more power. :high_voltage:We use GCP, and process hourly over 2M data points arriving in streaming to pub/sub, then saved to cloud storage. Here goes the pipeline, with a proper batching i'm able to use 4GB memory cloud run jobs to read parquet, process and export parquet. Until now everything is smooth, but at the final step this data is used by our dashboard, because polars + parquet files are super fast this used to work properly but recently some of our biggest clients started having some latency and here comes the big debate:I'm currently querying parquet files with polars and responding to the dashboard\\- Should i give more power to polars ? mode cpu, larger machine ...\\- Or it's time to add a Data Warehouse layer ...There is one extra challenging point: the data is sort of semi structured. each rows is a session with 2 attributes and list of dynamic attributes, thanks to parquet files and pl.Struct the format is optimized in buckets: <s_1, Web, 12, [country=US, duration=12] <s_2, Mobile,13, [isNew=True,...]Most of the queries will be group\\_by that would filter on the dynamic list (and you got it not all the sessions have the same attributes) The first intuitive solution was BiGquery, but it will not be efficient when querying with filters on a list of struct (or a json dict)So here i'm waiting for you though on this what would you recommend ?Thanks in advance.",

For example, say I’m reading a 1 TB CSV file — Spark somehow figures out all the column names and types *before* I call any action like `show()` or `count()`. So how is that possible if it’s supposed to be lazy? Does it partially read metadata or some sample of the file eagerly?Also, another question that came to mind — both Python (Pandas) and Spark can store data in memory, right? So apart from distributed computation across multiple nodes, what else makes Spark special? Like, if I’m just working on a single machine, is Spark giving me any real advantage over Pandas?Would love to hear detailed insights from people who’ve actually worked with Spark in production — how it handles schema inference, and what the “real” benefits are beyond just running on multiple nodes.",

Do you change variable names or simplify logic first, or just paste it as is and trust it’s fine?I’m wondering how common it is for developers to be cautious about what kind of internal code or text they share with AI tools, especially when it’s proprietary or tied to production systems.Would love to hear how you or your team handle that balance between getting AI help and protecting what shouldn’t leave your repo.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone, I’ve spent the last few weeks talking with a friend about the lack of a standard for data transformations.Our conversation started with the Fivetran + dbt merger (and the earlier acquisition of SQLMesh): what alternative tool is out there? And what would make me confident in such tool?Since dbt became popular, we can roughly define a transformation as:* a SELECT statement* a schema definition (optional, but nice to have)* some logic for materialization (table, view, incremental)* data quality tests* and other elements (semantics, unit tests, etc.)If we had a standard we could move a transformation from one tool to another, but also have mutliple tools work together (interoperability).Honestly, I initially wanted to start building a tool, but I forced myself to sit down and first write a standard for data transformations. Quickly, I realized the specification also needed to include tests and UDFs (this is my pet peeve with transformation tools, UDF are part of my transformations).It’s just an initial draft, and I’m sure it’s missing a lot. But it’s open, and I’d love to get your feedback to make it better.I am also bulding my open source tool, but that is another story.",

        "author": "Worried_Teaching_707",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,I'm working as an AI Architect consultant for a mid-sized B2B SaaS company, and we're in the final forecasting stage for a new \"AI Co-pilot\" feature. This agent is customer-facing, designed to let their Pro-tier users run complex queries against their own data.The projected API costs are raising serious red flags, and I'm trying to benchmark how others are handling this.**1. The Cost Projection:** The agent is complex. A single query (e.g., \"Summarize my team's activity on Project X vs. their quarterly goals\") requires a 4-5 call chain to GPT-4T (planning, tool-use 1, tool-use 2, synthesis, etc.). We're clocking this at **\\~$0.75 per query**.The feature will roll out to **\\~5,000 users**. Even with a conservative **20% DAU** (1,000 users) asking just **5 queries/day**, the math is alarming: \\*(1,000 DAUs \\* 5 queries/day \\* 20 workdays \\* $0.75/query) = **\\~$75,000/month.**\\*This turns a feature into a major COGS problem. How are you justifying/managing this? Are your numbers similar?**2. The Data Conflict Problem:** Honestly, this might be worse than the cost. The agent has to query multiple internal systems *about* the customer's data (e.g., their usage logs, their tenant DB, the billing system).We're seeing conflicts. For example, the **usage logs** show a customer is using an \"Enterprise\" feature, but the **billing system** has them on a \"Pro\" plan. The agent doesn't know what to do and might give a wrong or confusing answer. This reliability issue could kill the feature.**My Questions:*** Are you all just eating these high API costs, or did you build a sophisticated middleware/proxy to aggressively cache, route to cheaper models, and reduce \"ping-pong\"?* How are you solving these data-conflict issues? Is there a \"pre-LLM\" validation layer?* Are any of the observability tools (Langfuse, Helicone, etc.) actually helping solve this, or are they just for logging?Would appreciate any architecture or strategy insights. Thanks!",

It is a hybrid role with 2 days per week in the office in London.The positives of the role are as follows:- Quite good WLB (Only about 10 hrs per week actual work)- Good non-toxic culture with friendly technical and non technical colleagues who are always happy to help- I have been able to upskill in the role, and now have skills in Python, SQL, Java, DevOps, machine learning, ETL pipelines, GCP, business analysis, basic architecture design and SRE for maintaining data products.The negatives are as follows:- Low TC (only £60k TC) in London- Unclear how I might get a promotion in my organisation.Due to the good WLB mentioned above, I have used time to learn new skills and learn value investing and because I live with my parents I have been able to build a fairly good portfolio for my age.I am soon going to buy a flat however so I will not be able to invest as much in the near future.What should I be focusing on? Because although I partially think I should look for another highest TC role, the grass isn’t always greener, so I might be better off milking this good WLB role for all its worth then pursuing some kind of entrepreneurial venture alongside it, because that could have potentially unlimited upside with low downside if my corporate role provides a margin of safety, and if that takes off I could become a full time entrepreneur.What thoughts/advice do people have?

So if someone has has watched these and tell me what I can expect.As for databricks, am I just using a community edition? with snowflake the free trial is enough to complete a book.Thanks again, I learn by doing so please dont just tell me to look at the documentation (I wont learn anything reading it, and I dont have time the plan out a project which can conveniently cover all bases) !

It's pulling data from a source systems, cleans it, applies some transformations and presents the output to the user for approval. Afterwards the transformed data is being written into another DB and injected to our ERP. We're using Pandas for the database connection and transformations and streamlit as the UI.

It's **not production-ready**, just a sandbox for testing and learning.**What it does:*** It has three Python data generators for a realistic mix: 1. **Transactional (CDC):** Simulates MySQL changes streamed via **Debezium** & **Kafka**. 2. **Clickstream:** Sends real-time JSON events to a cloud API. 3. **Ad Spend:** Creates daily batch CSVs (e.g., ad spend).* **Terraform** provisions the entire AWS stack (API Gateway, Kinesis Firehose, S3, Glue, Athena, and Lake Formation with pre-configured user roles).* **dbt** (running on Athena with Iceberg) transforms the data, and **Dagster** (running locally) orchestrates the dbt models.Right now, only the AWS stack is implemented. My main goal is to build this *same* platform in **GCP** and **Azure** to learn and compare them.I hope it's useful for anyone else who wants a full end-to-end sandbox to play with. I'd be honored if you took a look.**GitHub Repo:** [https://github.com/adavoudi/multi-cloud-data-platform](https://github.com/adavoudi/multi-cloud-data-platform) Thanks!",

The pay is the same as I make and a better retirement pension if I stay long term. One the one hand I want to stay at my current job because doing a full migration will help me better my technical skills for long term. On the other hand this is my chance to step into management and ultimately I want to explore the management route because I am scared that AI will eventually make my mediocre DE skills obsolete and I don’t want to be laid off at 50 without much prospects. Both the current job and the new job offer are remote. Would love your suggestions and thank you in advance. Edit - The new job has been described as overseeing a team of 5 that will start a migration to databricks and duck db from Oracle. They use microstrategy as their semantic layer. I would be initially learn the existing system and then work with vendors and work with the team to migrate the data. I am 42 with a family living in a MCOL area and financially doing alright with decent savings but definitely need to work till 60 unless I get an unexpected windfall.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I’m exploring the trade-offs between **database-level isolation** and **application/middleware-level serialisation**.Suppose I already enforce **per-key serial order** outside the database (e.g., productId) via one of these:- local **per-key locks** (single JVM),- a **distributed lock** (Redis/ZooKeeper/etcd),- a **single-writer queue** (Kafka partition per key).In these setups, only one update for a given key reaches the DB at a time. Practically, the DB doesn’t see concurrent writers for that key.**Questions**1. If serial order is already enforced upstream, does it still make sense to keep the DB at SERIALIZABLE? Or can I safely relax to READ COMMITTED / REPEATABLE READ?2. Where does **contention** go after relaxing isolation—does it simply move from the DB’s lock manager to my app/middleware (locks/queue)?3. Any **gotchas, patterns, or references** (papers/blogs) that discuss this trade-off?**Minimal examples to illustrate context****A) DB-enforced (serialisable transaction)**```sqlBEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;SELECT stock FROM products WHERE id = 42;-- if stock > 0:UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = 42;COMMIT;```**B) App-enforced (single JVM, per-key lock), DB at READ COMMITTED**```java// map: productId -> lock objectLock lock = locks.computeIfAbsent(productId, id -> new ReentrantLock());lock.lock();try { // autocommit: each statement commits on its own int stock = select(\"SELECT stock FROM products WHERE id = ?\", productId); if (stock > 0) { exec(\"UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = ?\", productId); }} finally { lock.unlock();}```**C) App-enforced (distributed lock), DB at READ COMMITTED**```javaRLock lock = redisson.getLock(\"lock:product:\" + productId);if (!lock.tryLock(200, 5_000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) { // busy; caller can retry/back off return;}try { int stock = select(\"SELECT stock FROM products WHERE id = ?\", productId); if (stock > 0) { exec(\"UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = ?\", productId); }} finally { lock.unlock();}```**D) App-enforced (single-writer queue), DB at READ COMMITTED**```java// Producer (HTTP handler)enqueue(topic=\"purchases\", key=productId, value=\"BUY\");// Consumer (single thread per key-partition)for (Message m : poll(\"purchases\")) { long id = m.key; int stock = select(\"SELECT stock FROM products WHERE id = ?\", id); if (stock > 0) { exec(\"UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = ?\", id); }}```I understand that each approach has different failure modes (e.g., lock TTLs, process crashes between select/update, fairness, retries). I’m specifically after **when it’s reasonable to relax DB isolation** because order is guaranteed elsewhere, and how teams reason about the **shift in contention** and **operational complexity**.",

The HANA is on-prem.Jobs overview-Currently, we have a metadata-driven Glue-based ETL framework for replicating data from SAP HANA to Snowflake. The controller Glue job orchestrates everything - it reads control configurations from Snowflake, checks which tables need to run, plans partitioning with HANA, and triggers parallel Spark Glue jobs. The Spark worker jobs extract from HANA via JDBC, write to Snowflake staging, merge into target tables, and log progress back to Snowflake.Has anyone gone through this same thing? **Please help.**",

The infrastructure is very \"do it yourself\", and now that I’m near the end of my degree, the data volume has exploded and the organization has become a serious maintenance problem.Currently, I have a Linux server with a /data folder (\\~800GB and growing) that contains:* Climate datasets (NetCDF4, HDF5, and Zarr) — mainly MERRA-2 and ERA5, handled through Xarray;* Tabular data and metadata (CSV, XLSX);* ML models (mostly Scikit-learn and PyTorch pickled models);* A relational database with experiment information.The system works, but as it grew, several issues emerged:* Data ingestion and metadata standardization are fully manual (isolated Python scripts);* Subfolders for distributing the final application (e.g., a reduced /data subset with only one year of data, \\~10GB) are manually generated;* There’s no version control for the data, so each new processing step creates new files with no traceability;* I’m the only person managing all this — once I leave, no one will be able to maintain it.I want to move away from this “messy data folder” model and build something more organized, readable, and automatable, but still realistic for an academic environment (no DevOps team, no cloud, just a decent local server with a few TB of storage).What I’ve considered so far:* A full relational database, but converting NetCDF to SQL would be absurdly expensive in both cost and storage.* A NoSQL database like MongoDB, but it seems inefficient for multidimensional data like netcdf4 datasets.* The idea of a local data lake seems promising, but I’m still trying to understand how to start and what tools make sense in a research (non-cloud) setting.I’m looking for a structure that can:* Organize everything (raw, processed, outputs, etc.);* Automate data ingestion and subset generation (e.g., extract only one year of data);* Provide some level of versioning for data and metadata;* Be readable enough for someone else to understand and maintain after me.Has anyone here faced something similar with large climate datasets (NetCDF/Xarray) in a research environment? Should I be looking into a non-relational database?Any advice on architecture, directory standards, or tools would be extremely welcome — I find this problem fascinating and I’m eager to learn more about this area, but I feel like I need a bit of guidance on where to start.",

These are difficult to access and update, and we also lack a clear overview of which pipelines are running, when they are running, and whether any have failed. We only get notified by the end users...We’re considering migrating to Azure Container Apps or Azure Container App Jobs. The advantages we see are that we can easily set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to deploy new images and have a straightforward way to schedule runs. However, one limitation is that we would still be missing a central overview of pipeline runs and their statuses. Does anyone have experience or recommendations for handling monitoring and failure tracking in such a setup? Is a tool like Sentry enough?We have also looked into orchestration tools like Dagster and Airflow, but we are concerned about the operational overhead. These tools can add maintenance complexity, and the learning curve might make it harder for our first-line IT support to identify and resolve issues quickly.What do you think about this approach? Does migrating to Azure Container Apps make sense in this case? Are there other alternatives or lightweight orchestration tools you would recommend that provide better observability and management?Thanks in advance for your input!",

Every person who writes queries in the company (they're in every department) complains about how hard it is to find things. There's a lack of centralized reference tables that give us basic information about our clients and the services we offer them (it's technically not crucial to the architecture of the tools) and each client is configured differently so running queries on all our data is complex.The company is still growing and made it this far despite this, **so is it urgent to address this right now?** I don't know. But I'm concerned by my lack of ability to easily answer \"how many clients would be impacted by this Product change.\" (though I'm sure with more time I'll figure it out)**I pitched to head of Product that I dedicate my next year to focusing on upgrading the data models behind our core business areas**, and to do this in tandem with new Product launches (so it's not just a \"data review\" exercise), but I was met with the reasonable question of \"how would this impact client experience and your personal KPIs?\". The only impact I can think of measuring is reduction in hours spent by eng and data on sifting through things (which is not easy to measure), but cutting costs when you're a growing business is usually not the highest priority.My question: **what are metrics have you used to justify data model reviews?** How do you know when a confusing model might be a problem and when?Welcome all thoughts - thank you!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm the author of [zsv](https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv) ([https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv](https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv))**TLDR:**\\- the fastest and most versatile bare-metal real-world-CSV parser for any platform (including wasm)\\- \\[edited\\] also includes CLI with commands including \\`sheet\\`, a grid-line viewer in the terminal (see comment below), as well as sql (ad hoc querying of one or multiple CSV files), compare, count, desc(ribe), pretty, serialize, flatten, 2json, 2tsv, stack, 2db and more\\- [install](https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv/blob/main/INSTALL.md) on any OS with brew, winget, direct download or other popular installer/package managers**Background:**zsv was built because I needed a library to integrate with my application, and other CSV parsers had one or more of a variety of limitations. I needed:\\- handles \"real-world\" CSV including edge cases such as double-quotes in the middle of values with no surrounding quotes, embedded newlines, different types of newlines, data rows that might have a different number of columns from the first row, multi-row headers etc\\- fast and memory efficient. None of the python CSV packages performed remotely close to what I needed. Certain C based ones such \\`mlr\\` were also orders of magnitude too slow. xsv was in the right ballpark\\- compiles for any target OS and for web assembly\\- compiles to library API that can be easily integrated with any programming languageAt that time, SIMD was just becoming available on every chip so a friend and I tried dozens of approaches to leveraging that technology while still meeting the above goals. The result is the zsv parser which is faster than any other parser we've tested (even xsv).With parser built, I added other parser nice-to-haves such as both a pull and a push API, and then added a CLI. Most of the CLI commands are run-of-the-mill stuff: echo, select, count, sql, pretty, 2tsv, stack.Some of the commands are harder to find in other utilities: compare (cell-level comparison with customizable numerical tolerance-- useful when, for example, comparing CSV vs data from a deconstructed XLSX, where the latter may look the same but technically differ by < 0.000001), serialize/flatten, 2json (multiple different JSON schema output choices). A few are not directly CSV-related, but dovetail with others, such as 2db, which converts 2json output to sqlite3 with indexing options, allowing you to run e.g. \\`zsv 2json my.csv --unique-index mycolumn | zsv 2db -t mytable -o my.db\\`.I've been using zsv for years now in commercial software running bare metal and also in the browser (for a simple in-browser example, see [https://liquidaty.github.io/zsv/](https://liquidaty.github.io/zsv/)), and we've just tagged our first release.Hope you find some use out of it-- if so, give it a star, and feel free to post any questions / comments / suggestions to a new issue.[https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv](https://github.com/liquidaty/zsv)",

        "content": "I work as a data engineer in a an organisation which ingests a lot of time series data: telemetry data (5k sensors with mostly 15 min. intervals, sometimes 1. min. intervals.), manual measurements (couple of hundred every month), batch time series (couple of hundred every month with 15 min. interval) etc. Scientific models are built on top of this data, and are published and used by other companies.These time series often get corrected in hindsight, because they're calibrated, find out a sensor has been influenced by unexpected phenomena, or have had the wrong settings to begin with. How do I deal best with this type of data as a data engineer? Putting data into a quarantine time agreed upon with the owner of the data source, and only publishing it after? If data changes significantly, models need to be re-run, which can be very time consuming.For data exploration, the time series + location data are displayed in a hydrological application, while a basic interface would probably suffice. We'd need a simple interface to display all of these time series (also deducted ones, in total maybe 5k), point locations and polygons, and connect them together. What applications would you recommend? With preference managed applications, and otherwise simple frameworks with little maintenance. Maybe Dash + TimescaleDB / PostGIS?What other theory could be valuable to me in this job and where can I find it?",

But is there a faster way than this?CONTEXT I'm going to make one for sales team but they somewhat has no standard process. For example, they can change order data anytime they one thus creating conflict between order data and payment data. A better design would be to relate payment data on order data that way I can create some constraint to avoid such conflict.",

I see this most in two places: 1) the semantic layer and 2) the control plane.On the first point, if AI writes SQL and its answers aren't correct for whatever reason - different names for data elements across the data stack, different definitions for the same metric - this is where a semantic model comes in. It's basically giving the LLM the context to create the right results. On the second point, it seems data infrastructure and AI infrastructure are collapsing into one control plane. For example, analytics are now agent-facing, not just customer-facing. This changes the requirements for data processing. Quality and lineage checks need to be available to agents. Systems need to meet latency requirements that are designed around agents doing analytic work and retrieving data effectively. How are y'all seeing this show up? What steps are y'all taking when implementing these semantic data models? Which metrics, context, and ontology are you providing to the LLMs to make sure results are good?",

        "author": "TheOnlinePolak",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I work in a Databricks environment, so that’s my main frame of reference. Between Databricks Apps (especially the new Node.js support), the addition of transactional databases, and the already huge set of analytical and ML tools, it really feels like Databricks is becoming a full-on data powerhouse.A lot of companies already move and transform their ERP data in Databricks, but most people I talk to complain about every ERP under the sun (SAP, Oracle, Dynamics, etc.). Even just extracting data from these systems is painful, and companies end up shaping their processes around whatever the ERP allows. Then you get all the exceptions: Access databases, spreadsheets, random 3rd-party systems, etc.I can see those exception processes gradually being rebuilt as Databricks Apps. Over time, more and more of those edge processes could move onto the Databricks platform (or something similar like Snowflake). Eventually, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Databricks or partners offer 3rd-party templates or starter kits for common business processes that expand over time. These could be as custom as a business needs while still being managed in-house.The reason I think this could actually happen is that while AI code generation isn’t the miracle tool execs make it out to be, it *will* make it easier to cross skill boundaries. You might start seeing hybrid roles. For example a data scientist/data engineer/analyst combo, or a data engineer/full-stack dev hybrid. And if those hybrid roles don't happen, I still believe simpler corporate roles will probably get replaced by folks who can code a bit. Even my little brother has a programming class in fifth grade. That shift could drive demand for more technical roles that bridge data, apps, and automation. What do you think? Totally speculative, I know, but I’m curious to hear how others see this playing out.",

The idea actually came after watching my brother reorder a DataFrame with more than a thousand columns and realizing the only solution he could find was to write a script to generate the new column list and paste it back in. That felt like something pandas should make easier.The library helps with swapping columns, moving multiple columns before or after others, pushing blocks to the front or end, sorting columns by variance, standard deviation or correlation, and grouping them by dtype or NaN ratio. All helpers are typed, validate column names and work with `inplace=True` or `df.pipe(...)`.Repo: [https://github.com/Dinis-Esteves/pandas-smartcols](https://github.com/Dinis-Esteves/pandas-smartcols)I’d love to know:• Does this overlap with utilities you already use or does it fill a gap? • Are the APIs intuitive (`move_after(df, [\"A\",\"B\"], \"C\")`, `sort_columns(df, by=\"variance\")`)? • Are there features, tests or docs you’d expect before using it?

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello, I've been digging around the internet looking for a solution to what appears to be a niche case.So far, we were normalizing data to a master schema, but that has proven troublesome with potentially breaking downstream components, and having to rerun all the data through the ETL pipeline whenever there are breaking master schema changes. And we've received some new requirements which our system doesn't support, such as time travel.So we need a system that can better manage schema, support time travel.I've looked at Apache Iceberg with Spark Dataframes, which comes really close to a perfect solution, but it seems to only work around the newest schema, unless querying snapshots which don't bring new data. We may have new data that follows an older schema come in, and we'd want to be able to query new data with an old schema.I've seen suggestions that Iceberg supports those cases, as it handles the schema with metadata, but I couldn't find a concrete implementation of the solution. I can provide some code snippets for what I've tried, if it helps.So does Iceberg already support this case, and I'm just missing something? If not, is there an already available solution to this kind of problem?**EDIT:** Forgot to mention that data matching older schemas may still be coming in after the schema evolved",

But the developers who actually made things happen weren't the ones who typed fast or memorized docs. They were the ones who could think clearly about problems. When you learn to:* Define the problem before touching the keyboard* Explain your code out loud and make it sound simple* Name things precisely* Question assumptions instead of patching symptoms...you start writing code that lasts, scales, and earns trust. If you're early in your journey, here's my best advice:* Don't chase tools, chase understanding.* Don't fear being wrong, fear not learning from it.* Don't copy patterns blindly, know why they exist.Everything else.. frameworks, AI tooling, languages will follow naturally. *What's something you've learned the hard way that changed how you code?*",

        "content": "I shared this with some of my most senior software developer buddies and they said dude you need to share this again but in a better time window where more people will see it because it got lost too soon, so I'm doing that. I know I could probably go look at several analytics websites but I feel like midday on Saturday is probably a good time. The rest is my original post.I've been programming for nearly two decades, and the way I got my start, the way many of my most talented friends got their start, was not through a 16-week boot camp. Although I'm not saying there's no value there. Having a goal and moving through each of several key areas in a full-stack SDLC, they do well enough.If you're trying to learn all the things you need to know to be even a junior to mid-level engineer, it can be difficult to glue all those pieces together in your mind. It can feel like you're learning HTML, but it looks like crap, so then you learn CSS. But now it looks good but doesn't do anything, so you learn JavaScript. Now you can press buttons and make cool animations and forms work, but then it becomes a spaghetti mess, so you learn a framework like React or Angular. But then it doesn't do anything in terms of loading data without hard-coding it, so you have to figure out a backend so it's not hard-coded, so you learn some backend framework. Now you've got APIs, but you're still hard-coding, so then you learn how to stand up a database. All along the way, there are all these choices and decisions to make, pros and cons, and it's always changing.I've gone through the LAMP stack, Drupal, Joomla, WordPress, Ruby on Rails, C# and .NET, Spring Boot and Java, the MEAN stack with Angular 1, and then Angular 2 (which wasn't even the same thing as the first), the MERN stack, all the little frameworks and libraries that people quibble over, ORM preferences, style preferences whether it's object-oriented versus functional or GraphQL vs REST, and it keeps changing. It keeps going: one thing gets simpler, the next gets more complicated. If you don't have some central thing you can use to glue all these concepts together, they come and go and you've never really learned much. You learned kind of how to touch Kubernetes one day and then never used kubectl again, or you become an SRE or a DevOps guy and that's all you do, or it's all you wish you could do because you're actually on something worse than k8s. But I digress.If you really want to learn how to program and you're just starting out, my best advice after being a software engineer forever is to do these things:**1. Think of the coolest, most badass thing you can think of that you would like to go try and build.**Take as long as you need here. This is the most important part. It really has to resonate as \"you know what, holy shit, I would actually like to build this,\" and you start getting amped about it. That energy is going to get you through the next few months or years of your life, and it's going to be the glue that holds everything together. You can look back and say, \"Oh yeah, I remember when I integrated SCSS for the first time in my project and I just loved the mixins combined with the other features of the language. I just dropped plain CSS and LESS overnight. Oh yeah, I've heard of Tailwind. I dabbled with it. It's neat how it integrates with SCSS so cleanly,\" etc. You will have a personal anchor for this knowledge.**2. Once you have the idea, don't stress at all about what you're going to build it with, because I promise you the chances that you're going to kill the golden goose that is your excellent idea through analysis paralysis are going to be astronomical.**Do some quick research on what the most popular frameworks, languages, and patterns are for whatever it is you're trying to build. I recommend a full-stack JavaScript stack, or TypeScript if you can manage the slight edge in complexity and the learning curve when just starting out, mainly because it reduces having to learn two languages when context-switching from the frontend to the backend if you're looking to be full-stack. People ask me what the best programming language is, and I always tell them it's the one you've spent five years learning. You can do just about anything with just about any language out there. Some of them are hyper-specialized like Erlang or Rust or Go, but for most applications and especially getting into the programming market, pick one that has high market share. If it's popular, that means people are hiring for it, it means people like it, and that there's support out there for it. Whichever you pick, you'll be fine. You're getting an education either way.**3. If you don't know where to start once you've got things picked out, start where makes the most sense to you.**Many people don't know how to imagine what goes into some complex multi-region live streaming platform like YouTube or Disney Plus, but what they can do is imagine what the UI looks like and what their imagined idea of it would look like. So they just start there, building out the UI, learning how to make a mockup, and slowly they learn how to add functionality like button presses and menus, navigation, and eventually they hook it to something like a backend or some hard-coded something. Just start where makes the most sense to you.**4. You are going to change your mind about things. People who've been doing this for 20 years still say that if you don't look back on your code from six months ago and say to yourself \"what was I thinking here?\" then you're not growing.**Don't be worried about investing in the wrong technology, making mistakes, or becoming paralyzed because you made a mess of your database schema or you completely underestimated how you would scale. So now you're on a monolith that doesn't follow the 12-factor app methodology and you're paying out the ass to vertically scale while you figure out how to refactor shit to make it horizontally scalable, only to find out once you've done that your database can't handle more than three people connecting to it because it's effectively a giant join. These are just growing pains. There's so much reading out there, so many opinions, different patterns, different hills that people will die on. Pick yours. Look at it like building out your own custom set of opinions. I tell people I don't mind very opinionated people so long as their opinions don't suck. That's the nature of it.Lastly, if you find that your passion slips because you're moving in a direction and you're not sure you still want to go in that direction, but you're thinking \"okay, there's this whole other direction that's actually really cool,\" that's fine. The likelihood that you're going to change is just as likely as the chance that some new library or framework or paradigm shift like AI is going to be right around the corner. I've not been bored in almost two decades of programming. Each day it's more of the same but nothing is the same. No two days are alike. You get to express yourself creatively and get paid for it handsomely.So if you want to program, do yourself a favor and figure out something you would like to build. Immediately set up a GitHub account and challenge yourself to make even small pushes each day, even if it's just updating the README every single day until you pick a framework. Start building that part of your resume right away. Show you're active. Try to open a pull request on an open-source project. Go try to build up your HackerRank. Have fun with it, but truly try to build something and truly want to build what you're trying to do. It'll make all the difference in holding this together for you. Best of luck to you out there.",

But i think with all the uni work (writing a hell lot of assignments) and exams, i never reallyy tried to learn coding. Again i dont want to blame uni as i know there are many students who do manage to do it all and i just lack in that respect.Now the problem is that my uni has asked students to look for an internship this semester break (2nd dec) and i have absolutely NO skills to put on my resume. i am not doing good academically either. i am just an average engineering student. and i have my end semester exams this month (practical/vivas and the written paper). it is compulsory for all students. Now i dont know what to do. idk how to manage the exams and learn something decent enough to land an internship. what do i do?",

In every group project, it's the same story, they use AI to write their part, and then I end up spending three days fixing and merging everything because they either don’t know how to do it properly or just don’t care.The thing is, I actually love programming and math. I used to struggle a lot, but once I started doing things the right way and really learning, I realized how much I enjoy it. And that’s why this attitude around me is so frustrating, people treating this field like a shortcut to a paycheck while trashing the craft itself. Even if I ended up working at McDonald's someday, I’d still come home and code or do math for fun. Because I genuinely love learning and creating things.I think those of us who truly care about learning and self-improvement need to start speaking up to remind people that this field isn’t just about chasing trends or using AI to skip effort. It’s about curiosity, skill, and the joy of building something real.",

If I have built something similar before, I can rebuild it fast.But the moment I have to design the architecture, data flow, or figure out what talks to what by myself, I just freeze. I do not know where to start, I second-guess every choice, and I end up hacking something together that works but feels messy.What makes it even worse is that if I ask AI to design the structure for the app, it gives me a much cleaner architecture and code layout than I would have ever come up with. Instead of helping, it sometimes demotivates me, because it feels like AI is already better at the part I am trying to learn.So now I am wondering:* Is this normal for early devs?* Does architecture/ code structure come with experience, or do people actually study it as a separate skill?* How do you practice code architecture when you do not even know what a good one looks like?* Is relying on AI for structure a bad habit, or is it just the new normal?I do not use AI to write the full code, only the skeleton, and even that already results in something way cleaner than what I would design myself.How did I bridge this gap?Edit:Thanks everyone for the inputs. I think my main issue comes from my history of working in early stage startups where I had to come up with architecture, design, and working code really quickly. The tight deadlines didn’t help either, and there was very little room for mistakes, I was expected to just make things work. That kind of environment made me dependent on AI and caused me to get demotivated easily and have imposter syndrome i believe.I’ll spend more time in my free hours building systems on my own without relying on AI to fix this.",

So, I'm wondering: Are there maybe other random algorithms that can work in reverse? That can maybe get seed from values? Does something like this exist?This would allow transferring 100 numbers (or maybe many more?) just by sending a single seed which would be very efficient.I know there are simpler ways to send the data, but this is just an idea I've had.",

        "author": "ZealousidealKale2042",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello everyone!Throughout my years of studying programming and work, I have always had the same question. I don't know how to properly find various tools and libraries.While developing projects or doing my work, I tend to use the simplest and most straightforward approaches, relying on old and time-tested techniques that are hard to ignore when learning programming.When faced with a problem or task, I turn to Google for a solution. I usually find one, but it's often not the most efficient or optimal solution. Later, I find a better, more concise, and secure way to solve the issue that I somehow missed when searching.Each time I publish a repository on GitHub, it only contains the bare essentials for the project and nothing more.But also, every time I open other people's repositories or developers' chats, I see people communicating in Elvish, casting unknown secret spells consisting of made-up words and names of tools and libraries, some of which I have never heard of, such as: just, dependabot, pre-commit, uv, unicornus-pam-pam, umdbpegasus, fizzbuzzenterprisemegacooltool, and so on (some of the names are made up, but I think such tools will appear and become a must-have in the next few days).Many of these pieces of technology can only be discovered by searching for their direct name. However, how can one stumble upon them if they are only searched by name? Furthermore, often, the descriptions of such projects' repositories are as strange as possible and do not reflect their essence. For example, \"FizzBuzzEnterpriseMegaCoolTool is your ambassador to the world of great programming achievements. A framework for delegating fractal powers to transcendent purple entities in the paradigm of the great actor's shift.\" What??? Is this some kind of secret agent's code or is it really Elvish?And this framework itself, for example, is just a tool for generating HTTP clients based on a config. Of course, this example is made up, but I believe you understand what I am trying to say. Most project descriptions are a quiet horror. However, the most interesting thing is that it creates the feeling that everyone around you understands what they are and why they are needed.. And in general, everyone except me, of course, has been using this thing since it first appeared on the internet.When I first started studying, I looked at different roadmaps and study plans. There were lots of popular and useful tools and technologies, like git, Linux, VSCode, and more. Now, nothing has really changed - the basic stuff is still the same.I find similar roadmaps and look for these magic technologies, but I don't find them. The most you can find them in all sorts of awesome lists, but even then, not all and not always.Often, these projects have thousands of stars on GitHub, but neither Google nor GitHub search gives me this useful thing - just all the outdated nonsense and users' personal projects.And it happens even more often that such projects have fewer than 500 stars on GitHub, but people still use these things if you look at recent applications or in programmers' chats. How they discovered these things is not clear.There is also a common problem that I can't guess up to a certain concept in principle, and because of that, I can't create a search result, because that idea doesn't occur to me. For example, yesterday, I found out about such a thing as harper. I had never even thought of finding tools to check grammar, especially to automate this check in repositories. Or, for instance, hexagonal architecture, which has become popular in recent years (although the concept and original article have been around for many years). I stumbled upon this by accident. If you search for architecture on Google, there will only be MVC, MVP, MVVM and others, not this one. I don't understand how this spreads and why Google's search doesn't reflect actual trends.I understand that people often learn about concepts and tools through communication and job, rather than searching, but I would still like to know how people initially learn about these things and how they transfer their knowledge. Perhaps I just answered my own question - people simply communicate and interact with each other, sharing information and experiences. Someone may discover something interesting and share it with others, who tell others, and so on. But perhaps I need to hear confirmation of this understanding from you.In my attempts to ask these fundamental and interesting questions in chat rooms, but everyone there was toxic about it or ignored it, although, as for me, finding information and learning new things is the most important part of programming. I sometimes feel as if I have been banned from Google and Github search :D. It feels as if my searches are being filtered to exclude useful information and instead provide irrelevant or nonsensical results.TLDR: I am struggling to find useful new tools, libraries, and concepts in the development community when they are not well indexed by search engines and are mainly distributed through community channels. What important detail of the search for all this am I missing?I am sorry for the messy and unstructured nature of my text. I am feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what to do. Thank you for your patience and understanding. I appreciate your help.",

Paricularly, with my most recent project.I am making a Chrome extension, and without getting into details, it has a Flask backend that the app needs to request in order to work, because the library it uses is not available in JavaScript land.Naturally, when I found out that you have to deploy the backend in order to use it in production, I was hesitant, because if it's just going to be on the web, anyone can take the URL and request it even from outside the extension. I don't have anything expensive going on now, but if I did, that would not be good at all. I can't imagine tech companies deploying backends that way. So, what can I do?Ideally, I would only allow the backend to be requested from inside the app itself, not as a separate thing, but I haven't heard of a way to do that.I suppose what I'm getting at is: if your project has some API on the backend that you want to protect, what can you do about it? Is it even worth doing? How do companies do it?",

This is my pragmatic breakdown of monads in practice.In essence there are two distinct topics that concern monads:* Purity* Chaining of operations / compositionKey points i have gathered so far, correct me please:* Monads wrap around other \"things\"* The \"thing\" the monad wraps around can be operated on within the monad * This operation can also be a \"chain of operations\", monads can do many things internally while appearing to be \"one abstract step\" on the outside* Monads that \"do something\" (= arent simply context), like IO, are \"lazy\". They are representation for computations that are yet to run (unrelated to lazy vs strict languages)* The \"result\" of the monad can be retrieved/calculated and we call that retrieval \"unwrapping\"* Making, baking, and eating the monad are pure operations, from an outside perspective, while the inside of the monad *could* practically do whatever impure nonsense it wants * They always are 100% pure \"representations of 1) a value within a context or 2) an operation that produces a value\" * Some have impure operations. For example doing I/O * The impure operation is abstracted away (into oblivion) so the process that \"runs\" the monad does not have to and cannot care about the purity implications of the operation, it simply cares about \"in -> out\"If all above points are correctly describing them, monads are not \"that difficult to understand\", so I have to have missed something, right?I guess the biggest hurdle towards understanding monads stems from them coming in many different flavors... Maybe *seems different* from IO when looking from the side, But looking each of them straight in the face they both \"let you get a value, no matter what they have to do to get that value\".",

        "content": "As I observe the rise of tools like Interview Coder, I find myself questioning the very concept of \"merit\" in the tech industry. When an AI can assist you during a live coding interview by providing support with logic, syntax, and hints, can we truly claim we are testing merit, or are we merely assessing access to the right tools? Let’s face it: tech interviews have never been solely about skill. They have always been a complex mix of several factors:* How well you can recall patterns you studied the previous week,,* How fortunate you are with the problem set you receive, and,* How composed you can remain while someone observes your screen.,Now, with the introduction of AI tools, the fragility of this entire system is being exposed. If someone using Interview Coder performs like a top 1% developer, should we consider that \"cheating,\" or does it suggest that our interview process was never as robust as we thought? Perhaps the definition of merit is evolving from “I can solve this alone” to “I know how to use tools effectively.”",

Progrmming (Python)2. Signal processing3. Dsp simulation4. acoustic engineering5. psychoacoustics6. Spatial Audio / HRTF7. Coordinates → Audio MappingI studied Python through YouTube lectures, but I didn't fully understand it.I’m currently studying “Think Dsp” and I’m understanding it one by one by following the examples and adding my own comments.I’m trying to somehow get used to Python and the computer language system.I thought, Instead of following an example, why not just write the code from scratch?But I'm afraid it'll take too much time.Impatience comes first.**This is the one thing I really want to know.**How much of the basics should I study before starting a project?Is it better to start a project right away, even if I know nothing?I'm not sure if I'm on the right track right now, so I'm honestly asking for help.I took a year off from university to study on my own.But I had no one to talk to about these thingsEventually, I was trapped in my own world, talking to AI every day.Then I discovered Reddit,and I was genuinely moved seeing how people here give honest, caring advice to complete strangers.That’s what gave me the courage to write this post.And someday, I hope to be someone who can give advice to people who are lost like me.I’m still inexperienced, but I believe your words can change the direction of my life.Thank you, truly, for reading all of this.",

Currently my RAL is around 28k, which, considering my experience, I find a bit low. I would like to understand how to improve my position, both in terms of skills and job opportunities.At the moment I work mainly with Angular, but I also have some experience with React. Lately I've been very passionate about the mobile world, more out of personal curiosity than a strategic choice. However, I am open to any advice on how to broaden my skills and improve my professional profile, even in other sectors.My main objectives are:1. ⁠Increase my skills to propose myself to companies with a higher RAL.2. ⁠Gain experience abroad, perhaps in the USA or in any case in an international context.What would you advise me for 2025/26? Is it better to focus on mobile (native or cross-platform) or invest in other technologies that are more in demand internationally? And, in general, what steps would you suggest to make me more competitive on the market?Thanks to anyone who wants to share an opinion or their experience!",

I went all-in on the frontend, but I completely botched the backend and now I'm stuck. I could really use some advice on how to dig myself out of this hole.What I Built (The Good part): · Tech Stack: React Native, TypeScript, React Native Reanimated · The Look: A custom iOS 26 \"Liquid Glass\" inspired UI. · The Feel: Buttery 60fps animations, a type-safe codebase with zero errors, and optimized transitions. · Status: The entire frontend is basically done. It's a high-fidelity prototype. I can even show you a screen recording of how smooth it is.Where I Failed (The ugly part ):· The Mistake: I started coding with ZERO backend design or data model. I just started putting stuff in Firestore as I went along. · The Stack: Firebase Auth & Firestore. · The Problem: My database structure is a complete mess. It's not scalable, the relationships between users, universities, professors, and reviews are tangled, and I'm now terrified to write more queries because nothing makes sense anymore. I basically built a beautiful sports car with a lawnmower engine.What I’m blabbing about is:1.⁠How do I approach untangling this? Do I just nuke the entire Firestore database and start over with a clean plan?2.⁠What are the key questions I should be asking myself when designing the data structure for an app like this?3.⁠Are there any good resources (articles, videos) on designing Firestore structures for complex relational data?4.⁠If you were to sketch a basic data model for this, what would the top-level collections be and how would they relate?Infact what should be my best approach to transitioning to backend then to a Fullstack Developer? I learned a ton about frontend development, but this was my brutal lesson in the importance of full-stack planning. Any guidance you can throw my way would be a lifesaver.Thanks for reading.",

Honestly, the combination of remote work and alcoholism destroyed my mental health that by the time i received that fateful calendar invite, i was relieved. I didn’t have to do it anymore. I got an okay severance but used that and my unemployment to keep me afloat and not homeless for ~6 months. I quit drinking at that time and interviewed for a few jobs.After two final rounds for a couple jobs and not getting it both times, i’ve basically been frozen. I can’t do the interviews, i can barely even bring myself to apply anymore. I thought it would be easier being sober but it’s like my subconscious is trying to sabotage me because of how truly awful it was in those final months of employment. Here i am, 2 years later, and i’m not even sure if it’s possible for me to get a job anymore when i’ve got a two year gap. I’m borderline homeless, staying with family, and i’m kind of sick of it. Delivering uber eats destroyed my car in this time that i literally just cashed out my old 401k, the absolute last of my savings. I have tried camming as well with my girlfriend, since i’m a gay lady with an unreasonably hot girlfriend despite the life circumstances. It was great money but it’s so mentally exhausting, something i seemingly have no capacity for anymore.I haven’t posted in this sub since 2016/17 when i was a new grad and well, i honestly just want to feel like someone else understands my struggle. I feel like a failure and literally don’t know what to do with my life anymore. I had wanted this career since i was a child. What do you do when your dream job eviscerates your mental health? I know i need therapy but there’s no way a broke ass bitch can just afford that when i can’t even afford rent.I’ll probably delete this or maybe it’ll get moderated for not fitting the sub, but y’all, if anyone reads this, thank you for listening.",

        "author": "queenoyster",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "https://imgur.com/a/iRI5FRTI wanted to share my experience interviewing for the past two months in this market. I have a Bachelors of Science in a field unrelated to computer science and graduated in 2020, straight into COVID-world. I'd taken a few computer science courses, so I spent my last semester of university looking for software engineer roles knowing we were probably going to be remote for a while.I've been working for five years, with most of that time at Amazon. I've been a mid-level engineer for roughly 1.5 years, but feel that I should've been promoted sooner. Despite what people say about working at Amazon, I've enjoyed my four years here. I lucked out with finding a good team and manager.My main reasons for leaving are:- Amazon comp philosophy is bad. You are assigned stock to meet a target compensation number, with the assumption that the stock will increase 15% YoY. The stock has actually gained 10% YoY since I've started, which means I'm paid less than my target. The solution to this is Amazon assigns more stock that vests the following years to make up for the gap. This means you'd have to stay longer to meet your target compensation. The reverse is also true. If your actual compensation surpasses your target because of stock gains, then you are assigned fewer/no additional stock vests for the next few years. The employee loses when the stock does well and when the stock does poorly.- Layoffs were coming. The volume of posts about layoffs occurring later this year dramatically increased across Blind, internal Slack, r/amazonemployees, various Discords, etc. Morale was already bad since we did two layoffs prior to 2025.- My work was getting stale.- I felt there was no path to senior for me in the next four years.- I distrust my org's leadership.- I'm in Seattle for Amazon and I've accepted it's not my city. I'd like to move to New York City or San Francisco.Most of the jobs I applied to came from LinkedIn, but I applied manually through the employer's website. I targeted midlevel engineering roles if they were available, otherwise, I applied for senior. Towards the tail end of my job search, I used a browser extension called Simplify to autofill applications. I highly recommend this since you can also use it to keep track of your applications, scrum board style. I spread out my applications so that I would have interviews for the two following weeks.To prepare for my interviews, I bought a year of Leetcode premium and a lifetime subscription to HelloInterview premium. I also joined a Slack server targeted towards engineering leadership career development and participated in mock interviews there. My friends generously offered their time to mock interview me as well. These were great because they gave me very candid feedback. I also searched through Glassdoor for other peoples' interview experiences to get an idea of what to expect for companies I was highly interested in. My weakest round is probably the coding round; I completed 160 Leetcode during this interview cycle and felt that was sufficient. I should note that I would've practiced more Leetcode if I were interviewing with large tech companies like Google or Microsoft, but I didn't hear back from them. I also had never done a system design interview before this job application cycle, so I studied that hard. I read every HelloInterview system design article and felt I overprepared.Managing emotions around rejection was pretty difficult, I'm thankful I have good friends I could talk to. I got rejected from my top 3 target companies and I bedrotted for weeks beating myself up over it. If I were to have done anything different, I would've front-loaded my interviews with companies I cared less about. I felt much more comfortable in my later interviews. I also would've spaced out my interviews more. It was difficult balancing them and a full-time job. I tried to do early morning interviews (I even had two 2AM ones!), but found that my performance really suffered in the morning. I'd block out time in the afternoon instead to do interviews and pray no one at work wanted to schedule over them. I'd often work after hours to catch up on work I'd neglected during the day.I ended this interview cycle with 5 offers: 2 senior and 3 mid-level. Two of these offers were at late stage SF-based AI startups (not any of the big names). I accepted one of these. I don't want to reveal exact numbers, but I'll say that my base comp exceeds my total comp at Amazon, and I am extremely happy with it.",

I am lucky to be financially secure but I feel as if my career is dead. While I know my situation can’t be unique I have not found any information about what do here. Things I have tried/am considering:- I’ve worked on personal projects to fill out my resume. They fill the page out well but are always ignored in actual interviews- I’ve applied to smaller companies and startups, but in my experience it is both harder to find job listings for smaller companies and I am ghosted more often by startups than mid-large companies - I’ve considered going back to school to pursue a masters or change fields, but hesitated when seeing grad schools require recommendations from employers. It could be an option but I’d need to hope my managers that I haven’t kept in touch with would recommend me- I could seek underemployment. Not ideal but better than not accomplishing anything - I can keep applying. Obvious but I dread when the gap on my resume has grown so much I stop getting interviewsAny advice or stories about similar situations appreciatedEdit: I appreciate the honest replies. It seems the general recommendation is to improve my interviewing skills and keep applying. I don’t normally post on social media but getting to discuss this anonymously with others has been very helpful. As many have pointed out, my interview skills are not perfect, and I when I get feedback it’s generally about the system design round. While I can easily create a high level design and have used Hello Interview to practice, I still slip up when asked for low level details about components I haven’t worked with.",

        "author": "JagoffAndOnAgain",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "**tl;dr** 1. Paid an expert to redo my resume, and 2. Ignored LinkedIn/Indeed completely. Bookmarked and applied directly through company Careers/Jobs pages for brand new positions only.---In 2023, I was laid off from a full stack job I loved and was at for 9 years. The severance package provided some \"career coaching and resume assistance\" via Randstad. So I used them to redo my resume which I had always done entirely myself with no external help, including AI. I thought it was a lot better.I was wrong. Throughout the next 6 months in the spring and summer of 2023, I applied to 171 jobs (with 13 YoE at the time). I heard back from 12 (7%), was ghosted by 5 of those and rejected by 4 more. When I accepted my contract position, I ended two other interviews.Cut to this summer 2025. I was thankful for the contract position but wasn't particularly interested in the domain. Also, I got cabin fever working remotely. My new apartment's home office is a lot sadder than the old one. I need to get out of the house and see the sun which I don't do when WFH. I totally understand why most people love WFH- I did it for years. It's just not great for me personally long term. For all this reasons, I began hunting despite the doom and gloom around the current job market.For a few months, I stuck to my old habits. I added my current position to my resume but kept it basically the same as before. I applied to LinkedIn posts along with hundreds of other people. And I was back to my 2023 numbers. In fact, it was worse. I was only hearing back 5% of the time (which this time was only one job) and they ghosted me after one interview. Fuckers.---**1.** I realized I needed a change. I had a gut feeling my resume wasn't great. It wasn't getting me the first look. I'm a software engineer, not a resume expert. These are two entirely different skillsets. A younger me scoffed at the idea of resume writing being valuable: \"I write great code on cool systems, that should be easy enough for anyone to glean from my resume!\" Idiot. I searched \"software engineer resume coach\" and found one with great TrustPilot reviews. I spent $300 for someone to take my old resume, ask me clarifications, and return a brand new resume back to me about a week later.I cannot tell you how much of an upgrade the second resume is. The first one looks like dogshit by comparison. My old resume was a massive wall of text combining some tech keywords with the resume guidance of the late 2000's (my college era when I learned to write a resume). This new version had largely the same information, but it was presented in a much more impressive way. I was impressed by my own resume. It also surprisingly gave me a new sense of confidence going into interviews. It had way more metrics and quantitive points than I had on there.My callback rate when from 5% to 25%. Post-resume glow up, I applied to 12 positions and heard back from 3. Pretty stunning turnaround.But an improved resume wasn't the only thing I changed in this round of job hunting. I changed my application tactics.---**2.** In 2023 and part of my 2025 hunt, I spent a lot of time on LinkedIn applying to jobs according to filters and advanced searches. This just never felt particularly useful. You're adding another layer of software between your resume and a human being's eyes. Also, I just hate LinkedIn. People are so strange and phony on there. So I abandoned it.Instead, I started searching for lists of companies based in my city. I would then bookmark their Careers or Jobs pages in a folder in my browser. By the end of my hunt, I bookmarked about 55 pages. And a few times per week, I would spent about half an hour looking at every single one.I was looking for jobs posted within the last 48 hours but ideally that day. If a day was posted longer than 3 days ago, I considered it a dead end. You want to be in the first 50 in a stack of resumes.Job posting aggregators are a wasteland. I think these days HR looks at the stack of applications in their domain first, then looks to LinkedIn and Indeed if they see nothing promising.---With these two tactics, I interviewed with a few places, narrowed it down to two, and chose the one I was most excited about. It's been off to a good start so far.Anyways, that is my advice from my past few years of job hunting in the frustrating market/economy/country/existence. Good luck!When I posted this to r/experienceddevs I got accused of being an ad almost instantly, so FYI I will not be recommending the resume service I used. Just search around and I'm sure you'll find someone capable. This is merely advice for what seemed to work for me.",

Many of my friends have done very well on these stocks throughout the last tech bubble and refuse to sell, even though some of their company stocks have since taken a dip. They believe they will make back their unrealized gains. Some of their reasoning is:> It will bounce back, tech stocks are still in a bull market!> I work for the company and things are going really well right now!> It's performed really well in the past!*None of this matters.* Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Most companies that were listed on stock exchanges 100 years ago are *gone*. Many tech stocks today have high P/E ratios and other indicators that suggest they are overvalued. If the AI bubble bursts, it is highly likely that your company's stock will take a hit, regardless of how you perceive their level of exposure to that area.Imagine having a large percentage of your net worth tied up in one stock you picked. This is what you have, effectively. I'm not going to give people here a full rundown on basic investing, but a diversified portfolio is always a strong choice. Speak with an investment professional. Over the long term, a diversified portfolio is always the smart move. Being a bagholder isn't fun. Anyways, none of this is investment advice, do what you want.",

This faded away due to the whole covid situation, and long story short everyone ended up graduating at their own time and going their own ways.Fast forward a few years and i have very few friends and i find myself doing fuck all on weekends. It's honestly kinda sad man. When I was in uni I'd have a lot of events to go to with friends, but no money or time. Now I have the means and time, but no friends or events to go to. Nowadays my coworkers will ask me \"what are you plans for the weekend?\" and i have to lie cause i feel like they'll probably laugh at me for being 26 with little/no social life. I like my job as a SWE but a majority of time I feel very empty outside of work. I've felt this way for about 2 years now, and idk i feel like it's slowly killing me inside.A few hobbies i'm involved in : Clubbing (Fun, but havent had much success making friends there), Church(Great people, but nobody around my age range), Gym( I don't really talk to people at the gym cause they're probably very focused on their workout), and hiking (Met a few great people, but rarely do i see them again)Any advice?",

        "content": "Hey everyone,I’m about six months into my first full-time software engineering job at Apple, and I constantly feel like an imposter. I still don’t fully understand what’s being discussed in stand-up sometimes — people talk about complex systems and dependencies like it’s second nature, and I just nod along feeling lost.I also find myself relying on AI to generate a lot of my code. It’s something that’s actually encouraged here, but part of me worries it’s making me dependent. I do try to read and understand what it’s doing afterward, but I still feel like I’m just barely keeping up. Without it, though, I honestly think I’d be completely lost and wouldn’t finish half of what I need to do.For example, right now I’m doing some performance testing — running network tests, analyzing latency, and comparing different protocols — and it’s been going on for a while. I just keep feeling like I’m missing something or not doing it the “right” way. Part of me wonders if someone else had this task instead of me, it would’ve been done by now.I also feel like I’m getting things done, but not really understanding them. I can complete the tasks, but idk if i’m even doing them well and I wish I truly understood how and why everything works the way it does — the underlying architecture, the reasoning, the “why” behind each step. It makes me feel like I’m just going through the motions rather than growing as an engineer.Lately I’ve also been feeling kind of dumb — not in a self-deprecating way, but genuinely wondering if maybe my brain just doesn’t think the way a CS brain should. Like, maybe I’m not smart enough for this kind of work. I see how effortlessly some people grasp things like system architecture or debugging complex issues, and I feel like I’m missing whatever “clicks” for them.What really gets to me is hearing how confidently everyone else speaks — about QE, testing flows, deployment, architecture, tokens, etc etc — and I just… don’t feel like I understand the bigger picture. I can get individual tasks done, but I don’t yet “get” how all the pieces fit together in a large-scale system.Has anyone else gone through this? How do you actually learn to think like a real engineer and not just a task-doer? How do I become that person who genuinely knows what they’re doing and speaks knowledgeably and doesn’t just pray to somehow make it through the day without being confused out of my mind? Is this normal? Are there courses, books, or resources that helped you connect the dots and understand the bigger picture of how software systems work in practice?Any advice would mean a lot.",

My last job was in a big household name company but not one known for tech (more publishing) in Java. I never felt I was more than mediocre, and then I got sick with nebulous undiagnosable long covid, which made my performance worse, and I became an easy budget cut. After a few months of inactive burnout (where I lost a lot of muscle memory), and a few months of sending out CVs, I had pretty much given up on getting any significant interviews any time soon and was pretty much just messing around with ones I didn't care about and building my portfolio as much as possible, with an aim of just learning out loud and then leveraging that in my next round of applying. I was making a language learning app with some NLP elements in python for the last couple months. I haven't written much Java since April, and even then, my last position was fullstack and they had me on a lot of frontend in the final year. I haven't done any leetcode since June (and most DSA I haven't revisited since I got hired at my last place >2 years ago). Studying up on the systems design I'm starting to be expected to understand better as a now potential mid was in my backlog.Suddenly, two days ago I got an email from a big tech company (not FAANG but close, and in an adjacent field to my last company) I had applied to a month or more ago. I remember filling in the application form thinking \"I don't know why I am doing this, I should definitely wait until I have improved myself and have an actual chance. They're going to think this application is pathetic\". I expected no response and honestly forgot entirely about the job position or what I even wrote in that form. They want to interview me for a Java position.I can only assume they saw how my last company is actually vaguely relevant to their product and clicked on my github and saw how active I am rn and actually wanted to give me a chance.I have accepted, have HR on Tuesday, I'm just trying to work out how to get myself in gear in time for the next stage if it happens. Currently revisiting all of DSA on leetcode and doing problems but I'm unsure I can manage to internalise this stuff in time... Plus there are other elements like SD that I need to look over.How would you strategise going about this? Have any of you been in a similar situation and given it your best shot? Lmk",

So there's still a lot of remote jobs out there; it shouldn't be impossible to get a remote job. It's at least anywhere to 1/5 to 1/2 of jobs, depending on the term used.

        "author": "PentaSector",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey all. Apologies for the long post. Mainly want to be thorough to emphasize the efforts I've made and the scope of the problem.So, I manage a small squad of devs on a larger project team and maintain a full-time dev workload alongside them. (I know what you're thinking, and you're right, but I've accepted the challenge for the sake of my trajectory.)This is my first managerial role; I was deliberately given less advanced devs, partly to mentor them and help boost their professional development, partly to shield them from aggressive technical leadership. I was fine with that assignment; it plays to my strengths as a mentor and safe space steward. I do what I can to foster collaboration and self-organization - we have* a chat channel just for my reports and me (i.e., a space to screen \"stupid\" questions before asking the wider team, etc.)* regular meetings to check up on work status and collaborate on blockers in real time* 1:1 and 1:few meetings to get people comfortable and talking through obstacles* me frequently working to communicate thought process to the team through detailed code reviews, driving on pair/group programming sessions, and brainstorming out loud during aforementioned meetingsBasically, I'm doing everything I can to not only get people working together, but also to make sure they see the work through my eyes as much as I can verbalize my process.I'm confident in asserting that I'm putting forth disproportionate effort in getting them somewhere closer to my level. My efficiency suffers for it, but leadership is generally happy with my velocity, and I'm still significantly more efficient than the rest of the team. Some of them are legitimately junior and gradually ramping up, but a few have more YoE than I do and frequently submit incomplete, incorrect, or arguably badly engineered solutions (acknowledging that the latter is somewhat subject to my opinions, but it's also the least of my worries). This manifests in incredibly frustrating ways, like having to talk through the same technical guidance or arguments repeatedly as people continue to make the exact same mistakes, and having to frequently repeat what strikes me as obvious advice to solve refactoring or bugfixing problems (e.g., if you're trying to correlate a code path to a navigation path within a web app, start with a known related unit of code and follow the references). Tl;dr: lack of curiosity seems to be a major factor.These are the kinds of problems that resulted in me being stepped up to manage these devs, and the lack of improvement is felt across the wider team. This manifests pretty clearly in the fact that we estimate our own roadmap and have decent leeway to do so, and the devs aren't even meeting their own numbers when they get the padding they argue for. We're essentially not at liberty to stretch our roadmap much further, just given the dependencies on our output, so when we fall behind on our own estimates, it's a problem, and people come under scrutiny.I was recently asked to pull the tech lead into one of our regular meetings - one where mob coding is a frequent engagement - to help gauge the situation. After sitting in on a few rounds, his assessment was that I'm doing enough of the work that they ultimately have no need to be curious when I drive, and he's right. Anytime the devs pull me aside, it turns into me taking the cockpit and talking through how I work; I always let them start, but I usually take over *because* they essentially hit a point where they're just lost or out of ideas, including in the context of obstacles we've specifically worked through before.His proposed solution was to start letting them fail immediately. There's a version of this that I can get on with, but this work environment is not particularly tolerant of the kind of \"failure\" it would entail, and I don't want to put anybody's job at risk.So my question is essentially this:**What's a graduated approach I can take to get people working more independently that gives willing devs a chance and respects my time?**I don't foresee something like purposely tracking my collab hours and tuning them down each week; that'll never hold up. I *have* contemplated cutting all collab hours and letting code review be our only touchpoint. The problem here is that several devs don't seem to internalize review feedback, and PR churn sometimes results in exponential loss of time. E.g., they may submit a PR after one day but take two more to fix relatively simple issues. I'm essentially looking for a way to provide detailed, immediate feedback that they *will* internalize, while keeping my time burden for that sort of effort stable and eventually decreasing.Moreover, **what's a way to do this that doesn't leave people feeling demoralized or traumatized?** I'm clearly frustrated, but these are still people, and I don't want to make their lives hard. I just want to see them perform to their potential.Open to any insights regarding successful approaches that folks have taken here to empower and motivate their teams, especially if starting from a place of subpar performance.Also feel free to ask clarifying questions or hurl clarifying insults; there's surely a lot of context I'm leaving out here, probably in part just because I'm fixating on solving the problem more than thinking broadly around it.**EDIT:** remove a rogue instance of the word \"I'm.\"",

Job was a \"bait-and-switch\", which went from building cool new tech to endless data-munging. I'm miserable and have lost passion for coding.**My Background:*** **Education:** PhD in CS (Systems and Networking) from a top Asian university. BSc from another top Asian university.* **Current Role:** 1 year as a quant developer at a financial firm (think HFT or fund) in a major hub with very low / no taxes.**The \"Golden Handcuffs\":*** **Salary:** In the $180-190k USD range, tax-free.* **Perks:** Good vacation and remote policy.**The \"Bait-and-Switch\" Problem:*** The first 6 months was great. I was tasked with a challenging R&D project using a modern tech stack (Rust), which I had to learn on the fly. It was exactly what I wanted.* Afterwards, that project was suddenly and quietly de-prioritized. My manager reassigned me to what is effectively a data integration role. My entire job now is just endless, repetitive grunt work, fighting with terrible data formats from vendors and doing basic ETL.* To make it worse, the senior devs on the team have all managed to get themselves onto new, interesting projects, leaving me and other juniors to handle this \"data plumbing.\" Management is vague when I raise concerns. Changing teams isn't an option either.I feel that my passion for coding is gone, extinguished by this job. I feel miserable and am experiencing burnout symptoms. I have zero energy or interest in side projects or open source (which I was quite keen on before).**My Questions:**1. Is this loss of passion just a temporary reaction to this specific job? Or is it a sign I'll just end up in another \"boredom -> misery\" cycle if I change jobs?2. Am I just being an entitled or lazy person who \"hates all work\"? The relatively decent salary makes me feel incredibly guilty for complaining.3. What's a viable path? Other quant firms, tech companies, crypto, or simply stop complaining and keep cleaning data?I feel like my career is stalling and I'm wasting my life. Any advice would be appreciated.",

        "author": "HYV_Empathy",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "For context, I'm 27m and I used to work as a team lead for high-level FE development (HTML/JS/CSS only work, basically). My role was basically Technical Project Manager (who sometimes writes code or makes websites) by the end of it, and I was hating it. I wanted to leave management and get back to development, so I self-taught Vue and React basics to the point of being able to pass an interview and learn on the job.About 9 months ago, I got a new job as a Vue developer. During the interview process, my now-boss said that she understood the level to which I understood Vue was below what they'd expect of an employee, but they were willing to train me.Perfect! That's exactly what I was looking for, especially since the money was a significant increase compared to what I was earning in my old role as a team lead, so I thought I'd struck gold. And for the first 6 months, it felt that way.Going from knowing Vue at a hobby/passing activity level to a professional level was a difficult climb, but I felt like I was still making progress each day.Lately, however, I have felt like a wasted paycheck and a burden to the team. My main mentor figure changed departments as experienced resource was needed elsewhere, and while I have people I can still reach out to for help, I just keep hitting block after block and feel over-reliant on them.We use Sentry for bug management, and I absolutely cannot stand it. I keep trying to investigate issues, get stuck, reach out to a colleague only for them to say \"Oh, that's likely due to xyz\" when \"xyz\" never even crossed my mind.It feels like I've been plateaued for months now, and I can't get past it. I asked my now-boss for help a while back, and she's given me the advice of \"When you encounter something you don't understand, research the technology.\" along with \"Create a simpler, working version of the part that's broken, then try and apply that logic.\"This advice is great...for simple issue that can be Googled or technology I understand the concepts of. If I see \"Axios error 123\" or \"Apollo error: this is what's wrong...\" then brilliant! I can read the documentation!But for more vague issues like \"This is our component that's nested in 13 other components, it's not working as intended, figure out why.\" I can SOMETIMES get to the bottom of it, but I have just kept hitting walls of bugs where someone who wrote the system is needed because they understand how it works (the company seems entirely averse to adding comments explaining their code).What I'm struggling with is I just don't know if I enjoy this anymore. A few months ago, I LOVED my job - I'd hit the gold mine and life was going great.Lately though...I have spoken to a therapist and three separate GPs who signed me off for the last two weeks due to \"Acute stress reaction\" (probably not allowed to go into detail on this sub). I'd done a lot of thinking and soul-searching over the last two weeks, hit today (my first day back) with a positive attitude, and yet within 4 hours I'd returned to my habit of crying at my desk.It doesn't help that I work from home, since I'm alone in my room all the time. We go to the office once a week, but I'm the only one from my department and actually works on this codebase who goes in, so I just end up working in a room full of people who are more intelligent and experienced than me, but have never looked at a single line of code that I'm responsible for working on.I just feel stuck. I want to love this job and this career, but the way this job has made me feel lately...it's not living.Has anyone else experienced this? Going from light FE work (HTML, JS, and CSS only) to Vue/React development, picking up the basics, and then just hitting a brick wall 9 months later?Does anyone have any advice?P.S. My therapist has recently advised she thinks I have ADHD, and that perfectionism and unreasonable standards for myself are some of my symptoms and trigger my mental overload/shutdown when I hit my fifth brick wall of the day. I wonder if that's relevant... /s",

        "content": "I am a tech guy with over 10 years of experience. I got my PhD in CS from a good US school, and perhaps just as relevant for the topic, I got a minor in history. I worked in tech in the US, Germany, UK, the Netherlands, and visited China many times for work.To various extents, I've seen the the development of AI, dot-com bubble (indirectly), big data boom, cloud revolution, the Bitcoin inception, the LLMs, and a few side-hypes like the quantum computing.I'm also well-aware of the overall crisis of science, especially with respect to publishing and funding, that spans far beyond the boundaries of Computer Science. Nevertheless, I would argue that no major scientific discipline is in a worse danger than CS, and I'm proceeding to expand on that.Tech has generated an unprecedented amount of wealth over the last three decades. That wealth produced the political power that influenced the society. Unlike some other historically influential movements, this one chose an unsubtle method of societal influence that generates unprecedented amount of discontent, and therefore I denote the people who hold this power as \"moguls.\" Worse even for the tech community, the moguls hid their ideological underpinnings and political ambitions behind their \"tech nerd\" images. History teaches us that the majority of the upcoming backlash will center around the images the moguls perpetuate and not their chosen ideologies. Although one could argue that a scientific or engineering discipline may spontaneously evaporate upon fulfilling its historical role, I assume that CS is not at that stage. That is to say that there still exist problems that CS can help humanity with.Under the above assumption, how do we defend CS (and tech) as a discipline once the \"shit hits the fan,\" pardon my French? How do we argue that it's not tech that is evil, but the ideologies fueling the tech moguls?",

I’m pursuing Senior SWE position(s). Through my recruiter screening and technical phone parts, I believe I’ve shown that I’m technically strong, and I think they know through my introductions that I haven’t mentored or led projects. That’s why I’m curious about what expectations I should anticipate when speaking with the hiring manager.This market is tough, so I’m taking all the help I can get. I’m self-aware that socializing isn’t my strongest skill. In past hiring processes for SWE II roles, I tended to succeed at companies that emphasized LeetCode-style technical assessments. But at places where the behavioral portion carried weight, I often fell short—partly because I optimized only for the technical side.Now I’m focused on building strong behavioral stories. I’ve read advice online suggesting it’s okay to “fake it till you make it,” which I interpreted as exaggerating my impact or responsibilities. My assumption was that as long as I know the details well enough to answer follow-up questions, I could frame my contributions more strongly.Overall, I’d love tips on how to frame stories and strategies to present myself effectively to the hiring manager. I’m willing to invest significant time into this preparation since acing the behavioral round feels like a fixed cost in today’s market",

I'm learning a lot, and especially in this economy, I'm SO grateful to be working this job.Thing is, though, I know I can be replaced, and that's never gonna change no matter what I do, but what would you guys recommend I do to make myself slightly less replaceable? I've already been told about the areas in which I'm lacking performance-wise, so I'm gonna lock in and try to stay on top of everything and do the best I can. My company also offers reimbursement for passing exams like CCCNA and Security+, which I'm definitely going to take advantage of when I get more schoolwork out of the way, because that's kind of the direction I want to go anyway. I already have some experience part-time tech support somewhere else, but it took me almost two years of working freelance and warehouse since then to get offered this IT position, and I'm very worried about layoffs and whatnot.

For reference, I am a data engineer in the semi-conductor industry, and the number of times that I have worked on a project only to:1. Get held up by permissions and access constantly, and have to submit an IT ticket that gets put on the back burner for weeks.2. Find out that I need to use the approved by IT tools/resources which are often completely ass and hold no real world value, and hinder progress, because people making these decisions are looking at safety and budget, not actual function. Looking at you Power Automate flow, the worst platform I have ever had the displeasure of using in my entire life… all because my company won’t allow anyone not directly on the software team to create an actual web application outside of Power App and Power automate flow.3. Deal with management misunderstanding priorities and getting caught up on their grandiose visions of ML/AI which is just literally a buzz word at this point and they have no understanding of what is actually meant by these words. I had a boss that wanted me, by myself, to implement a way to monitor FSE’s , with AI, who are working on the tool to ensure they’re installing the parts outlined in procedures… sir… what?! He pressed us to do this for months despite telling him it isn’t attainable, and he just kept saying, “figure it out.” Until finally he left the he company.4. Management or stakeholders who want a detailed, image based, representation of every single change you accidentally mention instead of just making discretely. I had a manager for a while who, for example, in one meeting I mentioned I have to change the data type of a column on my not even proof of concept project yet, and he had me spend 6 days making DAGs, picture based PowerPoints, and tons of other documentation, because he wanted to understand better… this was a guy who bragged about lying on his resume to get a tech job management position and was previously just monitoring processes and creating tickets when processes failed for wafer runs in the fab…. Needless to say, he was shortly thereafter demoted lol.And so many other things.The point is, exercise, go for walks, meditate, or some thing else to build resilience and clear your mind, and learn patience, because the biggest thing I have learned in the last 3-4 years in this industry is that you will run into so many absurd issues or requests that are in no way based in logic, and are purely emotional, and if you let it eat at you, it’s going to destroy your mental health, work relationships, etc.Godspeed y’all. Edit: I also want to emphasize, I am so grateful to have a job, I love my company, I love the management that I have most of the time. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have worked here for 10 years now. I understand things could be significantly worse and I could be on tour in the infantry or something. I just wanted to touch on something that I think affects many people in this industry and they don’t get credit for it.",

There is a significant amount of duplicated logic/JSX, and components are often built more than once. The applications I've seen currently \"work\" but are going to be a nightmare to maintain.This environment feels toxic for learning how to be a good developer, as I am essentially being trained in anti-patterns.

I've read that gaining experience in project management, improving soft skills, and building a portfolio of significant projects are crucial for this transition. However, I'm unsure about the best steps to take. Should I pursue certifications, seek mentorship, or contribute to open-source projects? What specific skills or experiences should I focus on to make myself a more competitive candidate for mid-level roles? Additionally, how important is networking in this process? I'm looking for any insights or personal experiences from those who have successfully made this jump.",

But a few months back, someone told me that to be “job applicable” or to get some of my project to good level, I \\*need\\* backend skills too. Personally, I hate web dev I might get hate for saying this, but backend feels more logical and fun to me.Most of my batchmates use Spring Boot (Java) or Dj/Flask/Rest (Python). I didn’t want to pick Java or JS, so I started learning Go last week. So far it doesn’t seem too hard, but I’ve heard that goroutines and Gin get tricky later on.So, my question is: Should I focus on Python (faster prototyping, slower execution), or Go (backend-focused, is fast and unique, but harder to master as a developer language)? Would love to hear some insights!!(if I'm breaking feel free to take this down)",

        "content": "How do I grow from where I am? I feel either I’m losing steam or don’t have a defined plan, hence not truly working toward some goal.My goal is simple — to get or be in a position where I am employable. But to make myself employable, I am either overwhelmed or do not have a clear direction on what to prioritize.I started my career late — I got a true programming job at 28 years old. Since then, I’ve been with my current employer doing Java and legacy C# development for six years. I started job hunting three years ago, on and off. It has been a learning experience since then — crafting my resume better and using the time to upskill in domains like cloud (Azure) and doing mini personal projects to gain exposure to different technologies.In the past three years, I have gone through system design and done LeetCode. Lately, I’ve given up on LeetCode or lost motivation for it since I legitimately believe it’s not providing any real conversion. I have failed onsite not on LeetCode but on general full-stack knowledge — like authentication — or failed system design on “design of a job scheduler.” More importantly, since my day job doesn’t involve building projects from scratch and mostly focuses on enhancing legacy or large codebases, I don’t have real exposure to building, I guess.What can I realistically do right now? What should I prioritize as short-term and long-term goals? For the long term, I feel I’m either at a fork in the road or should use what I have so far and somehow leverage it. Since my background really isn’t related to true backend, DevOps, or cybersecurity — at its core, it’s just debugging and solving proprietary problems.As I type this, I have headhunters reaching out and I have two CodeSignals to complete, but I just don’t feel motivated at all and feel like there’s been a massive waste of time — or that there’s something I’m doing wrong.With that said, my thoughts for next steps are:1. Dive into the world of machine learning to gain exposure to another segment and see if it sticks with me or not.2. Get comfortable with React, which might open doors to building serious full-stack applications — this will give me much-needed hands-on experience in building and deploying solutions end to end. 3. Pursue Azure Solution Architect/DevOps certification — there is an intermediate Azure certification that’s just boring AF, and I lose interest really fast. It deals with group policy and similar things — the stuff an Azure admin would do. Is this something a SWE should really know?4. Skip the whole machine learning world and try exploring MLOps — I found resources on Reddit. My biggest issue is that since they don’t have any certificate or real-life usage at my current workplace, my gut feeling is that after spending months and months, I’ll have nothing to show for it.Given all this, with limited exposure in my day job, how do I leverage my current situation and make the most of it? As of now to 'grow', I will do item 2 since I am fairly comfortable getting the back-end working in either Java/Node.js and deploying to local VMs. Deploying to K8S will be interesting task.Before other folks say it, I should mention transferring to another role within the org is not possible. It will reset promo cycle. Some days, I feel my life would be so much easier if I had just worked at FAANG - it might be fallacy but perhaps working there automatically drives your career to the next level. But as of now, I am not that talented with LC at all. I suffer from ADHD which might be another issue.",
