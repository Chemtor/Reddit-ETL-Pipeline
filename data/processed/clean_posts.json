        "author": "BoredAt",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "This is a long article, so sit down and get some popcorn :slightly_smiling_face:At this point everyone here has already read of the newest merger on the block. I think it's been (at least for me) a bit difficult to get the full story of why and whats going. I’m going to try to give what I suspect is really going on here and why it's happening.*TLDR: Fivetran is getting squeezed on both sides and DBT has hit its peak, so they’re trying to merge to take a chunk off the warehouses and reach Databricks valuation (10b atm -> 100b Databricks/Snowflake)*First, a collect of assumptions from my side:* Fivetran is getting squeezed at the top by warehouses (Databricks, Snowflake) commoditizing EL for their enterprise contracts. Why ask your enterprise IT team to get legal to review another vendor contract (which will take another few 100ks of the budget) when you can do just 1 vendor? With EL at cost (cause the money is in query compute, not EL)?* Fivetran is getting squeezed at the bottom by much cheaper commoditized vendors (Airbyte, DLTHub, Rivery, etc.)* DBT has peaked and isn’t really growing much.For the first, the [proof](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/what-is-open-data-infrastructure) from DBTs article:> As a result, customers became frustrated with the tool-integration challenges and the inability to solve the larger, cross-domain problems. Customers began demanding more integrated solutions—asking their existing vendors to “do more” and leave in-house teams to solve fewer integration challenges themselves. Vendors saw this as an opportunity to grow into new areas and extend their footprints into new categories. This is neither inherently good nor bad. End-to-end solutions can drive cleaner integration, better user experience, and lower cost. But they can also limit user choice, create vendor lock-in, and drive up costs. The devil is in the details.> In particular, the data industry has, during the cloud era, been dominated by five huge players, each with well over $1 billion in annual revenue: Databricks, Snowflake, Google Cloud, AWS, and Microsoft Azure. Each of these five players started out by building an analytical compute engine, storage, and a metadata catalog. But over the last five years as the MDS story has played out, each of their customers has asked them to “do more.” And they have responded. Each of these five players now includes solutions across the entire stack: ingestion, transformation, notebooks and BI, orchestration, and more. They have now effectively become “all-in-one data platforms”—bring data, and do everything within their ecosystem.For the second point, you only need to go to the pricing page of any of the alternatives. Fivetran is expensive, plan and simple. For the third, I don’t really have any formal proof. You can take it as my opinion I suppose.With those 3 facts in mind, it seems like the game for DBTran (I’m using that name from now one :slightly_smiling_face:) is then to try to flip the board on the warehouses. Normally, the data warehouse is where things start, with other tools (think data catalogs, transformation layer, semantic layer, etc.) being an add on that they try to commoditize. This is why snowflake and databricks are worth 100b+. Instead, DBTran is trying to make the warehouse be the commodity. This is namely by using a somewhat new tech. Iceberg (not gonna explain iceberg here, feel free to read that elsewhere).If Iceberg is implemented, then compute and storage are split. The traditional warehouse vendors (bigquery, clickhouse, snowflake, etc.) are simply compute engines on top of the iceberg tables. Merely another component that can be switched out at will. Storage is an s3 bucket. DBTran would then be the rest. It would look a bit like:* Storage - **S3, GCS, etc.** * Compute - **Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.*** Iceberg Catalog - **DBTran*** EL - **DBTran*** Transformation Layer - **DBTran*** Semantic Layer - **DBTran**They could probably add more stuff here. Buy Lightdash maybe and get into BI? But I don’t imagine they would need to (not a big enough market). Rather, I suspect they want to take a chunk off the big guys. So get that sweet, sweet compute enterprise budget by carving them out in half and eating it.So should anyone in this subreddit care? I suppose it depends. If you don’t care about what tool you use, its business as usual. You’ll get something for EL, something for T and so on. Data engineering hasn’t fundamentally changed. If you care about OSS (which I do) then this is worth watching. I’m not sure if this is good or bad. I wouldn’t switch to DBT Fusion anytime soon. But if by any chance DBTran make the semantic layer and the EL OSS (even on an elastic license) then this might actually be a good thing for OSS. Great even.But I wouldn’t bet on that. DBT made Metricsflow proprietary. Fivetran is proprietary. If you want OSS, its best to look elsewhere.",

        "content": "Okay, so recently I’ve been learning and experimenting with Databricks for data projects. I work mainly with AWS, and I’m having some trouble understanding exactly how Databricks improves a pipeline and in what ways it simplifies development.Right now, we’re using Athena + dbt, with MWAA for orchestration. We’ve fully adopted Athena, and one of its best features for us is the federated query capability. We currently use that to access all our on-prem data, we’ve successfully connected to SAP Business One, SQL Server and some APIs, and even went as far as building a custom connector using the SDK to query SAP S/4HANA OData as if it were a simple database table.We’re implementing the bronze, silver, and gold (with iceberg) layers using dbt, and for cataloging we use AWS Glue databases for metadata, combined with Lake Formation for governance.And so for our dev experience is just making sql code all day long, the source does not matter(really) ... If you want to move data from the OnPrem side to Aws you just do \"create table as... Federated (select * from table) and that's it... You moved data from onprem to aws with a simple Sql, it applies to every source So my question is: could you provide clear examples of where Databricks actually makes sense as a framework, and in what scenarios it would bring tangible advantages over our current stack?",

In reality, it’s actually a complete team However, the expectation is that one DE is responsible for all of the areas; understanding the data model, owning telemetry/product analytics, ensuring data quality, maintaining data pipelines, building the dw and finally either building charts or partnering with analytics/reporting on the BI. The point being that if one of these teams drops the ball, the blame still falls on the DE. I’ve had this expectation everywhere I’ve been. Some places are better than others in terms of how big the Data team can be and perhaps placing more responsibility on the downstream and upstream teams, but it’s generally never a “you are only responsible for this area”I’m rambling a bit but hopefully you get the idea. Is it only my experience? Is it only a startup thing? I’m curious to hear from others.",

Downside is that it involves custom coding, no sql, just is implemented using vectors and hash tables. Other downside is if this server goes down it takes some time to reload all the data. Also machine needs lots of ram. Upside is the query is very fast.I understand a type of aggregate materialized view could be used. But this doesn’t seem to work if clauses added to where.

IT dept tried to setup polyrepo for n different projects but I refused)This setup is causing major challenges or at least I do not understand how to:* As far as I am aware, zero copy cloning doesn't work across Snowflake accounts, making it impossible to easily copy production data to DEV for testing* We don't have dedicated DevOps people so setting up CI/CD workflows feels complicated* Testing ML pipelines is extremely difficult without realistic data given we cannot easily copy data from prod to dev account in SnowflakeI've been reading through blogs & docs but I'm still confused about what's standard practice for this circumstance. I'd really appreciate some real-world insights from people who've been in similar situations.# This is my best attempt to distill the questions:* For a small team like ours (4 people handling all data work), is it common to have completely separate Snowflake accounts AND separate Airflow deployments for each environment? Or do most companies use a single Snowflake account with separate databases for DEV/UAT/PROD and a single Airflow instance with environment-specific configurations?* How do you handle testing with production-like data when you can't clone production data across accounts? For ML development especially, how do you validate models without using actual production data?* What's the practical workflow for promoting changes from DEV to UAT to PROD? We're using GitHub branches for each environment but I'm not sure how to structure the CI/CD process for both dbt models and Airflow DAGs without dedicated DevOps support* How do you handle environment-specific configurations in dbt and Airflow when they're completely separate deployments? Like, do you run Airflow & dbt in DEV environment to generate data for validation and do it again across UAT & PROD? How does this work?Again, I have tried my best to arcitulate the headaches that I am having and any practical advice would be super helpful. Thanks in advance for any insights and enjoy your rest of Sunday!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Sorry I’m posting from a new account as my main one indicates my full name.I'm a fairly new hire at a fintech company that deals with payment data from a bunch of different banks and clients. I was hired a few months ago as a Data Analyst but the role has become super flexible right now, and I'm basically the only person purely focused on data.I spent the first few months under the Operations team helping with reconciliation (since my manager, who is now gone, wasn't great at it), using Excel/Google Sheets and a few Python scripts to expedite that process. That messy part is thankfully over, and I'm free to do data stuff.The problem is, I'm not experienced enough to lead a data team or even know the best place to start. I'm hoping you all can help me figure out how to shape my role, what to prioritize, and how to set myself up for growth.I’m comfortable with Python and SQL and have some exposure to Power BI, but not advanced. Our stack includes AWS, Metabase via PostgreSQL (for reporting to clients/partners or to expose our data to non technical colleagues e.g. customer support). No Snowflake or Spark that I'm aware of. Any data engineering tasks are currently handled by the software engineers.Note: A software engineer who left some time ago used dbt for a bit and I'm very interested in picking this up, if relevant. I was given a mix of BAU reporting tasks (client growth, churn rate, performance metrics, etc.) but the CTO gave me a 3-month task to investigate our current data practices, suggest improvements, and recommend new tools based on business needs (like Power BI).My ideal plan is to slowly transition into a proper Data Engineering role. I want to take over those tasks from the developers, build a more robust and automated reporting pipeline, and get hands-on with ETL practices and more advanced coding/SQL. I want to add skills to my CV that I'll be proud of and are also in demand.I'd really appreciate any advice on two main areas:1. a. What are the most effective things I can do right now to improve my daily work and start shaping the data?b. How do I use the currently available tools (PostgreSQL, Metabase, Python) to make my life easier when generating reports and client insights? Should I try to resurrect and learn dbt to manage my SQL transformations?c. Given the CTO's task, what kind of \"wrong practices\" should I be looking for in our current data processes?2.a. How do I lay the foundation for a future data engineering role, both in terms of learning and advocating for myself?b. What should I be learning in my spare time to get ready for data engineering tasks (i.e., Python concepts, ETL/ELT, AWS courses)?c. How do I effectively communicate the need for more proper Data Engineering tools/processes to the higher-ups and how do I make it clear I want to be doing that in the future?Sorry for the long post, and I'm aware of any red flags you see as well, but I need to stay in this role for at least a year or two (for my CV to have that fintech experience) so I want to make the best out of it.

        "content": "This is a problem I’ve been thinking about for quite some time, and I just can’t wrap my head around it.It’s generally recommended to partition data by the time it lands in S3 (i.e., event processing time) so that your pipelines are easier to make idempotent and deterministic. That makes sense operationally — but it creates a disconnect because business users don’t care about processing time; they care about event time.To complicate things further, it’s also recommended to keep your bronze layer append-only and handle deduplication downstream.So, I have three main questions:1. How would you approach partitioning in the bronze layer under these constraints?2. How would you design an efficient deduplication view on top of the bronze layer, given that it can contain duplicates and the business only cares about the latest record?3. Given that there might be intermediary steps in between, like dbt transformations when going from bronze to gold. How do you partition data in each layer so that your pipeline can scale? Is achieving idempotentcy and deterministic behavior at scale a huge challenge? I would be grateful if there are any resources on it that you can point me towards too?",

Im new to the Data Engineering world but i come from infrastructure with experience standing Data factories and some simple pipelines. Last month we implemented a Databricks DLT Meta framework that we just scrapped and pivoted to a similar design that doesn't rely on all those onboarding ddl etc files. Now its just dlt pipelines perfoming ingestion based on inputs defined in asset bundle when ingesting. On the data factory side our whole extraction design is dependent on a metadata table in a SQL Server database. This is where i feel like this is a bad design concept to totally depend on a unsecured non version controlled table in a sql server database. That table get deleted or anyone with access doing anything malicious with that table we can't extract data from our sources. Is this a industry standard way of extracting data from sources? This feels very outdated and non scalable to me to have your entire data factory extraction design based on a sql table. We only have 240 tables currently but we are about to scale in December to 2000 and im not confident in that scaling at all. My concerns fall on deaf ears due to my co workers having 15+ years in data but primary using Talend not Data Factory and not using Databricks at all. Can someone please give me some insights on modern techniques if my suspicions are correct?",

Dept growth may be stagnant since the it’s not a tech company.I have an offer from a non-FAANG, but top company in their industry for a team lead position. TC is ~50% more. Growth is more defined and I think could have a much higher comp ceiling.I’ve been running the small company route for a while and have never done DE at scale for a company with the resources/need to use the big tech.

        "author": "valko2",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "So we're going to have a baby in a few weeks, and I was thinking obviously how can I use my data skills for my baby. I vaguely remembered I saw a video or read an article where someone, somewhere said that they were able to predict their wife's delivery time (with few minutes accuracy) based on accurately measuring contraction start and end times, as contraction lengths tend to be longer and longer as the delivery time approaches. After a quick Google search, I found the video! It was made by [Steve Mould](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7q0Y2W0Rn4) 7 years ago, but somehow I remembered it. If you look at the [chart](https://youtu.be/k7q0Y2W0Rn4?si=vz_S1LCIsLeYs10v&t=275) in the video, the graph and trend lines feel a bit \"exaggerated\", but let's assume it's true.So I found a bunch of apps for timing contractions but nothing that provides predictions of the estimated delivery time. I found a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lbrp5f/oc_attempt_to_duplicate_steve_moulds_graph_for/) created 5 years ago, but the blog post describing the calculations is not available anymore. Anyway, I tried to reproduce a similar logic & graph in Python as a Streamlit app, [available in GitHub](https://github.com/vmatt/predict-my-baby). With my synthetic dataset it looks good, but I'd like to get some real data, so I can adjust the regression fitting on proper data. My ask would be for the community: 1. if you know any datasets that are publicly available, could you share with me? I found an [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201517), but I'm not sure how [can this](https://www.physionet.org/lightwave/) be translated into contraction start and end times. 2. Or if you already have kid, and you logged contraction lengths (start time/end time) with an app from which you can export into CSV/JSON/whatever format, please share that with me! Also sharing the actual delivery time would be needed so I can actually test it. (and any other data that you are willing to share - age, weight, any treatments during the pregnancy)I plan to reimplement the final version with html/js, so we can use it offline.Note: I'm not a data scientist by the way. Just someone who works with data and enjoys these kinds of projects. So I'm sure there are better approaches than simple regression (maybe XGBoost or other ML techniques?), but I'm starting simple. I also know that each pregnancy is unique, contraction lengths and delivery times can vary heavily based on hormones, physique, contractions can stall, speed up randomly, so I have no expectations. But I'd be happy to give it a try, if this can achieve 20-60 minutes of accuracy, I'll be happy.Update: I want to add, that my wife approves this",

        "content": "I realised that using Airflow on GCP Composer for loading json files from Google Cloud Storage to BigQuery and then move these files elsewhere every hour was too expensive.I, then, tried just using BigQuery external tables with dbt for version control over parquet files (with Hive style partitioning in a bucket in GCS), for that I started extracting data and loading it into GCS as parquet files using PyArrow.The problem is that these parquet files are way too small (from \\~25 kb to \\~175 kb each) but at the same time, and for now, it seems to be super convenient, but I will soon be facing performance problems.The solution I thought was launching a DAG that could merge these files into 1 every day at the end of the day (the resulting file would be around 100 MB which I think is almost ideal) , although I was trying to get away from composer as much as possible, but I guess I could also do a Cloud Function for this.Have you ever faced a problem like this? I think Databricks Delta Lake can compress parquet files like this automatically, does something like this exist for GCP? Is my solution a good practice? Could something better be done?",

        "content": "Hey guys, looking for feedback on a potential setup. For context, we are a medium sized company and our data department consists of me, my boss and one other analyst. I'm the most technical one, the other two can connect to a database in Tableau and that's about it. I'm fairly comfortable writing Python scripts and SQL queries, but I am not a software engineer.We currently have MS SQL Server on prem that was set up a decade ago and is reaching its end of life in terms of support. For ETL, we've been using Alteryx for about as long as that, and for reporting we have Tableau Server. We don't have that much data (550GB total), and we ingest about 50k rows an hour in batched CSV files that our vendors send us. This data is a little messy and needs to be cleaned up before a database can ingest it.With the SQL Server getting old and our renewal conversations with Alteryx going extremely poorly, my boss has directed me to research options for replacing both, or scaling Alteryx down to just the last mile for Tableau Server. Our main purposes are 1) upgrade our data warehouse to something with as little maintenance as possible and 2) continue to serve our Tableau dashboards 3) make ad-hoc analysis in Tableau possible for my boss and the other analyst. Ideally, we'd keep our costs to under 70k a year.So far I've played around with Databricks, Clickhouse, Prefect, Dagster, and have started doing the dbt fundementals courses to get a better idea of it. While I liked Databricks's unity catalog and time travel capabilities of delta tables, the price and computing power of spark seems like overkill for our purposes/size. It felt like I was spending a lot of time spinning up clusters and frivolously spending cash working out the syntax.Clickhouse caught my eye since it promises fast query times, it is easy enough to set up and put together a sample pipeline together, and the cloud database offering seems cheaper than DBX. It's nice that dbt-core can be used with it as well, because just writing queries and views inside the cloud console there seems like it can get hairy and confusing really fast.So far, I'm thinking that we can run local Python scripts for ingesting data into Clickhouse staging tables, then write views on top of those for the cleaner silver + gold tables and let Alteryx/analysts connect to those. The tricky part with CH is how it manages upserts/deletions behind the scenes, but I think with ReplacingMergeTrees and solid queries, we could get around those limitations. It's also less forgiving with schema drift and inferring data types.So my questions are as follows:* Does my approach make sense? * Are there other products worth looking into for my use case?* How do you guys evaluate the feasibility of a setup when the tools are new to you?* Is Clickhouse in your experience a solid product that will be around for the next 5-10 years?Thank you for your time.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi!Assume I got a huge dataset of crawled internet webpages, and I'd like to transform them page by page doing some kind of filtration, pre-processing, tokenization etc. Let's say that original dataset is stored along some metainformation in form of parquet files in S3.Coming from enterprises, I have some background in Apache ecosystem as well as some older Big Tech MapReduce-kinda data warehouses, so my first idea was to use Spark to define those transformations using some scala/python code and just deal with it in batch processing manner. But before doing it \"classic ETL-style\" way, I decided to check some more modern (trending?) data stacks that are out there.I learned about Modal. They seem to be claiming about revolutionizing data processing, but I am not sure how exactly the practical usecases of data processing are expressed in them. Therefore, a bunch of questions to the community:1. They don't provide a notion of \"dataframes\", nor know anything about my input datasets, thus I must be responsible for somehow partitioning of the input into chunks, right? Like, reading slices of parquet file if needed, or coalescing groups of parquet files together before running an actual distributed computation?2. What about fault-tolerance? Spark has implemented protocols for atomic output commit, how do you expose result of a distributed data processing atomically without producing garbage from restarted jobs when using Modal? Do I, again, implement this manually?3. Is there any kind of long-running data processing operation state snapshotting? (not saying about individual executors, but rather the application master) If I have a CPU intensive computation running for 24 hours and I close my laptop lid, or the initiator host dies some other way, am I automatically screwed?4. Are there tweaks like speculative execution, or at least a way how to control/abort individual function executions? It is always a pity to see how 99% of a job finished with high concurrency and last couple of tasks ended up on some faulty host and take eternity to finish. 5. Since they are a cloud service - do you know about their actual scalability limits? I have a computation CPU cluster of \\~25k CPU cores in my company, do they have some comparable fleet? It would be quite stupid to hit into some limitation like \"no more than 1000 cpu cores per user unless you are an enterprise folk paying $20k/month just for a license\"... 6. Also, them being non-opensource also makes it harder to understand what exactly happens under the hood, are there any open-source competitors to them? Or at least a way how to bring them on-premise to my company's fleet?And a more generic question – has any of you folks ever tried actually processing some huge datasets with them? Right now it looks more like a tool for smaller developer experiments, or for time-slicing GPUs for seconds, but not something that I would use to build a reliable data pipeline over. But maybe I am missing something. PS I was told Ray also became popular recently, and they seem to be open-source as well, so will check them later as well.",

But in a way such a way that, if you or someone edits the text down the road, it won't mess up the annotations and stuff like that?I don't know much about linguistic annotation software (saw [this brief overview of some options](https://www.labellerr.com/blog/text-annotation-labeling-tools/#1-labellerr)), but what I've looked at so far are basically these:- [Perseus Greek Texts](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0227) (click on individual words to lookup)- [Prodigy demo](https://demo.prodi.gy/?=null&view_id=pos_manual) (on of the text annotation tools I could quickly try in basic mode for free)- [Logeion](https://logeion.uchicago.edu/articulus) (double click to visit terms anywhere in the text)But the general problem I'm getting stuck on in my head is what I was saying, here is a brief example to clarify:- Say we are working with the Bible text (bunch of books, divided into chapters, divided into verses)- The data model I'm considering at this point is a tree of JSON basically, `text_section` can be arbitrarily nested (bible -> book -> chapter), and then at the end are `text_span` in the children (verses here).- Say the Bible unicode text is super messy, random artifacts here and there, extra whitespace and punctuation in various spots, overall the text is 90% good quality but could use months or years of fine-tuned polish to clean it up and make it perfect. (Sefaria texts, open-source Hebrew texts, are super-super messy, tons of textual artifacts that could use some love to clean up and stuff eventually over time... for example.).- But say you can also annotate the text at any point, creating probably \"selection_ranges\" of text within or across verses, etc.. Then you can label or do whatever to add metadata to those ranges.Problem is:- Text is being cleaned up over say a couple years, a few minor tweaks every day.- Annotations are being added every day too.Edge-case is basically this:- Annotation is added on some selected text- Text gets edited (maybe user is not even aware of or focused on the annotation UI at this point, but under the hood the metadata is still there).- Editor removes some extra whitespace, and adds a missing word (as they found say by looking at a real manuscript scan).- Say the editor added `Newton` to `Isaac`, so whereas before it said `foo bar Isaac ... baz`, now it says `foo bar Isaac Newton baz`.- Now the annotation sort of changes meaning, and needs to be redone (this is a terrible example, I tried thinking of what my mind's stumbling on, but can't quite pin it down totally yet).- Should say `foo bar Isaac Newton baz` let's say (but the editor never sees anything annotation-wise...)Basically, trying to show that, the annotations can get messed up, and I don't see a systematic way to handle or resolve that if editing the text is also allowed.You can imagine other cases where some annotation marks like a phrase or idiom, but then the editor comes and changes the idiom to be something totally different, or just partially different, whatever. Or splits the annotation somehow, etc..Basically, have apps or anyone figured out generally how to handle this general problem? How to not make it so when you edit, you have to just delete the annotations, but it somehow smart merges, or flags it for double-checking, etc.. Basically there is a lot to think through functionality-wise, and I'm not sure if it's already been done before. It's both a data-modeling problem, and a UI/UX problem. But mainly concerned about the technical data-modeling problem here.",

The issue I am facing is since the query result is large, I am running out of memory. I tried using `--quick` command with `mysql` client to get the data row wise, instead of all at once, but I did not notice any improvement. On average, 1 Million rows seem to be taking 1GB in this case.My idea is to stream the query result data from the Mysql DB Server to my Script and then once it hits some number of rows, I gzip and send the data to S3. I do this multiple times until I am through my complete result. I am looking to avoid the limit/offset query route since the dataset is fairly large and limit/offset will just move the issue to DB Server memory.Is there any way to do this in bash itself or it would be better to move to Python/R or some other language? I am open to any kind of tools, since I want to revamp this, so that this can handle atleast 50-100 million scale.Thanks in advance",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I’ve been working at a WITCH company for about a year now, as a Data Engineer. I’ve been in the same project throughout, where I mainly handle support tasks— documentation, debugging, adding columns, updating views, ensuring data flow, and just ensuring everything runs smoothly. Essentially, I’m not involved in any real development work like building pipelines or writing scripts.I’ve seen a lot of posts about people in similar situations, like the one here [Need career advice – Am I a Data Engineer?](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineersindia/comments/1nf3h0u/need_career_advice_am_i_a_data_engineer_how_do_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) , and it feels like I’m in the same boat. The problem is, I’ve been stuck in this role for a year, and I honestly feel like if I stay for another year or two, I won’t learn anything new. I’ve been trying to switch jobs and have been applying for the last 3-4 months, but most of the time, I don’t even make it past the shortlisting stage. I don’t blame the companies, to be honest—I just don’t have anything unique to show in my experience section. I’ve worked on some personal projects, but that’s about it.Another challenge is the 90-day notice period. It’s hard to move quickly when companies need immediate joiners, so I feel stuck in that regard too.I see two possible options right now:Ask to be released from my current project: But this is tricky. I’m not sure if they’ll even let me go (seniors have told that release is not provided easily), and if I do get released, I’m worried the next project might be even worse. Plus, I don’t know how long I’d be able to stay on the bench, and that’s also not ideal.Resign and serve the notice period quietly: This comes with its own set of risks, mainly the uncertainty of not having a job while I keep applying. The idea of not having a stable income while job hunting scares me.So, I guess I’m at a crossroads. Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you navigate it? Any advice on how I should proceed from here? I don't want to be stuck here in this swamp in the early stages of my career as it will also affect my future career path. I have been making few more personal projects to add but I still don't think that will be enough.Appreciate any insights or suggestions!TL/DR : I’ve been working as a Data Engineer in a WITCH company for a year, mostly handling support tasks with no real development experience. I’ve been trying to switch jobs for 3-4 months but keep getting rejected. I’m stuck with a 90-day notice period and feel like I’m not learning anything new. Should I ask to be released from my project (with no guarantee of better work) or resign and serve the notice period while job hunting (despite the risk of unemployment)?",

I explored plausibly fast-to-decode compression schemes and found a couple BSP-based approaches which can half Roaring's size. The decode complexity is quite high so these will probably match (rather than beat) Roaring throughput on bitwise ops once tuned, but their might be some value for memory-constrained and disk/network-bound contexts. With an alternative simpler compression scheme I was able to reduce size by 23%, and expect the throughput will beat Roaring once the implementation is further along.",

        "content": "Hey folks, I need to pick your brains to brainstorm a potential solution to my problem.Current stack: SparkSQL (Databricks SQL), storage in Delta, modeling in dbt.I have a pipeline that generally works like this: WITH a AS (SELECT * FROM table) SELECT a.*, 'one' AS type FROM a UNION ALL SELECT a.*, 'two' AS type FROM a UNION ALL SELECT a.*, 'three' AS type FROM aThe source table is partitioned on a column, let's say column \\`date\\`, and the output is stored also with partition column \\`date\\` (both with Delta). The transformation in the pipeline is just as simple as select one huge table, do broadcast joins with a couple small tables (I have made sure all joins are done as \\`BroadcastHashJoin\\`), and then project the DataFrame into multiple output legs.I had a few assumptions that turns out to be plain wrong, and this mistake really f\\*\\*ks up the performance.**Assumption 1:** I thought Spark will scan the table once, and just read it from cache for each of the projections. Turns out, Spark compiles the CTE into inline query and read the table thrice.**Assumption 2**: Because Spark read the table three times, and because Delta doesn't support bucketization, Spark distributes the partition for each projection leg without guarantee that rows that share the same \\`date\\` will end up in the same worker. The consequence of this is a massive shuffling at the end before writing the output to Delta, and this shuffle really kills the performance.I have been thinking about alternative solutions that involve switching stack/tools, e.g. use pySpark for a fine-grained control, or switch to vanilla Parquet to leverage the bucketization feature, but those options are not practical. Do you guys have any idea to satisfy the above two requirements: (a) scan table once, and (b) ensure partitions are distributed consistently to avoid any shuffling.",

For a long time we have had the BI tool decoupled from the ETL/Warehouse and we are used to be able to refresh models and re-run ETL/Pipelines or scripts in the DB in parallel, the DW300c size warehouse is independent from the \"current\" Power BI capacity. we have a large number of users, and I'm really skeptical that a P1 (F64) capacity will suffice for all our data related activities.What has been your experience so far? To me migrating the models/dashboards sounds straightforward but sticking everything in Fabric (all-in-one platform) sounds scary to me, I have not had the chance to POC it myself to discard the \"resource contention\" problem. We can scale up/down in Synapse without worrying if it's going to break any Power BI related activities.I decided to post it here because looking up online is just a bunch of consulting firms trying to sell the \"product\".

        "content": "Hello,I'm seeking help with a bad situation I have with Synapse + Azure storage (ADLS2).The situation: I'm forced to use Synapse notebooks for certain data processing jobs; a couple of weeks ago I was asked to create a pipeline to download some financial data from a public repository and output it to Azure storage.Said data is very small, a few Megabytes at most. So I first developed the script locally, used Polars for dataframe interface and once I verified everything worked, I put it online.# EditApparently I failed to explain myself since nearly everyone who answered, implicitly thinks I'm an idiot, so while I'm not ruling that option out I'll just simplify:* I have some code that reads data from an online API and writes it somewhere.* The data is a few MBs.* I'm using Polars, not Pyspark* Locally it runs in one minute.* On Synapse it runs in 7 minutes.* Yes, I did account for pool spin up time, it takes 7 minutes after the pool is ready.* Synapse and storage account are in the same region.* I am FORCED to use Synapse notebooks by the organization I'm working for.* I don't have details about networking at the moment as I wasn't involved in the setup, I'd have to collect them.Now I understand that data transfer goes over the network, so it's gotta be slower than writing to disk, but what the fuck? 5 to 10 times slower is insane, for such a small amount of data.This also makes me think that the Spark jobs that run in the same environment would be MUCH faster in a different setup.So this said, the question is, is there anything I can do to speed up this shit?# Edit 2Under suggestion of some of you I then profiled every component of the pipeline, which eventually confirmed the suspicion that the bottleneck is in the I/O part.Here's the relevant profiling results if anyone is interested:### local```_write_parquet: Calls: 1713 Total: 52.5928s Avg: 0.0307s Min: 0.0003s Max: 1.0037s_read_parquet (this is an extra step used for data quality check): Calls: 1672 Total: 11.3558s Avg: 0.0068s Min: 0.0004s Max: 0.1180sdownload_zip_data: Calls: 22 Total: 44.7885s Avg: 2.0358s Min: 1.6840s Max: 2.2794sunzip_data: Calls: 22 Total: 1.7265s Avg: 0.0785s Min: 0.0577s Max: 0.1197sread_csv: Calls: 2074 Total: 17.9278s Avg: 0.0086s Min: 0.0004s Max: 0.0410stransform (includes read_csv time): Calls: 846 Total: 20.2491s Avg: 0.0239s Min: 0.0012s Max: 0.2056s```### synapse```_write_parquet: Calls: 1713 Total: 848.2049s Avg: 0.4952s Min: 0.0428s Max: 15.0655s_read_parquet: Calls: 1672 Total: 346.1599s Avg: 0.2070s Min: 0.0649s Max: 10.2942sdownload_zip_data: Calls: 22 Total: 14.9234s Avg: 0.6783s Min: 0.6343s Max: 0.7172sunzip_data: Calls: 22 Total: 5.8338s Avg: 0.2652s Min: 0.2044s Max: 0.3539sread_csv: Calls: 2074 Total: 70.8785s Avg: 0.0342s Min: 0.0012s Max: 0.2519stransform (includes read_csv time): Calls: 846 Total: 82.3287s Avg: 0.0973s Min: 0.0037s Max: 1.0253s```### context:`_write_parquet`: writes to local storage or adls.`_read_parquet`: reads from local storage or adls.`download_zip_data`: downloads the data from the public source to a local `/tmp/data` directory.

        "author": "ApacheDoris",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "In large-scale data analytics, balancing speed, flexibility, and accuracy is always a challenge. Apache Flink and Apache Doris together provide a strong foundation for real-time analytics pipelines. Flink offers powerful stream processing capabilities, while Doris provides low-latency analytics over large datasets.This post outlines the main integration patterns between the two systems, focusing on the **Flink Doris Connector** and **Flink CDC** for end-to-end real-time ETL.# 1. Overview: Flink + Doris in Real-time Analytics**Apache Flink** is a distributed stream processing engine widely adopted for ingesting and processing data from various sources such as databases, message queues, and event streams.**Apache Doris** is an MPP-based real-time analytical database that supports fast, high-concurrency queries. Its architecture includes:* **FE (Frontend):** request routing, query parsing, metadata, scheduling* **BE (Backend):** query execution and data storageTogether, Flink and Doris form a complete path: **Data Collection → Stream Processing → Real-time Storage → Analytics and Query**https://preview.redd.it/g5xktumi95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=58bff724160508aa3b65d27668013b2451af496c# 2. Flink Doris Connector: Scan, Lookup Join, and Real-time WriteThe **Flink Doris Connector** provides three major functions for building data pipelines.# (1) Scan (Reading from Doris)Instead of using a traditional JDBC connector (which can hit throughput limits), the Doris Source in Flink distributes read requests across Doris backend nodes.* The Flink JobManager requests a query plan from Doris FE.* The plan is distributed to TaskManagers, each reading data directly from assigned Tablets in parallel.This distributed approach significantly increases data read throughput during synchronization or batch analysis.https://preview.redd.it/nm11w5nm95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=7de75abee5e481cc1816edb4f5a794450eaf78e1# (2) Lookup Join (Real-time Stream + Dimension Table Join)Flink supports joining streaming data with dimension tables in Doris.* **Traditional JDBC Lookup** performs synchronous single-record queries, which can easily become a bottleneck under heavy load.* **Flink Doris Connector** introduces **asynchronous batch lookups**: * Incoming events are queued and processed in batches. * Each batch is sent as a single `UNION ALL` query to Doris.This design improves join throughput and reduces latency in stream–dimension table lookups.https://preview.redd.it/g3xrn78p95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a9b83137da211f91dde0ad32c19c003b8acbe03(3) Real-time Write (Sink)For real-time ingestion, the Connector uses Doris’s **Stream Load** mechanism.**Process summary:*** Sink initiates a long-lived Stream Load request.* Data is continuously sent in chunks during Flink checkpoints.* After a checkpoint is completed, the transaction is committed and becomes visible in Doris.https://preview.redd.it/w5d7rmut95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c4c308903f6902c398ebd4b0f152fbcb4aac98aTo ensure **exactly-once semantics**, the connector uses a **two-phase commit**:1. Pre-commit data during checkpoint (not yet visible)2.

The Connector adds a **batch caching mechanism**, temporarily buffering records in memory before committing, which improves throughput while maintaining correctness (idempotent writes under Doris primary key model).https://preview.redd.it/lattav7x95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=26943c7358c98e9dc2dcd0076861d23f80083524# 3. Flink CDC: Full and Incremental Synchronization**Flink CDC (Change Data Capture)** supports both initial full synchronization and continuous incremental updates from databases such as MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.# (1) Common challenges in full sync:* Detecting and syncing new tables automatically* Handling metadata and type mapping* Supporting DDL propagation (schema changes)* Low-code setup with minimal configuration# (2) Flink CDC capabilities:* **Incremental snapshot reading** with parallelism and lock-free scanning* **Restartable sync** — if interrupted, the task continues from the last offset* **Broad source support** (MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.)https://preview.redd.it/6564nl0z95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=93dbfd850c5765db605dd97613c1dc9a3f42e64a# (3) One-click integration with DorisWhen combined with the Flink Doris Connector, the system can automatically:* Create downstream Doris tables if they don’t exist* Route multiple tables to different sinks* Manage schema mapping transparentlyThis reduces configuration complexity and speeds up deployment for large-scale data migration and sync jobs.# 4. Schema Evolution with Light Schema ChangeDoris recently added a **Light Schema Change** mechanism that enables millisecond-level schema updates (add/drop columns) without interrupting ingestion or queries.When integrated with Flink CDC:1. The Source captures upstream DDL operations.2. The Doris Sink parses and applies them via Light Schema Change.Compared to traditional methods, schema change latency dropped from over 1 second to a few milliseconds, allowing continuous sync even during frequent schema evolution.# 5. Example: Full MySQL Database SynchronizationA full sync job can be submitted via the Flink client, defining:* Flink configurations (parallelism, checkpoint interval)* Table filtering via regex* Source/Sink connector parametersThis setup allows syncing entire databases to Doris with minimal configuration effort.https://preview.redd.it/8o0fii32a5vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=0960520b54b0432925a13584963929566966db2b# 6. Summary**Key takeaways:*** **Flink Doris Connector** supports parallel reading, async lookup joins, and exactly-once real-time writing.* **Flink CDC** provides lock-free incremental sync, automatic table creation, and DDL propagation.* **Light Schema Change** in Doris enables near-instant schema updates with no downtime.The combination of Flink and Doris offers a practical, open-source approach to real-time data integration and analytics at scale.",

I’m pointing out my coding/programming background to show I barely have any knowledge, when I was learning those languages I barely had any projects except when I was learning html and css in which I posted very beginner like web pages, task bars etc. I really don’t want to get dependent on AI due to the fact on different subreddits I see people say they hire swe’s or software developers and they aren’t able to code at all, I don’t want that to be me, even though AI has been around for a while now I want to act like it’s still 2010s-2020 when people were learning how to code without the use of tools like that, another reason is that my degree is more tailored to practical and applied programming than it is to theory and mathematics, towards my second semester of first year and second year I’ll be doing less of mathematics & computer science theory and more of Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Architecture, Object Oriented programming, Databases. I don’t want to GPT my way through this degree, I want to know why and how things work, I want to be able to actually critically think and problem solve, I’m not saying people who use AI cannot do this, I’ve heard several senior developers implement these tools in their day to day activities, but I’m saying as a beginner with a foundation which is not so sturdy, if I do rely on AI as a tool or teacher, I might get too dependent on it maybe that’s just a skill issue on my end :grinning_face_with_sweat:. I noticed C is a bit different from these languages cause C is more backend language and is used for compiling, I wouldn’t say it’s a hard language to learn but it’s definitely tricky for me, I don’t really want to use AI to learn it, apart from W3Schools and Youtube videos which other resources like books, blogs, websites can I use to learn this language?",

        "content": "It's actually very good. I really enjoy how they make programming and computer science seem fun and simple, the professor is very good at explaining concepts no matter how difficult or unfamiliar they are. Things like memory management in C or data structures and algorithms were very easily explained, David Malan (the professor) is a very energetic and enthusiastic teacher but he explains his thoughts very clearly, he does a very good job at explaining these concepts visually and conceptually. Things that I was scared of getting stuck on became very simple once they were explained, David Malan is a very good teacher.I also really enjoyed the problem sets. They were very well made and thought out, they're not too easy like some of the other coding courses that say things like \"print hello world\", \"create a variable and print it\", no with CS50 every problem set is a mini-project(s). It's not too hand-holding like other courses where it feels like you're following instructions instead of building, no you get an explanation, you get a demo of how the final product should look, sometimes you get a short walkthrough or some hints, but at the end of the day it's all about you seeking the answer yourself and working through the problem. Some problem sets are unique and fun like I really enjoyed Fiftyville and Readability.Expanding on the last point, I really like how they focus on the problem solving aspect of programming. As a developer you don't get paid to code but to solve problems. I really enjoyed how they didn't encourage AI to write code or to be the main source of learning, no they really want you to read documentation, research and do rubber duck debugging, they encourage figuring things out yourself and that is such an important skill to learn.Another thing I enjoyed was how easy their tools were to use. Just make a Github account and connect it to the CS50 codespace. They document and explain their tools like submit50 and check50 very well. I think that if tomorrow you start CS50 and it's your first day programming, it would be very straightforward to get started with the CS50 tools.Now, the course isn't particularly easy, simple and easy aren't the same thing. If you have no experience with computer science then CS50 could be a bit difficult at first since they get you up and running QUICK, I mean they start talking about algorithms and memory management by around week 3 and 4 and so yeah this is definitely not a course that I would say is \"easy\", but the professor is very good at explaining concepts and if you just stay consistent and you keep going it'll be worth it. It actually gets easier from week 6 and onwards, in my opinion.Overall, it's a great course. Heck, I wouldn't even be mad if this course costed money. If you're thinking of taking an easy to follow, free, fun course full of learning opportunities then I think CS50 is great, there is not really much of anything that I disliked, everything was super straight forward and simple.",

I've been reading through lots of conversations and the general consensus is sort of mixed, but still slightly leaning towards JS fundamentals. I do understand that the official docs also send you off to learn JS, just unsure in what capacity.Any JS resource I've looked at is largely comprehensive and not something I want to commit to. I've of course done a lot of prior research over the past week and have decided on tools that are TS-first, like Vue or Solid and potentially Astro eliminating the need for Nuxt, where I think Fastify for the backend would be a nice tool to learn, or just go for Nuxt over Fastify if learning something more performant like Go Standard Library in the future.As for TS resources, there's a couple that are thrown around, one of which is the official doc/handbook and the second is the Total TypeScript course, money isn't a concern in the slightest if the learning's worth it and I can come out of it being able to hold my own.I have a bit of C knowledge, nothing of exceptional note though. Would be nice to start learning something that's favored and will be favored in the future and is simply the better of the two rather than what's phasing out, at least in terms of writing code, although I do acknoledge that JS is still the underlying engine and holy grail.",

I think it has a lot more to do with the economy and business side of things than it does with \"capabilities\".Getting a job has never been about \"yo, i can build advanced and cool software!!\" and yet people put too much emphasis on technologies and what can now be done almost as if the entire tech industry is one giant competition about who can do what the best.So is AI really to blame here? Just seeking clarification. And if my take on the subject does matter, I would say it is important to be more business-oriented so you can understand the value you bring to companies because at the end of the day that is why we get hired. Nobody hires someone so they can have a salary. You just gotta prove to them that you are worth the investment.These are just my thoughts but if I am wrong please do correct me :)",

        "content": "My son (10 years old now) started his coding adventure with the typical things that kids use - block based tools like scratch.When he outgrew those, he moved on to learn open web technologies. His first two games were built using just HTML, CSS, JS using divs, images and sound apis. Huge learning curve, and still limited in what you can do. It didn't stop him though. More importantly, it taught him the fundamentals (arrays, variables, file management, functions, etc), and there's a lot of value in that.He wanted to do more advanced stuff, and started learning how to use canvas with requestAnimationFrame. He even started thinking about what a collision detection algorithm would look like (with the help of AI). He never passed the experimentation phase here so a game wasn't released. But he learned a lot more about the fundamentals. In all the above, he did have support & guidance from parents. So I think having the right mentorship in place is key.Along the way, he discovered a game engine (Microsoft Makecode Arcade) which, while limited, gave him so much to build on - tilemaps, input management, animations, integrated sound/image editor, gravity, etc. Suddenly, his games could become more complex. Levels, hidden sections and boss battles were all easily approachable.From my observation, picking up the game engine was easy. He already loosely knew what needed to happen, it was just a matter of figuring out how to do it in the engine.What I'm trying to say: when you want to learn to code, using a game engine on day one will speed you up, but it may also mean you're skipping some valuable fundamentals. Perhaps, instead, start smaller and explore. Learn the fundamentals and build on it until you naturally are hitting the limits and need something more powerful.My son also did a writeup on his experience using a game engine - [https://www.armaansahni.com/how-i-built-my-first-game-using-a-game-engine/](https://www.armaansahni.com/how-i-built-my-first-game-using-a-game-engine/)(Disclosure -  Parents provided multiple rounds of feedback to ensure clarity and coherence of his writeup)",

How does it compare to learning through video tutorials?And more broadly, how do you reach the point where you can create something from scratch when you don’t even know where to start?",

MAIN QUESTION:How does the programming was learnt back in 1990's , what were the resources used by them maybe manuals or documentations and how would you have learnt programming in 1990's?MORE CONTEXT: To be honest I just want to learn like in self taught way .

My professor teaches by using Microsoft Copilot to write all of the code, and then explains to the class what Copilot generated. I've been completing all my assignments using Copilot as well, since that's what the professor expects.However, one day we had a substitute professor who didn't use Copilot. He broke down each function and explained what everything did, and that was the first time I actually understood what was going on.Lately, I've been seriously considering whether this major is the right fit for me. If this is what the rest of the program is like, i'm not sure I'll enjoy or even fully understand what I'm supposed to be learning. I don't want to switch majors just because of one bad experience, but it's starting to make me question if this field is really what I want to pursue longterm.So now I'm wondering is this kind of Al heavy teaching normal for coding classes in 2025, and I'm just behind?

Each project is deployed on its own subdomain.That setup has worked quite well overall, but it has its pros and cons:* PRs don’t interfere with each other, so I can push some changes to production without affecting other projects.* The shared library isn’t a problem since it doesn’t get updated often.* There’s some repetitive code like interfaces, hooks, and constants.* When the shared library does change, I have to manually bump and update the version in every repo (`event`, `auth`, etc.) to avoid version mismatches — a bit annoying.* Each repo has its own CI/CD pipeline; it’s repetitive but helps ensure that if one build fails, the others still deploy fine.# For this new project, I’m considering a monorepo: apps/ base/ community/ registration/ store/ packages/ ui/ hooks/ interfaces/ utils/Everything in one workspace (using Bun/Turborepo)**My main doubts are:*** My intention is to use a monorepo, but my main questions are:* If only one app or a single change is ready for production, how is that usually managed in a shared repository?* How do you handle CI/CD for multiple apps and the shared core (packages like hooks, ui, etc.)?* Would you recommend a monorepo or a multi-repo setup with a shared npm package?# Stack* Next.js 15 (app router)* TypeScript* React Query / GraphQL / API Rest* Bun / Turborepo* CI/CD with Azure Pipelines",

But even after practicing functions on there I still couldn't grasp how to do our task.I'm doing this course to change careers, I don't have a computing or maths background. I'm hoping I can get past things like this but I got so scared that I'm just not smart enough for this.Any advice? **EDIT**This masters course is aimed at people without computer science backgrounds. I've not snuck my way in to a masters I'm not qualified for :face_with_tears_of_joy:",

        "content": "I am trying to make a function that assigns note names to musical scales which are represented by binary numbers. For example, the expected output for a scale 1001011100101 with a root of F would be F Ab Bb B C Eb F (for musical theory reasons).To do this I wrote a recursive function that attempts different scale spellings and returns the one with the lowest cost (e.g. F G# G## Bb Cb C C### F should have a higher cost). However I'm struggling with the recursion as its assigning unexpected costs to certain notes.Specifically at the calculate cost section (line 41). The function returns \\[('F', 0), ('Ab', 0), ('Bb', 0), ('Cb', 0), ('Dbb', 3), ('Eb', 0), ('F', 0)\\]). However I'm not sure why Cb has a cost of 0 and Dbb has a cost of 3. I would like them to be B and C which should have lower costs than Cb and Dbb.The idea behind the helper functions NameScalesEnharmonicRoots and NameScalesKeySignatures are to try different enharmonic roots (e.g. F# and Gb) for a scale and return the one with the lowest cost and to try to fit scales to key signatures to try to be accurate with music theory.Are there any recursion gurus who can help me out?Here is my code: def NameScales(tonic,binary,majorMode): keys = ['C','C#','Db','D','D#','Eb','E','F','F#','Gb','G','G#','Ab','A','A#','Bb','B'] # get the pitches of the scale pitches = [] for i in range(len(binary)): if binary[i]=='1': pitches.append(i) # get the pitches of the major scale if 'b' in tonic: diatonic = [1] elif '#' in tonic: diatonic = [-1] else: diatonic = [0] for i in range(7): if (ord(tonic[0])+i-65)%7+65 == ord('E') or (ord(tonic[0])+i-65)%7+65 == ord('B'): diatonic.append(diatonic[i]+1) else: diatonic.append(diatonic[i]+2) def AssignNotes(pitch, letter, lastNote=''): # base case if pitch == len(pitches): if lastNote and lastNote in keys: return (0,'', []) return (float('inf'), '', []) if (letter > 7): return (float('inf'), '', []) # get the note currentLetterNum = (ord(tonic[0])+letter-65)%7+65 accidentals = pitches[pitch]-diatonic[letter] if accidentals == 0: note = chr(currentLetterNum) elif accidentals < 0: note = chr(currentLetterNum) + 'b'*(-accidentals) elif accidentals > 0: note = chr(currentLetterNum) + '#'*accidentals # calculate cost if note in majorMode: totalCost = 0 else: totalCost = abs(accidentals)+1 totalStr = note totalList = [(note,totalCost)] if pitch == len(pitches)-1: currentLastNote = note else: currentLastNote = lastNote # recursive calls nextCost, nextStr, nextList = AssignNotes(pitch+1,letter+1,currentLastNote) totalCost += nextCost if nextStr != '': totalStr = note + '&ensp;' + nextStr totalList += nextList skipCost, skipStr, skipList = AssignNotes(pitch,letter+1,lastNote) doubleUpCost, doubleUpStr, doubleUpList = AssignNotes(pitch+1,letter,currentLastNote) if doubleUpCost != float('inf'): doubleUpCost += totalCost + abs(accidentals) + 1 if doubleUpStr != '': doubleUpStr = note + '&ensp;' +doubleUpStr doubleUpList = [(note,totalCost)]+doubleUpList # choose the path with the minimum cost minCost = min(totalCost,skipCost,doubleUpCost) if minCost == totalCost: return (totalCost, totalStr,totalList) elif minCost == skipCost: return (skipCost,skipStr,skipList) elif minCost == doubleUpCost: return (doubleUpCost,doubleUpStr,doubleUpList) return AssignNotes(0,0,'') # get the parent mode def NameScalesKeySignatures(tonic,binary): orderOfSharps = ['F#','C#','G#','D#','A#','E#'] orderOfFlats = ['Bb','Eb','Ab','Db','Gb','Cb'] flatKeys = ['C','F','Bb','Eb','Ab','Db','Gb'] sharpKeys = ['C','G','D','A','E','B','F#','C#','G#','D#','A#'] lowestScale = None lowestCost = 9999999999999 for i in range(-5,2): if tonic in sharpKeys: accidentals = sharpKeys.index(tonic)+i elif tonic in flatKeys: accidentals = -flatKeys.index(tonic)+i if accidentals > 0: keySignature = orderOfSharps[:accidentals] elif accidentals < 0: keySignature = orderOfFlats[:abs(accidentals)] else: keySignature = [] # build the notes of the scale by character number and then add sharps and flats to them as they appear in the key signature majorMode = [] for j in range(7): letter = chr((ord(tonic[0])+j-65)%7+65) for k in keySignature: if letter in k: letter = k majorMode.append(letter) currentScale = NameScales(tonic,binary,majorMode) if currentScale[0] < lowestCost: lowestCost = currentScale[0] lowestScale = currentScale print(majorMode) print(lowestScale) return lowestScale # get the tonic def NameScalesEnharmonicRoots(tonic,binary): enharmonics = [['C',''], ['F',''], ['Bb','A#'], ['Eb','D#'], ['Ab','G#'], ['Db','C#'], ['Gb','F#'], ['B',''], ['E',''], ['A',''], ['D',''], ['G','']] print(tonic,binary) scale = NameScalesKeySignatures(tonic,binary) scaleNotes = scale[1] scaleKey = tonic for keys in enharmonics: if tonic in keys: enharmonic = keys[:] enharmonic.remove(tonic) enharmonicTonic = enharmonic[0] if enharmonicTonic: scaleEnharmonic = NameScalesKeySignatures(enharmonicTonic,binary) if scaleEnharmonic[0] < scale[0]: scaleNotes = scaleEnharmonic[1] scaleKey = enharmonicTonic return (scaleKey,scaleNotes) print(NameScalesEnharmonicRoots('F','1001011100101'))",

My father is forcing me to 'learn' programming by assigning complex C++ projects with only a couple days allowed to work on it. I have barely any programming experience and have only done basic Python. But the workload of C++ my father is pushing is constant, he doesn't teach me C++ or even try to work through the assignments, just gives me a due date and a google doc and says to ask ChatGPT if I need help.My code is usually an ugly amalgamation of AI-generated nonsense and my best attempt at C++ that is impossible to get working. He only gives me enough time to make something that vaguely fills the assignment requirements much less works much less I actually understand what I'm writing. I genuinely want to learn to code but I don't have the time for much else on top of school and all the C++ projects. My father doesn't explain pointers or compiling or anything and I'm just very lost but I don't have the time to learn on my own while still completing his assignments. I'm currently doing CS50x from edx but its been difficult to progress on top of everything else.He's a software engineer but doesn't seem to understand that coding doesn't come naturally for some people. The most recent assignment was I was given a week for an advanced C++ ecosystem simulation of different environment regions, predators, prey, random chance, etc all reading from a configuration file; I don't even know how to write a basic calculator in C++ without help.If anyone has learned programming/C++ in a similar manner by 'doing' or has any suggestions for how I can actually learn please comment! I would really appreciate it. Thanks!",

As an example, I'm working on a site for a club I'm in and while the site itself is huge and probably needs most of its pages manually coded in (I'm using React), there's one section in particular where it could easily become a mess to do that. Basically, there's an \"Events\" section which features a bunch of links to Current and Past Events that the club has hosted and clicking on any of them takes you to a dedicated event page. All of the event pages have more or less the same structure. I can't imagine having to create pages for each of them manually and then route them all to individual endpoints; it sounds very backwards. I mean, there's no way the guys at Youtube are hand-crafting pages for each of it's videos on the database and then manually connecting a million routes. So what's the solution here?I heard of something called Static Site Generation, the concept of which I haven't been able to fully understand yet. Could this be the solution to what I'm trying to do?Also, what to do if I wanted to add some unique flair to some of the event pages (but not all) while still maintaining most of the structure? (Say for example, one event page has a different background colour than the rest, or has a few divs here and there that the others don't have) Would I be able to customise without having to break out of the system?",

So I want to jump into the deep end, and start learning C++, to get a proper deep level coding knowledge base.However... I want to find a way to learn that will give me some progressively more difficult, game based, coding projects along the way. I found the LearnC++ site which is absolutely awesome, but much too text heavy for me (I have ADHD/dyslexia) so want to find a balance between text and practice based learning.Can anyone point me to any relevant (and free/cheap) resources please, ones that will take me through the concepts progressively like LearnC++ does?

I completed the introductory “Hello World”, and other starter programs that they suggested however, I started doing extra exercises to attempt to help myself. I know with coding, like any hobby, you need experience and just working out new problems helps. When I’d ask for help or an explanation it feels as if the programmer mentors are frustrated with me because they cannot dumb down the material enough. Luckily I have a friend that’s been helping me explain code verbally and it’s helping more than sitting on scratch for 5 hours ever has but I still feel like I’m missing something. Basic functions are hard to write and I know memorization isn’t really your friend in this subject so how exactly do you know what to code?

I understand the basics of coding like variables, parameters, loops, conditions, functions etc but when it comes to advanced stuff like using OOP or developing a script to automate, or when looking at others scripts, it really scares me and makes me feel like I have learnt nothing... I end up re learning basics but then have no idea how to move forward or what to do that would genuinely help me learn the complexities of coding used in such automation. Btw automation can be like generating a list of pin names for input and output of a design once i feed it through an excel file for example....Thanks for reading and appreciate any possible solutions",

I would really like to see a daily devlog style video series that delves almost purely into the coding aspect with the person explaining what their goal is, but not necessarily what exactly they are doing.

I didn't really mind this but I have been thrown around from project to project without any being completed, I haven't had any resources.My main concerns are the following:* Not a single project has any form of docs whatsoever and this is something I wanted to learn about* I don't have a mentor* I don't even work with a senior* I don't even have my code reviewed* I work with a couple other juniors, whom don't work with the seniors either, and one heavily relies on AI so much that his code is always buggy and he doesn't know how to fix it* The director constantly uses AI to add code and pushes it to the main branch.* We only ever use one stack, which is redwoodjs, for every single project, or react native, expo if it's for mobile. No other tech stacks regardless of what the project is. Example of when this irked me a little, this last week I had to implement AI into one of the projects to read and automate docs. I wanted to use OCR, and felt like having a simple fastAPI server would've been beneficial as there are many great python packages to handle exactly what I needed but I was told to do so with react, of which packages to handle pdfs were hard to come by and many didn't support OCR from pdfs on react. It would also be nice to use other stacks and see where they benefit.I have tried other companies but I don't have a degree and every response I get is that I either need a degree or a few years of professional experience and I honestly don't believe that I'm getting that kind of experience with my internship",

I can have 2 hours/day for this. I started The Odin Project few years ago and I stopped at the beginning asynchronous Javascript.

I built out classes for each of these three things, and I want to make rule classes that will take in people, times, and work assignments, and generate the lower level elements to plug into the solver engine.I've done all that and it works, but I'm running into big picture questions:If I have a bunch of existing rules, people, times, work assignments, and I change/delete a person, then how do I ensure consistency in the rules that may reference that deleted person?Should rules contain value or reference links to the people/times/work assignments? Currently I used references (I understand these are pointers under the hood), but all of the reference links made it very hard for me to achieve the next step, which is saving the rules and everything to a file. I think I need to change the references to a key value that can be used to look up the person or whatever, like a GUID or other such key strategy.Is there any name for this or more complex programming in general that I can google to learn more about what I'm doing? I'm finding I'm building complex data structures but I don't really know what I'm doing, and it's a bit beyond a simple TODO app.",

It leads to companies considering way too many people and becoming way too picky. Also, hiring cheaters and causing non cheaters to be punished because standards are way out of line with reality.People who were saying this couldn't be done are strange to me. It is literally how it was always done prior to covid and pretty much forever.I think many of the people coming up with the questions for candidates are in for a rude awakening to realize how horrible they were at spotting cheaters. There egos won't let them admit it, but they will probably have to lower the difficulty of questions because cheaters artificially caused the standards to be raised way too high.",

Can't debug it, can't maintain it, can't extend it (AI does that as well). Most of our seniors are seeing that pattern and yeah we have PR'S for that, but people seem to produce more crap then ever.I used to spot lazy work much faster in the past. Now I have to dig deeper in every review to find the hidden problems. AI code is creating MORE work for experienced devs, not less.

I ended up on a naughty list for the first time in my career, despite never having performance issues. I explain to my manager and his response is to just ask it meaningless questions. Okay, fine whatever. Then came the \"vibe coding\" initiative. As if we don't have enough inexperience on our teams due to constant layoffs, we're now actively encouraging people to make mistakes and trust AI for the sake of speed. Healthcare company by the way (yikes).What happened to actually knowing things? When will people realize AI is frequently, confidently wrong? I feel like an insane person shouting on every company survey and in every town hall meeting to get these AI-pilled people to understand the damage they are doing. We have people introducing double-digit numbers of defects on single user stories now, and those people don't get in trouble (meanwhile I'm a bad person because I didn't talk to AI last week, for shame!). I have been applying to dozens of jobs, but every job I apply to is now a game of appeasing an AI reading my application. Of course the market just being crummy in general at the moment doesn't help. Most of the job postings are in developing AI tools that won't be around a year or two from now when they inevitably flop. I'm sure there are companies out there that aren't buying into the AI hype or are just too small to necessitate them, but they seem few and far between.I'm realizing I have such an appreciation for the critical thinking and problem solving aspects of the career, but as it changes I'm falling out of love with what it is becoming. I feel like I'm on The Truman Show when having to listen to these AI-pilled people. What's your approach to dealing with this? I'd love to hear perspectives from my fellow anti-AI/skeptics. I'm not sure if I'm looking for a \"change my mind\" or \"you're not alone\" but I'd love any reassurance or suggestions.",

I have been preparing for 3 months, have interviewed for a bunch of companies but failed due to very tough calls, and I got a few left now, but interviews just keep getting harder and harder and there is too much variance on what can be asked. I prepare for leetcode, they ask OOP, I prepare for OOP, they ask a leetcode hard, I prepare for that, they ask me a Java FILE I/O question. Just an example of not knowing enough. I have 5 chances left after 4 fails in the past month, and im running out of time and funds, only got 20k left to my name at 28 after paying off all debt. I have the blessing to atleast move back home because I was raised in NY, but it's embarrassing tbh but my parents want me to as they being supportive.

Time flew by, and I got pigeonholed in outdated “dinosaur” companies.Trying to leave my job was incredibly demoralizing. Thousands of job applications and a painfully low callback rate. I was discouraged by this and even more, by my background and lack of modern systems experience. I posted here asking how long it takes to prep for system design interviews from 0.  Many replies were disheartening, like “you need real on-the-job experience.” But it turns out…you don’t—at least not to pass interviews. Here’s what I did while working full-time:LeetCode (6 months): Focused on the top 150 problems, revisiting and practicing each one 4-5 times. (I failed many, many interviews along the way).System Design (1.5 months): Started from almost zero and crammed, studying about 15 systems deeply, mainly through videos and practice.Applications: Sent out over a thousand applications with very low callback. Landed interviews mostly through headhunters. Interviews (6 months): Juggled my full-time job while going through processes with 45 companies (failing most of them early on).It was brutal: endless rejections, self-doubt, and burnout. But I just landed 2 solid offers in AI (around 250k+ TC).If you’re in a similar rut, know that it is absolutely doable with consistent effort. You can break free even without the “right” background.

Edit: one recruiter did offer his LinkedIn though so idk if that means much. And all the companies took my resume. But that resume is within a whole sea of them so I don’t get the difference.",

I went through everything sadness, anxiety, crying at night, questioning my worth all of it.What really broke me wasn’t just losing the job, but realizing that the people I thought were my friends at work… really weren’t. We used to have fun discussions, laugh, share personal stuff I genuinely thought we were close. But after I got laid off, it was like I never existed.I reached out to one person from my old team just to see how things were going there, and she completely ignored my message. That hit me harder than I expected. It made me feel so small, like I was begging for attention or validation when all I wanted was some human decency.I’m still early in my career, just a fresh grad, and this was my first real job. I was one of the top performers on the team too, so getting laid off and then being treated like that felt like a slap in the face.I know I’ll bounce back eventually, but man… this experience gave me a real taste of how cold things can get in the professional world.Has anyone else gone through something similar after being laid off? How did you deal with that feeling of being forgotten so quickly? How you handled their behaviour man.",

        "content": "I’m a junior software engineer (9 months in) at a Series B cybersecurity startup with around 60 people.Honestly, my experience here has been kind of bizarre, and I’m wondering if this is a normal experience.I’m in a small team that reports directly to the CEO: one senior engineer, me, and an intern. The CEO is technically our manager, but he’s basically a ghost. He gives no technical direction or help. When I ask for guidance, he just says, “Ask other engineers,” but they’re in completely different departments and have no idea what I’m working on. So we all just work in isolation on our own little projects. There’s no code review, no real communication, and QA is all manual.The CEO keeps saying that since we’re a small team, we have to be “extra vigilant” and document everything — but that’s about the extent of his input. The funny part is, on the rare occasions when he does try to manage us, he becomes super micromanagey, nitpicking tiny details and trying to control everything. It’s weird because 95% of the time he’s totally absent, and then suddenly he swings to the complete opposite extreme. Some days I literally have nothing to do because he doesn’t assign new tasks.There are times when I get completely blocked because I don’t have the resources or information I need. When I mentioned that to the CEO, he told me that I was “blaming others” and that I should be more proactive. There was also this one time during our monthly progress meeting when our senior engineer fell behind on something because she was waiting for an API from another department. The CEO got frustrated and the two started arguing each other for a good minute or so about it.My biggest concern is this: Most of the projects I’ve done are small — maybe 2,000 to 3,000 lines of code at most. They feel more like college projects than production systems, and I’m not sure if they’re even worth putting on my resume. Sure, I have learned a few things here and there — Docker/K8s, Nginx with PM2, VM provisioning, shell scripting, a bit of frontend deployment but I’m worried that I’m not getting enough solid experience to grow. I’ve been studying 2–3 hours every night and 5 hours on weekends just to make sure I don’t fall behind.Is this kind of situation normal for early-career engineers at startups?",

Base is 150k with healthy equity (was able to bump equity a bit through negotiation). In total, I sent out around 200 apps. 150 were through linkedin or company career sites, and the remaining 50 were through recruiters recommending me to companies on paraform, which had a much higher success rate. During that month-long job hunt, I did 44 interviews with 20 different companies. I also had 12 recruiter calls. I made it to 3 final rounds and got one offer. Honestly, I’m very lucky my current company gives me a low enough workload to cram so many interviews.",

I was laid off about a year ago and was super happy to find my current role as a software dev engineer about 4 months ago. My background is mostly backend web applications with some front end work (10%) Upon arrival I found out that I'll be part of a devops team which was not a huge issue for me, I've built CICD pipelines in the past and know the basics of what might be required.Anyway, about 2 months ago I got handed this high visibility project. Basically it is a massive application monorepo and I'm in charge of the pipeline for this project. I've have been struggling to get any support from the team that manages the application. And the person who has become my \"main contact\" is constantly out of office and I'm starting to notice that the delivery target for this pipeline will get delayed. Whenever I bring up any issues to my manager he immediately dismisses my concerns and his rebuttal is \"oh that's not an issue we can resolve it by xyz\" without actually understanding the concern I'm trying to raise. I suppose I could do a better job of not \"accepting\" his answer and trying to make my point clearer but anyway we are kinda past that.The other problem is that I've become a defacto project manager. My manager has told me to assign work to other team members and I've had to create a \"second standup\" outside of my main teams standup where we go over the tickets related to this project. My manager has set an aggressive timeline to deliver this project but I'm seeing that we will not be able to deliver it on his timeline and now I'm getting yelled at for delays. I wasn't really expecting to become a project manager for this role, I don't know how to go about dealing my manager who told me in a 1:1 that he would \"rather die than deliver this project late\"Any advice would be appreciated. On the one hand I'm thinking I can use this opportunity to learn about project management etc however I've started doing the \"project manager\" role really close to the deadline so now I'm getting people up to speed etc while we are expecting to go into production asap. But on the other I'm feeling quite overwhelmed and feeling like this was not my expectations for this role.Thanks for any advice in advance!!",

I’m almost considering abandoning my job search and just focusing on the course just to get it done, but even then I’ll still have fairly minimal experience with React.The best results I’ve had so far have been individuals from recruiting companies pinging me on LinkedIn. Most of the time this results in me sending a resume to them for a contract job. I’ve had a few seem really promising but then ghost me after I get the resume. This last week I got in touch with a contractor who was looking for a position that just so happened to be with my first team at the tech company. They fast-tracked me into an interview that ran for far longer than it should have, and actually ran over what was supposed to be a second interview. The recruiter told me they would reschedule the second interview but I haven’t heard back from them. The team wants to have someone in the role by the end of this week but now I fear that even they might not be willing to take me back, even though they have my receipts, are probably using my code, and should know what I’m capable of.Any advice?

After being a full time software dev for a fortune 500 company (not big tech) and making a little shy of 100k (65k take home) i have been struggling with personal finances. My mortgage and housing expenses is 40% of my budget, food is 20%, that doesn't leave much to even get ahead. I have a small 3 bed 1 bath in a poor neighborhood and I'm looking to move for a better school district and my budget is aimed at the worst houses in the market. My wife is disabled and a stay at home mom so I only have 1 income and I'm dealing with health issues myself that makes me not on top of my game.I studied hard 8 months last year for big tech jobs but when I went to apply I put in apps to all big tech companies I only got Amazon responding and I failed their initial screening due to it being a design problem rather than leetcode. Even tried applying to jobs that weren't big tech and don't get a call back.I could do a business or at least a micro saas for income but I have too much idea paralysis before starting. I could make anything with software and I make great full stack software but I don't have a GREAT idea for an undeserved market. I could specialize in a field in CS but I am a .NET/go dev with some full stack experience. I could go to a different field like cyber sec or data engineering but I don't know a good list of ones that pay more than software development. I am regarded as an up and comer in my organization and work well and hard, but I am underutilized and underpaid. They also don't have a lot of promotion cycles so I don't feel I'm getting promoted as quick as my skills. I should hit senior level within a year or so.TLDRJust feeling lost at the moment. I feel starting a business is the only way to get uncapped salary but get stuck with idea paralysis and undeserved markets. I studied hard at a good university and graduated magna cum laude but I just feel stuck like I learned all that for nothing. Not utilizing enough of my skills at work and not getting paid enough and no calls back from jobs. With 60% of my pay going to a small house and food (not to mention medical bills) its tough to get ahead.",

I interned at this company during my senior year, and pretty much joined full time right after graduation (I had maybe a week off).The company is amazing. The work life balance is great, my coworkers and boss are great, and the pay isn’t bad (especially considering I still live with my parents in a low cost of living area). I’m nearby most of my friends and have a very healthy life outside of work with multiple hobbies.Yet I can’t help but feel like something feels missing. My job is right next to my house where I grew up (10 min commute) and I went to school in state only 30 ish minutes away. I feel like I haven’t seen or done anything and am missing out. I know I’m in a situation some would envy, but I just feel… bored?I’ve always been interested in the idea of joining the military, but have obviously heard horror stories about it too (hence why I never joined). But just today I was having a casual conversation with the lead engineer and he told me about his experiences in the Navy. All of the fun he had, all of the minor trouble he got into, the places he’s been, etc… It honestly sounded like a fun adventure and he said he hasn’t regretted a second of it. And obviously it didn’t impact his career negatively as he’s the lead engineer in our team.So I guess the TL:DR is, am I crazy for considering leaving my current job to join as an Officer in the Navy/Air Force? What tech skills will I learn and how will it impact me in the future? Obviously I had my lead engineer as a resource, but I want to get a broader set of opinions too that may not be biased by previous experiences.",

Honestly, getting a \"noreply\" is better than having your information sold and being contacted for the hundredth time by some random sales associate (usually speaking broken English with a generic pitch).That brings me to the subreddit in question. The first post I came across was this one: [Software Engineer - HTML/CSS/JS @ Apple | $120K–$210K | Paid Relocation](https://www.reddit.com/r/DevJobLeadsOnReddit/comments/1o1dgrx/software_engineer_htmlcssjs_apple_120k210k_paid/)It struck me as incredibly generic and out of touch. I left a comment for future readers because the post felt vague — basic HTML/CSS/JS skills, sky-high compensation, and no real details on location, employment type, or expectations. Most legitimate job postings include more concrete requirements. When they don’t, that’s usually a red flag.Out of curiosity, I reached out to one of the mods, who also claims to be the creator of the sub. While the conversation was polite, almost every question I asked was either dodged or brushed off. From what I could gather, they're scraping job listings from various sources, rewriting them into more digestible formats, and then notifying the companies afterward.When I asked if they had any process to clean up expired or inactive roles, how the employers are notified, or if they could post the sources for these scraped jobs, the conversation was cut short. Shortly after, I received a permanent ban from the subreddit. That, to me, is a bad sign.I wasn’t planning to apply through them anyway. I highly doubt Apple is scanning Reddit for job applicants based on comments and quick pitches. But I do care that people might be getting taken advantage of without realizing it.The job market is already stressful enough. The least we can do is call out shady practices when we see them.**TL;DR:** The subreddit r/DevJobLeadsOnReddit posted a sketchy-looking Apple job with vague requirements and high pay. I asked the mod some basic questions about sourcing and expired listings, got vague answers, and was banned shortly after. Feels like they're scraping jobs and repackaging them with little transparency. Be cautious, this looks more like a traffic funnel than a legit job board adjacent.",

We are both very skeptical of AI in general and both have been developers for almost 20 years each, but after a weekend of working with it he seems to have seen the light to the productivity boost. I have hit or miss experiences with AI, but never used it to vibe code. He spoke to a Microsoft Azure rep and they mentioned that AI is great for vibe coding greenfield stuff, but it doesn't work as well with established code. He is now in the process of using AI to take an existing C# .Net 4.8 MVC application to Blazor using Telerik controls to see the viable of using it to churn out new features faster.From reading this sub and Twitter, there seems to be a period where vibe coding with AI seems like magic where it seems to do everything perfectly the first time until it doesn't. So my question is what are other people's experiences and if and when the tables turned and you settled on using it only when it makes sense?

I don't mind becoming leadership but I don't want to do leadership things for a year+ before annual review where I get the title and salary raise for it. How have you all handled this transition?",

        "content": "Hi. I'm having trouble job seeking as a java developer with 7 years of experience due to the technologies that companies require now. I have experience with java and spring, databases (SQL and non-sql), event systems like rabbitmq/Kafka, rest/graphql, docker, kubernetes, maven/gradle. These are most of the things I do on a day to day basis. Throw in testing (junit, mockito, testcontainers) and observability/tracing tools like kibana/datadog/grafana.But when I apply to positions I am asked all of the above and way more. Most jobs are listed as full stack, so they require experience with angular/react. Then they want cloud experience, which is very vague imo. Do they expect you to set up ec2 instances and manage load balancers? They also want DevOps experience, but that doesn't stop at k8s/docker, throw in some helm, terraform, setup clusters from scratch if possible.At the end of the day most of these positions seem like 3 or 4 people into 1. They want a backend engineer, a frontend one, a DevOps and sometimes even a tester/IT/infra.And I know those are wishlists but while applying and interviewing, I actually get asked about all these things and even get denied if I don't have experience with them. Is this the new normal? Am I just not versatile enough? The project I work on does not allow me to have experience with all these other things things, and I want to know if you would expect someone to know all of these when working.And to specify: I'm not applying to startups where I understand its more expected to be a one man team.",

Joined because of the good pay & perks, but I slowly found out my team is a hot mess: no testing, no docs, no staging environment, no ci/cd, a bunch of tech debt and v1/2/3/4/5 to maintain at the same time, stagnant product, team lack of clear direction on what to do next...Very low productivity on everything like oncall, bug fix, project launch, etc, due to all these issues. More importantly, I don't seem to learn much on the job, it's all pretty repetitive work.I panicked and thought my career growth is gonna be nonexistent, so I started spraying resume to all the new grad positions blindly several months ago, I was able to get 1-2 offers from some other large company, the pay is on-par with my current company, the work seems more interesting to me, and I signed the offers. But now I'm a bit scared when I actually think about job switching. My manager and my colleagues like me, and my manager is promising a promo in 1-2 years (i know this can be bs), seems like most junior engineers get promoted pretty fast. WLB is ok too.I chatted with my friends, and it seems like they are all not getting much learning in their job, and it sounds like dealing with a hot mess is a norm in this industry, doesn't that defeat my original purpose for job switching? Given that there's no significant pay bump in these offers and unknown manager/wlb, should I actually just wait at least until 2/3 yoe to promo/jump to the next level?",

        "content": "In December my manager asked me to quit and that I’d probably be let go by August. I was taken by surprise and didn’t understand why. My new manager was promoted and I was placed under him. My old one is skip manager. I was having lunch with my manager and he laughed when I said I was busy. Eventually in a meeting with him, he snaps at me and tells me to “think!”. I was scared and confused. Keep in mind that I have Autism and severe anxiety. Usually, I get moved to a new project every sprint and have to deliver on time or else. I didn’t really have anyone available to help if I needed them, just a few minutes of explanation on a good day. I was hesitant since I began asking for ADA 6 months prior. I decided to call again and got my ADA approved for 60 days for Autism. I told my manager that I had ASD and would experience memory lapses under enough anxiety. He told me, “you can over come it.” He glanced at the paper explaining my condition and didn’t keep it. 5 days later he puts me on pip and detailing poor code quality. I was shocked. He himself approved those PRs and no one else found issue with it. When I requested pip papers, he gave it to me a month later without the pages of code he showed me. My anxiety skyrocketed to a point where I took extra days off and time to recover from. He never talked to me like the others in the office, and left me out of many team meetings. He puts me on one project where I had to do big data work when my strength was backend. The POC I needed to sign off my work kept changing the solutioning for the data and my ASD brain went into overdrive to make sure I could grasp it. That took 4 weeks. I was struggling with my mental health and updated my mid year a little late. My manager only based my mid year on those 4 weeks only. Shortly after I got very ill and lost a loved one in an accident. My manager told me to compartmentalize. Day 60 into the 90 pip, I ask him for more work since I’ve completed the recent work on time. He told me, “I’m working hard to find you work.” He moved our 1:1 meeting to 4:30. Once I show up to the meeting he said that I showed little improvement and had security escort me out the office. I never saw or heard from HR once. No severance, just out on the street. The ADA expired weeks ago and I was going to reapply once I saw my doctor again. I don’t know what I did wrong. I pushed myself past 100% trying to do as he asked. I compartmentalized and dedicated most of my free time to rest until work the next morning. What did I do wrong? He asked me to quit my black employee resource group, I skipped time with family, and put in an extra few hours on some days to ensure perfect code. I don’t know what I did to disappoint them. My mind would shutdown from exhaustion, but I was on medication to push me past 100%. I’m at home now recovering before I seek my next job. It was my first tech job out of college 2 YOE.",

I completely dropped applying for jobs ever since I got this current position because it genuinely just made me depressed every day, but with full time right around the corner and finding out full time genuinely is just worse in this pay with barely any pay bumps, I want to start looking for better software engineering positions out there. So here's my question: how do I start again? Here's where I am at right now. I already rebuilt my resume, updated my LinkedIn and GitHub to match my current experience, and I have a personal website I already included on my resume and attach on any application. My previous internship had be working on Backend JavaScript most of the time, and my current place utilizes php, python, and CRM development whenever I'm doing programming stuff. I really prefer C# and JavaScript. Admittedly I have not worked on a personal project in a long time, but I intend to work on some C# related projects soon. Where should I be looking for positions? Is it still LinkedIn, or is there a better option? Are there any programming languages that are high in demand right now that I should focus on instead? Should I use a different version of my resume each time I apply for anywhere? I've been out of the game for a while, and I know it's only gotten worse. I'm wondering what my next step should be now that I at least have something worth a damn to put on a resume, or if I should just abandon ship and use my experience for something adjacent.

But the last few months have been chaos. Management’s scrambling, people are quitting or quietly transferring, and entire projects are collapsing faster than they can be reassigned.Half the people I used to rely on have left, and now I’m basically maintaining random fragments of systems that no one else touches. There’s no mentorship, no technical challenge, and definitely no direction. Every day feels like “keep the lights on” mode.The thing is — I’m not overworked. I’m **understimulated.** The job’s too easy, the pay’s on the low side, and the feeling of stagnation is eating me alive. I used to love coding — building stuff, solving problems, learning new tech — now I just click through Jira tickets and slowly detach a bit more each week.I’ve thought about quitting a hundred times. I’ve even enrolled in a part-time Master’s starting next year as a soft reset — not because I need the degree, but because I need structure and a sense of progress again.But with Christmas coming up and everything slowing down, part of me thinks, *“just coast through the holidays, collect the chill paycheck, maybe even get a promo before you dip.”*Then another part of me goes, *“why am I still trying to climb a ladder I don’t even want to be on?”*I know a lot of people here are probably going through their own flavor of career existentialism — either can’t find the perfect job, can’t get one at all, or are stuck in something that’s fine on paper but quietly soul-draining. I just want to hear from anyone who’s in this same weird spot.How did you break out of the comfort trap early in your career? Did you quit cold, coast strategically, go back to study, or just wait until the burnout made the choice for you?",

I'm in my end 20s and horribly scared to not find a job in the future if I go 1-2.5 years more without job but I'd love to build a fully autonomous life.Also the job market currently is so horrible, that I may as well be forced to try because I couldn't find anything in the last 3 months.I already have 4 YoE of experience as a Java Web Dev prior to the travels.Edit: I learned React/Next (was an Angular guy) in those 2.5 years of travel, neovim and lua + did some Python scripting so definitely not completely away from coding. Edit2: How fair would be open source contribution additionally? I never did so far but was thinking about it too.",

I finished a 6-month internship at Omnishore, where I worked on a big insurance platform using .NET 8, Angular 19, SQL Server, and CQRS / Clean Architecture. It was tough, but I learned a lot and thought it would open doors.After that, I got accepted for a pre-employment internship at Prestige, moved to another city, paid for transport and a gym, even started building a new routine… and then, out of nowhere, they told me they’re overstaffed.Now they’re offering two options:Work remotely for free for 3 months until a post is open, orCome on-site full-time with no clear contract yet.Honestly, I feel crushed. I’ve already been through this once — Omnishore also didn’t hire me after promising there was a chance. I’ve been trying hard to stay disciplined, rebuild my life, go to the gym, focus on my health and confidence… but I keep ending up back at zero.I know I’m not the only one struggling to find a junior dev job, but I feel completely drained. I’m trying to stay calm, rebuild, and not lose faith, but it’s really hard when every opportunity collapses last minute.If anyone here has been through this — how did you keep going?How do you rebuild your motivation after months of rejection and uncertainty?Any advice for someone who just wants a stable start and peace of mind?",

The company itself is not a tech company, but in an entirely different industry/sector. Their tech team is small, and apparently a majority of the time I would be working on would be these Power Apps.Is this something if I take on, and do for years, would this look bad on my resume? Is this some disparate technology with little overlap to actual SWE work and SWE career growth? Would you take this kind of work for a company which is not tech focused? Moreover, would you move across the country to accept a job like this? I want to feel confident that I won't regret making a large life and career decision based on something that wasn't what I was looking for. I feel like they used normal SWE keywords and kind of bait and switched the role, as the focus will be heavily on these low code platforms which I don't have much experience with.",

        "content": "Good day devs! I’ve been working as a junior software dev (2 YOE) for a couple months now. It’s just me and my boss. He’s an ex-Reddit engineer with ~15 years of experience, and I come from a web background.We’re building a pretty big multi-app Flutter + Firebase project using Clean Architecture, which is all new to me. The main struggle I’m having is that I rarely get clear requirements. Usually I’ll get something like:“We need a chat box that can also record audio.”And that’s it. From there, I’m expected to figure out everything — UX, architecture, edge cases, and make it up to his standards.He doesn’t really walk me through the context or help clarify requirements; I usually just get feedback once I open my first PR. My PRs almost never meet expectations on the first few goes, and sometimes I make rookie mistakes (like forgetting to rebase), which makes me feel even worse. His feedback can be pretty blunt, too.Because I’m still learning Flutter, Firebase, and the project structure, things take me a long time — sometimes weeks for a single feature. Even when I do understand the requirements, like for the Auth flow I’m finishing now, it’s still slow progress.I’m trying hard to improve, but it’s been rough. During my interview, I said I perform above the average junior — and he’s holding me to that, which is fair. But right now I feel like I’m constantly falling short, and I can’t tell if that’s because I’m actually underperforming… or because this setup would be tough for anyone at my level.So I guess my question is:Is this kind of setup (basically no guidance, just tasks and expectations) normal for a junior? am I genuinely underperforming? And if you’ve been in a similar spot, what helped you get through it?TLDR:I’m a 2 YOE junior dev working under a super-senior ex-Reddit engineer. I get very vague task descriptions (e.g. “build a chat box that records audio”) and have to figure everything out myself — UX, architecture, edge cases, etc. I’m learning a new stack (Flutter + Firebase + Clean Arch), so progress is slow and feedback is tough. Not sure if I’m actually underperforming or if this setup is just rough for a junior. Looking for advice or perspective.",

Even though I’m in second year, I feel stuck, behind, and frustrated. Sometimes I feel embarrassed seeing my classmates move ahead while I feel like I can’t keep up.I enjoy programming and creating things, but lately it’s been hard to maintain the pace. I’m receiving psychological and psychiatric treatment, but I don’t want to use that as an excuse. I just feel exhausted.If I continue in my current program, it would probably take me about 2.5 more years if everything goes perfectly, which honestly seems unlikely.If I switch universities, I would likely have to start almost from scratch (3.5 more years).And if I quit completely, I’m afraid of being directionless and feeling even more stuck.What worries me the most is the future:I want to work in technology, grow into leadership or managerial roles, and eventually emigrate. But I don’t know if I absolutely need a university degree for that, or if I could build that path through technical certifications and work experience. However, I have this thought that without a degree I won’t be “anyone.”In summary:•I feel emotionally drained and frustrated.•I don’t want to keep spending money if I’m not making progress.•I also don’t want to give up without thinking it through; I’ve already made too many bad decisions.Has anyone been through something similar?Is it worth continuing the university route, or is it better to try something else?Any honest opinions or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated.Thanks for reading.",

        "content": "Currently an SWE at the rain forest, 1.5 yoe. Got an offer from a pretty cool AI startup, remote first global company. Some context: at Amazon I’m on an important team, starting to think about promotion, but manager recently moved so that’s been delayed and harder without him. Probably 6-12 months to L5 (what my L6 said) and salary goes up around 20%. Working 10-6, sometimes 7. Pretty chill wlb and good team. Not many perks. Lots of responsibilities and big projects with large impact.I definitely have a short term life goal of moving away from London for a few years while I am young. in a year after my promo I can move to the US on L1 visa, idk how feasible it is to get a good transfer internationally tho.Got an offer from a pretty big startup, it’s remote first but has offices in a few places, spoke to some engineers and they are working 9-7 so about 2 more per day. Salary around 30% more than Zon, take home post tax is 5.1k, vs 4k atm. Even after promo I’ll be only be on about 4.5k. It’s an exciting AI company, very interesting fast paced work.So here’s the decision-making part… I’d make more, moving now, than I would even after a promo here. At the startup, we would report to a tech lead who reports to the CTO; it’s fast-paced and high ownership (so is Amazon, tbf). I think I’ll have a lot of responsibilities, not treated like an L4, and I think it will supercharge my growth.My main concerns: is being a digital nomad at 22 weird? Idk how I feel about it for career growth, but I love travelling, so I’d be excited! But I might be more excited about the USA move (even though it’s two years away, I’d be 24). I’m not sure how easy it is, and I’m not sure if I’d have the same opportunity to move if I was in the startup.What would you guys do? Idk. Anything I’m not considering? The way I’m thinking about is - I’m 22, most of my peers are still unemployed and I am in a very fortunate position. Unsure if I’m rushing into a job switch too fast.",

I am expecting a promotion soon (from L1 to L2) which I believe will get me to 110-130K. I am in person full time because my work requires a clearance, which is kind of sucky (I would prefer a hybrid/remote role).I want to leave my role for a few reasons:* Salary increase* Potentially switch to another company with more prestige* Remote/hybrid opportunities* The tech stack I'm working with is fairly modern, but I do feel like the project suffers from poor software engineering practices. It lacks structure, has inconsistent code quality, minimal error handling, and an unresponsive, buggy UI. It feels like it was built without clear architecture or professional standards. The codebase is massive, so theres only so much I can do about this.The problem is that although I want to leave, the current state of the market is really rough and I am considering staying due to the job stability that I have. I am wondering if I should just stick it out with my current company for several more years and get a master's degree while I work full time, which the company will pay for in its entirety. At my company, getting a master's degree leads to a promotion quicker from L2 to L3, and I am thinking if I get a master's degree, especially in the AI/ML space, it will help me in the future when it comes to my career and opening up more jobs. However, doing this will keep me stuck at the company for several years and I won't be able to leave until 1 year after I have obtained the degree. Given the current state of the market, is it a better idea to stick it out with my company and get a master's degree, or stay screw it and apply to other companies?",

I already have 1.5 years of college done (my basics) so that will give me more time to focus on what I actually want to pursue as a career. Ever since middle school, I have decided I wanted to pursue computer science and since the ending of last year, I have decided I want to major in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and minor in cybersecurity. However, anytime I tell someone I want to major in computer science I get negative comments such as “that’s unemployment “ or “AI is going to take over that field” and that is just making me overthink and second guess what I want to do. I feel like majority of those people simply don’t know exactly what computer science is though and they have no idea what they are talking about but it still has me concerned. So my question to everyone on here is (if you are taking comp sci right now or particularly those who already have a career in the field) should I still pursue this field? Is it worth it?

I didn’t ask but I feel he regrets leaving nvidia long ago. The compromise is that he will take online courses at one of the big name online cs programs for a masters while still working as a CRNA. Then if he gets a job, he can leave CRNA and come back if he ever changes his mind. Originally he wanted to leave CRNA and focus on applying and studying full time.",
