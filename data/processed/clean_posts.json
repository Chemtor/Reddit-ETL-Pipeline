        "content": "We are hiring for a data engineering position, and I am responsible for the technical portion of the screening process. It’s pretty basic verbal stuff, explain the different sql joins, explain CTEs, explain Python function vs generator, followed by some very easy functional programming in python and some spark. Anyway — back to my story. I hop onto the meeting and introduce myself and ask some warm up questions about their background, etc. Immediately I notice this person’s head moves a LOT when they talk. And it moves in this… odd kind of way… and it does the same kind of movement over and over again. Odd, but I keep going. At one point this… agent…. Talks for about 2 min straight without taking a single breath or even sounding short of breath, which was incredibly jarring. Then we get into the actual technical exercise. I ask them to find a small bug in some python code that is just making a very simple API call. It’s a small syntax error, very basic, easy to miss but running the script and reading the error message spells it out for you. This agent starts explaining that the defect is due to a failure to authenticate with this api endpoint, which is not true at all. But the agent starts going into GREAT detail on how rest authentication works using oAuth tokens (which it wasn’t even using), and how that is the issue. Without even trying to run it. So I ask “interesting can you walk me through the code and explain how you identified that as the issue?” And it just repeats everything it just said a minute ago. I ask it again to try and explain the code to me and to fix the code. It starts saying the same thing a third time, then it drops entirely from the call. So I spent about 30 minutes today talking to someone’s scammer AI agent who somehow got their way past the basic HR screening. This is the world we are living in. This is not an advertisement for a position, please don’t ask me about the position, the intent of this post is just to share this experience with other professionals and raise some awareness to be careful with these interviews. If you contact me about this position, I promise I will just delete the message. Sorry. I very much wish I could have interviewed a real person instead of wasting 30 minutes of my time :pensive_face:",

We’re working on a joint project.Most of the other interns rely almost entirely on ChatGPT and other AI tools for their work full scripts, SQL, everything. When their code breaks (which happens a lot), they either throw it back into ChatGPT or come to me to fix it.I’ve been writing my own code so I actually learn what I’m doing ,because enjoy coding, and want to build real skills. I do use AI here and there, but only as a tool not to generate entire solutions blindly. When I showed them some of my handwritten code, they were shocked I didn’t just have ChatGPT generate it.It’s gotten worse too, I was writing a data cleaning script they needed, and they got visibly frustrated because I wasn’t just dumping it into ChatGPT to “make it faster” so they could have the cleaned data immediately.And the worst part? When something breaks in their code later they blame me, saying the data wasn’t properly cleaned or transformed. But when I actually look at their code, it’s often errors they introduced because they didn’t really understand what they were pasting in from ChatGPT. I then have to point out the bugs they don’t even realize are there because they didn’t write the code themselves.I also didn’t have a “traditional” education, I went go to school online and it’s a shock to see how people from brick and mortar schools operate sense I haven’t work with peers my age up until now. Which is making me second guess whether I’ve chosen the right path or not. My question is: am I taking the right approach by focusing on writing my own code and building skills, or should I be using AI more heavily like the others?If you have read all of this I appreciate you taking the time, any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

I really enjoy the day-to-day work, but the big-business driven nature bothers me. The field is heavily geared towards business objectives, with the primary goal being to enhance stakeholder profitibility. This is amplified by how much investment is funelled to the cloud monopolies.I'd to like my job to have a positive societal impact. Perhaps in one of these areas (though im open to other ideas)?- science/discovery- renewable sector- social mobilityMy aproach so far has been: get as good as possible. That way, organisations that you'd want to work for, will want you to work for them. But, it would be better if i could focus my efforts. Perhaps by targeting specific tech stacks that are popular in the areas above. Or by making a lateral move (or step down) to something like an IoT engineer.Any thoughts/experiences would be appreciated :)",

I tend to find that very in-depth books are better used as references. Sometimes I even think the internet is a more useful reference than those really dense, almost textbook-like books.Are there any data engineering books that give a good overview of the techniques, processes, and systems involved. Something at a level that helps me retain the content, maybe take a few notes, but doesn’t immediately dive deep into every topic? Ideally, I'd prefer to only dig deeper into specific areas when they become relevant in my work.",

        "content": "I'm somewhat struggling right now and I could use some advice or stories from anyone who's been in a similar spot.I work on a data team at a company that doesn't really value standardization or process improvement. We just recently started using GIT for our SQL development and while the team is technically adapting to it, they're not really embracing it. There's a strong resistance to anything that might be seen as \"overhead\" like data orchestration, basic testing, good modelling, single definitions for business logic, etc. Things like QA or proper reviews are not treated with much importance because the priority is speed, even though it's very obvious that our output as a team is often chaotic (and we end up in many \"emergency data request\" situations).The problem is that the work we produce is often rushed and full of issues. We frequently ship dashboards or models that contain errors and don't scale. There's no real documentation or data lineage. And when things break, the fixes are usually quick patches rather than root cause fixes.It's been wearing on me a little. I care a lot about doing things properly. I want to build things that are scalable, maintainable, and accurate. But I feel like I'm constantly fighting an uphill battle and I'm starting to burn out from caring too much when no one else seems to.If you've ever been in a situation like this, how did you handle it? How do you keep your mental health intact when you're the only one pushing for quality? Did you stay and try to change things over time or did you eventually leave?Any advice, even small things, would help.PS: I'm not a manager - just a humble analyst :grinning_face_with_sweat:",

Torn between safety and opportunity.Background:I’m 28 and have spent the last 7 years working primarily as a Cloud Data Engineer (most recently in a Lead role), with some Solutions Engineering work on the side. I got laid off last week and, while still processing that, two new paths have opened up. One’s predictable. The other’s risky but potentially career-changing.Option 1: Potential CTO role at a trading startup• Small early-stage team (2–3 engineers) building a medium-frequency trading platform for the Indian market (mainly F&O)• A close friend is involved and referred me to manage the technical side, they see me as a strong CTO candidate if things go well• Solid funding in place; runway isn’t a concern right now• Stack is MERN, which I’ve never worked with! I’d need to learn it from the ground up• They’re willing to fully support my ramp-up• 2–3 year commitment expected• Compensation is roughly equal to what I was earning beforeOption 2: Data Engineering role with a previous client• Work involves building a data platform on GCP• Very much in my comfort zone; I’ve done this kind of work for years• Slight pay bump• Feels safe, but also a bit stagnant—low learning, low riskWhat’s tearing me up:• The CTO role would push me outside my comfort zone and force me to become a more well-rounded engineer and leader• My Solutions Engineering background makes me confident I can bridge tech and business, which the CTO role demands• But stepping away from 7 years of focused data engineering experience—am I killing my momentum?• What if the startup fails? Will a 2–3 year detour make it harder to re-enter the data space?• The safe choice is obvious—but the risk could also pay off big, in terms of growth and leadership experiencePersonal context:• I don’t have major financial obligations right now—so if I ever wanted to take a risk, now’s probably the time• My friend vouched for me hard and believes I can do this. If I accept, I’d want to commit fully for at least a couple of yearsQuestions for you all:• Has anyone made a similar pivot from a focused engineering specialty (like data) to a full-stack or leadership role?• If so, how did it impact your career long-term? Any regrets?• Did you find it hard to return to your original path, or was the leadership experience a net positive?• Or am I overthinking this entirely?Thanks for reading this long post—honestly just needed to write it out. Would really appreciate hearing from anyone who's been through something like this.",

So I built something myself — a **distributed review analysis pipeline** using Dask, PyTorch, and transformer-based NLP models.**The Setup:*** **Data:** 17M+ Steam reviews (\\~40GB uncompressed), scraped using the Steam API* **Hardware:** Ryzen 9 7900X, 32GB RAM, RTX 4080 Super (16GB VRAM)* **Goal:** Process massive review datasets quickly and summarize key insights (sentiment + summarization)**Engineering Challenges (and Lessons):**1. **Transformer Parallelism Pain:** Initially, each Dask worker loaded its own model — ballooned memory use 6x. Fixed it by loading the model once and passing handles to workers. GPU usage dropped drastically.2. **CUDA + Serialization Hell:** Trying to serialize CUDA tensors between workers triggered crashes. Eventually settled on keeping all GPU operations in-place with smart data partitioning + local inference.3. **Auto-Hardware Adaptation:** The system detects hardware and: * Spawns optimal number of workers * Adjusts batch sizes based on RAM/VRAM * Falls back to CPU with smaller batches (16 samples) if no GPU4. **From 30min to 2min:** For 200K reviews, the pipeline used to take over 30 minutes — now it's down to \\~2 minutes. 15x speedup.**Dask Architecture Highlights:*** Dynamic worker spawning* Shared model access* Fault-tolerant processing* Smart batching and cleanup between tasks**What I’d Love Advice On:*** Is this architecture sound from a data engineering perspective?* Should I focus on scaling up to **multi-node** (Kubernetes, Ray, etc.) or polishing what I have?* Any strategies for **multi-GPU optimization** and memory handling?* Worth refactoring for **stream-based (real-time) review ingestion**?* Are there common pitfalls I’m not seeing?**Potential Applications Beyond Gaming:*** App Store reviews* Amazon product sentiment* Customer feedback for SaaS tools:link: **GitHub repo**: [https://github.com/Matrix030/SteamLens](https://github.com/Matrix030/SteamLens)I've uploaded the data I scrapped on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishikeshgharat/steam-games-data-40-gb) if anyone want to use it Happy to take any suggestions — would love to hear thoughts from folks who've built distributed ML or analytics systems at scale!Thanks in advance :folded_hands:",

The market has been brutal — I’m consistently reaching final rounds but losing out at the end, even with solid (non-FAANG) companies.I applied to a role two months ago — a Senior/Staff Data Engineer position with a strong focus on data security. So far, I’ve completed four rounds:•Recruiter screen•Hiring manager•Senior DE (technical scenarios + coding)•Senior Staff DE (system design + deep technical)My final round with the Senior Director was scheduled for today but got canceled last minute due to the Databricks Summit. Understandable, but frustrating they didn’t flag it earlier.What’s bothering me:•They reposted the job as “new” just yesterday•They rescheduled my final round for next weekIt’s starting to feel like they’re reopening the pipeline and keeping me as a backup while exploring new candidates.Has anyone been through something similar?Any advice on how to close the deal from here or stand out in the final stage would mean a lot. It’s been a tough ride, and I’m trying to stay hopeful.Thanks in advance.",

My point of view is to create PoC loading daily reservations and property updates orchestrated by Airflow, and then transformed in S3 using Glue, and finally ingest the silver data into Redshift2. My collegue proposes something else. Ask the infra team about the current event queues and set an event driven process and ingest properties and bookings when there's creation or update. Also, use Redshift in different schemas as soon as the data gets to AWS. In my point of view, I'd like to build a fast and simple PoC of a data warehouse creating a batch processing as a first step, and then if everything goes well, we can switch to event driven extraction What do you think it's the best idea?",

CDC from on-prem Postgres using AWS DMS2. Staging layer in Aurora PostgreSQL - this will combine all the databases for all services and tentants into one big database - we will also mantain the production schema at this layer - here i am also not sure whether to go straight to Redshit or maybe use S3 for staging since Redshift is not suited for frequent inserts coming from CDC3. Final analytics layer in either: * Aurora PostgreSQL - here I am consfused, i can either use this or redshift * Amazon Redshift - I dont know if redshift is an over kill or the best tool * Amazon quicksight for visualisationsWe want to support both real-time updates (low-latency operational dashboards) and cost-efficient historical queries.# Requirements* Near real-time change capture (5 - 10 minutes)* Cost-conscious (we're open to trade-offs)* Works with dashboarding tools (QuickSight or similar)* Capable of scaling with new tenants/services over time# :red_question_mark: What I'm Looking For1. Anyone using a similar **hybrid on-prem → AWS** setup: * What worked or didn’t work?2. Thoughts on using Aurora PostgreSQL as a landing zone vs S3?3.

Hello everyone! I was looking around this Reddit and thought it would be a good place to ask for some advice. Long story short I am a dashboard-developer who also for some reason does programming/pipelines for our scripts that run only on schedule (no events). I don’t have any prior background on data engineering but on our 3 man team I’m the one with the most experience in Python. We had been using Prefect which was going well before they moved to a paid model to use our own compute. Previously I had about 25 scripts that would launch at different times to my worker on our company server using prefect. It sadly has to be on my local instance of our server since they rely on something called Alteryx which our two data analysts use basically exclusively. I liked prefects UI but not the 100$ a month price tag. I don’t really have the bandwidth or good-will credits with our IT to advocate for the self-hosted version. I’ve been thinking of ways to mimic what we had before but I’m at a loss. I don’t know how to have something ‘talk’ to my local like prefect was when the worker was live. I could set up windows task scheduler but tbh when I first started I inherited a bunch of them and hated the transfer process/setup. My boss would also like to be able to see the ‘failures’ if any happen. We have things like bitbucket/s3/snowflake that we use to host code/data/files but basically always pull them down to our local/ inside Alteryx. Any advice would be greatly appreciated and I’m sorry for any incorrect terminology/lack of understanding. Thank you for any help!",

        "content": "Hi all, I'm looking for recommendations about data ingestion tools.We're currently using pentaho data integration for both ingestion and ETL into a Vertica DWH, and we'd like to move to something more flexible and possibly not low-code, but still OSS. Our goal would be to re-write the entire ETL pipeline (*), turning into a ELT with the T handled by dbt. For the 95% of the times we ingest data from MSSQL db (the other 5% from postgres or oracle). Searching this sub-reddit I found two interesting candidates in airbyte and singer, but these are the pros and cons that I understood: - airbyte: pros: support basically any input/output, incremental loading, easy-to-use cons: no-code, difficult to do versioning in git - singer: pros: python, very flexible, incremental loading, easy versioning in git cons: AFAIK does not support MSSQL ? Our source DBs are not very big, normally under 50GB, with a couple of exception >200-300GB, but we would like to have an easy way to do incremental loading. Do you have any suggestion? Thanks in advance(*) actually we would like to replace DWH and dashboards as well, we will ask about that soon",

Particularly when you don't have a mandate to implement a top-down master data management approach?Off the top of my head the solutions I've read are:1. Implement a top-down master data management approach. This authorizes you to compel the owners of the source data stores to conform their master data to some standard (e.g., everyone must conform to System X regarding the list of Departments)2. Implement some kind of mdm tool, which imports data from multiple systems, creates a \"master\" record based on the different sources, and serves as either a cross reference or updates the source system. Often used for things like customers. I would assume now MDM tools include some sort of LLM/Machine Learning to make better deicisions.3. within the data warehouse store build cross references as you detect anomalies (e.g, system X adds department \"Shops\" - there is no department \"Shops\", so you temporarily give this a unknown dimension entry, then later when you figure out that \"Shops\" is department 12345 add a cross reference and on the next pass its reassigned to 12345.4. force child systems to at least incorporate the \"owning\" systems unique identifier as a field (e.g, if you have departments then one of your fields must be the department id from System X which owns departments). then in the warehouse each of these rows ties to a different dimension, but since one of the columns is always the System X department ID, users can filter on that.Are there other design patterns I'm missing?",

Our approach is *not* to turn it on across the entire database—only on a small set of high-value tables.However, I’m running into some organizational pushback. There’s a general concern about performance degradation, but so far it’s been more of a blanket objection than a discussion grounded in specific metrics or observed issues.If you've enabled CDC on SQL Server:* What kind of performance overhead did you notice, if any?* Was it CPU, disk I/O, log growth, query latency—or all of the above?* Did the overhead vary significantly based on table size, write frequency, or number of columns?* Any best practices you followed to minimize the impact?Would appreciate hearing from folks who've lived through this decision—especially if you were in a situation where it wasn’t universally accepted at first.Thanks in advance!",

My hangup is that the old CRM is claiming that they have no way of doing any sort of massive data dump for us. They say in order to export all of that data, you have to do it using the export tool within the UI, which requires going to each individual job and exporting what you need. In other words, for every one of the 5000 jobs I would have to click into each of these Items and individually and download them.They don’t have an API I can access, so I’m trying to figure out a way to go about this programmatically and quickly before we get charged yet another month.

The goal is to get it modeled at the lowest granularity possible for dashboarding and future analytics (we don’t even have a proper gold layer yet).What I’ve done so far:•Went through all the reports and broke out the dimensions and measures•Found existing customer and product master tablesWhere I’m stuck:•Not sure how to map my dimensions/measures to target tables•How do I make sure it supports all report use cases without overengineering?Would really appreciate advice from anyone who’s done modeling in CPG.",

        "author": "eMperror_",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi,Our main OLTP database is an RDS Aurora Postgres database and it's working well but we need to perform some analytics queries that we currently do on a read replica but some of those queries are quite slow and we want to offload all of this to an OLAP or OLAP-like database. Most of our data is similar to a time-series so we thought of going with another Postgres instance but with Timescale installed to create aggregate functions. We mainly need to keep sums / averages / of historical data and timescale seems like a good fit for this.The problem I have is how can I keep RDS -> Postgres in sync? Our use-case cannot really have batched data because our services need this analytics data to perform domain decisions (has a user reached his daily transactions limit for example) and we also want to offload all of our grafana dashboards from the main database to Timescale.What do people usually use for this? Debezium? Logical Replication? Any other tool?We would really like to keep using RDS as a source of truth but offload all analytics to another DB that is more suited for this, if possible.If so, how do you deal with an evolving DDL schema over time, do you just apply your DB migrations to both DBs and call it a day? Do you keep a completely different schema for the second database?Our Timescale instance would be hosted in K8s through the CNPG operator.I want to add that we are not 100% set on Timescale and would be open to other suggestions. We also looked at Starrocks, a CNCF project, which looks promising but a bit complex to get up and running.",

        "author": "klenium",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Imagine that we have a pipeline and 100s of tasks inside it. Some tasks are depend on others so we can fill dependency trees. But not just one, as there are subsets of tasks that do not depend on any other subsets of tasks. So those subsets can run parallel (as without dependency connection they can be started immediately by the platform).I work in Databricks, which does not allow limiting the number of in-progress tasks at once. If there are too many in-progress tasks, the driver node may receive too large workload and crash.1. Upscale driver: I do not need this, I could wait for normal, slower, cheaper run.2. Add a normal dependency from the end of A subtree to the beginning of B subtree. This way I can limit the number of in-progress tasks, but if something in A fails, B will not start. Also it messes up lineage reporting.3. Same as #2 but the dependency type is All Done. The problem is that if something in A fails, B is started and if it finishes successfully, the pipeline hides the error from A.4. Create \"dummy tasks\" as checkpoints, connect 10 tasks to the first, checkpoint, connect another 10 ... This would kill the overall performance.5. Create separated workflows to all dependent subset of tasks, and use All Done connection type between them, and set up error reporting to the sub-workflows.6. Dynamically start tasks based on the current workload. This would add extra maintenance, manual dependency processing.Do you have any better solutions?",

I have no professional experience yet.But to be honest—I've been pushing myself really hard for the past few years, and I’m now at the edge of burnout. Recently, I've seen many Reddit posts saying the junior job market is brutal, the IT sector is struggling, and there's a looming threat from AI automation.I feel lost and mentally exhausted. I'm not sure if all this effort will pay off, and I'm starting to wonder if I should just enjoy my remaining time in the EU and then head back home.My questions are:1. Is there still a realistic chance for someone like me (zero experience, but good German skills and strong tech learning) to break into the German job market—especially in Data Engineering, Cloud Engineering, or even DevOps (I know DevOps is usually a mid-senior role, but still curious)?2.

        "content": "I'm working on some data pipelines for a new source of data for our data lake, and right now we really only have one path to get the data up to the cloud. Going to do some hand-waving here only because I can't control this part of the process (for now), but a process is extracting data from our mainframe system as text (csv), and then compressing the data, and then copying it out to a cloud storage account in S3.Why compress it? Well, it does compress well; we see around \\~30% space saved and the data size is not small; we're going from roughly 15GB per extract to down to 4.5GB. These are averages; some days are smaller, some are larger, but it's in this ballpark. Part of the reason for the compression is to save us some bandwidth and time in the file copy.So now, I have a spark job to ingest the data into our raw layer, and it's taking longer than I \\*feel\\* it should take. I know that there's some overhead to reading compressed .gzip (I feel like I read somewhere once that it has to read the entire file on a single thread first). So the reads and then ultimately the writes to our tables are taking a while, longer than we'd like, for the data to be available for our consumers.The debate we're having now is where do we want to \"eat\" the time:* Upload uncompressed files (vs compressed) so longer times in the file transfer* Add a step to decompress the files before we read them* Or just continue to have slower ingestion in our pipelinesMy argument is that we can't beat physics; we are going to have to accept some length of time with any of these options. I just feel as an organization, we're over-indexing on a solution. So I'm curious which ones of these you'd prefer? And for the title:",

Any access to Postgres data needs to happen through an intermediate mechanism that doesn’t expose raw tables.We’re trying to figure out the best way to enrich MySQL-based records with data from Postgres — especially for dashboards and read-heavy workloads — without duplicating or syncing large amounts of data unnecessarily.We use AWS in many parts of our stack, but not exclusively. Cost-effectiveness matters, so open-source solutions are a plus if they can meet our needs.Curious how others have solved this in production — particularly where data lives across systems, but clean, efficient enrichment is still needed without direct table access.",

Just a message that said “I trust you.”Now I can take ownership of any object in any workspace. I can drop tables I’ve never seen. I can break production in regions I don’t work in.And the only way I know how to create a Unity Catalog is by seizing control of the metastore and assigning it to myself. Because I still don’t have the CLI or SQL permissions to do it properly. And for some reason even as an account admin, I can't assign the CLI and SQL permissions I need to myself either. But taking over the entire metastore is not outside of the permissions scope for some reason. So I do it quietly. Carefully. And then I give the role back to the AD group.No one notices.

I also have a new appreciation for pointers. In fact, I’ve thought of C as a ‘low level’ language, but this makes you realize how much that language is doing for you under the hood.Basically: you start with a simple NAND logic gate and build your way up to making a functioning (Turing complete) computer. The content is all free, but you have to pay for the autograder + certificate, which is totally not necessary. I don’t know that I’d recommend this as an intro course for someone who’s never programmed, though you don’t technically need any programming knowledge. And I don’t know that I’d really recommend it if your number one goal is just to get a job. But if you actually want to improve as a programming, having a general understanding of these underlying systems will really really help.I don’t have any association with the course or anything, like I said, I think it’s probably a decade old (or more) at this point.

I began with BASIC and assembler on a C64, then I started working professionally with C/C++ then Visual Basic, Lotus Notes, .NET, C#, Java/Spring and now it's mostly JS, Node and React.I've never been attached to any particular language/technique but looked at what different platforms can offer. It took me quite some time to decide to move to fullstack web since I felt for a long time that web dev was like pounding a square peg through a round hole (and it still feels like that in some aspects), but the JS eco-system is fantastic these days. And JS truly runs everywhere.Something that's always amazed me is how some people like to spend their energy on bashing the new stuff that comes along. And it's always about focusing and exaggerating the negative sides. It has reached a point where I'm compelled to give new tech extra attention if it's heavily criticized by other programmers.Back in the day those who programmed Visual Basic where \"script kiddies\" and when React and Node came out it received tons of negative opinion only to dominate a few years later. So on this note I've lately focused on using AI as much as possible when programming. And I think it's bloody fantastic if used right. And by right I mean to let it do small well defined tasks and integrate into your app. Not prompt it to build an entire app so that you don't understand and can maintain the code.Especially CSS/Tailwind which I hate passionately. Just give the layout you want to the AI and let it grind until it looks right.I get that it can be tempting for new programmers to copy paste AI generated code they don't understand into a project, which is not a good idea. But the \"don't use AI if you're new is just silly in my opinion. A great aspect with AI is that you can have it explain programming concepts \"like I'm five\".

My university hasn’t provided much in terms of practical programming skills, and although I always knew I’d have to learn on my own, I kept postponing it.I’ve tried learning Java and Python through YouTube and documentation. I understand the syntax fairly well, but when it comes to actually building something, I freeze. I don’t know how to move from learning concepts to writing real code. It’s incredibly frustrating.Lately, I’ve started to feel like maybe I’m just not cut out for this. Like I’m too late, too slow, or just not smart enough. I constantly compare myself to others and feel like I’m falling behind.But despite all this, I still want to become a programmer. I’m not ready to give up. If anyone has advice—how to get unstuck, how to move from syntax to real coding—I’d be really grateful.Thanks.",

The most typical C# solution is: var guid = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(\"N\");This generates a 32 characters alpha-numeric ID which is supposedly truly unique (or is it?).I also want the Id to be as short as possible for reasons of storage efficiency and readability. How long does a randomly generated alpha-numeric GUID has to be in order to ensure it's collision-proof? If I pick the first 12-14 chars from the `guid` variable, will it still be collision-proof?",

Last year during my algorithm classes, I was able to write code myself (in C) and do well in oop(sadly it was taught in python so they didn't teach us much besides classes and basic stuff). The problem began when we were tasked of building an rpg game using a library we didn't know (pygame) in about a month. So I used AI a lot and since then I had been using Ai to code most of my stuff (even my personal projects). The problem began when we had a course where we had to build a full stack app in c# and angular. I made most of the project with Ai again, and was able to understand and explain it quite well. But when it came to do it myself, I found myself lost and didn't know what I should start by doing. I could only code when the steps were told to me clearly. So my question is, how do I relearn programming? Where do I start? From the beginning? I actually do enjoy creating stuff and I enjoy coding when I know what to do. I really want to work in this field (development in general) and I don't want to be incompetent when I have my bachelor's. Any advice?",

I felt proud., but nothing stays still so I wanted to improve more, but here it hit me I didn't have a goal nothing to look for not only in python, but in programming as a whole and didn't that only not make me know what to focus on, but also now I stopped feeling enthusiastic whenever somebody starts to say learn x I just feel ...tired exhausted and the worst part is that I like writing code I just have no goal no big grand goal.And keep in mind when I started to try to get better at python I chose to choose another language and kept bouncing between languages so that made my progress decrease a lot and probably was one of the biggest reasons is why I don't want to learn its because I just want to code.I am just here to whine if you want to help somehow do so I won't stop you and thanks, but I just did this because no one in my family could understand what I am saying so I decided to say it to people who will understand what I am talking about.if you have passed through this please helpthanks for hearing me ramble for this long.**UPDATE:**Hello,I wanted to end this on a happy note so here we areI just finished my first real projectits a todo list cli tool a proper cli tool made in python you could install it by following the instructions in the repo, sadly its only available on Linux and also don't expect much its just a normal todo list just for me to learn through it json, and making a proper project etcI would be very happy if anybody installed it but no pressurehere is the link[https://github.com/Omar-Arabi1/Todo\\_list\\_cli\\_tool?tab=readme-ov-file#](https://github.com/Omar-Arabi1/Todo_list_cli_tool?tab=readme-ov-file#)so yeah I found my way in the end and thanks to all of you for commenting or even caring and a big thanks to who installed the programsee you later",

It's about doing the application, giving the correct answer and leveling up which eventually awards you with chests that yield sitewide currencies/items you spend to keep going on. I didn't try them out yet but Codedex looks more of a gamified service.\"Holding hands\" approach was the point of criticism from what I saw and I can confirm although I can't critique the service on the method - there are times where a total beginner would be baffled.However, that's where their \"Socratic\" AI called Boots comes in - you can ask him questions and he will proceed to jog your memory by asking you new ones. That might be frustrating to some, especially in cases where you need an outright explanation to a part of the code that was not explicitly taught before.I did not feel outcasted while getting from zero to half way into Functions tutorials and this is a very good aspect. I respect vendors who do not entice by \"look at this amazing feature you are missing out since you are on free\" and rather convince you by proving their merits and generating the feeling that they are worth your financial support if you are able.I am from Turkey and I saw purchasing power parity discount on top of the promotion one so that's another plus for people like us who are crushed under their evil governments' poor management.I am in no way affiliated with [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) \\- I just felt I needed to pay my respects for offering a more-free-than-premium service who also care about where you are from. Programming-wise, I think there would be better people who are seasoned enough to comment on their curriculum and pace of progress.Cheers.",

I read in Turso's docs to store my auth token in a .env file and not to share it to GitHub... makes perfect sense.

I’ve been doing it in C++, because I have some experience using C and it was the fastest way to make ground and show some competence.But I’d really like to learn Rust, several others on the team are using it and overall I do think it’s the systems language of the future. I’ve never properly studied C++, and at the moment I’m basically writing idiomatic C with some standard library usage thrown in. So I’m kind of at a fork in the road - do I commit to learning proper, modern C++ development? Or do I try to learn Rust from scratch and become competent enough in that to work through this internship?Let me know your guys’ thoughtsThanks!",

I just graduated from high school and will be starting university soon, studying IT (programming, networking, etc.).I’ve explored different areas of programming, but only on a surface level. I enjoy backend development, especially working with PHP and databases. I also had fun working with a robotic arm using C++ and a Raspberry Pi, and I enjoyed making small games in Unity, which got me a bit into C#. However, I don’t really know how to build full applications with it.In general, I’m really interested in how things work “under the hood” — how data flows, how systems communicate, what’s happening in the background. But on the other hand, I absolutely dislike frontend development and UI/UX design.The problem is, I don’t know where to go from here. I don’t have a clear path. I enjoy several things but haven’t gone deep into any of them.So my question is:\\-What would you recommend I do next?\\-Should I focus on one language?Is there a particular field I should explore based on my interests?\\-How did you personally figure out what direction to take in your programming journey?Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I like the simplicity of it, the separation from my main files(in some manner) and all the bash stuff. I have two monitors. One I dedicate to the tutorials(windows side, because the VM runs videos and other things slowly) and the other I dedicate to all my practice and coding and all that. This has worked well for me so far, but I would like to know if this will cause me issues in the future.All my writing files for this project are in google docs or libreoffice, the former because I tend to write on a laptop away from home and need a way to keep it synced. Most of my non-coding development for this project happens on windows, as well as other things like browsing or playing games. My question is this: should I plan to scoot over to Linux permanently at some point? Should I dual boot? Should I plan to transfer my knowledge to Windows after this course is finished(Odin project, of course)? Should I dual boot? If the answer to these are “personal preference” I am completely okay with that. I am just seeking guidance, know the pros and cons for my situation, and I do not need Linux for the purpose of being marketable for companies(which is what people mention whenever this question comes up online, for good reason.)",

It’s relatively well paid, but the role is more IT-focused, mainly client support and troubleshooting and doesn’t really involve coding or development.This would be my first internship out of the 3 required by my co-op program, but since this one is 8 months long, it would count as 2 out of 3. That’s part of what’s making this decision tough.On one hand: •It’s paid •I’d get solid work experience and build professional soft skills •I wouldn’t be left with an empty termBut on the other hand: •It’s not aligned with the software/dev path I want to pursue •I’m worried it won’t be the most relevant or impactful experience in the long run •I don’t want it to push me into an IT support career trajectory by defaultI’m also nervous about declining and not finding anything else. I’ve applied to a lot of places already, but nothing else has worked out yet, this one came unexpectedly.Has anyone else been in a similar spot? Is it better to take it just to have something, or should I hold out for something more aligned with development?Really appreciate any insight.",

I'm middle aged, semi retired, but am bored and want to do something new with my life. Learning to code and hopefully getting a job as a developer is what I'm aiming for. I know the job market for developers is miserable right now, but it's miserable for lots of other non tech folks too. I also know that AI will replace some tech jobs, but as AI evolves, I have to think new human roles in tech will evolve too. Is there a snowball's chance in hell that a middle aged junior developer can get a job? I'll even take a low-level remote coding job. I don't care. I just want in. Any additional advice would be greatly appreciated. I'd love to pursue this but if it's pipe dream odds, I'd rather know about it before getting into it. Thanks.",

I’m in a skilled trade now and to be honest my body and degenerative back issues won’t sustain that for the next 20 years.

        "content": "Hello. I'm here to ask for some tips and advices for both personal and carrier growth. Some years ago, after university, I had to start from beginning to change my work carrier and for the first time, I've approached to the coding world. I love it. I took a master in data science, then I continued to study, c# and unity for game developer. I was hired as data scientist but few months later, the project ended and I was moved in another segment in the same society, as solution architect, with something that really wasn't suit for me. So, I spent some months for a master in devops and I finally could ask to change another team, this time in a team of integration. My team works as middle ware, and I could learn a lot about microservices, api, Aws tools and such that we have as infrastructure. So, I decided to stop trying to learn from others and start study, again, in order to have a robust knowledge of the entire process, end to end. So, with the chance to see how some lambda function (Aws) was integrated into other tools, I asked to write a new one that was needed for a new application. Following all pipeline and integrate it into cloud watch. Was a good work (both cause I used cdk libraries, but mostly cause I saw how pipelines really work in production, as a player and not just spectator). But in the end, the more I learn, the more I find out new stuff, that probably should have been discovered ten years ago at the university. So, right now, I'm trying to study about spring boot and Java, nodejs, maven, camel and how to make whole works together, in order to write good api/web app. Now, I feel full of stuff I don't know, and in my future I would like to have the chance to work as software dev, solution architect or whatever, cause I feel like all these worlds overlap somehow, somewhere.That said, I kindly ask for some suggestions:1)where should I start?2)what should I prioritize? 3)im not gonna lie, I'm using a lot chatgpt or Claude to study, like asking focused questions, like usage, best practice, asking for exercises and dig down every time I have a doubt, but, because I always been a self taught in this world, I have no idea if there are books, documentations or whatever that can be exhaustive and valid.I know can be confusing, but I'm very confused right now. The moment in your life when you realize you know enough to be where you are, but not enough to go much further. Thanks for your time",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "First of all I'll give some context:Website is made using a template in HTML, CSS and JS. Its hosted on Vercel with a custom domain. Its not a static website and uses a server behind the scenes for stuff like \"serving\" the html files from a public folder and contact.html so that people that visit the website can send us messages (That's also why its not hosted on Github). It uses NodeJS, ExpressJS and other Javascript libraries for having the server capabilities. Now I have not really studied and worked on ExpressJS and all but I was able to vibe-code it (I know I'm sorry but its my dad that wanted the website really quick).Fast forward to present day and my dad wants a blog page in the website. Now I asked copilot in VSCode to do do it for me but turns out it got really complicated. I setup a database schema in supabase connected to vercel and then it started spewing out all these lines of code that didn't work at all and I got confused. (`POST /api/blog`, `GET /api/blog` etc)So what my dad wants is that he should be able to make posts preferably with images and thats it. When I first heard of it, I thought maybe he would also like people to be able to comment and like on posts as well. Well he has clarified that he just wants the first part only. Now the thing is how should I go about it. I have 2 choices:1. Use something like what copilot gave me (Use GET methods along with response and requests) (Gonna have to learn it from YT tutorials and docs since \"AI slop\")2. Create a simple posts.json file and loading the posts from that website using JS script. (Only issue would be how to add images in a json file; maybe base64 encoding would work; base64 is quite heavy though). And then create a Flutter app that allows my dad to create, edit and delete posts and when he clicks on submit, it would automatically get pushed onto my vercel repository in production.First approach seems better to make it look like a proper production application whereas the second approach is a just a make-shift thingWhich one do you think I should work on? And if there's something you'd like to add, please tell me.PS: I'm more of a machine learning kind of guy and not frontend and all",

        "content": "I’ve been a programmer for most of my life. I started with PHP, which I worked with for around 10 years.Eventually, I wanted to level up. I began reading more and more about design patterns and techniques like generics and other advanced concepts. When the opportunity came along, I made the switch to Go. However, I never quite got used to the syntax—it felt a bit old-school, with very short and cryptic naming conventions. After more than a year, when I was offered a job working with C# I decided to switch again.Unfortunately, that company turned out to be a poor fit. They refused to adopt modern patterns, and the codebase was in a terrible state. And after six months, I moved on to another C# role, hoping for a better experience. But again, the codebase was a mess, and the work was split roughly 75% frontend and 25% backend.Since I had to work on the frontend, I started learning TypeScript. I really enjoyed many of the concepts and examples I came across while learning it, but sadly, the actual codebase I worked with didn’t reflect any of that what I learned and there was no room or time to improve that was already there.For the full picture: in addition to my 40-hour work week, I would often spend another 40 hours learning and building proof of concepts. You could say programming was my life.I started doubting if it wasn’t time to do something else and when another type of job came along I stepped off the programming wagon. I expected I would get my enjoyment in programming back in the hours that I used to make besides my work, but instead I just stopped programming all together.Now more then 2 years further I’m willing to pick it up in my sparetime again.But i don’t want to do course after course. I’m also not really sure what language I want to pick up. Not what to build.The main advantage of typescript is that I can write frontend and backend code with it. I could pick up c# or even try f# (always loved the functional syntax). I could go back to php? Or maybe try out rust or elixer? Just thinking about it makes me want to quit again? So maybe I’m not ready to pick it up again.I wonder if anyone has some advice to break out of this? Although I do enjoy my current job. I do want to get back into software development eventually.",

Express. Need sockets? Socket.io. And so on.This makes it really easy tod develop application quickly and unfortunately that's all that an organisation would care for too.In my resume if someone sees a chat application, they don't care if I implemented the web socket architecture or I just used a library. They may ask that stuff in an interview and still not mind that I used a library.Now, I have found out that, that I'm really dumb. I had been using web servers for an year in JS and only recently I figured out the entire architecture when I had to build an HTTP server from scratch in C. It has been a huge challenge and still is.I also learnt how to implement an event loop. But would any company care about these skills if I don't have any decent project? I don't think so.But, keeping my own subjective thinking and personal experiences aside, I had a doubt.If I learn how to apply a concept without first trying to understand it completely, is this a good strategy?Like because I learnt Express, I had an easy time creating macros for implementing routes in my C HTTP server. I just imitated a syntax similar to that in C.On the other hand, had I never used Express, I don't think my abstraction of routes would be like the way Express has and don't know if it would have been this good which it is now.So, clearly the learning of the application helps the learning of architecture just as much as learning the architecture helps learning the application.With this, what do you suggest:- Learn application first, no matter how you do it.- Learn architecture first and then design your own and learn application through that instead of a simply using libs.- A mid ground, learn architecture, learn application using whatever tool is necessary and then if one wishes, one can design their architecture from scratch as well.",

I am a little more confident in this, in that off the top of my head the following are potential grounds can elevate a basic project to a more advanced and portfolio worthy one:1. Usage of (appropriate) design patterns2. Scalability, and performance considerations3. Big O complexity considerations and usage of relevant, appropriate data structures4. Inclusion of additional functionality, so if I had a to do app, including it to be available on mobile/cloud (such as using streamlit from python) would elevate it5. Real world/life functionality, such as expansion of use cases to encompass practical, business domains and situations.6. A project that is specific/applicable to a specific domain, such as an anti-money laundering detection project within banking, or fraud detection within a commercial website/ banking7. Good code practices: clean, concise, modular code, with adherence to principles such as Single Responsibility Principle for functions, usage of seperation of concerns, abstracting data from logic8. actually including a well-written README file that details the functionality and use cases associated with the project within the git/github repository, with appropriate commenting of novel/atypical processes within the program.9. Adherence and implemention of SOLID principles, and generally high rates of cohesion and low rates of coupling.",

Now I admit that this is probably the sole challenge on writing code, but I am looking for suggestions from the community that has much more experience than me. Code-focused questions-What should be my approach for readability?-Should I prefer to separate the aspects of the logic into separate modules or subroutines/functions?Tutorial-focused questions-Should I write a tutorial on Word with screenshots?-Should I screen record myself explaining the logic?-Is unreadability inevitable if they don’t have a coding background?Just looking for advice, any resources would be appreciated as well.

I used Chatgbt to generate some parts of the code. But I like the uk fixing and correcting the design. I Just don't know sometimes I just want to full send front-end but coding especially backend throws me off.I have about 6 months before I graduate. I need to figure my life out.

What if that object is a variable size (like it contains an array, etc.)? What if the object is too small for the buffer, or too large?I'm on this path as I'm trying to learn how to process data as it is read, such as when you need to process very large files and waiting to read the entire thing at once is infeasable, or do work on data very quickly. And it would be good to know more than just \"File.ReadLines()\" or \"File.ReadAllText()\" (or the equivelent in other languages).",

In the past year or so, most of my students have been software developers, and I have really enjoyed teaching you guys. And this has meant that I have shifted to focusing primarily on Software Developers. (Just so you understand the background) And I want to know what it is that you find most difficult working in an English-speaking environment?My observations so far have been: 1. If you have to explain something technically, then generally it is ok. But if you have to explain something technical to a non-technical person, it is a bit harder. 2. Talking in stand-ups is generally fine, but sometimes you find that you use the same words or phrases every time. 3. Asking questions and knowing when to ask questions is difficult. 4. Listening, especially when there are native speakers, provides some challenges. By the time you understand something, the topic has moved on. 5. Humour is always a problem (in my opinion, it is not just a language thing but a cultural thing) 6. General conversations are sometimes the hardest to follow. 7. Phrasal verbs (phrasal verbs are everywhere with native speakers) 8. Giving feedback, how direct is too direct or was I too indirect? So... those are some of my observations. Do you have any others, anything specific? I want to be the best teacher I can be for my students. And I have been trying to learn Python just so that I have some form of understanding about what it is that you need to be able to communicate.

I've been teaching myself to code for the last 7 months (great timing, I know). At first I was just doing it for fun, but then it became one of the more meaningful parts of my life. I used to think I liked finance, but really I just liked saying \"stonks go up\". By contrast coding is predictable, controllable, you eventually can figure out where you f\\*cked up, and how you can improve. It's a kind learning environment. And in that there is peace. But I feel like I was just about 2-3 years too late on that realization. A couple months ago, I was very confident I could make it as a professional developer. Now I don't know. There's a lot of fear-mongering and apocalyptic prophesying going on. Some say AI is going to wipe out junior dev jobs. Some say there will still be plenty of demand but you’ll need to be more senior-level faster. And junior postings are way down. Layoffs everywhere.How the heck are we supposed to know what to focus on, when everything's up in the air?I've done alot of research and experimenting with all these roles, some thoughts: * **Front-end** / **Web Design** \\- S.O.L* **Full-stack** \\- somewhat better, but very generalist skillset* **Back-end -** pretty good open vis-a-vis AI defenseability, good way to niche-up* **Cloud** / **DevOps** \\- clearest path to employment, good balance of supply/demand* **MLE / MLOps** \\- highest demand, but very low base pool, and I don’t have a stats/ML background* **Blockchain** \\- thought about it given my finance background but very sketch * **Data Science / ML** \\- did a bootcamp, not fan of stats Exploring all of these definitely set me back on the web stack, but I did finish The Odin Project, the first half of Full Stack Open (Core Course, 5 credits), and partially through a milion other courses on Scrimba, freeCodeCamp, Udemy, [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev), Coursera, etc. I'm also considering a master’s to hedge my bets, hoping that by the time I come out the other end in 2-3 years, the markets will have settled. No idea if worth it, but on the other hand grinding projects feels pointless with the current freeze on junior hires. So my question is this. What path should I focus on as a self-taught dev with no degree, in this brutal market for junior devs? Should I target back-end, cloud, or something like MLOps? Is a master’s a smart move, or should I double down on projects and networking? Any advice would be mucho appreciated, thanks!",

I mean, i want to be on my own, May be the field isn't for me? Because before i spend 1-2 years studying something, i want to know is there any prospects for me? Will i be able to launch my own firm doing this? Will i be able to make a good quality product a website for example for a business owner or is programming a team job, not for a solo worker? Thx for the answers, I'm sorry if the question is stupid. Added: also I've checked freelance platforms such as upwork and fivver. A bot for 3$, a site costs 15$ . Are they real prices? Are you all studying programming to land a job in the end?",

I have a dependancy upon these tools which i now find constrain my ability to write fresh code. Am i doing something wrong in programming? Ive been at this on and off for the past 3/4 years and i just cannot retain specific functions and libraries languages need to make some programs, and it makes me feel useless as a programmer. How could i transition from where i am currently to progress further.I have never touched programming books or any biographies, i have only previously tried to get inspiration from others code, developing off examples on libraries and writing stuff, getting to a point where i am stuck and reverting to AI, baffling my flow and resulting in lacks of motivation where i am supposed to be in control of software im writing, but it takes over and becomes another sequence of hoops i need to jump through to even get anywhere.Any feedback towards my situation would help me so much, im looking forward to spending an extended period over the summer to try to become the best i can be, an end goal trying to create a product with some revenue so i can fund a community project that ive wanted to do for a while.

I have to learn it while working, i really don't have time to be learning things i don't need.

Here is how I would break it down.1. **Understand the problem first (3 mins)** \\- restate it back, walk through examples, ask about constraints.2. **Don't code immediately (5 mins)** \\- discuss approaches starting with brute force, explain why it's bad, then work up to optimal solution. DO NOT IMPLEMENT THE BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION. You don't have time for that.3. **Get buy-in (10 mins)** \\- make sure interviewer agrees with your approach before coding. I write pseudocode comments first as an outline, then flesh it out. A common failure pattern is coding something that the interviewer doesn't understand.4. **Wrap up (2 mins)** \\- explain time/space complexity, offer to write tests for edge cases, or move on to the next problem.**How I prepared:*** Use Blind 75. It has good coverage over all problems.* I DID NOT buy leetcode premium. If you study and understand the patterns, it doesn't matter what problem you get.I know the market is ass right now and the competition is rough, but stay disciplined and the hard work will pay off!

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "95% of this subreddit is people complaining about the job market or AI. The remaining 5% of actual advice is straight up garbage and completely outdated. Thought I would help out by making a list of things that will greatly improve your job searchAs a background, I have 6 years of Software Engineering experience and have worked with people of many backgrounds. I have never worked at FAANG, went to a mediocre school with mediocre grades, never had an internships or anything like that. But I have also never been unemployed. This isn't for the .1% of people, this is for the common CS man (or woman). And if you were asking, I'm a U.S. citizen in the U.S. market. If you are neither of those this probably won't apply to you.With that out of the way here's what I have gathered from my experience:**1. Apply to local/hybrid jobs in non-tech hubs.** Your goal is to reduce competition as much as possible. When I first started I would literally filter jobs on linkedIn to states nobody wanted to live in, like Ohio. You will be given jobs in locations that people don't even know exist. A lot of them have barely any applicants. If they are desperate enough they will hire you. Another tip would be to update your resume to have your location be within the same area, since companies might filter you if you are located too far away**2. Make sure your resume is concise.** When I review resumes I hate ones that have tons of wordy bullet points that basically say nothing. Don't dilute your resume with crap. Most people have 1-2 important projects they have worked on at a company and a bunch of filler work. Just focus on the important stuff and make sure it is clear what you actually did. Also PLEASE do not use arbitrary percentages in your bullet points. I hate this advice so much just put what you actually worked on. It doesn't matter how the business benefitted we all know that is the point of work.**3. Similar to 2, make sure your technical skills are concise** If you put every tool or technology it looks like you have very little experience in lots of things. Focus on putting skills that are needed for the job you are applying to. Another easy approach is to take the skills you are best at (say React), and filter only for jobs with React. Then do the same thing with Angular etc.**4. If you don't have any experience (or limited) YOU NEED TO DO PROJECTS** You need some way to show that you have some sort of technical knowledge or drive. You don't need a github, but you should have projects that you can explain how they work. This is especially crucial for internships. My company just hired an intern that was the CEO/Cofounder of a startup. Her startup? Building websites with other students for various people. Sounds stupid, but it got her an internship.**5. Just straight up fucking lie** I don't want to endorse this, but I just want people to know who they are competing with when they send out 500 applications without a response. We hired someone who had experience as a software engineer. But they accidentally told me they were a QA at their last role. I checked their linked in and they were listed as a software engineer. So yeah, if you work in tech support, QA, product. Doesn't matter, you were a software engineer**6. Same as number 5** This is more reasonable in my opinion because recruiters are stupid. If you have React experience and applying to a job with Angular, congrats - you actually have Angular experience. Same with Java and C# etc. The important thing is you are able to actually pass an interview for this stuff. It is worth it to review core concepts and maybe do a few leetcode problems in that language. At the end of the day you need a job**7. Interview advice: be honest but not too honest** When I was interviewing for a job I wanted they asked me a common interview question about a time I failed. So I told them a real story about how I messed up getting requirements and caused a delay in the release. I didn't get this job. The next job I applied to asked the same question, so I told the same story but rephrased it where product threw a bunch of requirements at me last minute and I had to work overtime to get things across the finish line. I did get this job. You get the idea**8. Do not negotiate** There's a lot of people on this sub that will scold you for not negotiating. But I have seen first hand peoples' offers get rescinded for negotiating, especially in this market. Just accept the damn offer once you get to this stage. Every job I've gotten when I negotiate I got $5k more on top of the initial offer which is not worth risking losing an offer over. I simply asked if there was any wiggle room and they gave me basically the same offer**9: For students: do not waste your time** Seriously, start applying/working on projects as early as you can. Grades hardly matter. I knew a dumb kid that had a 4.0. It didn't make a difference when it came to getting a job. He could have spent some of his time studying instead building a react app or something and gotten a 3.7 and been better off. Take as many easy classes as possible and focus on learning on your own time. Most CS classes I've taken taught be .01% of my current CS knowledge**10: Make sure everything is up to date, even when employed** Keep your resume up to date with your latest experience. Try to check LinkedIn/Indeed once a week or so. I've seens job boards get flooded with really good jobs one week, which all get removed the next. You never know when that next opportunity is going to be available so it's good to always be looking.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’m really terrible at Reddit formatting, so this will probably seem like a blob of text. So many people are incorrectly saying that AI is the driving reason for the mass layoffs, non-hiring, and the downward trend of anything software development related. AI is a _contributing_ factor to the *difficulty* of getting hired at entry level positions at companies, but that’s a standard bar push. But what’s *truly* influencing the mass layoffs, hiring freezes, and shrinking investment into developing proprietary and innovative technologies in America isn’t AI. It’s a tax credit rewrite that was never supposed to take effect. Law and legislation is boring, but this piece specifically, is important for all of you. It impacts your life, your industry, how you’re paid, what the Chief Financial Officer sees and uses to justify paying you six figures, and your tax rebates if you’re planning to start or work in a startup.I’m going to lay out the facts in a (hopefully) objective way. The credit I’m talking about:The Research and Development Tax Credit under IRC Tax Code 174. EDIT: Edits will be for formatting. The law that changed it:The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (specifically under section 13206). This provision was initially drafted by Kevin Brady (R-TX), and advocated significantly for by Republican lawmakers. The House of Representatives vote:227 Republicans For13 Republicans Against0 Democrats For192 Democrats AgainstThe Senate vote:51 Republicans For0 Republicans Against0 Democrats For47 Democrats, and 2 Independents Against The final result:Signed into law by President Donald Trump on December 22, 2017. Date it took effect:January 1, 2022Why so late?A fun, gimmicky workaround to the Byrd Rule and to delay costly tax hikes until after the 5-year mark, while cashing in on any revenue after the 10-year mark. In short, it was a play to look fiscally responsible, but didn’t provide any tax cuts. It just kicked the can down the road and offset immediate tech conglomerate backlash. They assumed that this provision would be removed or indefinitely delayed by future Congress, but they didn’t. Previous:Prior to 2022, businesses were able to immediately (same year tax break) cash in and deduct R&D expenses, including software developer and other IT professionals’ salaries, IT infrastructure changes, engineer innovation in all sectors, and more. After 2022:All of the expenses covered by the R&D credit now has to be capitalized and amortized. For domestic research, they are required to amortize over 5 years. For foreign research, they are required to amortize over 15 years. Meaning that, prior to 2022, a $1M investment into software development and cyber security would be fully deductible for fiscal year 22. Now, that same $1M investment into those same fields would only allow for $200k to be deductible for the fiscal year, and the remaining $800k would need to be spread out over the remaining four.Which resulted in layoffs, frozen hiring, cash flow strain for startups and tech firms, and immediate tax burden on companies employing R&D-based that persists to today. BUT! There is a bipartisan bill that’s going through Congress right now to reverse it and retroactively apply the lost tax credits back to businesses from 2021 forward, but we’ll see where it goes!",

Going through all their code and infrastructure and internal tooling, I've come to realize that the projects I've built at home are nothing even remotely close to this.Honestly I think I didn't clarify enough, my point is that coding your hobby resume project won't really prepare you at all for working in big tech. What I mean by this is : A hobby project is exactly that a small, self contained app with limited scope. You’re not trying to build an enterprise-grade solution, nor are you expected to. And unless you’ve already worked in the industry, you likely have no idea what enterprise development even *looks* like.One Google search will throw you into a rabbit hole of 20 unfamiliar technical keywords, and suddenly you’re trying to engineer a business-scale architecture for a portfolio project. It’s not realistic and it creates a false impression of what actual preparation looks like.\"",

I am glad to have worked in tech as it provided me with more than enough wealth to have retired long ago. I have decided I will get a bachelors in nursing and then eventually become an NP to work in healthcare as a way for fulfillment. I debated about medical school but being this old it’s a daunting task just due to the time commitment as I do want to spend quality time with family. Has anyone made this leap and regretted it?

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I joined a startup about a year ago, fresh out of grad school. I was really excited. My role was to explore how we could use large language models and build AI systems to improve our content and automate workflows. I was mostly a backend engineer, creating APIs, and I loved it.A little while ago, our CEO suddenly decided our company needs to be \"AI first\". On the surface, that sounds great for someone in my role. But the execution is becoming a nightmare. Any complex technical challenge I bring up gets dismissed with a wave of his hand and a simple, \"Oh yeah just write a prompt and develop it fast\".We are now in a phase where we are actively breaking things that already work perfectly fine, just to rebuild them the \"AI way\". The logic seems to be that if it doesn't use a large language model, it's obsolete, which makes no sense.The worst part, however, is what this has done to my job. The CEO now expects every engineer to own the entire product process from start to finish. This means we are all now responsible for writing long product requirement documents, creating wireframes, coding the frontend, developing the backend APIs, and then deploying and integrating everything ourselves.I chose a career in engineering specifically because I did not enjoy product management. Now, it's a core part of my job. And when concerns are raised about the massive new workload and lack of experience in these areas, the response is just, \"Oh yeah just use ChatGPT to write the document\".My work feels less meaningful every day. I went from being a specialized engineer working on interesting AI problems to a generalist doing a bit of everything, without any real depth or focus. My passion for coding and building robust systems is fading. It feels like my actual engineering skills are being devalued in favor of someone who can just prompt an AI for a passable solution to everything.Is this what the future of tech work looks like? Are other companies operating this way?",

How can you plan to make major life decisions like starting a family knowing you can lose your job at any time and potentially be unemployed for months. Many people are rightfully angry about it but blaming the wrong causes. It’s true that offshoring is caused by far lower salaries in other countries but we don’t look any deeper than that. We assume it’s a good thing because the US is a “rich” country and assume everyone else is extremely poor and desperate. We ignore that we have a huge cost of living crisis primarily driven by our insane housing costs no where higher than in Silicon Valley. The primary cause of our high housing costs are nationwide restrictive zoning laws that prevent the supply of housing from meeting the demand and making it extremely difficult and expensive to build anything. r/yimby has great discourse on this issue if you want to learn more. It’s impossible for Americans to compete because we would literally be homeless if we were paid equivalent salaries in the countries they are offshoring.

Now that I’m looking to see how’s the market, I’m terrified since it seems very bad. So my question is, is the CS job market really this terrible? Am I better off hoping I don’t get layoff’d? I think 7 month is pretty decent to find a new job, I would be looking at NYC or DC but can move anywhere tbh. What would y’all do in my position? I’m trying to make a decision within a week and is so hard!Thanks y’all!TLDR: layoffs very likely to happen, however still a chance it doesn’t occur. Earn six figures and like my job. Is the CS job market really bad for mid-level devs? Do you recommend taking 7 months pay and look for new job or is the market very terrible and I’m better off risking it and staying?",

I'm tired of the stress, of having to figure out why some model isn't performing as it should. It feels like such a chore. Also I'm pretty much alone on working on projects, I feel like I have way too much responsibility. Sure I can ask help but still.I feel like I'm so done having to solve hard problems all the time, not sure if I will even be able to solve them.I'm kind of fantasizing about just working on a farm at this point. (I know that's silly).Does anyone have advice for what to do? What kind of jobs to look for?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I've helped a lot of students & early-career folks with job hunting, and one fear comes up all the time: **networking**. So many people are scared they'll say the wrong thing, or that their message will just get ignored.Totally get it! I've been there too. But based on what I’ve seen from job seekers who’ve actually landed roles (including some who started with zero connections), here are some tips that really work:**1. Start with a 15 min coffee chat**Don’t overthink it. You’re not asking for a job. You’re just asking for 15 minutes to get to know the other person’s position. Most professionals remember what it felt like in the beginning, and they’re happy to help.You can say something like, “Hi \\[name\\], I’m currently studying \\[major\\] and exploring career paths in \\[field\\]. If you’d like to chat with me for 15 minutes, I’d love to hear about your experiences.”**2. Build rapport: \\~2 min**Don’t jump right into the subject. Start by warming up with a friendly opening line:“How are you doing today?”“Hope you’re having a great week, thank you for your time!”It’s a small thing, but it can create a relaxed atmosphere and make both parties feel more comfortable.**3. Introduce yourself: 2-3 min**Keep it brief and to the point. Think of it like your LinkedIn verbal summary.“I’m currently a Data Analytics student at \\[school\\] and I’m really interested in marketing analytics. I’ve worked on projects with A/B testing and Tableau dashboards, and I’d love to learn more about what careers in this field really look like.”Confidence comes from clarity of thought: if you know what you want, you’ll be ten times more confident when you speak your mind.**4. Ask two good questions: \\~10 min**This is where you learn. Try:“What do you like most (and least) about your job?”“How did you get into this field?”“If you graduated today, what would you focus on?”Avoid asking generic questions like “How is your company?” Just try to show curiosity and depth.**5. Follow up consistently**Send a quick thank you note and ask if they’d like to stay in touch. That’s it. Relationships are developed through follow-up, not one-off chats.**Tips:**\\- If you don't hearing back so far: Try alumni, smaller companies, or people who are 1-3 years ahead of you. They’re often more responsive than FAANG executives.\\- Feeling nervous all the time? Write a pitch and practice it with a friend before the actual chat.\\- Keep a spreadsheet of who you reached out to, when, and what you learned.So if you’re afraid of networking, you’re not alone. I’ve been there. Take the first step and you’ll be pleasantly surprised at where it leads.Has anyone else networked their way into your first job? How did you succeed?",

Between the low pay at both companies and all this stress, I'm burned tf out.At this point, I genuinely despise cybersecurity, software development, and even the data science BS I'm learning at university. I've got multiple offers from banks and other solution companies in both fields with way better pay, but I feel paralyzed. I don't want to screw over the companies that gave me my first opportunities at such a young age. I want to leave on good terms, but I'm stuck.Honestly not sure what to do anymore. Maybe therapy? **TLDR:** 3 years in IT across pentesting/DevOps while in college, completely burned out despite good opportunities. Lost all passion but feel guilty about leaving companies that gave me my start.",

I previously worked in sales, and decided I needed to pivot (to a field I was passionate about) about two years ago. Worked pretty hard to learn programming, got a BSCS at WGU (bleh, I know) and here I am. The tech stack is mostly a mix of very old Java applications and some newer React stuff. Seems like devs are kind of doing it all - front end, back end, testing, you name it! It's fun and I've been exposed to a lot off cool technologies. I've mostly been doing the typical entry level guy stuff - add a GUI option to automate this database change we get hit with a lot, learn our no/low code platform and help us convert legacy apps to it, help us change this PDF export, all that kind of stuff. A few apps we maintain are getting moved to the cloud over the next year, and I've expressed interest with the managers in helping with that. Overall, it seems really laid back and everyones being extremely helpful as I learn and giving me more than enough time (and space) to do everything. I'm in a LCOL area, and the job is hybrid (2 days a week in office), I get great health insurance, and I'm just really thankful to have a job! Honestly, I love it. My coworkers are great, everyones so chill, it's a laid back environment, an absolute dream to me coming out of my last job. That being said, pay is on the low end of the scale ($60,000) and I get it - I have no practical experience. I'm ok with starting here and taking a pay cut from my last role, but I do have ambition. I'm worried that I'm not gaining experience on new and cool tech stacks, I'm worried about the no code app conversions. I want to grow, and level up my income. What are some things I should be doing to make the most of this opportunity?",

When I started working, things were a bit different I am required to go twice a week (any that I choose tho) and I do have to work from 8 to 5. I just coped with it and started working accepting the new conditions, I was happy, I usually disconnect at 5pm and study German and do some certifications so I can improve at my job :) I had no clear, measurable goals but I didn’t mind it, after all, I am completely new to the labor market. I got assigned to basically help out a senior who didn’t quite give me much responsibility, I did some architectural initiatives and digital transformation little projects fitting for an intern job. But he didn’t give me a lot of them and mostly told me to help out with documentation, which I didn’t mind that much because after all it is necessary. Never had a bad feedback, I even presented all I worked on to my boss and she told me that all was rly good and if I was comfortable in the company which I responded to with a yes. HR decided to call me two weeks ago to tell me that I wasn’t gonna have my contract renewed because they asked my boss and she told them no because I lacked “motivation”, they were even impressed with me not knowing my boss had felt this. I felt like it was totally my fault but bit by bit I am thinking I am not the one that did everything wrong and that it is completely my fault. Also, we have a new boss (boss of my boss) and this guy totally skips my direct boss to text me always outside working hours (once it was 6 pm, another at 7 and the most recent was a message this Friday at 9pm) which I always reply at 8am in the morning, and he never replies until he just texts me days after after working hours once again, am I wrong here?

On the other other hand, I'm single. I currently live in 1500 square feet for $1600/month, my car doesn't get that much more expensive, and I buy nice toys that get 4% more expensive in California than not California. Sales tax. If I had a family, this would be insane, but I've always been working too hard not to get fired to ever go on a date.

        "content": "I need some advice.I left a job where I was working for 10 months due to toxic leadership, it was literally making me sick. I started a new one at a company that I heard amazing things about, how everyone was great and how leaders were super supportive, I was genuinely excited.I started in January, onboarding was a bit messy but eventually I figured it out, I had my first oficial feedback session on 09.04, all positive, a few things to improve but the official document statement said that I was on track to complete my 6 months probation. Ever since that feedback I didn’t have any other official feedback, my manager and I talked about projects, I worked on improving what I had to improve, all our conversations were positive. There was going to be a offsite next week - well this is still happening, but I’m won’t be there - where my manager were telling me things and activities for the team. She doesn’t live at the same city that I do, so Tuesday (10.06) was the first time we’ve met in person, we talked about the offsite, she was very friendly and then, Wednesday, on our regular 1:1, not even like a separate meeting, she says that I did not completed it the requirements and therefore I was no longer at the company. I asked for examples of what was wrong, she didn’t tell me, I asked why she didn’t say it before, she had 02 months to provide more feedback saying what was not working and helping me in what I needed, I mean, is her job too, she invested time, money and energy to hire and train me but ,she didn’t say anything either. It was a stab in my back, it is astonishing how someone can be so cold. I honestly have no idea, I’m reliving all my steps and I can’t find something or a little somethings that led to this. I even thought that it could have been homophobia, I’m bi and since this is pride month, when we met I was wearing some pride apparel, but I think this is a stretch.Now I’m here, on my CV there is a 10 month job and now a 5 months job and I’m thinking I’ll never find a place again cause who would hire someone like this? I am really lost, do HR really care so much if you look like a job hopper?For context I have a little over 10 years experience in performance marketing/tech and jobs where I stayed almost 4 years but still, this looks so bad. I’m also in Germany if that makes any difference",

        "author": "Valuable_Mall228",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I graduated 3 years ago, it's a bit of a personal story, and one that I'm honestly not sure how to share with an employer but here it is (the story can be skipped as I don't know if it's relevant to my situation, regardless of why, I haven't been employed in industry for 3 years):At around the time of my graduation date I stumbled across the Amber Heard Johnny Depp trial. Amber Heard really reminded me of my brother but I wasn't sure why. As she got diagnosed with NPD and BPD I looked into it and the covert narc description happened to completely match my brother.I had a lot of mental health challenges growing up but I managed to keep it together when it came to my education. Got A\\* Maths, A\\* Computer science A-levels, graduated CS with a First-Class Integrated Masters from a reputable university. But when I came across this piece of news my whole world flipped upside down. So many things started to make sense and I went through a wild emotional rollercoaster. Hadn't cried in 10 years since I was 13 but for at least 2 weeks I would be weeping 6hrs/day and I honestly didn't know what to make of my life. I had to get a job fast after graduating since I didn't want to live back home so I got hired at McDonalds. My mental health was fragile during this time and it took me 6 months to get a job in retail. Only a year after that had I actually started applying to CS jobs.As soon as my CV hit the market I started getting calls from recruiters, at least 2 calls/week. I started making some progress with some companies but a friend of mine from McDonalds hit me up and convinced me to start a business. It's a long story with him, but basically he came to the UK by selling his business for 40K pounds. He had a small thing where he bought bicycle parts in some dodgy auction and used them to make bicycles and sell them. He worked at McD to earn the rest of what he needed to pay off his tuition fee (he had to pay 21K/year as he was not from the EU/UK). I resonated with the idea of being self-employed and the guy seemed competent enough and I thought YOLO, why not.3-4 months into that whole process I realised I really craved some financial security and it'd be a waste not to use my degree. So I quit and started applying to jobs again. I got very close with a video game apprenticeship (was the 11th applicant out of 300 but they only had 10 positions). And I also got an interview for a job through a uni connection that went really well. I had been given a call and was told that I have the job! just have to be on the lookout for HR to contact me. No contact, I stayed in touch via email and eventually called and the hiring manager told me he doesn't know what's happening and the job seems to be in the air. He's signed everything and so has his boss he is just on lookout for the final business approval. He told me he'll contact me if anything changes, so I can only assume nothing changed.After this whole foray I was a little bit low and my friend sweeps in again to offer me to start our own thing. Great timing. Won't go into the details of that but we did a lot of work but were delayed by waiting for my passport to arrive from Romania to the UK as we needed ID to start the business bank account. Just when we were starting to do outreach and get some customers the guy started behaving very poorly towards me. Very passive aggressive, would tell me to do shit for him, etc. When I confronted him about it he called me sensitive, etc. I just couldn't deal with that kind of behaviour so we split up.It's been a while at this point since I actually graduated and I learned so many things about myself. I thought for a while maybe I don't want to do CS and I went on to try to be self-employed. It turns out I'm a little too fragile for that at the moment, I don't quite have enough self-determination for it and I've lived for 2.5 years in a constant state of anxiety (as my current workplace is quite toxic and demanding as well). I just need a little bit of breathing room and some financial stability to pull myself together enough to actually attempt something like that.This brings me to now, 3 years later, applying to jobs yet again but now I'm honestly worried since it seems like the market is not in a great place, and my gap is getting quite large.Is there any point in me applying to CS related jobs at the moment? Does anyone have any advice for how to stand out in this market given this disadvantage?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey all! A few years ago, when the employment market shifted with COVID, I landed a great, well-salaried remote software engineering job. With the added flexibility, my wife and I decided to move back to our hometown and bought a house.It's been about four years now, and I think I'm realizing I'm tired of the isolation it creates in my life. Not only do I feel siloed at work and a bit excluded from upward movement, but I'm also realizing I don't quite fit into my hometown's social fabric as I'd assumed, especially with my job being so different from the local trades.I'm realizing I want to work in person again. I miss the daily camaraderie with other engineers, the energy of a stricter schedule, and even the minor corporate politics that somehow keep everyone alert. Remote work has made me a bit lax, and while I still deliver good work, I'm not sure I like this more relaxed pace.I could always move a couple of hours back to my old metro area, but it's still fairly small. I'm interested in trying a larger city with more tech companies and less friction in the job market (not implying it's easier to get a job, just more options).However, having bought a house, moving is a bit more complex and expenses are now quite a bit higher. It's not as easy to pick up and move as when I was renting and had less stuff. I'm curious if any of you have gone through something similar and would have any tips. Did you use a new job to manage a relocation, or did you make it work without having to move jobs? Any tips, regrets, or expectations that either held true or were broken? I'm eager to hear about others' experiences.EDIT: Most comments received have been about cost of living. I'm very financially aware that moving somewhere more populated correlates with an increase in housing cost. I'm more interested in experiences others have had; please don't suggest I'm naive and that if I only looked at the numbers harder, I'd realize I'm crazy for wanting to do what I've outlined above. I'm not. It's truly a case of suffocating from the isolation of remote work and a small town; an increase in cost of living is something I can afford and would happily do so if it helps me feel more integrated with other people around me.",

        "content": "Hello, I have a decision to make and I’m not sure what to do. I’m currently employed at one of the WITCH companies in the USA (I’m a citizen btw) as a data engineer. Been here for about 3 months but haven’t gotten assigned to a project yet so it’s been slow. I just had a recruiter reach out to me for an “Automation Developer” role (not entirely sure what this is, they said it wasn’t related to QA/testing but the role requires knowledge of things like Python and APIs. They said there would be things like daily standups and they use Jira etc). This is for a very well known fortune 50 company and the compensation is $10000 higher than my current WITCH role (still way below industry standard for a dev role, however). They said it’s a 12 month contract, not sure if this is a contract to hire situation though—they’ve been a bit vague on that. The recruiter is from an agency and not from the company itself.Is it worth switching into this role if I eventually want to be an SWE? My concern is that I might get pigeonholed into this “automation” work and not be able to move to a more traditional SWE type role. Also this is a W2 contract whereas I’m employed full-time at the WITCH. Any thoughts on what to do in this situation? Do I decline this new opportunity and focus on gaining experience with WITCH clients as a data engineer or should I move to the fortune 50 for the name brand on the resume/actual work experience? Any input or thoughts would be highly appreciated.",

My current job is kinda badly paid, no raises whatsoever, but besides that, I really like it, and I have become very efficient at doing my tasks, which leaves me with plenty of time to learn new things, and work on personal projects. I was also going to pursue a master's degree.But I've been contacted by a fintech company, and I'm at interview 4/4, going great so far. I am quite interested, because I know that finance is one of the best domains in terms of both learning high performance C++, optimization, multithreading(I'm a nerd for these) AND high salaries. The given salary range isn't great considering that it requires relocation to a place with hellish cost of living, but I'm trying to think long term here, it's probably better than telecom, based on my research. I'd probably need to give up on the master's degree for now though, since I might not have much free time in this new position.

I've been reasonably happy with my current company and basically told them to kick rocks. Recently I've become a bit disillusioned with the direction my current employer is being run and got 3 more cold-calls, all for the same job I mentioned before. I engaged with all 3 and confirmed they're all the same role, although each agency has given me a different salary expectation/range. I ended up following through with the one that paid the most, but should I have countered the other recruiters with the higher offer to try and get a bidding war started? The salary is in the middle of their bands for a senior dev and is 50% more than what I currently get paid, which I'm fairly happy with. I had the final interview yesterday and am just waiting on the verdict and potential offer to come through (they've already asked me for referees).",

I usually try to end the interview on a high note by asking the interviewer something along the lines of “what do you enjoy most about the company”. This can lead to more conversation as I can talk more about their interests as well. That said would it be bad(or somehow good?) to bring up a sibling when talking?

For one, if they have over 50 FTE on W2, then they MUST offer healthcare. And that 50 headcount is easily met by the staff. For every person placed on a contract as a W2 and it blows well past the 50 people threshold. Sure, they could have a lot of \"subsidiaries\" and therefore avoid the cap. That makes them more shady. Anyone know what kind of markup or profit these companies are getting? I ask because since all they do it process payroll, that is only worth about $35 per pay period or less then $0.50 (50 cents) per hour. I know of one company raking in just under a 50% markup, or from their point of view *only* a 30% take off the top. Either way it is straight up theft. The don't \"sell\" or push any candidate. They don't provide ANY value. Since require 3 or 4 week notice before leaving but will cut your job with zero warning.Plus their corp-to-corp rate is downright ridiculous. As if we can't do basic math and see they immediately get a 15.3% increase by having us work as a 1099 - and that's IF we get fully paid. And are they all calling from an tele-scam center in Bangladesh? (That's another conversation.) These days most recruiters seem like nothing more than a resume scalpers.",

        "content": "Hello. I've been working for around 2.5 years in a startup as a senior backend engineer.When I started, we were 2 on the team, under the CTO. 1 person left. We hired someone terrible, and we didn't continue with him after a few months. I proposed to not replace this person with anyone because the workload was ok-ish just for me. I was the only backend engineer for more than one year, managing (successfully) around 1/3 third of the product (several microservices etc).During this period, the CTO was changed because of investors' wishes. A few months back, we hired a couple of more people for my team, but they are nowhere close to my productivity or domain knowledge, and are on-par or below my general technical knowledge. I get along with everyone, I have good communication skills, and I've gotten 2 raises during this time. This is why I was expecting to become a Tech lead when it was time to have one.Unfortunately, we (i was included in the call) are interviewing for an external technical lead. This has been extremely disappointing. When asking my CTO, he said that they wanted someone with experience in leading teams who could effectively help with the refactors that we need, and so on.I'm more than capable (or at least that's what i think) of planning and managing long projects and make them happen through incremental steps, but this new CTO has never let me do that because he always proposes more long-term, breaking refactorings. So we are kind of stuck in urgent things and bugs (that obviously should not happen on the first place) and not moving forward with the important topics.I have the impression that they (the CTO and the CEO) have already made the decision not to count on me to promote to teach lead, because otherwise they would have, at least, spoken with me about what I'm not good at or something.So Im wondering if it make sense to push for it anyway. For example, writing a detailed technical proposal of the refactors that we need, and having another conversation with my CTO. But one part of me thinks that this would be a waste of my time and would only lead to an uncomfortable conversation in which no one wins. What do you think? Any similar experience? Thanks!",

My BA in CS didn't teach me much about front end (react, graphql...) but I have had so much fun learning these things :)I feel like I've hit a learning plateau, though, and many people my age are pursuing masters degrees or attending other types of schools. I feel like traditional CS masters programs are pretty CS foundations focused (i.e algs, data, machine learning) and I don't see many that focus on user interfaces... I also stalked all of the senior engineers I work with, and none of them have masters. I advocated for myself in the workplace and get to work on the UI for internal tools which is fun.I currently live in SoCal and don't want to move for a full-on in-person program. Is it even worth it to get a masters? I've found some certificate programs and I believe my company will pay up to $700 per credit. If I were to look for more sr roles with my CS degree already, would a certificate help? When the time comes for me to jump for a sr role I would have at least 5+ years of experience.I just want to really be a front end engineer who really works on making beautiful UIs that are easy to use, accessible, and look great.

        "content": "Hi all, Just looking for some of your thoughts on whether or not you think an MSCS would be worth it in my case. I have a BBA in Finance, have been working in cybersecurity at a Fortune 100 company (although it isn't a tech company) for almost 3 years. I feel like I am stagnant in my current position, haven't gotten a raise or promotion since I've been there, and feel like an MSCS would help me be more competitive. I've also always wanted to learn how to code and have done a full stack data science bootcamp, but haven't kept up with my skills and trying to teach myself again without any real end goal is a chore.The program would probably take around 2 years since I have to take prerequisites and would be part time.I was thinking I could choose a focus in cybersecurity (classes in cryptography, secure coding, etc.) and try to switch into application security, or maybe look for a government job in forensics. Any thoughts? Thanks",

Or at the very least, are the interviews less brutal than CS Leetcode interviews?I am a CS graduate with a couple you of industry experience. I work purely on the software side, but my company is well-known for hardware. I have also spent 9 months interning at a different Embedded Systems company. I graduated with a pure CS degree, but have taken numerous CE adjacent classes, including the Physics series + Diff Eq + Calc3, as well as some upper division math courses including Advanced Linear Algebra and Linear Algebra for Quantum Mechanics.I am considering going back to school and getting my Masters in EE. I'm very open to getting a job in EE instead of CS. However, my goal is to expand the number of jobs I am open to, including CS-adjacent positions that I am not currently eligible for. Despite my experience, due to my pure CS background, I am still boxed out from most Embedded Systems companies during interviews.",

        "author": "Data-Fox",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm 8 years into my career (around 30 y/o), with the last 8 months being in a junior dev role (.NET and some basic cloud work). I finished my WGU BSCS program last fall and want to ultimately move into an ML Engineer (or adjacent) role, using an AI/ML masters to help push me there.GT Path: I am currently on track to start Georgia Tech's OMSCS (ML specialization) in August, but I'm starting to double think the time tradeoff. I could only handle 1 class/semester, so the earliest I would finish is December 2028. By that time, I would have 4 years of traditional dev experience + GT credential/skills to transition from (assuming I wouldn't be able to transition mid-program, which could be likely).WGU Path: If I started the new WGU MSCS (AI/ML concentration) in August, I'm confident I could finish within a year, even taking the time to try and learn instead of blowing through the coursework. I would then have a bit under 2 years of traditional dev experience + WGU credential/skills to transition from.I'm curious on opinions from this sub on which path seems better? I would learn more & have a more prestigious credential from GT, but by the time I finished, does that beat (potentially) already being an ML Engineer for 2 years with the WGU path? There's also the risk that the WGU path wouldn't be strong enough to actually make the ML transition from.",

I do not have the contact info of the people I interviewed with (IT director and the software devs), only the HR person I did my first round online interview with. Is it worth trying to contact the HR person to relay a thank you email to the second round interview panel? I did not send a follow up email for the first interview.

        "author": "apgthrowaway_",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So, I'm a new grad torn between two offers. One is SRE at a company that is mid-sized, tech/AI oriented, enterprise, good recent funding, seems really stable, GlassDoor reviews seem positive, unlimited PTO (that reviews say was usually approved), has good benefits but would require relocating. Another is SWE at a smaller start-up ish, can't find any info online about their revenue and funding, almost no GlassDoor reviews, no unlimited PTO, 7 year old e-commerce company.Salary wise due to relocating they both kind of wind up being the same net for me.My brother who's worked as a Product Manager at Microsoft for a few years (but never worked in SWE) is telling me that the smaller company SWE position w slightly worse benefits is much better because the industry is so competitive right now that if you only have experience as an SRE it'll be hard to pivot to other roles in the future, and that it's a much better setup for my future career than an SRE role. He also said that it's better to work at a e-commerce marketplace company because the skills will be more transferrable and a lot of FAANG type companies will like that, whereas the enterprise AI company experience wouldn't be as direct.Another engineer I talked to said the job titles don't matter that much, I'll only be able to tell once I start the job and know exactly what I'm doing that I'll know how useful the learned skills are, best I can do is look at the job description.So I'm torn on what to do. If the job titles were the same I'd go with the mid-sized company 100%. But since the smaller company where I'm not sure about the work culture has the better title *and* doesn't require me to relocate I'm really not sure. Any advice on what it seems like the better role is, if SWE is that much better as my brother says it is? Idk I feel like the SRE position is at a company with such a stronger future. If it helps, the SWE role works with C#, they said I'll be doing some QA and automation with Selenium. The SRE role will be working with Playwright and Kubernetes. I have no idea which of those skills would be more useful in the industry and neither does my brother/other engineer friend lol.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "#Hey guys, I’m posting for a friend who doesn’t have a Reddit account with enough karma! Thank you I’m currently a software engineer at Microsoft with 5 years of industry experience(mobile developer for a major product). Over the past few years, I’ve developed a deep passion for philosophy of mind, artificial intelligence, and the ethical and societal implications of emerging technologies. I believe my long-term goal is to work as an AI ethics researcher, ideally contributing to both academic understanding and practical guidance for organizations building impactful systems. To pursue this, I’m considering enrolling in a Master’s in Philosophy to gain formal training in foundational and conceptual frameworks(philosophy of mind and ethics focus), with the eventual goal of pursuing a PhD in Computer Science or a related interdisciplinary field that focuses on AI ethics. That said, I’m wondering if a single Philosophy master’s is the most efficient path—or if it might be worthwhile to simultaneously pursue a second Master’s in Machine Learning or Computer Science. I recognize this may extend the timeline, but I’m genuinely passionate about building a strong, cross-disciplinary foundation and want to make sure I’m well-prepared to contribute meaningfully in both technical and ethical domains. My key questions are: * Is a PhD necessary to break into impactful AI ethics research, or can a Master’s degree (or two) be sufficient?* Would pursuing two Master’s degrees in parallel (Philosophy + ML/CS) make sense, or would you recommend a more focused route?* Are there specific programs or schools you would recommend for someone with this interdisciplinary focus?* Finally, does this path tend to offer long-term job security and practical opportunities in industry at major labs? Thank you so much for your time and any advice you can share—I deeply appreciate it.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey guys, here’s my situation. I’m a full stack software engineer at a midsize non-tech company (but still well known) with 4.5 YOE (1.5 YOE in data analysis before that, so I guess 6 YOE total). I’ve been cold applying for remote software engineering roles but I’m not really getting any bites. I know the remote market is insanely competitive right now, but I’d really like one and I’m only considering switching roles if the new one is remote.For some more background, I have an unrelated bachelors from an Ivy League school. I have a feeling that this is one of the main reasons I’m not getting much traction - I’m probably being filtered out immediately at a lot of places for not having a CS degree, especially in this market. I was getting a good chunk more interviews 2-3 years ago.Lately, I’ve been contemplating doing a MSCS to make up for that shortcoming. Last year, I got accepted into GT OMSCS but I decided to not attend after thinking heavily about the time commitment. It would’ve taken me about 3 years and I would’ve completely had to sacrifice my quality of life due to the programs rigor. I have a wife and now a baby on the way, and my wife and I are ready to expand our family even further in the short term future, so I just didn’t think it was worth the sacrifice. Plus, now it’s been a year so my offer of admission is no longer valid anyway.Here’s the thing. WGU just came out with an MSCS that I think I can get done in 6 months, if not a year. That time horizon and day-to-day commitment is a lot more palatable to be honest. Also, my employer is willing to pay for it 100%.All that said, do you think it’s worth it for me to do the WGU MSCS so that I can meet the CS degree requirement at a lot of places/avoid getting filtered out early in the process? The way that I’m thinking about it is that I can always take it off my resume if I feel it’s causing a negative impact on my profile. What do you guys think? Would it be beneficial to my profile or make it worse? At this point, it’s either WGU MSCS or nothing - I’m just at a point in my life where I’m done with higher education otherwise and want to focus on life itself, so I’m not considering any other masters programs.I do have 3 YOE working remotely due to COVID and I’ve reflected that on my resume, plus some promotions, so I don’t think it’s a track record issue.",
