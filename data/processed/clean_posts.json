Half the dependencies aren't even pinned to versions.Last week someone tried to push a model to production that only worked on their specific laptop because they'd manually installed some library months ago and forgot about it. Took us four days to figure out what was even needed to run the thing.I get that they're not infrastructure people. But at what point does this become their problem too?

You start a sprint already behind.Even if you finish your work, there’s always something else. A pipeline fails, a deployment breaks, or someone suddenly needs “a quick fix” for production. It feels like you can never really log off because something is always running somewhere.In my current team, the seniors are still online until midnight almost every night. Nobody officially says we have to work that late, but when that’s what everyone else is doing, it’s hard not to feel pressured. You feel bad for signing off at 7 PM even when you’ve done everything assigned to you.I actually like data engineering itself. Building data pipelines, tuning Spark jobs, learning new tools, all of that is fun. But the constant grind and unrealistic pace make it hard to enjoy any of it. It feels like you have to keep pushing non-stop just to survive.Is this just how data engineering is everywhere, or are there actually teams out there with a healthy workload and real work life balance?",

There’s also a path here for data analysts to move into data science, which pays better and involves predictive analytics and advanced modeling.That used to be my plan, but lately I’ve realized I’m not sure it’s for me. I’m autistic and I struggle with the constant presentations, storytelling, and meetings that come with more “business-facing” roles. I’m very introverted and prefer structured, predictable work and I’ve noticed the parts I enjoy most are the engineering ones: building pipelines, automating processes, making data flow efficiently.I don’t have a software engineering background (I’m a physicist), but I’ve always done well with computational work and Python. I haven’t worked with Spark, IaC, or devops yet, but I like that kind of technical challenge.I’m not looking for advice per se, just wanted to share my thoughts and see if anyone here has had a similar experience, moving from a data or analytics-heavy background into something more engineering-focused.",

The previous Data Engineering Manager became a specialist and left the company. It's a bad position, infrastructure has always been an afterthought for everybody here and upper management has the absolute conviction that I don't need to be technical to manage the team. It's been +/- 5 months and, obviously, I am convinced that's just BS. The market in my country is hard right now, so looking for something in my field might be a little difficult. I decided to accept this as a challenge and try to be optimistic. So I'm looking for advice and resources I can consult and maybe even become a full on Data Engineer myself. This company is a Google Partner, so we mostly use GCP. Most used services include BigQuery, Cloud Run, Cloud Build, Cloud Composer, DataForm and Lookerstudio for dashboards.I'm already looking into the Skills Boost data engineer path, but I'm thinking it's all over the place and so generalist.Any help?",

I like that it feels more structured day-to-day, but I’d basically be starting from scratch learning it.With just 16 months left and visa rules changing, I’m nervous about making the wrong choice.If you’ve worked in either field, what’s your honest take on this?Based on my profile, i might struggle to land an entry-level ML job cos I only have one year of internship experience. I’d really appreciate your recommendations. I get that ML jobs are limited, so any guidance to navigate this would mean a lot.I’m confident I can put in the work necessary but the thought of my AI/ML internship experience going to waste if I switch to data engineering is scary. I’m not afraid to start fresh, but I want to be smart about it",

The end datasets combine data from different sources we normalize in our database. The issue I’m facing is that stuff that seems to have been ok-ed a few months ago is suddenly not ok - I get grilled for requirements I was told to put, if something is inconsistent I have a colleague who gets on my case and acts like I don’t take accountability for mistakes, even though the end result follows the requirements I was literally told are the correct processes to evaluate whatever the end user wants. I’ve improved all channels of communication and document things extensively now, so thankfully that helps point to why I did things the way I did months ago but it’s frustrating the way colleagues react and behave to unexpected failures while im finishing time sensitive current tasks. Our pipelines upstream of me have some new failure or the other everyday that’s not in my purview. When data goes missing in my datasets because of that, I have to dig and investigate what happened that can take forever, sometimes it’s a failure because of the vendor sending an unexpectedly changed format or some failure in the pipeline that software engineering team takes care of. When things fail, I have to manually do the steps in the pipeline to temporarily fix the issue which is a series of download, upload, download and “eyeball validate” and upload to the folder that eventually feeds our database for multiple datasets. This eats up my entire day that I have to dedicate for other time sensitive tasks and I feel there are serious unrealistic expectations. I log into work first day out of a day off with a bulk of messages about a failed data issue and have back to back meetings in the AM. I was asked just 1.5 hours of logging in with meetings if I looked into and resolved a data issue that realistically takes a few hours….um no I was in meetings lol. There was a time in the past at 10PM or so I was asked to manually load data because it failed in our pipeline and I was tired and uploaded the wrong dataset. My manager freaked out the next day,they couldn’t reverse the effects of the new dataset till the next day, so they found me incapable of the task but while yes, it was my mistake of not checking it was 10PM, I don’t get paid for after hours work and I was checked out. I get bombarded with messages after hours & on the weekend. Everything here is CONSTANTLY changing without warning. I’ve been added to two new different teams and I can’t keep up with why I am there. I’ve tried to ask but everything is unclear and murky. Is this normal part of DE work or am I in the wrong place? My job is such that I feel even after hours or on weekends im thinking of all the things I have to do. When I log into work these days I feel so groggy.",

Essentially, I will have the following entity:* student* class* teacher* paymentAnd while designing this new database, aside from migration, I'm currently planning ahead on implementing design choices that will help me with my work, some of them are currently this:* track payments (installment/renewal, if installment, how much left, etc)* attendance (to track whether or not the student skipped the class, more on that below)Basically, my company's course model is session based, so students paid some amount of sessions, and they will attend the class based on this sessions balance, so to speak. I came up with a two ideas for this attendance tracking:* since they are on fixed schedule, only lists out when they took a leave (so it wouldn't be counted on the number of sessions they used)* make an explicit attendance entity.I get quite overwhelmed with the rabbit hole of trying to make the db perfect from the start. Is it easy to just change my schema on the run? Or is what I'm doing (i.e. putting more efforts at the start) is better? How should I know is my design is already fine?Thanks for the help!",

The way that i see is that this company's workload is ridiculously demanding.20 story points per sprints to begin with. And some of the tickets are just too many subtasks for 3 story points. For example setup an etl pipeline complete with cicd deployment for all envs will just cost you a 3 story point.. Besides usually the tickets just have the title, no description whatsoever. Assignee is responsible to find out information about the tickets. And i also got comments on things like i will need to have more accountability on the projects, I mean its just been 6 months.And there are 2 other seniors, both of them are workaholic and they basically set the bar here. they spent time working exactly 12 hours average on daily basis. Additionally, why im saying my team is weird is because i have been doing research and been talking to otber teams. Lets just say only my team have ridiculous story pointings. They shout worklife balance and no need to work extra hours, but how can one finish their task without extras hours if workloads are just too much. Honestly, although i can push myself to be like them, i choose not to. Im already senior level and looking for a place to settle and work as long as i could.Question, will things get better?

        "author": "ThqXbs8",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "# SamaraI've been working on Samara, a framework that lets you build complete ETL pipelines using just YAML or JSON configuration files. No boilerplate, no repetitive code—just define what you want and let the framework handle the execution with telemetry, error handling and alerting.The idea hit me after writing the same data pipeline patterns over and over. Why are we writing hundreds of lines of code to read a CSV, join it with another dataset, filter some rows, and write the output? Engineering is about solving problems, the problem here is repetiviely doing the same over and over.## What My Project DoesYou write a config file that describes your pipeline:- Where your data lives (files, databases, APIs)- What transformations to apply (joins, filters, aggregations, type casting)- Where the results should go- What to do when things succeed or failSamara reads that config and executes the entire pipeline. Same configuration should work whether you're running on Spark or Polars (TODO) or ... Switch engines by changing a single parameter.## Target Audience**For engineers**: Stop writing the same extract-transform-load code. Focus on the complex stuff that actually needs custom logic.**For teams**: Everyone uses the same patterns. Pipeline definitions are readable by analysts who don't code. Changes are visible in version control as clean configuration diffs.**For maintainability**: When requirements change, you update YAML or JSON instead of refactoring code across multiple files.## Current State- 100% test coverage (unit + e2e)- Full type safety throughout- Comprehensive alerts (email, webhooks, files)- Event hooks for custom actions at pipeline stages- Solid documentation with architecture diagrams- Spark implementation mostly done, Polars implementation in progress## Looking for ContributorsThe foundation is solid, but there's exciting work ahead:- Extend Polars engine support- Build out transformation library- Add more data source connectors like Kafka and DatabasesCheck out the repo: [github.com/KrijnvanderBurg/Samara](https://github.com/KrijnvanderBurg/Samara)Star it if the approach resonates with you. Open an issue if you want to contribute or have ideas.---Example: Here's what a pipeline looks like—read two CSVs, join them, select columns, write output:```yamlworkflow: id: product-cleanup-pipeline description: ETL pipeline for cleaning and standardizing product catalog data enabled: true jobs: - id: clean-products description: Remove duplicates, cast types, and select relevant columns from product data enabled: true engine_type: spark # Extract product data from CSV file extracts: - id: extract-products extract_type: file data_format: csv location: examples/yaml_products_cleanup/products/ method: batch options: delimiter: \",\" header: true inferSchema: false schema: examples/yaml_products_cleanup/products_schema.json # Transform the data: remove duplicates, cast types, and select columns transforms: - id: transform-clean-products upstream_id: extract-products options: {} functions: # Step 1: Remove duplicate rows based on all columns - function_type: dropDuplicates arguments: columns: [] # Empty array means check all columns for duplicates # Step 2: Cast columns to appropriate data types - function_type: cast arguments: columns: - column_name: price cast_type: double - column_name: stock_quantity cast_type: integer - column_name: is_available cast_type: boolean - column_name: last_updated cast_type: date # Step 3: Select only the columns we need for the output - function_type: select arguments: columns: - product_id - product_name - category - price - stock_quantity - is_available # Load the cleaned data to output loads: - id: load-clean-products upstream_id: transform-clean-products load_type: file data_format: csv location: examples/yaml_products_cleanup/output method: batch mode: overwrite options: header: true schema_export: \"\" # Event hooks for pipeline lifecycle hooks: onStart: [] onFailure: [] onSuccess: [] onFinally: []```",

Then, the user could ask natural language questions about the CRM data using the Claude AI desktop app or a similar tool, via a connection to the DuckDB MCP server. These REST APIs require the user to be connected (using a session cookie or, in some cases, an API token) to the service and make potentially 1,000 to 100,000 API calls to retrieve all the necessary details. To keep the data current, an automated scheduler is necessary. * I've built a Go program that performs the complete ETL and tested it, packaging it as a macOS application; however, maintaining database changes manually is complicated. I've reviewed various Go ORM packages that could add significant complexity to this project. * I've built a Python DLT library-based ETL script that does a better job normalizing the JSON objects into database tables, but I haven't found a way to package it yet into a standalone macOS app. * I've built several Chrome extensions that can extract data and save it as CSV or JSON files, but I haven't figured out how to write DuckDB files directly from Chrome. Ideally, the standalone app would be just a \"drag to Applications folder, click to open, and leave running,\" but there are so many onboarding steps to ensure correct configuration, MCP server setup, Claude MCP config setup, etc., that non-technical users will get confused after step #5. Has anybody here built a similar ETL product that can be distributed as a standalone app to non-technical users? Is there like a \"Docker for consumers\" type of solution?",

But the reality has been quite different.Most of my seniors mainly work with Spark and SQL, while I’ve been assigned tasks involving Airflow and Airbyte. The issue is — no one really knows these tools well enough to guide me.For example, yesterday I faced an Airflow 209 error. Due to some changes, I ended up installing and uninstalling Airflow multiple times, which eventually caused my GitHub repo limit to exceed. After a lot of debugging, I finally figured out the issue myself — but my manager and team had no idea what was going on.Same with Airbyte 505 errors — and everyone’s just as confused as I am. Even my manager wasn’t sure why they happen. I end up spending hours debugging and searching online, with zero feedback or learning support.I totally get that self-learning is a big part of this field, but lately it feels like I’m not really learning, just surviving through errors. There’s no code review, no structured explanation, and no one to discuss better approaches with.Now I’m wondering:Should I stay another month and try to make the best of it,or resign and look for an opportunity where I can actually grow under proper guidance?Would leaving after 3 months look bad if I can still talk about the things I’ve learned — like building small workflows, debugging orchestrations, and understanding data flow?Has anyone else gone through a similar “no mentorship, just errors” internship?I’d really appreciate advice from senior data engineers, because I genuinely want to become a strong data engineer and learn the right way.Thanks",

        "content": "Hi everyone,I’m currently doing an academic–industry internship where I’m researching polyglot persistence, the idea that instead of forcing all data into one system, you use multiple specialized databases, each for what it does best.For example, in my setup:PostgreSQL → structured, relational geospatial dataMongoDB → unstructured, media-rich documents (images, JSON metadata, etc.)DuckDB → local analytics and fast querying on combined or exported datasetsFrom what I’ve read in literature reviews and technical articles, polyglot persistence is seen as a best practice for scalable and specialized architectures. Many papers argue that hybrid systems allow you to leverage the strengths of each database without constantly migrating or overloading one system.However, when I read Reddit threads, GitHub discussions, and YouTube comments, most developers and data engineers seem to say the opposite, they prefer sticking to one single database (usually PostgreSQL or MongoDB) instead of maintaining several.So my question is:**Why is there such a big gap between the theoretical or architectural support for polyglot persistence and the real-world preference for a single database system?**Is it mostly about:Maintenance and operational overhead (backups, replication, updates, etc.)?, Developer team size and skill sets?, Tooling and integration complexity?, Query performance or data consistency concerns?, Or simply because “good enough” is more practical than “perfectly optimized”?**Would love to hear from those who’ve tried polyglot setups or decided against them, especially in projects that mix structured, unstructured, and analytical data.

        "content": "Hi all!I am a data engineer by trade and I am currently working on a project involving streaming data in from an s3 parquet table into an ML model hosted in ec2 (specifically a Keras model). I am using data generators to Lazy load the data with pandas wrangler and turn it into a tensor. I have already parallelized my lazy loads, but I’m running into a couple of roadblocks that I was hoping the community might have answers to. 1. What is the most efficient/standard way to lazy load data from an s3 parquet table? I’ve been iterating by partition (utc date + Rand partition key) but it’s a pretty slow response time (roughly 15 second round trip per partition). 2. My features and targets are in separate s3 tables right now. Is there an efficient way to join them at load or should I set up an upstream spark job to join the feature and target set to a single bucket and work from there? My intuition is that the load and x-process of handling that join for a disjoint set will be completely inefficient, but it would be a large data duplication if I have to maintain an entire separate table just to have features and targets combined in one parquet file. Any insight here would be appreciated!Thank you!",

        "content": "How do you handle schema changes on a cdc tracked table? I tested some scenarios with CDC enabled and I’m a bit confused what is going to work or not. To give you an overview, I want to enable CDC on my tables and consume all the data from a third party(Microsoft Fabric). Because of that, I don’t want to lose any data tracked by the _CT tables and I discovered that changing the schema structure of the tables, may potentially end up with some data loss if no proper solution is found. I’ll give you an example to follow.I have the User table with Id, Name,Age, RowVersion. The CDC is enabled at db and at this table level, and I set it to track every row of this table. Now some changes may appear in this operational table1. I add a new column, let’s say Salary as DECIMAL. I want to track this column as well. But I don’t want to disable and enable again the CDC for this table, because I will lose the data in the old capture instance2. After a while, I want to ALTER the column Salary from DECIMAL to INT (this is just for the sake of the example). Here, what I observed, is that after the ALTER state is run, the Salary column in CT table is automatically changed to INT which is weird that may lead to potentially some data loss from the previous data3. I will Delete the Salary column. The statement will not break but I need to update somehow the tracking for this table without the column. 4. I will rename the Name column to FirstName. The rename statement will break because it will see that the column is linked to CDC5. I will rename the table from User to Users. This statement is not failing but I still need to update the cdc tracking to not let misleading naming conventions that may be confusing Did you encounter similar issues in your development? How did you tackle it?Also, if you have any advices that you want to share related to your experience with CDC, it will be more than welcomed.

All on the starter subscription.Then, we sign up and pay, but who would know, EU support is now removed from the entry monthly plan. So EU data residency is now a paid extra feature.We are told that EU data residency is for annual plans only, bit annoyed, but fair enough, so i head over to their pricing page to see the entry subscription in an annual plan. I contact them to proceed with this, and guess what, it is gone, just like that! And it is gone, despite (at this point) still being listed on their pricing page!Ok, so after much back & forth, we are allowed to get the entry plan in annual (for an extra premium of course, gotta pay up). So now we finally have EU data residency, but now, all of a sudden the one important feature we were presented by their sales team is gone.We already signed up now to the annual plan to get EU, so bit in the shit you can say, but I contact them, and 20 emails later we can get the dynamic configuration of destinations, if we upgrade to a new and more expensive plan.And to put it into context, starter annual is 11'800 USD for 7m events a month, so it is not like it is cheap in any way. God knows what we will end up paying in a few weeks or months from now, after having to constantly pay up for included features being moved to more expensive plans.Is segment, fivetran and the other ones equally as shit and eager with their enshittification?

As titled, am I Missing Hidden Costs/Tradeoffs?We're a small shop, 5 data people, <10TB of production data.We used to run our analytics in the production's read replica, but nowadays it always timed out / failed bcz of transaction conflicts.We're storing a snapshot of historical data every day for audit/regulatory purposes (as pg dump and restoring it when we need to do an audit.We're moving our data to a dedicated place. We're considering ingesting our production data to a simple iceberg/s3 tables and using Athena for analytics.But we're also considering Redshift serverless + Redshift's managed storage, which apparently, the pricing for RMS ($0.024/GB) is now closly matches S3 Standard ($0.023/GB in our region). Our data is purely structured (Parquet/CSV) with predictable access patterns.  For the compute cost, we estimated that the RSS will cost us <500$/mo. I haven't estimated the Athena cost query because I don't know how to translate our workload into equivalent Athena scan cost.With either of these new setup, we will take a full snapshot of our postgres everyday and dump it to our datalake/redshiftWhy I'm Considering Redshift:  \\- We're pretty much an all-in AWS shop now, not going to move anywhere in the quite long term. \\- Avoid complex data lake/iceberg maintenance \\- I can still archive snapshot data older than a certain period to the cheaper S3 tier when I need to.I'm coming here from the idea that I can have an exabyte of data on my storage, but that won't affect the performance of my DB if I don't query it. On Redshift, I'm thinking to achieve this by either 1. storing older snapshots on a different table or 2. using \"snapshot\\_date\" as a sort key so that unrelated data will be filtered when doing a queryQuestion:1. Does this storage model make sense?2. Are there hidden compute costs? (from vacuuming/optimization)",

Two areas where I see key assumptions changing for data engineering are...1. Security Compliance and Governance2. Managing StateThe security component is actually already top of mind for governments and major enterprises who are concerned with \"harvest now, decrypt later\" attacks ([NIST.gov Report](https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity/what-post-quantum-cryptography), [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/us-china-tech-quantum/)). Essentially the core assumption is that encryption is \"obsolete\" if quantum becomes viable at scale so various actors are scooping up encrypted data today hoping the secrets will be useful in a future state. The managing state component is interesting to me as an entity can either be 0, 1, or simultaneously both (i.e. superposition) until measured. This is what opens up strong computing capabilities, but how would you model data with these properties? Is anyone else thinking about this stuff?",

        "author": "poogast",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone,I'm building a real-time data pipeline using Docker Compose and I've hit a wall with the Hive Metastore. I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction or suggest a better architecture.My Goal:I want a containerized setup where:1. A PySpark container processes data (in real-time/streaming) and writes it as a table to a Delta Lake format.2. The data is stored in a MinIO bucket (S3-compatible).3. Trino can read these Delta tables from MinIO.4. Grafana connects to Trino to visualize the data.My Current Architecture & Problem:I have the following containers working mostly independently:· pyspark-app: Writes Delta tables successfully to s3a://my-bucket/ (pointing to MinIO).· minio: Storage is working. I can see the _delta_log and data files from Spark.· trino: Running and can connect to MinIO.· grafana: Connected to Trino.The missing link is schema discovery. For Trino to understand the schema of the Delta tables created by Spark, I know it needs a metastore. My approach was to add a hive-metastore container (with a PostgreSQL backend for the metastore DB).This is the step that's failing. I'm having a hard time configuring the Hive Metastore to correctly talk to both the Spark-generated Delta tables on MinIO and then making Trino use that same metastore. The configurations are becoming a tangled mess.What I've Tried/Researched:· Used jupyter/pyspark-notebook as a base for Spark.· Set Spark configs like spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.path.style.access=true, spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog, and the necessary S3A settings for MinIO.· For Trino, I've looked at the hive and delta-lake connectors.· My Hive Metastore setup involves setting S3A endpoints and access keys in hive-site.xml, but I suspect the issue is with the service discovery and the thrift URI.My Specific Question:Is the \"Hive Metastore in a container\" approach the best and most modern way to solve this? It feels brittle.1. Is there a better, more container-native alternative to the Hive Metastore for this use case? I've heard of things like AWS Glue Data Catalog, but I'm on-prem with MinIO.2. If Hive Metastore is the right way, what's the critical configuration I'm likely missing to glue it all together? Specifically, how do I ensure Spark registers tables there and Trino reads from it?3. Should I be using the Trino Delta Lake connector instead of the Hive connector? Does it still require a metastore?Any advice, a working docker-compose.yml snippet, or a pointer to a reference architecture would be immensely helpful!Thanks in advance.",

Each batch contains y rows of data in every dataset where each dataset can have a different shape. The last file in the batch might contain less than y rows. Another job, job B can have less or more batch files, will still have x datasets but the split of rows per batch (the amount of data per batch) might be different than y. I've tried a combo of kerchunk, zarr, and dask but keep on having issues with the different shapes, I've lost data between batches - only the first batch data is found or many shapes issues.What solution do you recommend for efficiently doing data analysis?

        "content": "Hi everyone,I'm trying to modernize the stack in my company. I want to move the data transformation layer from qlik to snowflake. Have to convince my boss. If anyone had this battle before, please advice.For context, my team is me (frustrated DE), team manager (really supportive but with no technical background), 2 internal analyst focusing on gathering technical requirements and 2 external bi developer focusing on qlik.I use Snowflake + dbt but the models built in here are just a handful, because I was not allowed to connect to the ERP system (I am internal by the way) but only to other sources. It looks like soon I will have access to ERP data though.Currently the external consultants connects with Qlik directly to our ERP system, downloads a bunch of data from there + snowflake + a few random excels and create a massive transformation layer in Qlik.There is no version control, and the internal analysts do not even know how to use qlik - so they just ask the consultants to develop dashboards and have no idea of the data modelling built. Development is slow, dashboards look imho basic and as a DE I want to have at least proper development and governance standards for the data modelling.My idea: Step 1 - have ERP data in snowflake. Build facts and dim in there.Step 2 - let the analysts use SQL and learn DBT to have the \"reporting\" models in snowflake as well. Upskill the analyst so they can use github to communicate bugs, enhancements etc. Use qlik for visualization onlyMy manager is sold on step 1, not yet 2. The external consultants are saying that qlik workd best with facts and dims, instead of one normalized table. So that they can handle the downloads faster and do transformations in qlik.My points to go for step 2:- qlik has no version control (yet - noy sure if it is an optiom)- internally no visibility on the code, it is just a black box the consultants manage. Move would mean better knowledge sharing and data governance- the aim is not to create huge tables/views for the dashboards but rather optimal models with just the fields needed- possibility of internal upskill (analysts using sql/dbt + git)- better visbility on costs, both on the computation layer as well as storage costs decreased Anything else I can say to convince my manager to make this move?",

Don't know why though, I'd love to understand (especially when I duplicated that folder). PS, both workspaces are under unity catalog. Ps2: I'm not Databricks expert, so any help is welcome. We need to migrate years of historical data, and also might need to remigrate when new data is added. So incremental unloading is needed as well... I don't know if delta sharing is an option or would be too expensive, since we need just to copy all that history, I read there's cloning too but don't know if that's cross metastore/cloud possible...too much info, if someone migrated or you have ideas, thank you!",

But I recently noticed that one of our standard processes for monitoring crew assignments during shifts is wildly inefficient, and I want to build a proof of concept dashboard so that management can OK the project to our IT dept. Right now, when a train is delayed, dispatchers have to manually piece together information from multiple systems to judge if a crew will still make their next run. They look at real-time train delay data in one feed, crew assignments somewhere else, and scheduled arrival and departure times in a third place, cross-referencing train numbers and crew IDs by hand. Then they compile it all into a list and relay that list to our crew assignment office by phone. It’s wildly inefficient and time consuming, and it’s baffling to me that no one has ever linked them before, given how straightforward the logic should be.I guess my question is- is this as simple as I’m assuming it should be? I worked up a dashboard prototype using Chat GPT that I’d love to get some feedback on, if I get any interest on this post. I’d love to hear thoughts from people who work in this field!

        "author": "Salt_Anteater3307",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey folks,I am working at a large insurance company where we are building a new data platform (dwh) in Azure, and I have been asked to figure out a way to move a subset of production data (around 10%) into pre prod, while making sure referential integrity is preserved across our new Data Vault model. There is dev and test with synthetic data (for development) but pre prod has to have a subset of prod data. So 4 different env.Here’s the rough idea I have been working on, and I would really appreciate feedback, challenges, or even “don’t do it” warnings.The process would start with an input manifest – basically just a list of thousand of business UUIDs (like contract_uuid = 1234, etc.) that serve as entry points. From there, the idea is to treat the Vault like a graph and traverse it:I would use metadatacatalog (link tables, key columns, etc.) to figure out which link tables to scan, and each time I find a new key (e.g. a customer_uuid in a link table), that key gets added to the traversal. The engine keeps running as long as new keys are discovered. Every Iteration would start from the first entry point again (e.g contact_uuid) but with new keys discovered from the previous iteration added. Duplicates key in the iterations will be ignored.I would build this in PySpark to keep it scalable and flexible. The goal is not to pull raw tables, but rather end up with a list of UUIDs per Hub or Sat that I can use to extract just the data I need from prod into pre prod via a „data exchange layer“. If someone later triggers an new extract for a different business domain, we would only grab new keys no redundant data, no duplicates.I tried to challenge this approach internally but i felt like it did not lead to a discussion or even „what could go wrong“ scenario.In theory, this all makes sense. But I am aware that theory and practice do notalways match , especially when there are thousand of keys, hundreds of tables, and performance becomes an issue.So here what I am wondering:Has anyone built something similar?Does this approach scale?Are there proven practice for this that I might be missing?So yeah…am i on the right path or run away from this?",

Turns out that I hadn't fully internalized how filtering vector queries really worked. I knew vector indexes were fundamentally different from B-trees, hash maps, GIN indexes, etc., but I had not understood that they were essentially incompatible with more standard filtering approaches in the way that they are typically executed. I searched through google until page 10 and beyond with various different searches, but struggled to find thorough examples addressing the issues I was facing in real production scenarios that I could use to ground my expectations and guide my implementation. Now, I wrote a blog post about some of the best practices I learned for filtering vector queries using pgvector with PostgreSQL based on all the information I could find, thoroughly tried and tested, and currently in deployed in production use. In it I try to provide:\\- Reference points to target when optimizing vector queries' performance \\- Clarity about your options for different approaches, such as pre-filtering, post-filtering and integrated filtering with pgvector \\- Examples of optimized query structures using both Python + SQLAlchemy and raw SQL, as well as approaches to dynamically building more complex queries using SQLAlchemy \\- Tips and tricks for constructing both indexes and queries as well as for understanding them \\- Directions for even further optimizations and learningHopefully it helps, whether you're building standard RAG systems, fully agentic AI applications or good old semantic search!

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,I wanted to get some community perspective on something I’ve been exploring lately.I’m currently pursuing my master’s in Information Systems, with a focus on data-related fields — things like data engineering, data visualization, data mining, processing and AI, ML as well. Initially, I was quite interested in Data Governance, especially given how important compliance and data quality are becoming across the EU with GDPR, AI Act, and other regulations.I thought this could be a great niche — combining governance, compliance, and maybe even AI/ML-based policy automation in the future.However, after talking to a few professionals in the data engineering field (each with 10+ years of experience), I got a bit of a reality check. They said:It’s not easy to break into data governance early in your career.Smaller companies often don’t take governance seriously or have formal frameworks.Larger companies do care, but the field is considered too fragile or risky to hand over to someone without deep experience.Their suggestion was to gain strong hands-on experience in core data roles first — like data engineering or data management — and then transition into data governance once I’ve built a solid foundation and credibility.That makes sense logically, but I’m curious what others think.Has anyone here transitioned into Data Governance later in their career?How did you position yourself for it?Are there any specific skills, certifications, or experiences that helped you make that move?And lastly, do you think the EU’s regulatory environment might create more entry-level or mid-level governance roles in the near future?Would love to hear your experiences or advice.Thanks in advance!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone, I have a question regarding integration of Azure DevOps and VS Code for data engineering in Fabric.Say, I created notebook in the Fabric workspace and then synced to git (Azure DevOps). In Azure DevOps I go to Clone -> Open VS Code to develop notebook locally in VS Code. Now, all notebooks in Fabric and repo are stored as .py files. Normally, developers often prefer working interactively in `.ipynb` (Jupyter/VS Code), not in .py.And now I don't really know how to handle this scenario. In VS Code in Explorer pane I see all the Fabric items, including notebooks. I would like to develop this notebook which i see in the repo. However, I don't know I how to convert .py to .ipynb to locally develop my notebook. And after that how to convert .ipynb back to .py to push it to repo. I don't want to keep .ipynb and .py in remote repo. I just need the update, final .py version in repo. I can't right-click on .py file in repo and switch to .ipynb somehow. I can't do anyhting.So the **best-practice workflow** for me (and I guess for other data engineers) is:Work interactively in `.ipynb` → convert/sync to `.py` → commit `.py` to Git.I read that some use jupytext library:`jupytext --set-formats ipynb,py:light notebooks/my_notebook.py`but don't know if it's the common practice. What's the best approach? Could you share your experience?",

Okay so maybe some clarification is needed: I know the computer doesn't \\_know\\_ (in the sense humans know things) that grey is grey and not chartreuse. I was kind of assuming the values exist on some sort of cartesian plane with XYZ coordinates and from there some sort of maths is done on the inputs to get the output colour, but I'm going to go on a limb here from the responses that is not really whats happening and its more just light/voltage manipulation done by the GPU/image processing part of whatever computer.",

Of course I've been into multiple projects inside this industry, from big e-commerce to management systems, integrations between sites and marketing tools, etc..Recently I had 2 interviews for Senior positions, and I felt very comfortable with the interviews, I passed the 2 live test coding challenges , was I lucky or experience? who knows.I'm going to move to USA next year because my wife is USC, and I'm into this immigration process, but I'm very scared/afraid of interviews in the US, I know that interviews in USA are harder, way harder than here.I've worked with lots of US based customers through my employers, and most of the developers/team mates are very capable , way more than latin american developers, I've worked with Asian guys and their understanding of architecture and computer design is just beyond my skills, and I'm scared that I won't make it in the US because I will be competing against **Asian Developers** that are addict to coding and solving problems for fun.I know that it depends on the company, some companies will have harder interviews , but I feel that my 8 years of experience, will be like 4 years of experience in the US.What do you think? how can I land a job fast ? I can't live in the US without income, that would be very hard.I'm confident about my skills and experience, but I don't think I will be a Senior Developer in the US as I'm in Latin America, here I'm more valuable because I communicate in english plus my technical skills, but in US everyone speaks english, so english is not a valuable skill as it's in here. So I'm planning to apply for mid developer positions.Thanks and feel free to comment your recommendations.",

        "author": "COOLGAMER88_YT",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So I finally caved and tried a split keyboard (NocFree lite, wireless version). Been two weeks and my wrists already feel a lot less strained during long coding sessions. My posture is getting better and the compact 60% design also frees up desk space which is nice when I am juggling multiple devices. The layout took a few days to click especially the right side and some Fn combos but now it feels pretty natural. Typing is quiet, smooth and the little thumb keys are actually useful (again took some getting used to). Wireless mostly works but if I type really fast, sometimes it stumbles and makes me backspace a few times. I also miss a proper battery indicator but I guess its not that bad a thing. Beyond comfort, the customization options are a real productivity boost. I’ve been using Vial to set up extra layers and remap keys. I can even remap keys to control the mouse which is quite handy for my workflow (like scrolling or navigating code without leaving the keyboard). Hot-swappable switches mean I can tweak the typing feel over time without having to replace the whole board so I like the long-term use I’ll get out of it. Overall it has been a small change that’s actually improved my learning speed. Sharing it here for anyone curious about split boards. Those who already use one, how long did it take you to get used to the layout?",

A video game in GameMaker Studio, a JavaScript/HTML based NFL Trivia Website, and a Python based NFL Prediction program that uses Pandas to collect data... Although I \"created\" those projects, I gotta admit... They weren't created off the top of the ol' dome. The best way I can explain them is that they were put together with duct tape and bubble gum haha. Whenever I need help with a specific portion, i'd just google the question I had, use code from different forums and tutorials, and edit that code it to fit my specific needs. Like I have no idea how to just free-hand use Pandas for my NFL Algorithm. There is countless hours of googling and taking code to be able to make it happen. I don't know how to just free-hand create an HTML site lol. I just used the code that we learned in a project in school and edited to fit my ideas...I feel like an idiot for that. I guess the best solution is to just keep practicing... but for right now, I just feel like a fraud for not knowing all the intricacies of the languages I use. I am actively looking for entry-level jobs, especially because I have experience in the industy as an Engineering Technician that exposed me to the code that software engineers wrote... But I feel like my first interview (assuming I get that far) is going to be a disaster and i'll get made out to be a fraud...Has anyone else felt this level of Imposter Syndrome?",

I really enjoyed my work in those classes, though at times I felt exhausted and stupid.Now I work as an Insurance Aide and most of my week consists of scripting/documentation somehow. I am now responsible for building an MS Access Reporting tool and using Excel, SQL, and VBA, and documenting our existing codebase for our \"applications\".While I enjoy my work, I recognize that working with VBA isn't what programming looks like in the typical sense of the word. I don't record macros, but there's a lot of abstraction in VBA and I feel like it's quite different from in depth programming work people do in python and other languages. I'm not dealing with C pointers, or data storage problems, or even serious optimization issues. I feel like I might like \"scripting\" instead of \"programming\", but I'm not even sure how to define the difference between the two, apart from how programming involves more technical memory allocation while \"scripting\" is the surface level \"do this do that\" of programming. TL;DR: Do I like programming or scripting? And if I like scripting, what does that mean for my self-education journey (I'm currently re-introducing myself to Python)?",

But outside of seeing how other people do it I struggle to know where to abstract or to just make fluid or modular as opposed to rigid and repeating the same logic over and over. The balance of over-complicating versus just getting it running. And know whether suggestions or examples actually are even relevant or a good way of creating the flow I intend in the first place. I guess this is more of a general question but yeah how do you focus on learning that? Like I understand concepts and often when I am moving through something I go to the underlying functionality of a method or existing class to explore options but I keep feeling like, I know I am neither the smartest or most experienced, so how can I find models of good ways of doing things or at least the principals to have some checklist or reference point to judge myself against?",

I am about to graduate college, but just curious how that compares to the alternatives. The more technical stuff may not add up to much, but maybe expresses the enjoyment of learning I guess (which could be an advantage). I am assuming the more standardized tooling experience may add up to something slightly more significant. Idk, I am just kind of lost right now as to how I compare to job market (currently brutal) expectations / other jr developers.I also have several medium sized projects I have worked on, currently developing a fairly large project, and have done a bit of freelance work.

        "content": "Context: As part of my self-study routine, alongside reading \\*The Algorithm Design Manual\\* by Skiena, I practice LeetCode problems. I’ve also passed a university course on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).I’m having a hard time recognizing where exactly my lack of skill is and how I should structure my practice. For example, with the LeetCode problem “121 - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock\", my initial thought was: “Okay, there’s a profit to be maximized — this seems like a decision problem. When to buy? When to sell? Could it be a greedy problem?” I came up with a “greedy” approach, but it failed on a counterexample. After looking up the solution, I found it could be solved with two pointers and a sliding window — a simple and straightforward method.When I tried to find a dynamic programming solution, I couldn’t locate one (at least on YouTube) that started with a recursive approach and then introduced memoization. From what I remember in my DSA course, we first derived the recursive function as a mathematical definition (not code) and then built a table of values for the dynamic programming implementation. I think my problem is that I understand the general ideas of these concepts:\\* Backtracking\\* Dynamic Programming\\* MemoizationI can also identify the problem category:\\* Enumeration (find all possible paths or ways)\\* Optimization (find the maximum or minimum)\\* Decision (e.g., fractional knapsack problem)I’m not getting too emotional about it. If I make mistakes, I study other people’s solutions, then move to the next problem with a fresh mind — avoiding overthinking. I walk through examples, see if I can relate them to other problems, patterns, or topics, and try my best. I’d like to hear about your experiences and any advice that helped you overcome similar difficulties. Thanks!",

        "content": "If you want to learn web dev, you already kind of have a fundamental understanding of the end goal (i.e. a website) what it is, how it's used, etc. So you can get started with the intention of \"I'm learning webdev so I can make websites\" and have the end goal in mind. It makes the learning very concrete and tangible. In that way it's a bit easier to \"keep going\" with it as you learn more.But if you're interested in something like how computers work, while it's cool in a mystical sort of sense, or from the perspective of curiosity, it's hard to have a real-world application for it. That lack of real-world application makes it hard to feel like there's goals and a path to follow, and it's easy to feel like you don't have a way to practice what you're learning.I guess put another way, there's some programming/computer concepts that are inherently practical, and some that feel theoretical. How do you find practical applications for the areas that are more theoretical to reinforce what you're learning?",

        "content": "Hello. I'm a Junior Dev working mainly with Python.I've been asked to write a series of unit tests for a feature that I'm implementing on a project that I've worked on for a couple of months already.To give some context. It's a microservice using a company-developed ORM. Each microservice inherit from a base class with a series of functionalities and the ORM itself. These microservices communicate with each other through a message broker.I need to write tests mainly for business logic and the ORM-related service layer queries. I’ve never written tests before, so I’ve been reading documentation and watching tutorials but most of the material I find is too basic and not fit for what I need.I've managed to write most of the tests for the business logic part, but I find it quite hard to do so for the ORM queries.The main issue I'm facing is understanding how to effectively test ORM queries. Most examples I see online suggest using mocks with predefined return values, but I don’t really see the value in that. If I mock everything, I’m basically faking entire functionalities. So if after adding a new feature or refactoring code were to break, these tests would not detect it. So what am I testing?I feel like I'm testing the same things that I'm writing which doesn't make sense to me.I'd really appreciate some help on this. Thanks in advance! :)",

But workflow when it comes to keyboard navigation and shortcuts is awful, because I don't know what I don't know. So my workflow is significantly hindered because I spend so much time just trying to get where I need to go, and not just in text, but in the editor (vscode currently).Any help is appreciated :)(also what are vim motions?

I tried bambooHR (no actual parsing capability whatsoever) and greenhouse (the parsing is so bad it's not even worth using). Is ts a myth? Why is it so big in our mind that ATS is like some god algo.Within the first 40 or 50 apps i already had enough people to interview. like 15 maybe. good enough. after that i stopped scrolling. THis is how people get ghosted.I also noticed linkedin and indeed were showing my post HOURS later. Appararently every job on there needs to get approved. It showed up like 6, 10, 12 hours after I tried posting it. so if you apply there, you’re already late.it made me realize maybe it’s not about being perfect. maybe it’s just about being early. first.idk. felt like someone should say it out loud. hope it helps someone.

It adds up to **1,403 cuts statewide** — it’s unclear how the overall cuts might be affecting subsidiaries. (Amazon also owns Audible, Twitch, Goodreads, Whole Foods, Zoox and Ring.)Who are these laid-off workers? **Software development engineers make up the largest category, with hundreds of cuts listed across the documents**. Amazon is also shedding recruiters, business analysts, marketers and managers. The layoffs in Irvine and San Diego, where Amazon has video game studios, include dozens of game designers and game artists.This sheds some light on how affected SWEs were by this layoff in California at least.

His heart starts racing every time his phone buzzes, thinking it might be that email. The \"you’ve been impacted\" one.He barely sleeps..maybe 2 or 3 hours a night.He told me people who got laid off earlier received their emails after midnight or early morning, so now he stays awake in constant fear of that notification. Imagine being that scared of an email.He keeps saying \"I'm sure I'll be next. They like people who talk a lot. I just…..work.\"And the sad part...he’s really good at his job. But his manager once told him that his communication skills are a little off and he needs to work on that. He was okay with this initially and agreed to work on it but with the constant state of fear and overthinking he thinks this could be one of the deciding factor.There are some new hires in his team..they’re young, confident, articulate..and he feels invisible next to them and assumes he’s automatically at risk.It’s heartbreaking to see someone who’s great at what they do be this mentally wrecked by uncertainty. The kind of fear that turns your phone into an anxiety trigger.These corporates don’t talk enough about what layoffs or even the fear of layoffs do to people mentally. It’s brutal.

This was for a very popular payment company.Instead of asking me whether to use cursor-based or off-set pagination or how to implement it all, they asked me \"**why is it called pagination and where did this term originate from?**\"I couldn't answer and they just told me \"**okay, it seems like you're struggling hard, let's just move on to pair programming.

A couple years ago, our international teams started to take off, so now we are more of a global company, especially in regions like Europe, Japan, and Mexico.We hired a new Chief Product Officer who is Indian (I have absolutely no problem with that) about 1.5 years ago, and he has on record said that he prefers to hire Indians, and is aggressively pushing the company to build a big India based tech team. Our team has expressed their concerns, and we are being assured that our jobs are safe, but I'm not sure if I buy it.

However I don’t see what singles out programming from other fields in this oddly timed hypothetical that executives keep touting.If AI can automate writing enterprise code; thereby reducing the number of human engineers needed, wouldn’t it also imply that AI could automate major parts of what lawyers get paid to do such as legal research or legal advisory?Can’t companies outsource their accounting needs to AI, or at least force their accountants to augment AI into their workflow thereby drastically increasing productivity and decreasing the number of accountants needed?The list goes on.",

I checked my settings and screen share was set to allow, so I didn’t know what the problem was. I then suggested that I take a moment to download the desktop version of teams but they weren’t having it. 15 minutes or so had passed and one of the guys just said he’d talk to my recruiter to reschedule. This afternoon I got a rejection email. Extremely unprofessional because it’s not my fault teams wasn’t working right, shit happens but apparently they don’t give a shit because there’s probably plenty of other candidates.Just needed to vent because I barely get any interviews because the market is shit so when something like this happens that’s out of my control, it’s pretty infuriating tbh.

        "content": "After about 5+ years in this field, I've realized that it's always better to prefer polish over speed.The reason is simple. Unless you work in an extremely isolated silo, you are not entirely responsible for your speed.When people review your code you don't get bonus points for how quickly you wrote it.However, if there are issues with your code, for that you are entirely responsible.If there's some edge case that you didn't properly check, you're responsible for that. If you missed some step in preparing your PR, you're responsible for that. If your code is difficult for others to read, you're responsible for that.Managers will always want you to be fast but speed is a shared responsibility.You cannot be fast if the code base you inherited is a mess. You cannot be fast if the company keeps changing direction. You cannot be fast if your work is rate limited by other people or systems.I've found this applies across orgs of all levels.In big orgs you'll be slowed down by more processes and structure.In small orgs the lack of process and structure increases the potential for mistakes and misunderstandings.Without really knowing the ins and outs of what someone is working on, it's hard to say if they're actually slow but a mistake is a mistake. Now and forever. When it comes time for performance reviews, no one will have the context to know if the time you spent was reasonable but if someone is looking to get rid of you, they will form a collage of every single wrong-doing you committed since the day you joined.So remember, slow down and try to consistently get everything right on the first try.",

If I think that I'm correct I'm willing to accept other ideas if they also work, and also that I prefer solutions that work best with the team over solutions that would technically be better but for example being too complicated to explain.Then I said that it also depends on the situation, and told a story about a pointless discussion at the end of a meeting. There were ten developers in the room and two developers started discussing variable naming and I said that I'm okay with both styles as long as we have a clear guideline.The discussion went on and on and I politely left the meeting as I couldn't contribute anything and wanted to get back to work to finish my tickets. I told this story because I wanted to show that I'm efficient and don't want to waste time on discussions that could have been a simple email.I assumed this efficiency would be appreciated, especially as it would have been an expensive external position where every hour counts.

It had a high strike price and the FMV of the stock is completely ridiculous because the company raised a bunch of money during covid but was completely overvalued. There is no future if the company ever IPOs because the strike price would probably be higher than the stock value. The current company I work for gave me RSUs but I'm completely lowballed. The RSUs are worth $20k over 4 years based on the FMV. A friend who worked at Uber mentioned that Uber IPO'd at $45 but after the 6 month lockup, the stock was around $27 but they had the pay taxes on the IPO price. Similar story with Lyft IPO and 6 month lockup. So some employees received significantly lower RSU packages they were expecting and even lost some money. It doesn't seem like there's a point joining a startup unless you join the top startups like OpenAI, Stripe, Databricks, etc.",

On top of this, I need to help ppl with their coding, like PR review, daily discussions, and so on. And then I also get into Production calls, reviewing production outcomes, why our code isn't performing well or whatever, etc. I fucking hate all of this. It might sound easy due to not coding, but i need to stretch my brain in a way that just gets me very overwhelmed, while also being incredibly BORED.I just never imagined that, I would be coding less, while being 5x more stressed than ever. A lot of the requirement documents I review are poorly written, so I have to keep scheduling meetings / following up with ppl to ask questions.. my day sometimes is just meetings ALL day, with almost no time to eat a damn meal. And then I need time to do code review so my team members' aren't blocked! So oftentimes, I do the code review at like 7pm after dinner or early in the morning the next day. Shit's fucked. Anyway, just a dumb rant I guess. It just makes me sad that, this is ultimately where a SWE goes. You can't be that guy being told what to do all the time.. now I need to take accountability for things and be the one to tell others what to do. But it's just so.. overwhelming man. Sigh.",

So idk if they just want cracked folks or I just fucked upI went through an interview process with a very small startup (less than 10 employees) in an industry I am new to. The interviews seemed to go really well. During the process, they mentioned there would be an initial probationary period of a few months, after which I’d need to relocate if both sides wanted to continue. They even had meetings with my references on top of the interview process.The work is quite challenging and requires a strong understanding of cloud, networking, security, and a modern tech stack. They didn’t provide health insurance, but in our meeting they initially said they would pay for the cost if I purchased it myself. I received a non-formal offer via email sharing the good news and to discuss terms. Later, in the informal offer email, they claimed the quoted salary already factored in health insurance cost they claimed they'd imburse.Because of my medical expenses and insurance needs, I asked humbly if there was any flexibility for a $10K increase in base salary, phrasing it as:*\"On base salary, I was hoping to see if there’s any flexibility toward $x\"*The next day, I noticed my LinkedIn notification showed my resume had been viewed/downloaded again for that job I applied 2 weeks back. Then I received this email:*\"While working to finalize this, the founding team decided to take hiring for this position in a different direction. I realize this is not the answer you were anticipating, but want to get you a response as soon as possible to help guide your search process.\"*In this tough market, where getting a job is extremely hard and I had submitted over 2,000 applications, I finally received an offer (not an official letter, just terms via email), and now it feels like I’ve lost the one opportunity I had.I’m wondering if they rejected me because of the $10K request, and if it’s normal for a company to back out this way during negotiations. I understand some companies have tight budgets, but isn’t the usual approach to say, “this is what we can provide” or “we can’t meet your proposal”?Part of me wants to believe they found a more senior candidate and it wasn’t my fault, but another part worries that I messed up by asking for more.What do you guys think could be what happened.

I started a new job in January at a large company with 18 days of PTO, which I thought was nice considering I'm used to \"unlimited\" which left me constantly worried about what was ok to take.For the first few months, I didn't request any time as I know it can be considered unprofessional when you're new. I took a single day because I had to move for the job, which my manager didn't seem happy about, but it was a big move from a place I had lived in for a long time and I made it clear I was going to need to before I was even offered the job.Just for some background, over the year my manager's feedback has been very negative. Whenever I get this negative feedback I put in extra effort to address it, and at first I figured he was just a bit more demanding than most. But as I'm now grinding over the weekends and occasionally pulling all-nighters, I see that my manager is just looking for anything to critique and ignoring everything else. It's not like I'm just not doing the work or half-assing it, in fact I've gone above and beyond to meet every critique, no matter how minor, and I've tried to pull out all the stops on clever solutions and building out important features. I've even had other coworkers remark at the amount I've accomplished and the quality of the results, so I don't think it's just in my head. My team is also sort of \"R&D\" for a large company, so our results are important, but we don't have rush times or fast-paced deadlines.But whenever I've put in PTO requests, he has denied them, saying I'm too behind to be taking extra time off. I put in the requests at least 2 months in advance, and I'm not requesting much -- when I had \"unlimited\" PTO I never took more than 5 days total in a year so I'm not looking to take off an entire week or anything. Honestly I just want to use the time since it goes away at the end of the year and doesn't pay out or roll over. He and other members of my team seem to take long vacations all the time though, so I'm not sure why it's just me that can't take any days of PTO.Everyone I've talked to so far has basically said that it's ultimately my manager's discretion, which surprised me as I thought dedicated PTO totals meant there was some sort of legal requirement that you be allowed to use them. I guess lesson learned now.Any advice though? Simply leaving for another job is difficult considering it's not even been a year, and my previous roles have been 1-2 years as well so I was looking to have a long stint at one place to make it not look so bad. Beyond that, if anyone has experience with this I'd like to hear about it so I can understand what to do / not to do.",

This was my first post-grad job.Got pulled aside this morning and was told \"today's your last day here,\" out of nowhere. The reasoning they gave was along the lines of not meeting \"velocity,\" despite no expectations or timelines explicitly being put into place. It was a solo project with little guidance, and I required access to tools I wasn't initially provided and had to ask for, which definitely slowed the pace. There were no warnings and no PIP. They inferred that I wasn't meeting the expectations for the position and the pay.Was told to leave immediately. It was right after I completed my first major deliverable. I was genuinely shocked, as at the beginning my boss was very pleased with my work and liked to show it off; I'd worked extra on nights and weekends in response to my boss's messages to get the project done whilst also tackling my online masters. There seemed to be conflicting expectations between moving fast vs initial code quality between two of my authorities, and I often had difficulty getting timely support or permissions from the dev team.I'd love some advice moving forwards. I just relocated across the country for this job and have pretty limited savings and a year's lease to pay. The company offered a release agreement with small severance.I'm also not the first person to be let go from this role; another person was let go under a month ago for similar vague reasoning he also wasn't aware of.

Now, i also have an option to pursue an internal position in an adjacent team which is basically a 1:1 mapping of my current role and I know that team works a lot and the work over there is mehh or at least not that interests me long term but also likely not be able to prep for interviews due to the expectations. I can basically pull some strings and have high confidence i can get that offer, but if they offer and regardless of whether i accept or reject i'll loose this severance package. It's clear to me that 6month pay is much better than this internal position but i'm on H1b and have until March 2026 to find a job. if not I'm screwed or i'll have to think about changing to B1/B2 to buy time or joining a consulting firm which i want to avoid. With this job market and all this VISA bs i'm not really sure if i can find a new job within March, but the thought of 6month severance without doing any work seems really sweet to recover mentally and get on the leetcode grind. What do you think is the better play? should i just pull my internal applications and get out with severance and try my luck outside? (Somewhat confident i'll find something in 6 months). Or take that internal position and be safe, loose that sweet severance work for some time and switch with position of power?

But I can’t stomach pseudo unemployment anymore.The new place develops agentic solutions for some really big government clients. Cool so far. The pay is good and the environment is semi flexible and more dynamic and fast paced than the lab. All fine and dandy.However, the structure of the work is pretty chaotic. And it’s especially subject to client expectations, which…. I mean— i feel like a country bum for making this observation— are ludicrous and verging on offensive. 3 weeks to develop a fully functional system? It seems insane. I’m trying to deliver fast, but the only way to iterate fast is to vibe code and frankly it’s a mind numbing exercise. I’m assessing the potential damage on my learning trajectory and well… i dunno. I feel like I’m just reinforcing my fraud status. I know that this is a stupid gripe to have especially when i’m lucky to even have a job. And I don’t have any other worthwhile experiences to benchmark against since the research lab was an atrocious place on all facets (garbage PI, no contract, no benefits, slow progress) except for the publication potential and the exposure to academic connections and really really intelligent people (who also happen to be horrible human beings).",

Thus, I’ve gone back to school to give it another chance with the hopes to make good/decent money post-grad. I’m currently taking an intro to programming/scripting class which has been going ok, the thing is I’m just not sure if I love it yet. My true passion is travel, and I figured if I studied CS I could get a well paying job and potentially be able to work remotely whilst traveling in the future. But now I’m really second guessing everything considering how poor the job market for CS grads seem to be at the moment. So, am I making a mistake for continuing this path? Should I consider studying something else, or even just drop out again and see where life takes me? I’m also currently living with my parents and hate the state I live in (US), so the thought of being stuck here for another 3-4 years sounds miserable, but if I could set myself up for a good future I feel it’d be worth it.

I now use Copilot in my daily workflow, but I genuinely do not understand how you guys are saying things like \"My workflow is 95% prompting then copy and pasting and I barely ever touch code manually now.\" My experience with copilot is that it will make up functions left and right that do not exist in the codebase, and it's actually faster for me to just write the code manually and then use AI as sort of a glorified stack overflow. I.e. I can rubber duck with it, and it won't call me stupid for asking a question. I'm genuinely confused how people are vibe coding entire applications.When you guys do this is the code actually robust and work well? Or do you end up spending a lot of time refactoring? Do you spend a lot of time coming up with instructions for the AI? What are the strategies you guys use to make it effective for you?

I grew with them from a support agent, to an integration consultant, and eventually became the team lead of their integration consulting team. However this year there were some changes that rubbed me the wrong way and I took that as a push to go find something new, and ultimately joined a different company as a technical consultant. Now, 3 months into my new job, I've just learned our team is being offshored and I'll be out of a job at the end of the month. And unfortunately for me there is no longer a great abundance of integration consultant jobs like there was a couple of months ago, and most team lead roles want some amount of development experience. I'm facing the prospect of either changing careers or waiting on the sidelines for much longer than I'd like. Where do I go from here? I have a two-year diploma from a technical college in Canada and the 5.5 years of experience listed above. I don't have any coding experience in a professional setting. Outside of staying in consulting, or moving back to support (which could require a big paycut from what I was making), what other CS careers could my experience translate to?",

I've been there ~1.5 years now, and at the beginning, I really enjoyed it. Everyone on my team is kind, my manager is very supportive, and while WLB was rough, I thought I could manage it. I could care less about the work that I'm doing too, but that's probably the case for most people anyway. In the beginning, I was performing well and received a promotion at the 1 year mark, but since then, it feels like my performance has quickly gone downhill. I've had several meetings with my manager discussing my potential and how to improve my metrics. Received advice from senior eng on how to work faster. Watched projects get passed to new hires since I'm no longer reliable. I completely agree with the negative feedback I've received. I wouldn't even be surprised if I get fired during my next performance review.And it's not that the work's become too difficult after the promotion either (I'm doing similar work as before). It's just that everyday I work feels like a little part of me is suffocating. It's gotten so bad that I've been daydreaming about when I worked retail jobs on night shifts during college (legitimately think that was more enjoyable for me than this job). I don't know if I'm just not built for a corporate job. The tight deadlines, horrible WLB, constant comparisons with coworkers, etc. All of it has been causing me so much stress, and my health has gone to hell this year because of it I think. Several days this month, I've just stared at my laptop screen, feeling like I physically could not do any work that day. I'm really frustrated with myself, because I grew up pretty poor and I think, if 12yo me knew I was complaining this much about a job paying me six figures, I'd punch myself in the face. I'm hoping I can get some advice from people who've felt similar:1. Am I just depressed or is my job really not a good fit for me? 2. Do I try to push through this feeling to keep my job or should I start job hunting?3. Should I try to switch career fields if I do look for new employment? 4. Also, can someone reassure me that moving to the middle of nowhere and becoming a hermit isn't actually a valid solution?",

Last summer, I accepted an internship at a non-tech company working as a full stack intern. The company is great, people are nice, pay for my area is pretty good, etc. I was offered to continue my internship part time through the school year and have continued working there ever since. Apparently, it is rare for them to extend such an offer, and the full timers on my team tell me that I will most likely be offered a job upon graduation. I do not ever put my eggs in one basket, ESPECIALLY on the foundation of “most likely”. So, last school year after accepting the internship I applied for my Masters in CS with an emphasis in ML. I was accepted into the program, but now I am having doubts given the current job market. My plan was to find a data science internship and try to transition into ML after getting my masters, but I keep getting rejected. Now, I am at a cross roads between pursuing SWE, where I have experience, or keep pursuing my passion of ML. Side note: I am more interested in Computer Vision, where i currently have a research assistant position. I understand that this likely requires a PhD, but I am also open to more traditional ML roles.",

That is, join when the company is laying off people as the “price” is less (less competition because of people who are scared of joining because they’ve heard of the layoff news)The whole premise of this question depends on the idea that people are more hesitant to apply to and join a company that has recently laid off. Do you think this is true?Have you seen companies that have gone through massive layoffs actually become a good place to angle for work?",

It honestly feels like a hackathon.I’m trying to understand the system logic and learn SnapLogic at the same time. I’m making progress, but I’m frustrated. Yesterday I found a bug and figured out the root cause and fix in minutes — but then spent the entire day figuring out how to implement it in SnapLogic. Tried docs, AI tools, trial-and-error… nothing. Finally got help from a SnapLogic dev in another team and he solved it in 15 minutes.On top of that, this feels like a career-direction issue too. My manager is changing soon, which means I’ll likely be stuck owning this SnapLogic project long-term. Once it goes to production it’ll mostly just be maintenance and I don’t want to get pigeonholed into this. I want to stay focused on backend Java projects, not get boxed into ETL work I’m not excited about.How do you handle situations where you get assigned to a project you’re really not interested in and don’t want to end up tied to long-term? And how do I bring this up professionally without sounding ungrateful?",

I have 7 YoE of Web Development (4 in my current) and I'm not learning the things I want to learn, or seeing progress in terms of promotions and title-growth. The culture has also degraded after the company I joined was merged into another (I joined a bank in end-2021 that collapsed in 2023), and a lot of the original, interesting people I thought I could learn from has left for other companies or moved onto other internal positions.&nbsp;For context, my Project is some back-office data aggregator that ingests data from different sources and exposes it to downstream middle-office and front-office applications via REST API and Elasticsearch. This sounds ok, until you realize that we don't get any credit for the accomplishments of the downstream applications (which Business people can relate to), whilst still taking the heat for when the data is not what they expect it to be (i.e. we effectively just redistribute our upstream data under this new company). My daily work now involves more firefighting rather than technically challenging and inspiring tasks, and my Team Lead and I are the only ones in the Team that handles the firefighting, the rest don't.&nbsp;To be fair to this Project, every year since joining I learnt something technically \"interesting\".> * 1st year (2022) was an introduction to Backend Work and Technologies - learning how to use Mongo and Kotlin, writing proper Unit and E2E Tests (my previous companies didn't mandate tests, relying instead on a QA Dept to ensure correctness).&nbsp;> * 2nd year (2023) was tying all that I've learnt thus far into making a Full-Stack Project from the ground up - creating a Gradle Task for putting the Frontend Client-Side Bundle into the Resources Folder of the Kotlin Project and serving that, using the Quarkus framework instead of http4k, GitLab CICD Pipelines, integrating Sonarqube for both Javascript and Kotlin Source Code, using Kaniko to create a new Application Image and using Helm Charts to configure and run the Application Image onto Openshift. This new Project would have been important, to quote my former Line Manager, had my company not collapsed.&nbsp;> * 3rd year (2024) was trying to replace our former f5 / haproxy certficate-based authentication with OAuth2 / OIDC on a company centralized IDP. Supposedly this was required so that systems from the new company could access systems hosted within the old company's network. I managed to integrate OIDC on our Dev env for our UI, until it was suddenly no longer needed; someone high up pushed for something so that many Projects didn't have to individually change for this. And so many weeks of Dev work went down the drain.&nbsp;>* 4th year (2025) involved shifting our Project to be hosted on Azure Cloud services. For my part, I had to replace our old FTP Servers (we receive data in files and process them in batches) to the Azure-equivalent - Azure Blob Storage connected to an Event Grid which sends Blob Creation Events to our Event Hub, and change the Project Code to listen for those via a Kafka Interface. This should have been interesting to me, but it just felt meh. Probably because the new company had an in-house abstraction layer over the ARM / Bicep Templates via Ansible Roles - I think I would have liked it more if I dealt directly with Azure.&nbsp;There were other tasks in the background that I felt were mildly interesting too - writing code to process large text files in parallel (using nio for the Random Access and Kotlin IO Coroutines) for data analysis being one.&nbsp;I did try to go for a few interviews but I think the main problem is that my experience is not in demand - my Project is primarily written in Kotlin and http4k, and that greatly limits the search because the closest equivalent that is more popular is Java and Spring / Springboot and in this market hiring managers can pick other candidates that have the exact skillset that they are looking for rather than having to settle for candidates with adjacent skills. I used to do Frontend with React, but that was over a year ago since the UI of the project has been descoped. I feel like even if I dedicate time to learning Java and Spring / Springboot, hiring managers would just choose candidates with direct hands-on professional experience instead of experience with side projects, or pick fresh graduates instead. Probably another issue is that I can't recite my experience like how I did above on demand / in real-time - my verbal communication skills are lacking.&nbsp;It just feels very, very difficult motivationally to dedicate free time outside of work to get myself into a better position - like I _really_ don't want to spend even more of my waking time outside of work having to work for something that might not even pay off. I know staying in this role will probably eventually end my career, but it's like, what's the point? The market is horrible and AI is somehow _still_ the reason mass-layoffs are happening even though I see endless chatter on Reddit that it's not all that it's cracked up to be. Honestly, it feels like I'm just waiting for the music to stop and get laid off - at least I then have an excuse to take a break.",

I have mainly been responsible for tool development and data processing. Some examples: maintaining and making new tables for our database (there's talk of redesigning the whole db), writing a basic script people run to keep files standardized, porting our data processing scripts to another group's system, making tableaus and designing KPIs for random manager requests, and my latest is modifying one of our main C# programs to accommodate another group (and whatever other changes have built up over time).It all sounds well and good, but my concern is that I don't have any oversight and that everything seems to fall in the toy project category. None of the code I've written has been complicated, and there have been libraries for everything. I don't have a senior to call me an idiot and ask why I did things a certain way - the only metric I have is whether the tool I made works and whether I did it fast enough for people not to ask again. The point of this post is to ask what I should do to mitigate that. What can I do to move into a pure dev role after this (I'm a test engineer and have that workload on top of my dev stuff). I'm worried that I'm 'poisoning the well' by getting light dev experience without any guide. I am worried that I will essentially still be entry level as long as I stay here.

This team uses .NET + Postgres + Azure. I’ve used Postgres for simple personal projects, but no complex schemas or data types. The feedback I got from the recruiter before this next stage was that they thought I was an excellent culture fit with appropriate knowledge of .NET, but they mentioned I might not have the depth of knowledge with Azure and Postgres. The recruiter said it’d be best to brush up on these and that “_They will likely ask about your skill sets in those areas and how you would deal with common problems that are encountered in Azure and Postgres_”. I get it, they don’t want an engineer that might struggle adapting to their environment. I am not worried I’d have trouble picking these up, I’m just worried about this next stage of discussion.

I traveled in Europe, spent time with my girlfriend, and honestly, it was exactly what I needed.Now that I’m feeling re-energized, I’ve been back to applying for roles over the past few weeks. I’m focused on sharpening my interviewing and communication skills. I realized that articulating my work clearly is just as important as doing the work itself.My only concern is that as time goes on, my gap gets larger. I sometimes wonder if I shot myself in the foot by taking that mental-health break, even though it helped me reset and refocus. I’m committed to job searching, practicing system design, and keeping my skills sharp.With the market being competitive, especially with more senior engineers entering it, I’d really appreciate any advice or perspective from others who’ve been in a similar situation.",

I see compelling arguments for both paths - specialists often command higher salaries for deep expertise, while generalists seem more adaptable to market changes and can pivot between different roles. For those further along in their careers, what factors helped you choose your path? How has this decision impacted your job security, compensation growth, and day-to-day satisfaction?

Working as software engineer for a defense contractor and been here 3 years. For the people in a similar company you will know it is semi laid back as things are allowed to move slow but the work can be challenging at times.Heres my dilemma.. I feel like I should be somewhere else making way more money. I think my talent is going to waste here working on 30 year old C++ code. Multiple coworkers have told me not to stay too long or you will have no option in the future. Feeling a bit down. The pro about the job is that it is very secure, almost recession proof. It’s just that it’s starting to feel like im not doing the best I can in my career. I’m about to be 27 and I feel like it’s now or never. Really want to work as an engineer for hedge fund or something to do with trading and quantitative stuff. My company will pay for my masters but that means staying there another 3-4 years. Am I just tired of the repetitiveness? Lately I’ve been thinking it would be the same anywhere I go. I find myself as somebody who wants to get better everyday but this new stage in life seems like I reached a pinnacle. Anybody ever feel the same way? I see people here grinding for jobs and complaining they can’t get one so maybe I’m just ungrateful. TL;DR feeling like I’m not doing enough despite having a decent job. Looking for something to change in my career but also feel that this is as good as it can get. Anybody been a similar situation? Any words of encouragement or advice?",

The general sentiment is that there’s little interest in the products my org develops and that we're considered too expensive, so our situation isn’t looking good. While the budget for next year is already allocated, there’s a real risk of layoffs starting in 2026.I’ve started exploring new opportunities, for fully remote roles. I mostly find openings at startups. European big tech have largely stopped offering full remote positions and are basically in hiring freeze, so the available roles are few and highly competitive. That said, I’m able to compete for positions at established startups, typically Series B or later, since I avoid earlier-stage ones due to the higher risk.My dilemma is this: should I stay where I am, stagnant and without growth prospects, but hoping the rumors turn out to be wrong and my division gets a second chance? And in the meantime, maybe hope for a lucky break with an interview at another big tech? startup? Does it make sense to leave a big tech for the risk of being without work in two years for a startup that I imagine could fail anyway in the same timeframe?",

We first were looking for candidates who know the tech stack. We got bunch of resumes from the consulting companies that mentioned they have worked on the tech stack, and they all have at least 7+ years of experience ( in general), but literally none of them passed our two round interview. The first one is questions about some basic knowledge ( basic if you've worked on the tech stack, in my opinion ), and questions about how the candidates would solve a problem.The second round is a coding challenge while sharing the screen (like pair programming where we might give some hints) that only takes about 90 mins. The features we asked them to do are really basic if they have worked on the tech stack before, and we also allowed them to google and check the documentation if they want, it really is an open book exam, but just no AI stuff. 90 mins is really more than enough to complete.None of them passed. We decided to look for candidates who know a different tech stack that I think is more well known compared to the first one, but also to focus on how they solve problems, like the approach they take, how they are solving it, and etc. Guess what, literally only 2 of them passed and they aren't really the devs we are looking for, we only hired them because we realized they know a tech stack well enough and seems to be alright when it comes to learning new things.We have interviewed more than 40 people already.

I am getting tuition paid so that is not a concern.I have done Web Dev on my own time and made a To-Do program using react and all the basic building blocks before that in terms of technical skills, about 1 year of self learning experience. I have no education in computer science, and so I thought this message would at least show employers that I am worth hiring. Would it be a bad idea to do this masters program?

        "content": "I’ve been working at my job for about four months now. Honestly, the tasks they give me usually take me an hour at most to finish. Only a few days have actually been busy or stressful.There’s a girl in our department who’s been here for a year or so, and she’s really proven herself — they even transferred her to another department recently. My question is: how can I prove myself at work and make them rely on me more?To be fair, I did make some mistakes at the beginning, but that’s normal for anyone doing something for the first time. I’ve noticed that even before she got transferred, whenever I got assigned something, they’d tell me to ask her for help. She’s great at what she does, always asks the right questions, and when our manager comes around and talks to us, he usually makes eye contact with her — like he expects her to be the one answering.Honestly, I do feel a bit jealous sometimes. But I always follow that feeling with a prayer for her success and mine too. What makes me sad is that I spend eight hours at work with barely anything to do, while she’s always busy and people constantly come to her. It frustrates me a little because I feel like I’m just there doing nothing.",

So I’ve been jumping around different tech stacks for each project. I currently feel like a jack of all trades that knows just enough to get the job done, but I feel like this could have negative effects to my career since I don’t feel like I’ve mastered anything specific. If I plan on rising to the senior level, would it be better to find a new team where I can specialize in a specific tech stack? Or is being a master of none a viable option for the long run?",
