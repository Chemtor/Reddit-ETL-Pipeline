        "content": "*Disclaimer: this post is nothing but a rant.*---I've recently inherited a data project which is almost entirely based in Azure synapse.I can't even begin to describe the level of hatred and despair that this platform generates in me.Let's start with the biggest offender: that being Spark as the only available runtime. Because OF COURSE one MUST USE Spark to move 40 bits of data, god forbid someone thinks a firm has (*gasp!*) small data, even if the amount of companies that actually need a distributed system is less than the amount of fucks I have left to give about this industry as a whole.Luckily, I can soothe my rage by meditating during the downtimes, beacause testing code means that, if your cluster is cold, you have to wait between 2 and 5 business days to see results, meaning that each day one gets 5 meaningful commits in at most. Work-life balance, yay!Second, the bane of any sensible software engineer and their sanity: Notebooks. I believe notebooks are an invention of Satan himself, because there is not a single chance that a benevolent individual made the choice of putting notebooks in production.I know that one day, after the 1000th notebook I'll have to fix, my sanity will eventually run out, and I will start a terrorist movement against notebook users. Either that or I will immolate myself alive to the altar of sound software engineering in the hope of restoring equilibrium.Third, we have the biggest lie of them all, the scam of the century, the slithery snake, the greatest pretender: \"yOu dOn't NEeD DaTA enGINEeers!!1\".Because since engineers are expensive, these idiotic corps had to sell to other even more idiotic corps the lie that with these magical NO CODE tools, even Gina the intern from Marketing can do data pipelines!But obviously, Gina the intern from Marketing has marketing stuff to do, leaving those pipelines uncovered. Who's gonna do them now? Why of course, the same exact data engineers one was trying to replace!Except that instead of being provided with proper engineering toolbox, they now have to deal with an environment tailored for people whose shadow outshines their intellect, castrating the productivity many times over, because dragging arbitrary boxes to get a for loop done is clearly SO MUCH faster and productive than literally anything else.I understand now why our salaries are high: it's not because of the skill required to conduct our job. It's to pay the levels of insanity that we're forced to endure.But don't worry, AI will fix it.",

        "author": "bdadeveloper",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,I recently completed a data engineering screening at a startup and now I’m wondering if my approach was right and how other engineers would approach or what more experienced devs would look for. The screening was around 50 minutes, and they had me share my screen and use a blank Google Doc to jot down thoughts as needed — I assume to make sure I wasn’t using AI.The Problem:“How would you design a system to ingest ~100TB of JSON data from multiple S3 buckets”My Approach (thinking out loud, real-time mind you):•I proposed chunking the ingestion (~1TB at a time) to avoid memory overload and increase fault tolerance.•Stressed the need for a normalized target schema, since JSON structures can vary slightly between sources and timestamps may differ.•Suggested Dask for parallel processing and transformation, using Python (I’m more familiar with it than Spark).•For ingestion, I’d use boto3 to list and pull files, tracking ingestion metadata like source_id, status, and timestamps in a simple metadata catalog (Postgres or lightweight NoSQL).•Talked about a medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold):•Bronze: raw JSON copies•Silver: cleaned & normalized data•Gold: enriched/aggregated data for BI consumptionWhat clicked mid-discussion:After asking a bunch of follow-up questions, I realized the data seemed highly textual, likely news articles or similar. I was asking so many questions lol.That led me to mention:•Once the JSON is cleaned and structured (title, body, tags, timestamps), it makes sense to vectorize the content using embeddings (e.g., OpenAI, Sentence-BERT, etc.).•You could then store this in a vector database (like Pinecone, FAISS, Weaviate) to support semantic search.•Techniques like cosine similarity could allow you to cluster articles, find duplicates, or offer intelligent filtering in the downstream dashboard (e.g., “Show me articles similar to this” or group by theme).They seemed interested in the retrieval angle and I tied this back to the frontend UX, because I deduced the target of the end data was a front end dashboard that would be in front of a client The part that tripped me up:They asked: “What would happen if the source data (e.g., from Amazon S3) went down?”My answer was:“As soon as I ingest a file, I’d immediately store a copy in our own controlled storage layer — ideally following a medallion model — to ensure we can always roll back or reprocess without relying on upstream availability.”Looking back, I feel like that was a decent answer, but I wasn’t 100% sure if I framed it well. I could’ve gone deeper into S3 resiliency, versioning, or retry logic.What I didn’t do:•I didn’t write much in the Google Doc — most of my answers were verbal.•I didn’t live code — I just focused on system design and real-world workflows.•I sat back in my chair a bit (was calm), maintained decent eye contact, and ended by asking them real questions (tools they use, scraping frameworks, and why they liked the company, etc.).Of course nobody here knows what they wanted, but now I’m wondering if my solution made sense (I’m new to data engineering honestly):•Should I have written more in the doc to “prove” I wasn’t cheating or to better structure my thoughts?•Was the vectorization + embedding approach appropriate, or overkill?•Did my fallback answer about S3 downtime make sense ?",

It's a great tool to check the quality of all your dbt metadata when your dbt projects are ever-growing.We just released a new version: 0.12.0. It's now possible to:* Lint `models`, `sources`, `snapshots` and `seeds`!* Access the `parents` and `children` of a node, enabling graph traversal* Disable rules conditionally based on the properties of a dbt entityWe are highly receptive for feedback and also love to see contributions to this project!

        "author": "wearz_pantz",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I have this idea for a data lake/data warehouse architecture for my startup that I've come to based on a few problems I've experienced, I'd like to hear this subreddits' thoughts.The start up I work for has been dancing around product-market fit for several years, but hasn't quite nailed it. We though we had it in 2020 but then zero-interest rate ended, then AI, and now we're back to the drawing board. The mandate from leadership has been to re-imagine what our product can be. This means lots of change and we need to be highly nimble.Today, I follow an ELT approach. I use a combination of 3rd party ingestion tools+custom jobs to load data, then dbt to build assets (tables/views) in BigQuery that I make available to various stakeholders. My transformation pipeline looks like the following:1. staging - light transformations and 1:1 with raw source tables2. intermediate - source data integrated/conformed/cleansed3. presentation - final clean pre-joined,pre-aggregated data loosely resembling a Kimball-style star schemaStaging and intermediate layers are part of a transformation step and often change, are deleted, or otherwise break as I refactor to support the presentation layer.[Current architecture which provides either 1 type of guarantee or no guarantee](https://preview.redd.it/lw8za6s3ggye1.png?width=863&format=png&auto=webp&s=e36ac4259058bcce5ae72fbdef1e8bb7ec2e2eb5)This approach has worked to a degree. I serve a large variety of use cases and have limited data quality issues, enough that my org has started to form a team around me. But, it has created several problems that have been exacerbated by this new agility mandate from leadership:1. As a team of one and growing, it takes me too long to integrate new data into the presentation layer. This results in an inability for me to make data available fast enough to everyone who needs it, which leads to shadow and/or manual data efforts by my stakeholders2. To avoid the above I often resort to granting access to staging and intermediate layer data so that teams are unblocked. However, I often need to refactor staging/intermediate layers to appropriately support changes to the presentation layer. These refactors introduce breaking changes which creates issues/bugs in dependent workflows/dashboards. I've been disciplined about communicating to stakeholders about the risks involved, but it happens often.3. Lots of teams want a dev version of data so they can create proof-of-concepts, and develop on my data. However many of our source systems have dev/prod environments that don't integrate in the same way. ex. join keys between 2 systems' data that work in prod are not available in dev, so the highly integrated nature of the presentation layer makes it impossible to produce exact replicas of dev and prod.To solve these problems I've been considering am architectural solution that I think makes sense for a fast-moving startup... I'm proposing we break the data assets into 2 categories of data contract...1. **source-dependent**. These assets would be fast to create and make available. They are merely a replica of the data in the source system with a thin layer of abstraction (likely a single dbt model) with guarantees against changes by me/my team, but would not provide guarantees against irreconcilable changes in the source system (ie. if the source system is removed). These would also have basic documentation and metadata for discoverability. They would be similar to the staging layer in my old architecture, but rather than being an unstable step in a transformation pipeline, where refactors introduce breaking, they are standalone assets. These would also provide the ability to create dev and prod version since they are not deeply integrated with other sources. ex. \\`salesforce\\_\\_opportunities\\` all opportunities from salesforce. As long as the opportunity object in Salesforce exists, and we continue to use Salesforce as our CRM, the model will be stable/dependable.2. **source-agnostic**. The assets would be the same as the presentation layer I have today. They would be a more complex abstraction of multiple source systems, and provide guarantees against underlying changes to source systems. We would be judicious about where and when we create these. ex. \\`opportunities\\`. As long as our business cares about opportunities/deals etc. no matter if we change CRM's or the same CRM changes their contract, this will be stable/dependable[Proposed architecture which breaks assets into 2 types with different guarantees](https://preview.redd.it/mqt2ojo7ggye1.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=070c5524998a56569b96fda3201a4567489cd89d)The hope is that source-dependent assets can be used to unblock new data use cases quickly with a reasonable level of stability, and source-agnostic assets can be used to support critical/frequented data use-cases with a high level of stability.Specifically I'm curious about:1. General thoughts on this approach. Risks/warnings/vibe-check.2. Other ways to do this I should consider. It's hard to find good resources on how to deliver stable data assets/products at a fast-moving startup with limited data resourcing.

Fivetran and Airbyte costs ballooned mostly due to runtime and license/credit models.* OLake retries gracefully. No manual interventions needed unlike Debezium.* Airbyte struggled massively at scale — couldn't complete run without retries. Estuary better but still \\~11x slower.Sharing this to understand if these numbers also match with your personal experience with these tool.Note: Full Load is free for Fivetran.",

We did our research and narrowed down our search to Spark and Flink as a choice for data processing platform that can satisfy our requirements while embracing Java.Since data processing is not our main responsibility and we do not intend for it to become so as well, what would be the better option amongst Spark vs Flink so that it is easier for use to operate and maintain with the limited knowledge and best practises we possess for a large scale data engineering requirement.Any advice or suggestions is welcome.",

This has happened before where someone has randomly called me up and asked me questions but no squeak from them later on. As an individual desperate for a job I had previously answered these demeaning questions starting from second highest salary to the difference between ETL and ELT. But yesterday I was in no mood what so ever. She asked what file types I have worked on and then proceeded to ask me the difference between parquet and delta live tables. I mentioned 2 or 3 I had in mind at that moment and asked her not to ask me google questions, to which she was offended. She then went on to mention the definition and 7 points on their difference. Any other day I would have moved on saying that sorry I don't memorize these stuff, but again I wanted to have my share of the fun and asked her why each is used and when and this ended in her frantically saying that delta live tables are default and better that's why we use it.I would love to know if anyone in this group has had similar experiences.",

But that didn't change, it was like that before the increase in costs.* The tables follow the \\[One Big Table\\](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/one-big-table/) data modelling * It could be something else, but the incremental in costs came just after that.My question would be, is it possible that changing the partition granularity from DAY to MONTH resulted in such a huge increase or would it be something else that we are not aware of?",

(Not to generalize, but IMO I consider everyone in this reddit group not your \"average typical\" employee. As we all grind and self study outside of our 9-5 job which requires intense patience, sacrifice, and dedication).Currently a 31 years old, single male. I am not smart, but I am hardworking. Nothing about my past \"stands out\". I graduated from an average state school, Umass Amherst, with a Finance degree and IT minor. Went back to graduate school, Northeastern, to pursue my MS degree for Data Science while working my 9-5 job. I've never worked for a \"real tech company\" before. Previous employment history includes working at Liberty Mutual, Nielsen, and Disney. (FYI: Not Disney Streaming )For the past 2.5 years, I've been studying and applying for software engineering roles, data engineering roles, and data science roles while working my 9-5 full time job. Bc of wide range of roles, I had to study/practice leetcode, sql, pyspark, pandas, building ml models, etl pipelines, system design, etc.After 2.5 years of endless grinding, I have 2 offers for both Senior Data Engineering positions at Capital One and Fan Duel.**Question:** I'm hoping to get some feedback/opinion from Reddit to see which one, FanDuel vs. Capital One, has more potential, weight regarding company brand, that more aligns to Big Tech and will help me jump to FAANG companies in the future. Curious what all ya'll thoughts are! Any of them are much appreciated!**Reach out/Ping me:**Because I've been studying and applying for SE roles, DE roles, and DS roles , and have gotten interviews with Meta, Robinhood, Bloomberg, Amazon feel free to reach out.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone,I’m currently based in Spain, so while the job market isn’t great, it’s not as tough as in the US. A few months ago, during my final year of Computer Engineering, I realized I’m genuinely passionate about the data field, especially Data Engineering and Analytics. Since then, I’ve been self-studying with the goal of starting as a Data Analyst and eventually becoming a Data Engineer.Since January, I’ve been doing an internship at a large consulting firm (180K+ employees worldwide). Initially, they didn’t give much detail about the technologies I’d be working with, but I had no other offers, so I accepted. It turned out to involve Adelia Studio, CGS, AS400, and some COBOL, technologies unrelated to my long-term goals.These teams usually train interns in legacy systems, hoping some will stay even if it’s not what they want. But I’ve been clear about my direction and decided to take the risk. I spoke with my manager about possibly switching to a more aligned project. Some might have accepted the initial path and tried to pivot later, but I didn’t want to begin my career in a role I have zero interest in.Luckily, he understood my situation and said he’d look into possible alternatives. One of the main reasons they’re open to the change is because of my attitude and soft skills. They see genuine interest and initiative in me. That said, the feedback I’ve received on my technical performance has also been very positive. As he told me: *“We can teach someone any tech stack in the long term, but if they can’t communicate properly, they’ll be difficult to work with.”* Just a reminder that soft skills are as important as hard skills. It doesn’t matter how technically good you are if you can’t collaborate or communicate effectively with your team and clients.Thankfully, I’ve been given the chance to switch to a new project working with Murex, a widely used platform in the banking sector for trading, risk, and financial reporting. I’ll be working with technologies like Python, PL/SQL (Oracle), Shell scripting, Jira... while gaining exposure to automated testing, data pipelines, and financial data processing.However, while this project does involve some database work and scripting, it will largely revolve around working directly with the Murex platform, which isn’t strongly aligned with my long-term goal of becoming a Data Engineer. That’s why I still have some doubts. I know that Murex itself has very little correlation with that career path, but some of the tasks I’ll be doing, such as data validation, automation, and working with databases, could still help me build relevant experience.So overall, I see it as a better option than my previous assignment, since it brings me closer to the kind of work I want to do, even if it’s not with the most typical tools in the data ecosystem. I’d be really interested to hear what others think. Do you see value in gaining experience through a Murex-based project if your long-term goal is to become a Data Engineer? Any thoughts or advice are more than welcome.It’s also worth mentioning that I was told there may be opportunities to move to a more data-focused team in the future. Of course I would need to prove my skills whether through performance, projects, technical tests or completing a master’s program related to the field.Thanks to anyone who took the time to read through this and offer any kind of feedback or advice. I genuinely appreciate it. Have a good day.",

When it’s time to build BI dashboards or forecasting models, they export **flat, denormalized CSV files** often multiple files filled with repeated data, inconsistent column names, and no clear keys.Even the core databases behind the scenes are sometimes just raw transaction or log tables with minimal structure. And when we try to request a cleaner version of the data, the response is often something like:>“We can’t share it, it contains personal information.”So we end up spending days writing custom scripts, drawing ER diagrams, and trying to reverse-engineer schemas and still end up with brittle pipelines. The root issues never really go away, and that slows down everything: dashboards, models, insights.After running into this over and over, I built a small tool for myself called **LayerNEXUS** to help bridge the gap:* Upload one or many CSVs (even messy, denormalized ones)* Automatically detect relationships across files and suggest a clean, normalized (3NF) schema* Export ready-to-run SQL (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite)* Preview a visual ERD* Optional AI step for smarter key/type detectionIt’s free to try no login required for basic schema generation, and GitHub users get a few AI credits for the AI features. :link: [https://layernexus.com](https://layernexus.com) *(I’m the creator just sharing for feedback, not pushing anything)*If you’re dealing with raw log-style tables and trying to turn them into an efficient, well-structured database, this tool might help your team design something more scalable and maintainable from the ground up.Would love your thoughts:* Do you face similar issues?* What would actually make this kind of tool useful in your workflow?**Thanks in advance!** Max",

I consider myself advanced in Power BI — not an expert, but someone who can solve most problems, including performance tuning, RLS, OLS, Tabular Editor, etc.Company 2 – I built and delivered a Data Platform for a retail company (+7000 employees) using Microsoft Fabric. I was the main and principal engineer for the platform for 1.5 years, using Azure Data Factory, Dataflows, Spark Notebooks (basic Spark and Python, such as reading, writing, using APIs, partitioning...), Delta Tables (very good understanding), schema modeling (silver and gold layers), lakehouse governance, understanding business needs, and creating complex SQL queries to extract data from transactional databases. I consider myself intermediate-advanced in SQL (for the market), including window functions, CTEs, etc. I can solve many intermediate and almost all easy LeetCode problems.Company 3 – I just started (20,000+ employees). I'm working in a Data Integration team, using a lot of Talend for ingestion from various sources, and also collaborating with the Databricks team.Freelance Projects (2 years) – I developed some Power BI dashboards and organized databases for two small companies using Sheets, excel and BigQuery.Nowadays, I'm learning a lot of Talend to deliver my work in the best way possible. By the end of the year, I might need to move to another country for family reasons. I’ll step away from the Data Engineering field for a while and will have time to study (maybe for 1.5 years), so I would like to strengthen my knowledge base.I can program in Python a bit. I’ve created some functions, connected to Microsoft Graph through Spark Notebooks, ingested data, and used Selenium for personal projects. I haven't developed my technical skills further mainly because I haven't needed to use Python much at work.I don’t plan to study Databricks, Snowflake, Data Factory, DBT, BigQuery, and AIs deeply, since I already have some experience with them. I understand their core concepts, which I think is enough for now. I’ll have the opportunity to practice these tools through freelancing in the future. I believe I just need to understand what each tool does — the core concepts remain the same. Or am I wrong?I’ve planned a few things to study. I believe a Data Engineer with 5 years of experience should starts understand algorithms, networking, programming languages, software architecture, etc. I found the OSSU University project (https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). Since I’ve already completed an engineering degree, I don’t need to do everything again, but it looks like a really good path.So, my plan — following OSSU — is to complete these subjects over the next 1.5 years:Systematic Program DesignClass-based Program DesignProgramming Languages, Part A (Is that necessary?)Programming Languages, Part B (Is that necessary?)Programming Languages, Part C (Is that necessary?)Object-Oriented DesignSoftware ArchitectureMathematics for Computer Science (Is that necessary?)The Missing Semester of Your CS Education (Looks interesting)Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to TetrisBuild a Modern Computer from First Principles: Nand to Tetris Part IIOperating Systems: Three Easy PiecesComputer Networking: a Top-Down ApproachDivide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized AlgorithmsGraph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data StructuresGreedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic ProgrammingShortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About ThemCybersecurity FundamentalsPrinciples of Secure CodingIdentifying Security VulnerabilitiesIdentifying Security Vulnerabilities in C/C++ Programming or Exploiting and Securing Vulnerabilities in Java ApplicationsDatabases: Modeling and TheoryDatabases: Relational Databases and SQLDatabases: Semistructured DataMachine LearningComputer GraphicsSoftware Engineering: IntroductionEthics, Technology and Engineering (Is that necessary?)Intellectual Property Law in Digital Age (Is that necessary?)Data Privacy FundamentalsAdvanced programmingAdvanced systemsAdvanced theoryAdvanced Information SecurityAdvanced math (Is that necessary?)Any other recommendations is very welcoming!!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all,I've recently completed an audit of all datetime-like fields across our data warehouse (Snowflake) and observed a variety of data types being used across different layers (raw lake, staging, dbt models):* `DATETIME` (wallclock timestamps from transactional databases)* `TIMESTAMP_LTZ` (used in Iceberg tables)* `TIMESTAMP_TZ` (generated by external pipelines)* `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` (miscellaneous sources)As many of you know, mixing timezone-aware and timezone-naive types can quickly become problematic.I’m trying to define some internal standards and would appreciate some guidance:1. Are there established best practices or conventions by layer (raw/staging/core) that you follow for datetime handling?2. For wallclock `DATETIME` values (timezone-naive), is it recommended to convert them to a standard timezone-aware format during ingestion?3. Regarding the presentation layer (specifically Looker), should time zone conversions be avoided there to prevent inconsistencies, or are there cases where handling timezones at this layer is acceptable?Any insights or examples of how your teams have handled this would be extremely helpful!Thanks in advance!",

I thought I'd save the next person a circuitous journey by just laying out the 1-2-3 steps (huge shout out to o3). Full tutorial linked below - but these steps are the true TL;DR :backhand_index_pointing_down:# 1. Set up your stack with dockerSave this as `docker-compose.yml` (includes Postgres, Kafka, Zookeeper, and Kafka Connect): services: zookeeper: image: quay.io/debezium/zookeeper:3.1 ports: [\"2181:2181\"] kafka: image: quay.io/debezium/kafka:3.1 depends_on: [zookeeper] ports: [\"29092:29092\"] environment: ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181 KAFKA_LISTENERS: INTERNAL://0.0.0.0:9092,EXTERNAL://0.0.0.0:29092 KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: INTERNAL://kafka:9092,EXTERNAL://localhost:29092 KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP: INTERNAL:PLAINTEXT,EXTERNAL:PLAINTEXT KAFKA_INTER_BROKER_LISTENER_NAME: INTERNAL KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1 connect: image: quay.io/debezium/connect:3.1 depends_on: [kafka] ports: [\"8083:8083\"] environment: BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS: kafka:9092 GROUP_ID: 1 CONFIG_STORAGE_TOPIC: connect_configs OFFSET_STORAGE_TOPIC: connect_offsets STATUS_STORAGE_TOPIC: connect_statuses KEY_CONVERTER_SCHEMAS_ENABLE: \"false\" VALUE_CONVERTER_SCHEMAS_ENABLE: \"false\" postgres: image: debezium/postgres:15 ports: [\"5432:5432\"] command: postgres -c wal_level=logical -c max_wal_senders=10 -c max_replication_slots=10 environment: POSTGRES_USER: dbz POSTGRES_PASSWORD: dbz POSTGRES_DB: inventoryThen run: bashdocker compose up -d# 2. Configure Postgres and create test table bash # Create replication user docker compose exec postgres psql -U dbz -d inventory -c \"CREATE USER repuser WITH REPLICATION ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'repuser';\" # Create test table docker compose exec postgres psql -U dbz -d inventory -c \"CREATE TABLE customers (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255), email VARCHAR(255));\" # Enable full row images for updates/deletes docker compose exec postgres psql -U dbz -d inventory -c \"ALTER TABLE customers REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;\"# 3. Register Debezium connectorCreate a file named `register-postgres.json`: json{ \"name\": \"inventory-connector\", \"config\": { \"connector.class\": \"io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector\", \"database.hostname\": \"postgres\", \"database.port\": \"5432\", \"database.user\": \"repuser\", \"database.password\": \"repuser\", \"database.dbname\": \"inventory\", \"topic.prefix\": \"inventory\", \"slot.name\": \"inventory_slot\", \"publication.autocreate.mode\": \"filtered\", \"table.include.list\": \"public.customers\" } }Register it: bash curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data u/register-postgres.json http://localhost:8083/connectors# 4. Test it outOpen a Kafka consumer to watch for changes: bash docker compose exec kafka kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --topic inventory.public.customers --from-beginningIn another terminal, insert a test row: bash docker compose exec postgres psql -U dbz -d inventory -c \"INSERT INTO customers(name,email) VALUES ('Alice','alice@example.com');\"**:chequered_flag: You should see a JSON message appear in your consumer with the change event! :chequered_flag:**Of course, if you already have a database running locally, you can extract that from the docker and adjust the connector config (step 3) to just point to that table.I wrote a [complete step-by-step tutorial](https://blog.sequinstream.com/postgres-cdc-with-debezium-complete-step-by-step-tutorial/) with detailed explanations of each step if you need a bit more detail!",

Currently, they mainly want to run batch job pipelines, and a clear requirement is that the orchestration tool must be self-hosted on Kubernetes AND OSS.My initial thought was to go with Apache Airflow, but the growing ecosystem of \"next-gen\" tools (e.g. Dagster, Prefect, Mage, Windmill etc.) makes it hard to keep track of the trade-offs.At the moment, I tend towards either Airflow or Dagster to get somehow started..My key questions:* What are the meaningful pros and cons of Airflow vs. Dagster in real-world deployments?* One key thing could also be that the client wants this platform useable by different teams and therefore a good Multi-tenancy setup would be helpful. Here I see that Airflow has disadvantges compared to most of \"next-gen\" tools like Dagster? Do you agree/disagree?* Are there technical or organizational arguments for preferring one over the other?* One thing that bothers me with many Airflow alternatives is that the open-source (self-hosted) version often comes with feature limitations (e.g. multi-tenant support, integrations, or observability e.g. missing audit logs etc.). How has your experience been with this??An opinion from experts who built a similar self-hosted setup would therefore be very interesting :)",

        "content": "Hello folks, I recently joined a research center with a mission to manage data generated from our many labs. This is my first time building data infrastructure, I'm eager to learn from you in the industry.We deal with a variety of data. Time-series from sensor data log, graph data from knowledge graph, and vector data from literature embedding. We also have relational data coming from characterization. Right now, each lab manages their own data, they are all saved as Excel for csv files in disperse places.From initial discussion, we think that we should do the following:A. Find databases to house the lab operational data.B. Implement a data lake to centralize all the data from different labsC. Turn all relational data to documents (JSON), as schema might evolve and we don't really do heave analytics or reporting, AI/ML modelling is more of the focus.If you have any comments on the above points, they will be much appreciated.I also have a question in mind:1. For databases, is it better to find specific database for each type of data (neo4j for graph, Chroma for vector...etc), or we would be better of with a general purpose database (e.g. Cassandra) that houses all types of data to simplify managing processes but to lose specific computing capacity for each data type(for example, Cassandra can't do graph traversal)?2. Cloud infrastructure seems to be the trend, but we have our own data center so we need to leverage it. Is it possible to use the managed solution from Cloud provides (Azure, AWS, we don't have a preference yet) and still work with our own storage and compute on-prem?Thank you for reading, would love to hear from you.",

The role offers the stability I’m looking for, but the tech stack centers around Microsoft Fabric, which I know is still new and polarizing in the data engineering community.

I’m just not sure if this is the right move for long-term growth — especially since I enjoy hands-on coding and working with more flexible, open tools.My questions:Has anyone made a similar shift from tools they love to a more rigid/abstracted stack? How did it go?How much of a “career risk” is moving into Fabric right now, given it’s still maturing?What would you prioritize in this situation — toolset you love or full-time security (especially with a growing family)?What other factors should I be weighing in this kind of decision?Appreciate any insights or personal experiences you can share!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I’m an ML Engineer working in a team where ML is new, and I’m collaborating with data engineers who are integrating model predictions into our data warehouse (DWH) for the first time.We have a traditional DWH setup with raw, staging, source core, analytics core, and reporting layers. The analytics core is where different data sources are joined and modeled before being exposed to reporting.Our project involves two text classification models that predict two kinds of categories based on article text and metadata. These articles are often edited, and we might need to track both article versions and historical model predictions, besides of course saving the latest predictions. The predictions are ultimately needed in the reporting layer.The data team proposed this workflow:1.Add a new reporting-ml layer to stage model-ready inputs.2.Run ML models on that data.3.Send predictions back into the raw layer, allowing them to flow up through staging, source core, and analytics core, so that versioning and lineage are handled by the existing DWH logic.This feels odd to me — pushing derived data (ML predictions) into the raw layer breaks the idea of it being “raw” external data. It also seems like unnecessary overhead to send predictions through all the layers just to reach reporting. Moreover, the suggestion seems to break the unidirectional flow of the current architecture. Finally, I feel some of these things like prediction versioning could or should be handled by a feature store or similar. Is this a good approach? What are the best practices for integrating ML predictions into traditional data warehouse architectures — especially when you need versioning and auditability?Would love advice or examples from folks who’ve done this.",

But I recently came across the concept of **Event Sourcing,** where every state change is stored as an immutable event, and you can replay the full history of a system to reconstruct its state at any point in time.are there any platforms in the industrial or IoT space that actually use event sourcing at scale? or do organization build their own tools for this purpose?Totally open to being corrected if I’ve misunderstood anything, just trying to learn from folks who work with these systems.",

        "content": "Hi. Background: We want to deploy a new clickhouse cluster, and retire our old one. The problem we have rn is that our older cluster version is very old (19.x.x), and our team could not update it for the past few years. After trying to upgrade the cluster gracefully, we have decided to go against it, and deploy a new cluster, sync the data between these two and then retire the old one. Both clusters are only getting inserts by a set of similar kafka engine tables that are inserting new data into materialized views that populate the inner tables. But the inner table schemas have changed a bit. I tried clickhouse-backup, but the issue is that the database/metadata have changed, the definition of our tables, zookeeper paths and etc (our previous config had faults). For this issue, we could not also use clickhouse-copier. I'm currently thinking of writing an ELT pipeline, that reads that from our source clickhouse and writes it to our destination one with some changes. I tried looking up AirByte and DLT, but the guides are mostly about using clickhouse as a sink, not a source. There is also the option of writing the data to kafka, and consume it on the target cluster from kafka, but I could not find a way to do a full kafka dump using clickhouse. The problem of clickhouse being the sink in most tools/guides is also apparent hereCan anybody help me out? It's been pretty cumbersome as of now.",

So, what I am thinking is creating a \"gold\" layer table with a stable schema according to what we need for analytics then add an ETL job that converts from raw to \"gold\" (quotes because I don't necessarily to go full medallion)This way, when the source schema changes, we only need to update the ETL job rather than every analytics report.

        "content": "Hello everyone! :waving_hand:I've recently started a side project using AWS and Python. A core part involves running multiple Lambda functions daily. Each Lambda generates a CSV file based on its specific logic.Sometimes, the CSVs produced by these different Lambdas have data quality issues – things like missing columns, unexpected NaN values, incorrect data types, etc.Before storing the data into DynamoDB, I need a process to:1. Gather the CSV outputs from all the different Lambdas.2. Check each CSV against predefined quality standards (correct schema, no forbidden NaN, etc.).3. Only process and store the data from CSVs that meet the quality standards. Discard or flag data from invalid CSVs.4. Load the cleaned, valid data into DynamoDB. This is a side project, so minimizing AWS costs is crucial. Looking for the most budget-friendly approach. Furthermore, the entire project is in Python, so Python-based solutions are ideal. Environment is AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB).**What's the simplest and most cost-effective AWS architecture/pattern to achieve this?**I've considered a few ideas, like maybe having all Lambdas dump CSVs into an S3 bucket and then triggering *another* central Lambda to do the validation and DynamoDB loading, but I'm unsure if that's the best way.Looking for recommendations on services (maybe S3 events, SQS, Step Functions, another Lambda?) and best practices for handling this kind of data validation pipeline on a tight budget.Thanks in advance for your help! :)",

        "content": "The request on this project is to build a transformation layer on top of a transactional 3NF database that's in Azure SQL standard tier.One desire is to separate the load from the analytics and transformation work from the transactional system and allow the ability to scale them separately.Where I'm running into issues is finding a simple way to replicate the transactional database to a place where I can build some dbt models on top of it.Standard tier doesn't support built-in read replicas, and even if it did, those won't run DDL so not a place where dbt can be used.I tried making a geo-replica then on that new azure sql server, a sibling database to use as the dbt target, and set up the geo-replica as the source in dbt, but that results in cross-database queries which apparently azure sql doesn't support.Am I missing some convenient options or architectures here? Or do I really just need to set up a bunch of data factory or airbyte jobs to replicate/sync the source down to the dbt target?Also, I realize azure sql is not really a columnar storage warehouse platform, this is not TB or barely even GB of data though, so it will probably be alright if we're mindful of writing good code. And if we needed to move to azure postgres we could, if we had a way to deal simply with getting the source replicated out to somewhere I can run dbt, meaning either cross-database queries, or to a database that allows running DDL statements.Open to all ideas and feedback here, it's been a pain to go one by one through all the various azure/ms sql replication services and find that none of them really solves this problem at all.Edit - data factory may be the way? Trying to think about how to potentially parameterize something like this docs page is doing so I dint need a copy activity for all 140 or so tables that all need maintained manually. Some will be ok as full replacements, others will need incremental to stay performant.

That made me realize these might be useful to others learning programming and computer science online.So, I wanted to share the playlist here on r/learnprogramming in case it helps anyone else out there. The course emphasizes analysis of algorithms — especially time complexity — and aims to build strong intuition about how and why algorithms work. It also covers key data structures along the way, including heaps, binary search trees, hash tables, and others, as well as the time complexity analysis on their operations.The course is still ongoing, so I’ll be adding new videos each week for a few more weeks.Here’s the playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3fg3zQpW0k4TYTBwPFrGkXDJ1Xh4IHyv.No pressure — just putting it out there in case it’s helpful to anyone. Happy learning, and feel free to reach out if you have any feedback or questions.",

        "author": "MrPlatinumsGames",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I’m working on a frontend-heavy dashboard project involving 5-10 APIs (mostly to showcase that I know how to use them and JSON), but I’m wondering how to hide the API key while keeping it functional when I host the app on GitHub pages. I’ve read it involves creating a new file with the terminal (which I’m not particularly comfortable using). Is there any other way of doing it? Also, what would the consequences of not hiding API keys be and will the rest of the code still be visible to people I share it with?Edit: thank you for all the comments everyone—they’ve been very helpful and eye opening. As an addendum, here’s my plan to address all the security concerns that have been brought up:(First, though, I’ve already revoked/made new API keys and haven’t committed them to GitHub, so please don’t worry about that anymore.)1. I think I’m going to go with GitHub secrets as the most simple way to still have the page functional and secure on pages to share with potential co-ops. Alternatively, I’m going to look into Netlify, which a lot of people have recommended as a simple solution. 2. After that’s done, I’m going to create an alternate version where I use PHPmyAdmin to store the keys and then retrieve them with PHP to showcase doing both (that’s the plan anyways). I’ve avoided PHP since I don’t really understand servers and hosting (haven’t had a class on that yet). Like I don’t know how to make PHP work outside my XAMPP htdocs folder, and it won’t be functional for people I share with (to my knowledge).As always, any additional advice would be appreciated, especially if there’s anything wrong with my intended approaches",

        "content": "I graduated about 1 year ago in Computer Science and got my Software Engineer badge for taking the extra courses. I’m in a terrible predicament and would really appreciate any advice, comments, anything really. I studied in school for about 5 years (including a 1 year internship) and have never built a complex project leveraging any of my skills in api integration, AI, data structures,networking, etc. I’ve only created low risk applications like calculators and still relied on other people’s ideas to see myself through. In my final year of school, I really enjoyed android development due to our mobile dev class and really wanted to pursue that niche for my career. Unfortunately, all I’ve done in that time is procrastinate, not making any progress in my goal and stagnating. I can’t complete any leetcode easies, build a simple project on my own (without any google assistant, I barely know syntax honestly, and have weak theoretical knowledge. I’ve always been fascinated by computers and software and this is right up my alley but I haven’t applied myself until very recently. Right after graduation, I landed a research position due to connections but again, played it safe and wasted my opportunity. I slacked off, build horrible projects when I did work, and didn’t progress far. I’ve been unemployed for two months and never got consistent with my android education until last week. I’ve been hearing nothing but doom and gloom about the job market and my own stupidity made everything way worse. My question is: Though I’ve finally gotten serious enough to learn and begin programming and building projects, is it too late for me to make in the industry? I’m currently going through the Android basics compose course by google, am I wasting my time? I really want to do this and make this my career and become a competent engineer but I have a feeling that I might’ve let that boat pass me by. Apologies for sounding pathetic there, I will be better. I’ve also been approached by friends to build an application involving LLMs with them but I have no idea where to start there either. Any suggestions, comments, advice, or anything would be very appreciated. I’m not really sure what’s been going on in my life until recently when I began to restore order and look at the bigger picture. I’m a 24 year old male.Thank you for reading.",

        "author": "travel_through_r",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi! I'm new here, so sorry in advance if I broke some rule.Anyway... During high school, I learned procedural programming (C++), basics of data structures, computer architecture... and as a result, I think I've become somewhat skilled in solving algorithmic tasks.Now at university, I started with object oriented programming (mostly C++ again) and I think that I understand all the basics (classes and objects, constructors/destructors, fields/methods, inheritance...) while all my professors swear that this approach is far better than procedural programming which I used to do (they mostly cite code reusability and security as reason why).The problem is that, even though I already did dozens of, mostly small sized, object oriented programs so far, I still don't see any benefits of it. In fact, it would be easier to me to just make procedural programs while not having to think about object oriented decomposition and stuff like that. Also, so far I haven't see any reason to use inheritance/polymorphism.The \"biggest\" project I did until now is assembler that reads contents of a file with assembly commands and translates it to binary code (I created classes Assembler, SymbolTable, Command... but I could have maybe even easier achieve the same result with procedural approach by simply making structures and global functions that work with instances of those structures).So, my question is: **can someone explain me in simple terms what are the benefits of object oriented programming and when should I use it?**To potentially make things easier to explain and better understand the differences, I even made a small example of a program done with both approaches.So, lets say, you need to create a program \"ObjectParser\" where user can choose to parse and save input strings with some predefined form (every string represents one object and its attributes) or to access already parsed one.Now, let's compare the two paradigms:**1. Procedural:**\\- First you would need to define some custom structure to represent object: struct Object { // fields }\\- Since global variables are considered a bad practice, in main method you should create a map to store parsed objects: std::map objects;\\- Then you should create one function to parse a string from a file (user enters name of a file) and one to access an attribute of a saved object (user provides name of the object and name of the attribute) void parseString(std::map& objects, std::string filename) { // parsing and storing the string } std::string getValue(std::map& objects, std::string object_name, std::string attribute_name) { // retrieving the stored object's attribute }\\* Notice that you need to pass the map to function since it's not a global object\\- Then you write the rest of the main method to get user input in a loop (user chooses to either parse new or retrieve saved object)**2. Object oriented**\\- First you would create a class called Parser and inside the private section of that class define structure or class called Object (you can also define this class outside, but since we will only be using it inside Parser class it makes sense that it's the integral part of it).One of the private fields would be a map of objects and it will have two public methods, one for parsing a new string and one to retrieve an attribute of already saved one. class Parser { public: void parseString(std::string filename) { // parsing and storing the string } std::string getValue(std::string object_name, std::string attribute_name) { // retrieving the stored object's attribute } private: struct Object { // fields Object(...) { // Object constructor body } } std::map objects; }\\* Notice that we use default \"empty\" constructor since the custom one is not needed in this case.\\- Then you need to create a main method which will instantiate the Parser and use than instance to parse strings or retrieve attributes after getting user input the same way as in the procedural example.**Discussing the example:**Correct me if I wrong, but I think that both of these would work and it's how you usually make procedural and object oriented programs respectively.Now, except for the fact that in the first example you need to pass the map as an argument (which is only a slight inconvenience) I don't see why the second approach is better, **so if it's easier for you to explain it by using this example or modified version of it, feel free to do it.****IMPORTANT**: This is not, by any means, an attempt to belittle object oriented programming or to say that other paradigms are superior. I'm still a beginner, who is trying to grasp its benefits (probably because I'm yet to make any large scale application).Thanks in advance!**Edit**: Ok, as some of you pointed out, even in my \"procedural\" example I'm using std::string and std::map (internally implemented in OOP manner), so both examples are actually object oriented. For the sake of the argument, lets say that instead of std::string I use an array of characters while when it comes to std::map it's an instance of another custom struct and a bunch of functions to modify it (now when I think about it, combining all this into a logical unit \"map\" is an argument in favor of OOP by itself).",

Literally have written hundreds of pages of IT documentation, guides, scripts, etc. Documenting literally everything I do and writing automation to do things easier.My CTO said that the head of dev needed my help with something and I was told that she noticed the way that I document and script and needed my cross-functional knowledge for something that our application (that we sell to clients) does with good documentation and validation.Long story short, she needed a JSON schema so they could make JSON files for something the application does that integrates with IT systems our clients use. Something to define all of the configurations possible and enumerate all the values for each property so that the configuration could be validated by our software's automation. (Most devs know very little about IT infrastructure, so my cross-functional knowledge was know enough of both worlds to be able to make something sensible.)It's such a small thing, but she assigned a task in their dev tracker and I did a PR into a live software project for a company that I work for the first time in my life and even though I'm not a dev (yet!) it's still made me feel like in a small part I'm almost reached that thing that I've literally dreamed of doing for 35 years.I didn't have anyone else to share this with, so I hope you don't mind me sharing the story here.",

I have made my own http server, back end web app type stuff, simple CLI stuff etc. I worked with python briefly and now really only use golang. I suppose the next step would be learn some front end and start making fully fledged applications/web apps. But it sounds uninteresting to me. I think I am interested in lower level stuff. I started reading \"Modern C\" just for 20-30 mins a day. But I don't want to be that guy thats mediocre at many languages. So I still want to use Go.I am so lost though, what path do i take if making web apps is uninteresting? I am currently enrolled in math classes, but I need more time (another 6 months) to genuinely use calculus or other more complex math in my programs. E.G. graphics ,rendering, things like that. Pls help , Im feeling lost, but I still like programming. I need some sort of capstone project",

        "content": "I started my programming journey almost four years ago when I was 18, with no background in computers. I began with HTML, basic CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. Later, I discovered Laravel, a PHP framework, and started working on backend development. Over time, I became skilled in Laravel and really enjoyed building applications.As I grew, I realized that I needed a deeper understanding of PHP itself, so I took the time to learn PHP as well. I ended up creating the backend for many mobile applications and worked on complex projects. At that time, I was working at a service-based company, so I had to work on whatever came my way. That’s how I also ended up learning Node.js.You could say I’m a backend developer who can work with a variety of frameworks like Laravel, Livewire, CakePHP, and Node.js.Currently, I’m working at a fintech, product-based company. But here’s the funny part — even after four years of experience, I still feel like something is missing. I’m not sure what to learn next to truly grow. I've never done LeetCode problems, but I’m very good at solving real-world, complex problems that arise during application development.I also have a basic understanding of low-level languages like C++. But now I’m at a crossroads. Sometimes I feel like I should improve my JavaScript skills and learn React. Other times, I feel drawn toward AI and want to explore how to get better at that.There’s a lot of confusion in my mind right now.I’m 22, and I still love learning and building new things. I genuinely enjoy creating. But I’m unsure what to learn next — something that will help me grow both financially and technically, and truly make me better.Can you guys please give me some good advice ?",

Instead, you can use AI to generate the code then ask the AI to explain how the code works so you get to know how things work. You have to keep asking the AI questions on how each line of that code works. He says that companies want you to get things done, they don't care how you did that. Hence all you need to know is how a code works and this method gets you ahead.How would you do that?",

        "content": "I was a math/CS major in college, and afterwards worked for two years as a software engineer (in Java/SQL). I then switched careers and spent the next 25 years successfully doing something completely unrelated, writing code only extremely occasionally in essentially \"toy\" environments (e.g., simple Basic code in Excel to automate some processes). In the meantime, I sort of missed \"real\" coding, but not enough to switch back careers, and I completely missed all the developments that happened during those 25 years, in terms of tooling, frameworks, etc. Back when I was coding, there was no GitHub, Stack Overflow, Golang, React, cloud, Kubernetes, Microservices, etc., and even Python wasn't really a thing (it existed, but almost nobody was using it seriously in production). I now have an idea for an exciting (and fairly complex) project, and enough time and flexibility (and fire in the belly) to build it myself - at least the initial version to see if the idea has legs before involving other people. Haven't had such an itch to code in 25 years :) So my question is - what is the fastest and most efficient way to learn the modern \"developer stack\" and current frameworks, both to start building quickly and at the same time make sure that whatever I do is consistent with modern best practices and available frameworks? The project will involve a big database on the backend, with a Web client on the frontend, and whatever is available through the Web client would also need to be available via an API. For the initial version, of course I don't need it to support many requests at the same time, but I do want to architect it in a way that it could potentially support a huge number of concurrent requests/be essentially infinitely scalable. I'm not sure where to start \"catching up\" on the entire stack - from tools like Cursor and GitHub to Web frameworks like React to backend stuff - and I am also a bit worried that there are things \"I don't know that I don't know\" (with the things I mentioned, at least I know they exist and roughly understand what they do, but I am worried about \"blind spots\" I may have). There is of course a huge amount of material online, but most of what I found is either super specific and assumes a lot of background knowledge about that particular technology, OR the opposite, it assumes no knowledge of programming at all, and starts out with \"for\" loops and such and moves painfully slowly. I would very much appreciate any suggestions on the above (or any parts of the above) that would help me catch up quickly (obviously not to the expert level on any of these, but to a \"workable\" one) and start building. Thank you so much!",

The idea is to create a simple but useful tool that helps track and plan chess study sessions.Here’s what I’m thinking it could include:* Logging how much time you spend training and breaking it down by category (like tactics, openings, endgames, etc.)* Weekly planning (customizable by category or phase)* Personal notes for each session* Stats over time (weekly/monthly) with charts* Daily reminders and puzzles based on what you’ve been training* The option to export all your data to CSV or ExcelI’m still pretty new to all this, and I don’t really know everything that goes into building an app like this, and I'm not sure what would be the best language or tools to use—especially for building the UI, storing the data, and maybe even connecting it to platforms like Lichess or [Chess.com](http://Chess.com) in the future.So my question is: **What does it actually take to build a desktop app like this? What programming languages, tools, or technologies would you recommend? And where should I start if I want to learn how to build it from scratch?**",

But after that, I shifted paths, completed a 2-year diploma in electrical engineering, then spent 6 months learning smartphone repair. During that time, I completely lost touch with coding and now barely remember anything.Despite that, working in tech as a software developer has always been a dream. I sometimes doubt if I’m smart enough, but I’m willing to give it everything I’ve got.I don’t plan to go the traditional college route. I believe real skills and practical projects matter more than degrees today. So, I’m choosing the self-taught path.My question is:Is it truly possible to become a front-end developer through self-learning and land an internship or junior role within a year if I build a few good projects?Would love to hear from anyone who’s done it or is on the same journey.",

I probably could have brought in a package to handle opening and closing a side menu but figured that would have been unnecessary? I did end up installing a package solely for closing the side menu when you click somewhere outside of it because absolutely nothing was working and Stack Overflow couldn't help.Anyway, could I have just installed a bunch of these tiny packages that handle things to cut down on code or should I try to stick to coding it myself to keep the file size down?",

Since I need a bit of side income to support myself, I started looking into freelancing opportunities. After doing some research, Django seemed like a solid option—it's Python-based, powerful, and in demand.I started a Django course and was making decent progress, but then my finals came up, and I had to put everything on hold. Now that my exams are over, I have around 15–20 free days before things pick up again, and I'm wondering—should I continue with Django and try to build something that could help me earn a little through freelancing (on platforms like Fiverr or LinkedIn)? Or is there something else that might get me to my goal faster?Just to clarify—I'm not chasing big money. Even a small side income would be helpful right now while I continue learning and growing. Long-term, my dream is to pursue a master's in Machine Learning and become an ML engineer. I have a huge passion for AI and ML, and I want to build a strong foundation while also being practical about my current needs as a student.I know this might sound like a confused student running after too many things at once, but I’d really appreciate any honest advice from those who’ve been through this path. Am I headed in the right direction? Or am I just stuck in the tutorial loop?Thanks in advance!",

And am completing the Jose Padilla Python Zero to Hero Course on udemy, I plan on then learning about Data Structures and Algorithms, I have some resources I can tackle it with. Including Abdul Bari on youtube the whole playlist. This course on youtube by freecodecamp that covers all of DSA on Python. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkYVOmU3MgA&t=54s&ab\\_channel=freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkYVOmU3MgA&t=54s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) Theres also this one which is more general [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hly31xKli0&ab\\_channel=freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hly31xKli0&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) and also a playlist on youtube by Greg Hogg on DSA. Also another resource on DSA was a course on udemy by Eishad Karimov. So. there are a lot of options on DSA, excited to learn all this.After that or while doing the DSA course I plan on completing, leetcode questions, this practice section on geeksforgeeks [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?page=1&sortBy=submissions&itm\\_source=geeksforgeeks&itm\\_medium=main\\_header&itm\\_campaign=practice\\_header](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?page=1&sortBy=submissions&itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=main_header&itm_campaign=practice_header) and this course by neetcode offering on freecodecamp which is the top 150 asked questions for interviewers? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0u5nwSA0w0&ab\\_channel=freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0u5nwSA0w0&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)The problem that I am facing right now is that all this is for data science and ai I believe that Python is for, and I can use frameworks? I don't really understand it all very well. But my end goal is to create applications that can help give me streams of income. I understand what you will say that coding shouldn't be about the money, but I am genuinely interested in learning all the crevices of this large iceberg. I picked this route because it seemed to be a good starting point with a good roadmap. But as I started to go deeper there was just so much information that I really don't even know where to begin. Learned something about SQL, Flask, Tailwind CSS? The source of inspiration for all this was this video by stoneycodes [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvO88XxNAzs&ab\\_channel=stoneycodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvO88XxNAzs&ab_channel=stoneycodes) Anyway is this a good starting point? Like I said the end goal is to be able to create apps that I believe will make peoples lives easier. I've loving programming for a couple years now but a recent epiphany made me realize that if you want something you gotta go get it! Stop waiting for it. create your own luck if you want to say. Currently the python course by jose padilla, is frying my brain, the practice problems make my brain stop working. I don't know.. Some advice is appreciated it you're willing to share. Thank you have a blessed day! P.S sorry for spelling errors :o",

I recently got back into programming and I've been learning for a few years now. I'm about to start my 3rd year of my Computer Science major. I have ADHD... really bad ADHD. Obviously, I'm medicated now, and that helps. My problem is trying to remember proper syntax. I can code just fine. Passed all my classes so far. Worked with C++, C#, Java, HTML, and CSS without issues EXCEPT I cannot remember proper syntax for the life of me. I know what I need to do. I know how to get there. I just can't ever remember code syntax and structure. Going from C++ to C# was especialy frustrating. I can't tell you how many times I wrote Console.PrintLine() instead of Console.WriteLine(). I constantly have to have a reference open on my computer to help me remember syntax. Here's an example: Lets say I'm building a class. I would need to have something like this open to help me remember syntax: public class MediaItem { // Properties common to all media items public string Title { get; set; } public int PublicationYear { get; set; } // Constructor for the base class public MediaItem(string title, int publicationYear) { Title = title; PublicationYear = publicationYear; Console.WriteLine(\"MediaItem constructor called.\"); } // A virtual method that can be overridden by derived classes public virtual void DisplayInfo() { Console.WriteLine($\"Title: {Title}\"); Console.WriteLine($\"Publication Year: {PublicationYear}\"); }I would need to have this open in OneNote so I can reference because my memory is so terrible. Is this a bad practice? Is this a normal problem? Obviously, I know it will get better with repetition, but it is very frustrating.",

        "content": "Hey, guys! I'm planning to self-study computer science from scratch with the goal of reaching a job-ready (junior-to-mid level) skillset. My focus is on mastering both core CS concepts and practical skills. I want a clear, efficient roadmap that covers fundamental topics, hands-on coding, and system design — essentially the skills expected in a CS job, even if I don't plan to apply for one. Here's my current plan: 1. Core CS Fundamentals: Study algorithms, data structures, operating systems, networks, databases, and computer architecture. 2. Programming Proficiency: Deeply learn one or two programming languages (considering Python and JavaScript/TypeScript). 3. Project Development: Build real-world applications (web and backend) and contribute to open-source projects. 4. System Design: Learn scalable architecture principles, database management, and cloud deployment. I'll use a mix of free online courses (like CS50, MIT OCW, The Odin Project, and freeCodeCamp) alongside other online resources. ### My Questions:- Is this roadmap practical? What changes or additions would you recommend?- What are the best, up-to-date resources for self-learning computer science (e.g., YouTube channels, blogs, creators, platforms)?- Given the current trends of vibe coding, what can self-learners prioritize or skip?- Any vibe coding tools to recommend?- What common mistakes should self-learners in CS avoid?I'd love to hear from anyone who has successfully self-studied CS or has experience in the field.

        "author": "Tough_Trust5713",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "The prior post about this provider of bootcamps has been archived by Reddit and doesn't allow to post comments, and the only allowed comment isn't genuine in my view: I believe the DfE should initiate an investigation into the Software Development online bootcamp by this provider that they fully subsidise, to ensure accountability and protect future participants from what I deem unprofessional and childish behavior by its leads.Below, I outline my key concerns:1) **Misleading duration.** The bootcamp was advertised on the Academy website as a 16-week training program to qualify participants as full-stack software developers, and when I enrolled I confirmed I agreed to 16 weeks. However, when I asked for proof of studies letter, the founder informed me via email that the duration was only 12 weeks, undermining the program’s promised scope and depth. I believe that shortening the DeF-agreed programme undermines the DfE’s expectation of transparency and value for money, and might reduce its effectiveness.2) **Misleading capacity.** The program was promoted as limited to 10 students, ensuring a 1:10 instructor-to-student ratio for personalized learning, including 1:1 office hours during lunch breaks, as described in the enrollment interview. Yet, an email from the administrator was sent to 24 students, significantly exceeding the advertised capacity and diluting the quality of instruction. This is concerning because Skills Bootcamps under the NSF must provide \"intensive, focused training to ensure participants gain employable skills\", and overcrowding can compromise this.3) **Breach of DPA.** The administrator failed to use Bcc in group emails, publicly disclosing the personal contact details of all participants without consent. This violates the data protection standards outlined by the DfE, which emphasize the need to protect personal data and respond effectively to breaches. Additionally, not offering an option to use an alternative email for Teams access further exacerbates the privacy breach, as it forces participants to expose private email addresses, violating GDPR’s requirement for informed consent, and the NSF expected compliance with DPA standards to ensure participant trust and safety.4) **Lack of planning and transparency**. Despite repeated requests, neither the founder nor the administrator provided a provisional timetable detailing the breakdown of hours for technical and soft skills training. Furthermore, the founder claimed daily sessions would start at 9:00 AM, but Teams instructions indicated 9:30 AM, with no clarity on end times or offline breaks, hindering effective preparation. This again infringes the DfE requirement for funded training to operate transparently, while poor planning could be seen as a failure to deliver the agreed provision effectively.5) **Unreasonable funder's behavior**. **One hour before the bootcamp’s start, I was removed from the program and blocked from accessing the academy’s Slack and Teams platforms. This decision was based on a trivial matter: the change of my 3mm Slack thumbnail picture the night before, which was deemed “unflattering” to the interviewer despite being a tiny, totally unrecognizable image.** This action demonstrates a lack of professionalism, fairness, and equitable access. Given that the DfE expects funded programs to ensure equitable access to education for eligible participants, the unreasonable removal could be seen as a failure to deliver the program.6) **Lack of empathy**. I explained to the founder and administrator that I had made significant financial and physical sacrifices to attend, including relocating to a new residence to ensure a suitable remote working environment. Despite these efforts, they refused to reinstate me, showing disregard for the challenges faced by participants, the public resources invested, and the support provided by others, such as my landlady, whose assistance was ultimately wasted. 7) **Possible systematic waste of public funding received by the DfE.** Upon joining the academy’s Slack account, I noticed a “General” channel where instructors posted notes and recordings of the first lesson for the prior cohort, but engagement in that channel ended abruptly. This suggests the possibility of early termination of the bootcamp in the past. Additionally, the lack of transparency in participant identities on Slack, combined with the ease of removing participants, raises concerns: the program could misrepresent its impact by attributing employment outcomes to others who are not their students but find employment as developers.8) **Poor communication.** Essential details, such as session start times and access links, were buried in irrelevant information within login emails, raising questions about their fitness for role.9) **Gender Bias.** During the enrollment interview, I mentioned a podcast highlighting that women often end up in front-end development roles, which are less paid and more tedious than back-end roles dominated by men. The interviewer responded by stating that, in her view, this is because women are less capable in mathematics than men.  This bias contradicts the principles of equality and meritocracy in the tech industry and raises concerns about their inclusivity, especially given the DfE’s awareness of gender imbalances in Skills Bootcamps.",

As a result, I’ve decided to shift my focus after graduation toward becoming a software engineer, with interests in both backend and frontend development.During my time in university, I didn’t have the opportunity to work on impactful projects within the curriculum, largely due to limitations in the local educational environment. That said, I’m eager to grow beyond that and make up for it through independent work and real-world experience.To recruiters and industry professionals:What kinds of projects would stand out to you on a resume for an entry-level software engineering role? I’d love some guidance on what you value most when evaluating candidates like me.",

Looking at job security, it seems that .NET is a pretty good gamble.So for those of you working in the field:* What back-end tools, frameworks, or skills should I be learning alongside .NET to be job-ready? Things I've read about are Entity Framework Core, DTOs, Repository Pattern etc.* Are there databases, authentication tools, or cloud services that companies expect you to know?* Any tips for someone coming from the front-end world and transitioning to .NET?Appreciate any insight here - I'd love to hear what things I need to learn that'd make me most marketable.Thanks!",

Not necessarily an amazing offer in his words, but something. In the 2000s, he said it was a bit more competitive, but could land an offer for every 10 applications. Even in 2015, I found I could apply to 20 or 30 jobs and be relatively confident in getting an offer. Assuming I wasn't stretching myself, most jobs I was applied for I would get an interview for, even if we determined it wasn't a good fit.But now I am regularly seeing people say you need to submit 100s to 1000s of applications to get a job. & applying to 100 jobs without getting past the screener.I feel like the ladder has been pulled up & the hiring process has become fully kafkaesque. its a regular refrain here now that you can be the best applicant for the role and be filtered out by the ATS, it depends on your luck. this system seems designed to abuse people seeking work rather than find the best applicant. For those of us who can take advantage of our professional networks, we might still find we only need to have 20 or 30 conversations with people to land our next role. Since we can get referrals or speak directly to hiring managers out of band.But every publicly posted job getting +1000 applicants. If things continue at this rate we will soon see people saying we will need 10,000 or 100,000 job applications submitted in order to land a role. I don't know what the solution is but this just doesn't make sense and seems completely awful. turning the job market into a casino isn't helping employees or employers.",

It’s making me wonder:Are companies just posting jobs without actually hiring? Or are they hiring, but just being extremely selective and slow about it?I’m asking because I’m literally just starting my journey into software engineering and will most likely have 4 YOE by the time I even graduate. So while this may not impact me right now, I’m trying to understand the landscape and where the demand actually exists.For those actively applying or on the hiring side — what’s the real deal in the market right now?Appreciate the insight.",

        "content": "The market is tough for inexperienced folks. That is clear. However, I can’t help but notice how many people are not really doing what it takes, even in good market, to secure a decent job (ignore 2021-2022, those were anomalously good years, and likely won’t happen again in the near future).What I’ve seen:1. Not searching for internships the summer/fall *before* the summer you want to intern. I literally had someone ask me IRL a few days ago, about my company’s intern program that literally starts next week…. They were focusing on schoolwork apparently in their fall semester , and started looking in the spring.2. Not applying for new grad roles in the same timeline as above. Why did you wait to graduate before you seriously started the job search? 3. Not having projects on your resume (assuming no work xp) because you haven’t taken the right classes yet or some other excuse. Seriously?4. Applying to like 100 roles online, and thinking there’s enough. I went to a top target, and I sent over 1000 apps, attended so many in-person and virtual events, cold DMed people on LinkedIn for informational interviews starting my freshman year. I’m seeing folks who don’t have the benefit of a target school name literally doing less.5. Missing scheduled calls, show up late, not do basic stuff. I had a student schedule an info interview with me, no show, apologize, reschedule, and no show again. I’ve had others who had reached out for a coffee chat, not even review my LinkedIn profile and ask questions like where I worked before. Seriously?6. Can’t code your way out of a box. Yes, a wild amount of folks can’t implement something like a basic binary search.7. Cheat on interviews with AI. It’s so common.8. Not have basic knowledge/understanding (for specific roles). You’d be surprised how many candidates in AI/ML literally don’t know the difference between inference and training, or can’t even half-explain the bias-variance trade-off problem.Do the basic stuff right, and you’re already ahead of 95% of candidates.",

        "author": "megariffs",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "If you work at a company that uses old tech stacks and processes, try not to stay at that company for too long (unless they are transitioning to using a newer tech stack and processes) because when it's time to work at another company, your lack of experience in newer tech and processes may come back and bite you. They're good to gain professional experience but after a couple of years, you should try and find another job that's more in line with what industry is going towardsWhen I graduated from college in 2016, my first job was a full-stack developer at a company I was working at while I was in college doing completely different work. I became their first in-house developer after I developed their Intranet site (as an internship project for my university) and redesigned their one of their customer referral forms. Their tech stack at the time was [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Forms for their customer portal and VB6 for the application that their employees used.After getting an opportunity to work at a startup that my former boss help start in 2022, I quit my then current job to work there. Less than a year later, I was let go due to \"inexperience\" even though I've done all my tasks on time, quickly learned React (the company initially was using [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Forms as a proof of concept before switching to React and [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core Web API), and I was receiving good reviews from my manager a month earlier. I believe I was scapegoated because the team itself was under performing, but I digress. With that being said, I learned quite a bit before I was let go. My first employer never used GitHub/Azure/etc, so I was unfamiliar with committing code, branch concepts, creating a PR, etc. I was also unfamiliar with newer [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) concepts like Dependency Injections, Program.cs, Middleware, etc that were in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core. Working at the startup exposed me to all of that.Luckily, I was able to find another job (which paid even more money) in less than 3 months. It was another company that used [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Forms for one of their applications and a mixture of [VB.NET/VB6](http://VB.NET/VB6) for another application. Fast forward to last month (April 3rd 2025), my position was eliminated. Therefore, I got laid off due to the company restructuring after having a bad financial outcome from the previous year. This time around, I wasn't let go due to performance. In fact, they emphatically praised me for being a great developer. My boss's boss emailed me afterwards to let me know that I can use him as a reference for another job and he'll reach out to contacts to see if anyone of them are looking for a developer to hire.Within the last several weeks, I was able to get an interview at 3 companies (2 contract jobs and one direct to hire). This week, I made it to the second round of one company before they decided to go in another direction. They told my recruiter that my in-person interview was excellent but another candidate they interviewed had more experience, so they decided to go with the other candidate. This time around, the companies I worked at previously never used automated testing, Microservices, CI/CD pipelines, service bus technology, etc. I felt like my lack of experience using those concepts came back and bit me.Regarding the two other companies, I did make it to the third round of the direct to hire job, but I'm afraid that my lack of experience using .NET based service bus tech and potentially other tech may get in the way of me landing this job. I'm going to spending the entire week brushing up on those concepts before my final interview. I did get a job offer from the first company I interviewed at, but I'm hesitant to work there because it's only 3 month contract, it's a long commute to another state (40-45 min drive), and they want me to use React. I haven't used React in over a year.TLDR; Don't be like me and stick around at a company for too long that uses old tech stacks and processes or not spending enough time to learn newer tech. Granted, I tried to do that at times, but I have a newborn now. Also, my partner can be quite needy and wants to spend a lot of time with me. We've got into arguments in the past over me wanting to spend time after work to work on projects to develop new skills.Edit: Grammar",

Why have a separate analytics dashboard if you can just ask for “revenue by cohort for Q2” and get a chart back?Feels like we’re heading toward a world where the core “app” isn’t a UI anymore—it’s just a schema + an agent + a model. And if that’s the future… does most CRUD work just evaporate?I know not everything can or should be replaced by this (think banking, social media etc), but I can’t shake the feeling that a lot of what we currently build is basically middleware between users and structured data—and LLMs are starting to eat that.Anyone else thinking about this? How are you adapting?",

        "content": "I’m based in the Bay Area with 5 YOE. A couple of months ago, I interviewed for a role I wasn’t too excited about, but the pay was super compelling. In the first recruiter call, they asked for my salary expectations. I asked for their range, as an example here, let’s say they said $150K–$180K. I said, “That works, I’m looking for something above $150K.” I think this was my first mistake, more on that later.I am a person with low self esteem(or serious imposter syndrome) and when I say I nailed all 8 rounds, I really must believe that. The recruiter followed up the day after 8th round saying team is interested in extending an offer. Then on compensation expectations the recruiter said, “You mentioned $150K earlier.” I clarified that I was targeting the upper end based on my fit and experience. They responded with, “So $180K?” and I just said yes. It felt a bit like putting words in my mouth.Next day, I got an email saying that I have to wait for the offer decision as they are interviewing other candidates. Haven’t heard back since. I don’t think I did anything fundamentally wrong or if I should have regrets but curious what others think.Edit: Just to clarify, in my mind I thought that’s how negotiations work. They will come back and say can’t do 150 but can do 140. But I guess not.",

One day I realized I can only build apps from examples, and I never really understood a lot of the concepts and I didn’t have the energy to learn, or the curiosity or the brain capacity evenAlso as the job responsibilities pile up, I realized I’m not the best at communicating or requesting access for resources. It’s common to work with legacy code or clients api without having clear documentation and expected to figure it out. And often being the only developer on a project and not even that good at the tech. I’m stuck at the job because , bills, and really not good at it. A few times I was really close to getting fired but didn’t, I don’t know what to do anymoreOk now my lorezapem has taken effect and I can communicate with my coworkers without crying, I am concluding this post.

Then, they’ll list this as an internship on their see bee or LinkedIn page.Interesting, to be honest I interned at some large companies but basically did data entry and a very small amount of development work, but I of course listed it as “web developer intern using React” when React was maybe like 15% of the job, so I’m not hating on these guys. But my work was at “real” companies with thousands of employees so is actually verifiable, I’m curious as to if this strategy by students works.

(got to work for Disney, amazon-studios, NBA, multiple MLB teams) Took some studio training got certified. and I made money doing it. The problem is, I started working at an amazon warehouse and I've gotten very \"lazy\" at first it was just to pay bills, make ends meet, but then I got benefits, insurance ect, but you're a work horse, you move boxes for 10 hours at a measly 24.35 an hour. It's not sustainable, I do want to go back into film but it's been 2 years later with only a few side gigs worked here and there as a production assistant. (mostly because I haven't pursued anything because of financial hardship and the steady pay is worth more to me than random amounts of 1099 based pay here and there)On a whim, I decided to have Amazon pay me to learn how to drive a truck ( semi-drivers are also needed in film too) and at the time it just seemed to be a good thing to fall back on and I day dreamed about getting to travel again and get paid to do it.That said, I kind of don't want to see myself as a trucker for life ( as funny as an idea that was at the time as a way to get out of back breaking labor)I was from a generation that was always told learn to code ect.... What's going on with that? I have zero interest to be a blue \"collar\" worker, and I need an extra set of skills if working BTS isn't a viable long term career (its not)I just want that desk job and that 80-100k a year. Thought of going into game dev and heard a lot of \"well don't want to do that because it'll beat that passion out of you for gaming\" don't really care about passion projects, I just want to work. Don't mind my vision being shared or not shared, just want to make money. Is coding still in, is tech dead? am I barking up the wrong tree,would it be stupid at nearly 30 to say \"Yeah I could be a game dev if i want.\" or should I look at something else tech related or is tech just too competitive now?No kids, no plan to ever have kids, current gf doesn't want kids.If tech isn't it then i'll probably spend the next few years buying the film equipment I had my eye on for years, building a better pc, learning editing, working PA as often as I can and doing that grind (which trust me it's a grind, some weeks I made 200 dollars other weeks I made 3200) But I would love the comfort of a cozy desk job.

They could possibly find a similar role in the Bay Area, and are totally open to that. I could also potentially find a solid remote role if we stayed.We’re trying to balance the career benefits of joining FAANG on a team I would love against staying somewhere where we’re both really happy and have roots we’ve formed over the past three years.I could use some advice on:1. How much long-term value does a FAANG role really add to your resume and career growth? Is the FAANG name and learning actually that impactful on your career? (I think it is but could use perspectives)2. Do you think the payoff could be worth uprooting our lives on the East coast? 3. How many years of experience at FAANG really makes a difference on your resume and your learning? It’s easier for us to consider moving for just a few years, and then coming back East. And hoping that the FAANG experience would open up a lot of opportunities and flexibility. Thank you in advance!",

Argued everything and even one time called me weird because he didnt agree with some of my work ethic. He interrupted everyone and would extend scrum by an hour if someone dared to disagree with him. He didnt scream but you could tell he was always on verge to (maybe had a few hr calls in the past). He basically built everything and he is one of those guys who likely will never lose his job because he may be a dick but he gets the job done. Im starting my 3rd job this week and an expecting to meet my team. It seems chill but part of me is wondering if im going to see the 3rd version of that toxic principal dev. Just got me curious.

And the best I got so far from those employers is an automated rejection email. The recruiters I have gotten responses from are all working for FAANG-type companies in California. I have two potential explanations (pure speculation on my part)1. Maybe they don't want to deal with relocation. I can relocate myself but I'm not sure how to convey that without actually talking to someone.2. Maybe there is some kind of stigma / bad rep associated with Silly Valley and the people who work here. I can understand (I'm trying to GTFO after all) but I have no idea how I can get past that Is any of this true ? Is there any other potential explanation ?

I got my current and first job because I was cheap (my starting pay was far below market rate for SE1 role), and the hiring manager was impressed with a systems programming and os architecture project I had on my resume and my github from one of my classes which was written in C. My job uses a techstack of syncfusion c# winform frontend and an old C backend that was originally written before I was even born.I've been spending my free time upskilling, mostly working with .net core & react, and python as I'd like to get a full stack or backend role with a more modern and common techstack. But problem is, every job I've applied to that uses anything remotely modern hasn't given me any call backs. The only jobs I have heard from are ones that I didn't even apply to that want the same thing as my current job does, a cheap junior that knows C.I'm guessing part of the reason why I'm not getting callbacks is not just because of how bad the market is, but because in a recruiters and hiring manager's mind, why take a chance on someone who currently works with something arachic, when you can just get someone who has actual job experience in what they use. How do I get out of being pigeonholed? I tailor my resume to the job I apply to as best I can, but it's not like I can rewrite the experience section of my resume that shows I deal with winforms and C.",

He called me like 10 minutes late, no apology, gave me a 5-10 minute run down of the process and told me to email him with any questions. Scheduled the interviews. Admittedly i didn’t do as strongly as i would have hoped (rusty with little time to prepare). Finally reached out with a rejection.Honestly, from the time I got transferred to the second recruiter I knew it was partially a waste of time. First recruiter was great, explained the teams, the general process at a high level, very responsive. Second recruiter: No calls, very little details on updates, unresponsive. Third one was by far the worst. It’s like he knew I was was wasting both of our times. Do they not get commissions if they weren’t the lead recruiter? Do they have so many faang applicants that they know those will probably get the job and deprioritize the others?Even the interviewers were pretty bad. I’ve had interviews at google, meta and Apple and while one or two of the interviewers might be extra tough, most are easy to work with and are collaborative.

        "content": "For a long time, I’ve been obsessed with prestige and what people think of me. Only recently have I started to realize that this focus has been damaging.Back in college, I struggled to land strong internships. When people asked where I interned, I’d feel insecure.This past new grad job hunt season was different. I did extremely well. But instead of simply feeling proud, I found myself bringing it up in almost every conversation — how many offers I got, how hard the decision was. My close friends pointed out that my conversations shifted away from hobbies and life to career decisions, leveling systems, and growth.When it came time to choose between job offers, I tried everything to make the “right” decision. I asked all my friends and family. I read every blog and polled every possible forum. I was obsessed with finding the most validated, socially acceptable path — the one society would approve of. Obviously it didn’t work. Eventually, I had to ask myself: *Why do I feel the need to share my successes so often? Why is this decision so agonizing?* And I think the honest answer is that I care a lot about how others perceive me.But digging deeper, that desire doesn’t feel purely ego-driven. In tech, **career advancement almost entirely depends on perception.** Recruiters scan for brand names. Managers reward visibility. Friends decide whether you’re worth a referral. Your market worth is defined by what others think, not by what you think you’re worth.That’s why I find myself highlighting my accomplishments and leaning toward prestige. I want to be seen as someone worth helping, worth investing in. I want future recruiters to see my resume and not hesitate. But in the process, I’ve started to value prestige more than my own long-term goals and personal values.Choosing between offers this season was especially hard because they represented opposite sides of this internal conflict — one path aligned with prestige, the other with personal fit.Conventional advice says to “stop caring what people think.” But is that even realistic when almost every system in tech (and the world in general) is based on what others think of you and how you're ranked?",

So again, I feel unemployable given my current “ancient” tech stack and falling behind knowledge of web dev. Long story short, is it difficult to job hop once you have experience?

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "***Disclaimer: This post is not about me but a friend of mine. That nevertheless doesn't invalidate the seriousness of the situation. There’s a TL;DR at the end if you need it.***I've been working as a software engineer at my current company for about 2 years. From the very beginning, I disclosed that I have SLE lupus (an autoimmune condition), which means I’m constantly on anticoagulant medication. I also have a physical disability that makes daily commuting difficult.Thankfully, things were manageable for a long time—my role allowed for hybrid work, with some days in-office and others WFH. That balance helped me stay productive and committed despite my health challenges.But everything started shifting this year.The company is preparing to go public and has been carrying out silent layoffs—mostly through performance improvement plans (PIPs). WFH flexibility has been dialed back, and there's increasing pressure to be in-office regularly. I complied with the new expectations despite the strain, kept putting in the hours, met all deadlines, and consistently received positive feedback.However, over the past couple of weeks, my health has taken a serious turn. I’ve developed gangrene in my left index finger—there’s a chance I could lose it, or even more fingers if it spreads. I was terrified to ask for leave, hoping things would heal. I kept working—coding one-handed with my right hand—just to avoid raising red flags.Then two days ago, I was blindsided.My manager scheduled a recorded meeting and placed me on a PIP, claiming I had negative feedback from past team leads. This was shocking, since one of those leads had publicly praised my work before, even in front of my current manager. After the meeting, my manager called me privately, off the record. He implied that he had no real control over the situation and gently suggested I start looking for a new role while going through the PIP.So here I am—on a one-month PIP, with a two-month notice period after that if things don’t improve.And now my health is at a breaking point. I need time off, but I can’t afford to lose this job. My medical expenses are piling up fast. If I lose this income, I’ll probably have to leave my apartment and move back in with my parents, who are already under financial strain.I need advice. Please.* Should I try explaining the full extent of my condition to HR or management again and ask to pause the PIP or adjust expectations?* Should I ask for a quiet exit now with some kind of severance instead of going through a likely-failed PIP?* Has anyone faced something similar—being disabled and seriously ill while also under pressure to perform or leave?Please don’t just say “prioritize your health and quit”—I wish I could, but I don’t have that privilege. I'm trying to survive, not just live. Any practical advice or shared experiences would really mean a lot right now.**TL;DR:** **Software engineer with lupus + physical disability. Was managing well with hybrid work until company began silent layoffs via PIPs. Now being forced into WFO, health has worsened (developed gangrene in hand), but afraid to take leave. Just put on a PIP despite positive past feedback. Manager privately suggested I start job hunting. Can't afford to lose job due to high medical costs. Looking for advice on whether to fight the PIP, talk to HR, or ask for severance.**",

Initially came way via their summer analyst program and then returned as part of their Graduate Rotational Analyst program. In my current role as a Systems Engineer I support trading infrastructure its kind of a mix of implementation, weekly meetings with vendors, benchmarking new and emerging technologies like processors and a lot of dealing with compliance issues because of the nature of being at a bank. Though I’m hitting my 5 year mark soon and I pretty stagnant where I’m at. On that note I did make it to few final rounds at a few Trading firms in Chicago but it was a typical case of me being too junior senior if that makes sense. There are times when I learn a bit but a major of my time is chasing and mitigating risk and compliance stuff as new tech is introduced to the firm.Its more of an infrastructure role and not much of a dev/swe role though I done some automation with python. and on occassion do things in ansible, bash and so forth. Haven’t been promoted nor had a raise in the last 2 years or so. Although each time i was close my team was realigned or got a new manager about 2-3 times. Home is LA/Southern California and would like to stay on the west coast to be near family and my girlfriend so I’m looking at Seattle & The bay area. The tech market in LA seems weird to say the least. Is it really just a matter of grinding leetcode to land a new role? I feel ike 5-8 years ago that was the case but that might not seem to be it anymore? Though I could be wrong. I am looking at applying to an MS in Applied Math which my current firm would heavily subsidize and use that to pivot though unsure if that’d be the right move though it seems like the most like plausbile. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Kinda feel a little directonless at the momment.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I am a big proponent in that we should improve ourselves by relying on ourselves only, but after a decade of working in tech, and many more years being a student, I realize that unless you are extremely talented or lucky (or both), even just talking to a willing mentor can get you astronomically ahead in any endeavor, whether it be school or career. For example I’ll talk about myself: I am first generation college grad in my family. My parents did not know anything about tech or software or even how you use a college degree to start a career. My pre-college education was also similarly ignorant of these things (I learned to programmed as sophomore in college!). In my Senior year in high school I took a university class and got the highest grade; it was surprisingly easy for me. Had my parents or teachers encouraged me much earlier I could have likely started college earlier even as a sophomore in high school or at least taken college classes alongside high school and gotten quite ahead when starting in university. A 2nd example, I majored in CS but nobody advised me on anything nor did I know what I had to do. I only majored in CS after a professor strongly advised me to. I had a single internship simply due to a connection with that same professor. But I didn’t know I should be studying LeetCode or applying at internships for big tech. I didn’t get my first real job until 1 year after I graduated. So imagine if I never talked to that professor or took their advice ! One single person made an infinite positive difference in my life by just talking to them !OK, now let’s move to current day. I am mid career SWE, I write lots of code but also manage other SWEs. I want to keep advancing because I have strong options about how things should be done, and I see a lot of inefficiency in current engineering leadership. I guess you could call me Sauron if you know the analogy. I actually prefer being an IC but the amount of incompetence I observe at eng leadership drives me crazy and I feel it is my duty to course correct and help rather than just shrug my shoulders and keep my nose to the grinding wheel. For those of you now late or end of career, what would you have advised your mid career self to be doing to get to where you are now sooner ?",

        "content": "I've been at the same company for the last 4.25 years. The work has been very stable. Luckily it's not an industry that gets affected much due to recent economic events. However with that said, we're only a startup and my salary is 96k CAD.In terms of the position/job, I have literally zero complaints. I've never worried about my performance, the work itself is very chill, I get to work remote and I only do actual work for around 3-4hrs a day (usually less). The people are also incredibly nice and I truly believe I'll never meet a management team that's better than my current one. However, the pay is still pretty low, especially considering I now have over 4 years of experience. The only other con is that due to the work being so chill, I have recently felt like I've stopped learning new things. Every day it's the same CRUD operations in a different format so I feel like if I continue down this path I may end up with 6 YoE but not much talent to show for it. Don't get me wrong though, I've definitely learned a ton at my current company and how to build a system from end to end, but I don't think I can learn anymore as our use base is pretty small.So, I've started to look around as to what's available. If I get a FAANG offer with 200k+ salary, I'd take it in a heartbeat but putting that to the side, I've slowly started getting responses from other startups and small companies with salaries ranging from 100k to 150k. This made me think, what is the minimum amount of money I'd need to leave my current situation? For example, my most recent first round interview with a company told me that they pay 120k but weirdly enough I almost felt like I'd rather stay at my 96k chill job than potentially change everything for just 24k.What do you guys think? If you were in my position making 96k but it's like a dream scenario in terms of WLB, bosses, etc, how much money would you need to be offered to quit? Also if it matters, I'm 28.",

Lots of upper management has left, some coworkers have left. Seems like things are always on fire every week. The thought of being oncall makes me cringe due to how many incidents come up. Testing environment sucks. We're dealing with tons of bad and outdated code. A project I planned fell apart at 90% completion due to is being unable to work around some outdated libraries. The system is too vast to really know what causes an issue until you look into it. It kind of feels like our team has been left behind to handle the legacy stuff whereas other teams are working on newer projects and tech. The team collab has also declined due to addition of some members. It was already tough due to WFH but now its worseI've never been too interested in work and always just took it as a means for an income. But now I feel myself really dreading waking up on workdays. I'm really starting to resent the whole thing.

It's got a lot of visibility, and I'd be somewhat insulated because it's a big fucking company. I'd get to work in Scala, which is a joy and not easy to find.I'm torn. I'm getting back on the horse after a pretty bad series of uncomfortable startup experiences that ended with a lot of burnout, and the idea of going into the office every day for visibility is a lot. Hell, I'm not even sure if I want to be a software engineer.D would give me more flexibility and less pressure but it does seem like a cool project. I could pretty much take it and run with it and do some cool stuff. I'm friendly and personable.I'm just trying to get back on my feet after being out of the game for about a year. I'm not sure how ready I am to hit the ground running at a startup, and I'm not sure if it's just my lack of confidence. The flexibility of in-office when I want to be is huge, but am I daft for leaning toward contract work at a big entity with the possibility of conversion for less money, considering the reality of the grind?I don't want to burn out, but I want to make sure I'm in a good place if this contract ends. Should I get the offer from the startup? I can't really use it to leverage more from D because it's through a third party, and sanity and sustainability are my big drivers. And yeah, being able to do Scala makes me happy.Thoughts?",

New company will reach out to HR anyway for reference and reason of leaving. I’m leaving because I hated some colleagues and they were not good developers, so a lot of work fell on my shoulders without the pay or the title or the power to make real change.

I like it here and while it's not difficult or challenging work, I would like to 'expand my options' a wee bit into application security and security automation. While I don't require any programming or CS knowledge to do my job, I think it would open up a lot of new pathways for me and also just be really interesting to learn about. Learning how memory parsing works, stacks, operating systems, algorithms and being able to create tools and tear software apart would be awesome. It's also a source of insecurity for me, I tried university before I started work and failed pretty hard. Essentially because I was lazy and not medicated for ADHD (all sorted now) and want to give it another go to prove that I can commit to something and complete it. Are there any other pathways I can consider that I can *really* learn computer science? I'm worried that if I do some sort of self-paced course, I'll lose motivation and drop it. Also, I won't have a fancy piece of paper by the end of it.",

The writing was on the wall that layoffs were coming so I started actively interviewing. I’ve applied to maybe 20-30 positions and have gotten like 10 screens with 4 actual on sites but no offers. One with a faang company. I know why. My interview skills have never been and aren’t great but that is something that I usually get better at the more I interview. I feel pretty good about how I’m interviewing now but I’m still just not the best at it. I’m a good programmer, but not the best. I can figure out most leetcode mediums and even hards but usually not in 20-25 minutes. I’ve always been good at my job because I’m willing to take my time to understand a problem and implement a solid solution. In the past this has worked out because although I never landed a big tech job, I got to work at some pretty big companies with what I’d say is relatively good pay. It seems like I’m just not as good as the competition anymore and I can’t stand out against the competition. What’s worse is the sub field I’m in (mobile) seems to be shrinking (lower paying jobs in hcol areas and a lot of the jobs that used to exist in the US are now being outsourced). Let’s say i manage to find another job in a somewhat short time frame. What is guaranteeing this from getting worse? It seems like I’m on a sinking ship. But at this age, where do I go? With how difficult things seem to be for entry level engineers I feel like even switching to backend would be difficult and with no guarantee of job security. Do I try to switch into something tech adjacent like sales or a sales solution engineer? Do I get out of the tech industry as a whole? Do I go back to school? I’ve never had such a bleak outlook on life before in my life. I know I’m being dramatic but sometimes I have these intrusive thoughts like just giving up on life as a whole.Edit:CS Degree at a top 50 cs school but with a low gpa (3.0). I was always kind of smart but I was never one of the smartest kids in the classroom. I also spent a lot of time slacking in middle school and high school but managed to get into community college and then into my states university where I scraped by in getting my degree. I had to work part time so I had limited time to study if not I think I would have done a bit better. 11 years of experience.One of my biggest challenges is severe performance anxiety when giving presentations. That is something that I avoided in my career for a long time but have been working on for the past few years. Even with medication, it’s still hard for me but I’ve realized if it’s the difference between putting food on the table and starving I need to improve no matter what. It’s imperative regardless of what I end up doing.",

        "author": "Wonderful_Analyst_50",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I graduated college with a bachelors degree in computer science a while ago and ever since I’ve been living with my parents while doing delivery services like Instacart and uber eats to make money while I try to search for a job as a software engineer. As you can guess I haven’t really gotten anywhere with that. I even attended a software engineering bootcamp last year to try to bolster my resume (may not have been the smartest idea in hindsight but I enjoyed it and met some cool people so I don’t regret it) but still nothing. My family is now trying to push me to apply for a masters program focusing on something like cybersecurity or biotech (which feels a little outside my comfort zone as I wasn’t great at biology) claiming the masters is the final piece I need to make it all come together. Honestly the thought of putting so much more time and money into a field that has had fruitless returns so far gives me a ton of anxiety and I don’t want to come out the other side of it multiple years from now tens of thousands of dollars in debt and be in the same position I’m in now. I was lucky enough that I could get my bachelors degree mostly for free due to my father’s VA benefits but I’d be too old to qualify for that once I get into a masters program so I’d be paying full price this time around. I also burned out pretty hard towards the end of my bachelors (partially due to Covid) and pretty much dragged myself across the finish line so the thought of going back after a few years away is pretty daunting.Ultimately though I know I need to do something and I’m sick and tired of the position I’m in. I feel like I’ve put my life on hold for years trying to start it from the best position possible and I’m at a point where it just doesn’t feel viable anymore. Living with my parents for this long just doing deliveries and job applications every day has made me pretty depressed and I kind of just want to get a regular non-tech job, move out into an apartment with a friend, and figure out my life from there. At the same time though I feel like if a masters degree would genuinely be very useful in the long run, I’m being short sighted and years from now I’d regret not getting it. Especially considering my parents are willing to keep housing me while I go back to school so I’d probably be making my life more difficult by moving out instead, even if it would probably improve my mental health.I do genuinely enjoy coding and would consider myself pretty good at it, but I wouldn’t say I’m passionate about it or anything. I don’t really feel passionate about anything really, I kinda just want to have a good life making comfortable money and not hating my job. When I changed my major to computer science it seemed like a pretty straight shot, I enjoyed it more than my other classes, I was naturally very good at it, and there seemed to be a pretty direct path of internship (check) -> degree (check) -> high paying job (crash and burn). The market crash happened right before I graduated so I found it to be extremely unlucky timing and have pretty much been trying to play catch up ever since.Basically I’m just looking to see if anyone has any thoughts on the usefulness of a masters degree in the current market and if it would be a good use of my time and money or not. Or maybe even if there’s any CS related jobs I could get with my current degree that I may have overlooked so far (I’ve mainly been focusing on full stack development). Any advice is very appreciated.TLDR: I’m wondering if a masters degree is worth the time and money in this current tech market or if there are any other type of CS jobs I could get with my bachelors that are commonly overlooked. Or should I just cut my losses, find a non-tech job, move into an apartment with a friend, and try to figure out my life from there.",

        "content": "My background - I have a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering. During my Bachelor's, I had learned Java and OOPS concepts through self-instruction and online resources. After that, I have 4 years of experience in an IT Consulting firm - my job title said \"Consultant.\" I mostly worked on production support (incident management and bug fixes) for client projects, primarily on the backend which for the most part, involved a Java-based low code integration development platform and Oracle DB/SQL on the database side. Occasionally, I would use Core Java as and when needed. I also got familiar with version control and CICD concepts.While working on this job, I had been parallelly doing a lot of self learning on fundamental CS topics like Data Structures, Algorithm design and analysis. I eventually left to pursue a Master's in Computer Science where I am currently enrolled. Today, an Amazon recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn to set up an SDE-2 interview. I have been practicing LeetCode and intend to complete at least the Neetcode 150 and Blind 75 in the coming days. My Master's coursework has involved a lot of Low Level Design/Object Oriented Design Patterns and I have been learning High Level System Design from online lecture videos.However, I am not sure if my earlier work experience makes me suitable for an SDE-2 role at Amazon. I haven't really done any significant System Design in my previous role and I am not sure how to deal with the Behavioral/Leadership Principles based rounds where they question you about your earlier work experiences.As I'll be graduating from an MSCS program soon, should I ask the recruiter for an SDE-1 role instead? I'm not sure if she even recruits for SDE-1 and it's not clear if down leveling to SDE-1, in case I meet the SDE-1 bar but not the SDE-2 one, after the interview is an option. I would greatly appreciate any insights on what is advisable given my background. Thank you!",

        "content": "I’m at a pretty stressful crossroads and could really use some guidance. I recently turned 30 and am struggling with the reality that I don’t have professional experience in my field. Most of my work has been tied to school projects, so my portfolio isn’t as strong as I’d like.While I don’t consider myself the best or smartest (sometimes I feel the exact opposite), I’ve always been quick to understand things. I’m good at breaking down complex problems, and I’ve received praise for it my entire life. However, discipline has always been a challenge for me. I’ve managed to get by relying on my intellect while doing far less work than I should have. But recently, I’ve started implementing good routines and becoming productive every day.I’m an international student in the U.S., working toward my master’s in Math with a concentration in Computer Science, and my bachelor’s degree was also in CS. All I need to do to graduate is submit my thesis. The pressure is mounting because my time to stay in the country is running out unless I secure a job soon. I’m actually being forced to start using my OPT (limited work eligibility) time to submit my thesis by December and graduate.I feel overwhelmed trying to figure out how to compete in the job market despite these challenges. For reference, I’m currently near Houston, Texas. So far, I’ve applied to fewer than 50 jobs. Most of the time, I don’t get responses - sometimes I get rejections - but I’ve never had an interview.For those who have been in similar situations - or those who’ve successfully transitioned into a career without much experience - how did you do it? Can I make my school projects look more compelling to employers? Will they even look at them? Do I have a chance?I know that if I’m given an opportunity in a work environment, I’ll reach a high-performance level very quickly. I just don’t know how to show this potential to employers. I also can’t seem to get my resume under two pages.Any advice on networking (which I’ve struggled with as an introvert with few close friends), skill-building, or navigating job searches efficiently would be incredibly helpful.Finally, thank you whoever you are for taking the time to read this. I’m crossing my fingers for something that gives me hope - that I haven’t completely wasted my life and opportunity here. In the meantime, I'm making small victories, like finally maintaining a steady routine of working on my thesis and working on my resume/linkedIn/applying for jobs full-time.",

Bonus is up for debate, but supposedly around 10% of the base. Hybrid 3 days in office. The tech stack is different from my normal one, I've always worked heavy backend java, this would be full stack with C++. I'm fine learning a new stack and front end, and the pay seems good, assuming the bonus can be confirmed. But the 3 days in seems rough. I've never had the displeasure of going into an office before (5 YOE). Always fully remote. If my current job wasnt threatening layoffs I wouldn't consider this at all realistically. To be honest I'm dog shit at interviewing, and I hate leet code, and I almost never get responses from apps, this seemed like a fluke. Additional info: my current company has assigned us 3 new offshore teams, who have taken around 60% of our old workload. We've focused on new things, and have work flowing, but it seems like the goal is for the offshore teams to take more as time passes.Am I being stupid not just taking the confirmed job? It seems unlikely they'd lay me off after just hiring me.",
