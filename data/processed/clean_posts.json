I chose this career path because I really like the puzzle solving element of coding, and being stinking good at data quality analysis. This is the aspect of my job that puts me into a flow state. I also have never been strong with expressing myself with words - this is something I struggle with professionally and personally. It just takes me a long time to fully articulate myself.My company is SUPER welcoming and open of using AI. I have been willing to use AI and have been finding use cases to use AI more deeply. It's just that...using AI changes the job from coding to automating, and I don't enjoy being an \"automater\" if that makes sense. I don't enjoy writing prompts for AI to then do the stuff that I really like. I'm open to future technological advancements and learning new things - like I don't want to stay comfortable, and I've been making effort. I'm just feeling like even if I get really good at this, I wouldn't like it much...and not sure what this means for my employment in general. Is anyone else struggling with this? I'm not sure what to do about it, and really don't feel comfortable talking to my peers about this. Surely I can't be the only one?Going to keep trying in the meantime...",

        "content": "Hey folks,So here's the situation: one of our stakeholders got hyped up after reading some LinkedIn post claiming you can \"magically\" connect your data warehouse to ChatGPT and it’ll just answer business questions, write perfect SQL, and basically replace your analytics team overnight. No demo, just bold claims in a post.We tried to set realistic expectations and even did a demo to show how it actually works. Unsurprisingly, when you connect GenAI to tables without any context, metadata, or table descriptions, it spits out bad SQL, hallucinates, and confidently shows completely wrong data.And of course... drum roll... it’s our fault. Because apparently we “can’t do it like that guy on LinkedIn.”I’m not saying this stuff isn’t possible—it is—but it’s a project. There’s no magic switch. If you want good results, you need to describe your data, inject context, define business logic, set boundaries… not just connect and hope for miracles.How do you deal with this kind of crap? When influencers—who clearly don’t understand the tech deeply—start shaping stakeholder expectations more than the actual engineers and data people who’ve been doing this for years?Maybe I’m just pissed, but this hype wave is exhausting. It's making everything harder for those of us trying to do things right.",

The speed at which I could set it up was remarkable—I had DuckLake up and running in just a few minutes, especially since you can host it locally.One of the standout features was being able to use custom SQL right out of the box with the DuckDB CLI. All you need is one binary. After ingesting data via [sling](https://docs.slingdata.io), I found querying to be quite responsive (due to the SQL catalog backend). with Iceberg, querying can be quite sluggish, and you can't even query with SQL without some heavy engine like spark or trino.Of course, Iceberg has the advantage of being more established in the industry, with a longer track record, but I'm rooting for ducklake.

One of the most common examples is the data lake populated with tons of parquet files. How different from each other in data types, number of columns etc are these files? If not very much, why not just throw it all in a pipeline to clean/normalize the data and store the output in a common warehouse?2. How *straightforward* it is to use technologies like Iceberg for managing non-tabular binary files like pictures, videos, PDFs etc? Is it even possible? If yes, is this a common use case?3. Will these technologies become the *de facto* standard in the near future, turning traditional lakes and warehouses obsolete?",

Unfortunately, I don’t have hands-on experience with Databricks yet – although a few years ago I worked very intensively with Apache Spark for about a year, so I assume it won’t be too hard for me to get up to speed with Databricks (especially since the requirement was rated at around 2.5/5). Still, I’d really like to start the job being reasonably prepared, knowing the basics of how things work, and become independent in the project as quickly as possible.I’ve been thinking about what the most important elements of Databricks I should focus on learning first would be. Could you give me some advice on that?Secondly – I don’t know Terraform, and I’ll mostly be using it here for managing Databricks: setting up job deployments (to the right cluster, with the right permissions, etc.). Is this something difficult, or is it realistic to get a good understanding of Terraform and Databricks-related components in a few days? (For context, I know AWS very well, and that’s the cloud provider our Databricks is running on.) Could you also give me some advice or recommend good resources to get started with that?Best, Mike",

That seems...incredibly expensive.Or would they pre-aggregate at a higher granularity, potentially sacrificing some dimensions in the progress, to accelerate their dashboards?This way you could just group by hour + ad_id + dim1 + dim2 ... and then run sum(clicks) / sum(impressions) to get a CTR estimate. Which I'm thinking would be way faster since there's no join anymore.This strategy seems generally accepted in streaming workloads (to avoid streaming joins), but not sure what best practices are in the batch world.",

        "content": "To provide measurable benchmarks, there is a need for standardized tasks and challenges that each participant can perform and solve. While these comparisons may not capture all differences, they offer a useful understanding of performance speed. For this purpose, Coiled / Dask have introduced a challenge where data warehouse engines can benchmark their reading and aggregation performance on a dataset of 1 trillion records. This dataset contains temperature measurement data spread across 100,000 files. The data size is around 2.4TB.**The challenge**“Your task is to use any tool(s) you’d like to calculate the min, mean, and max temperature per weather station, sorted alphabetically. The data is stored in Parquet on S3: s3://coiled-datasets-rp/1trc. Each file is 10 million rows and there are 100,000 files. For an extra challenge, you could also generate the data yourself.”**The Result**The Apache Impala community was eager to participate in this challenge. For Impala, the code snippets required are quite straightforward — just a simple SQL query. Behind the scenes, all the parallelism is seamlessly managed by the Impala Query Coordinator and its Executors, allowing complex processes to happen effortlessly in a parallel way.**Article**https://itnext.io/the-one-trillion-row-challenge-with-apache-impala-aae1487ee451?source=friends_link&sk=eee9cc47880efa379eccb2fdacf57bb2**Resources**The query statements for generating the data and executing the challenge are available at https://github.com/boroknagyz/impala-1trc",

It doesnt matter if you know how to write a loop in some language or how to define a class or anything similar, you just need to be able to realize when you need to iterate over something or express a concept with specific attributes. You can always just reference the syntax later.I have taken soo many lessons on these things and they all make sense on that day but days later I forget what each of them mean. However, the concept of doing X in a certain way remains.Am I weird for being this way? I often feel discouraged when I have to look up a term that other people are using online.

        "content": "I moved from a startup into a corporate job ( digital banking ) a few months ago. I’m from Malaysia , for context. I’m still under probation. And honestly, I don’t know anymore if I’m underperforming, or if I’m just stuck in a dysfunctional culture that burns people out.In my previous role, I worked as a backend engineer. I had autonomy. Things moved fast. Feedback was immediate. Now, I’m in an environment where expectations are vague, processes are messy, and communication is passive-aggressive.One example: we have a support schedule to help vendors load data into internal systems. They can’t do it directly, so someone from our side has to run everything manually. It’s basic, repetitive work , I once suggested scripting it to make the process cleaner. That suggestion was ignored. So we keep doing it the hard way.Recently I got pinged after working hours to join a “5-minute call to load something” , something that would run for 10 hours. There was no advance notice, just the assumption I’d be available. I was already off shift, but even then, the next day came with a passive-aggressive remark: “Didn’t expect this from you.” This wasn’t the first time either.Then there’s the feedback I’ve been given. My boss told me twice , that I lack “initiative.” The most recent example was over documentation. I was asked to update some system design docs. I did. I even left a comment inside tagging him, asking for input , which should’ve triggered an email notification. But I didn’t follow up in Teams because I got pulled into other work. I was literally about to update him the next morning when he messaged me and immediately launched into a rant about me needing to be more proactive and take ownership. Even though the work had been done. However, sometime he would dished out praise but rarely. Meanwhile, I’m putting in 10–15 hour days. I’m exhausted. I forget things. I don’t have any more bandwidth. I’m not even doing meaningful engineering work , just reacting to whatever lands in my inbox or chat window. No ownership, no growth. Just people assuming I’ll pick up anything and everything.This is starting to affect my personal life. I carry the resentment home. I’m always tired. I’m checked out even when I’m not working. I literally can’t take a shit without being pulled into a meeting.So now I’m asking: is this a sign I’m not fit for this kind of culture? Am I truly missing something basic? Or is this what happens when you take someone from a fast, transparent, builder-type environment and drop them into a place where nobody wants to own problems , they just want someone to quietly clean up the mess?If you’ve been through this, I’d appreciate perspective.",

We use Airflow and Dagster to orchestrate the DataFlow and python pipelines.At this scale, it seems that the way to go is to switch to a lakehouse model with iceberg/Delta in GCS and process the data using DuckDB or Trino (one of the requirements is to keep using SQL for most of the data pipelines).From my researches :* DuckDB can be executed in-process but does not fully support Iceberg or Delta* Iceberg/Delta seems mandatory as it manages schema evolution, time travel and a data catalog for discovery* Trino must be deployed in a cluster and i would prefer avoid this unless if there are no other solutions* pyspark with SparkSQL seems to have cold start issues and is non trivial to configure.* Dremio fully supports iceberg and can be executed in K8S pods with the Airflow Kubernetes Operator* DuckLake is extremely recent and i fear this is not prod-readySo, my first thought is to use SQL pipelines with Dremio launched by Airflow/Dagster + Iceberg tables in GCS.What are your thoughts on this choice ?

This pipeline uses AI agents (orchestrated with LangChain/LangGraph and powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet) to:* **Plan** data transformation strategies.* **Generate** production-ready PySpark code.* **Review** the generated code for quality and correctness.* **Execute** transformations across Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.* Crucially, **self-correct** by revising code and retrying in case of errors.It aims for a truly zero-touch, self-healing data flow, with integrated observability via LangSmith.As a CS undergrad, this is my first significant venture into building a comprehensive data transformation agent like this. I've learned a ton about integrating LLMs with data platforms.I'd be incredibly grateful if you seasoned data engineers could check it out.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "**Full disclosure:** I'm part of the team at Databend, and we just published a deep-dive article on User-Defined Functions (UDFs). I’m sharing this here because it tackles a question we see all the time: when and how to move beyond standard SQL for complex logic in a data pipeline. I've made sure to summarize the key takeaways in this post to respect the community's rules on self-promotion.We've all been there: your SQL query is becoming a monster of nested `CASE` statements and gnarly regex, and you start wondering if there's a better way. Our goal was to create a practical guide for choosing the right tool for the job.Here’s a quick breakdown of the approaches we cover:* **Lambda (SQL) UDFs:** The simplest approach. The guide's advice is clear: **if you can do it in SQL, do it in SQL**. It's the easiest to maintain and debug. We cover using them for simple data cleaning and standardizing business rules.* **Python & JavaScript UDFs:** These are the workhorses for most custom logic. The post shows examples for things like: * Using a Python UDF to validate and standardize shipping addresses. * Using a JavaScript UDF to process messy JSON event logs by redacting PII and enriching the data.* **WASM (WebAssembly) UDFs:** This is for when you are truly performance-obsessed. If you're doing heavy computation (think feature engineering, complex financial modeling), you can get near-native speed. We show a full example of writing a function in Rust, compiling it to WASM, and running it inside the database.* **External UDF Servers:** For when you need to integrate your data warehouse with an existing microservice you already trust (like a fraud detection or matchmaking engine). This lets you keep your business logic decoupled but still query it from SQL.The article ends with a \"no-BS\" best practices section and some basic performance benchmarks comparing the different UDF types. The core message is to start simple and only escalate in complexity when the use case demands it.**You can read the full deep-dive here:** [https://www.databend.com/blog/category-product/Databend\\_UDF/](https://www.databend.com/blog/category-product/Databend_UDF/)I'd love to hear how you all handle this. What's your team's go-to solution when SQL just isn't enough for the task at hand?",

        "author": "Miserable-Toe5090",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone—I could really use some advice.I’m currently a senior data analyst working in healthcare fraud analytics and model development at a large government contracting firm. Our client has multiple contracts with us, and I support one of them. I’ve been interested in moving into data engineering for a while and am about halfway through a master’s in computer and information technology.Recently, I asked if I could shadow the DE team on an adjacent contract, and they brought me in for their latest sprint. Shortly after, the program manager on that team asked if I’d be interested in applying for an open DE role. I was thrilled—it felt like the perfect opportunity.I already know the data really well (I worked on their recent migration efforts and use their tables regularly), and I’m familiar with some of the team. It’s a solid internal move with a lot of alignment.The catch? I’d have to take a $27K pay cut—from $137K to $110K.I expected a cut since I don’t have formal DE experience and would be stepping into a mid-level role, but that number feels steep—especially since I live in a high cost of living area and recently bought a house.⸻My question for you all:1. Would you take the job anyway, just to get your foot in the door?2. Has anyone else here made a similar internal switch from analyst to DE? How did it work out long-term?3. Are there ways to negotiate this kind of internal transition to ease the pay gap? (e.g. retention bonus, hybrid role, defined promotion path)4. If I pass this up, how hard would it be to break into DE externally without prior experience or the DE title?Any perspective—especially from folks who’ve made the jump or hired junior/mid DEs—would really help. Thanks in advance!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hopefully this is the correct subreddit. Not sure where else to ask. Premise: So our application has a requirement from the C-suite executives to be active-active. The goal for this discussion is to understand whether Mongo or Postgres makes the most sense to achieve that. Background: It is a containerized microservices application in EKS. Currently uses Oracle, which we’ve been asked to stop using due to license costs. Currently it’s single region but the requirement is to be multi region (US east and west) and support multi master DB.Details: Without revealing too much sensitive info, the application is essentially an order management system. Customer makes a purchase, we store the transaction information, which is also accessible to the customer if they wish to check it later. User base is 15 million registered users. DB currently had ~87TB worth of data. The schema looks like this. It’s very relational. It starts with the Order table which stores the transaction information (customer id, order id, date, payment info, etc). An Order can have one or many Items. Each Item has a Destination Address. Each Item also has a few more one-one and one-many relationships. My 2-cents are that switching to Postgres would be easier on the dev side (Oracle to PG isn’t too bad) but would require more effort on that DB side setting up pgactive, Citus, etc. And on the other hand switching to Mongo would be a pain on the dev side but easier on the DB side since the shading and replication feature pretty much come out the box. I’m not an experienced architect so any help, advice, guidance here would be very much appreciated.",

        "content": "**Hello everyone,**I hope you're all doing well.I'm reaching out here to ask for some guidance or suggestions as I continue my job search in the data engineering field.Let me introduce myself briefly. I began my career in 2017 as a junior data engineer and worked in India for 5 years. During that time, I gained solid experience with technologies such as Spark, Airflow, AWS, CI/CD, Kafka, Elasticsearch, SQL, Python, Scala, and a bit of GCP. These form the core of my technical background.After working with two companies in India, I moved to the UK in mid-2022 to pursue a Master’s degree in Data Science. It was a one-year program, and I graduated in 2023 with distinction. Right after graduation, I worked as a Machine Learning Research Assistant in the UK until February 2025. Around that time, I moved to Ireland on a joint visa, and I'm currently settled here.Since March 2025, I've been actively looking for opportunities in data engineering or software development. I’ve been fortunate to receive interviews from some great companies. I’ll admit, I wasn’t fully prepared for the first two or three, but since then, I’ve put in a lot of focused effort. I'm now quite confident in SQL, Python, and problem-solving.However, it’s now June, and I still haven’t landed a role. I’ve reached the final rounds in 3 or 4 interviews, but unfortunately, the outcomes have been negative. This has been difficult emotionally, and I'm growing concerned about the employment gap it’s creating in my career.I can feel the competition is intense, especially in the data engineering field. Some people are even surprised that I haven’t secured a role yet, given my 5+ years of experience and a master’s degree. I understand their perspective, but I’m truly doing everything I can.If anyone has any advice, guidance, or even just words of encouragement, I would deeply appreciate it. If you were in my position, what would you do? I’m starting to feel like my career is slipping away, and any support would mean a lot to me right now.Thank you so much in advance.",

        "content": "I'm not talking about Gen AI doing data engineering work... specifically what does data engineering look like for supporting Gen AI services/products?Below are a few thoughts from what i've seen in the market and my own building; but I would love to hear what others are seeing!1. A key differentiator for quality LLM output is providing it great context, thus the role of information organization, data mining, and information retrieval is becoming more important. With that said, I don't see traditional data modeling fully fitting this paradigm given that the relationship are much more flexible with LLMs. Something I'm thinking about is what are identifiers around \"text themes\" an modeling around that (I could 100% be over complicating this though).2. I think security and governance controls are going to become more important in data engineering. Before LLMs, it was pretty hard to expose sensitive data without gross negligence. Today with consumer focused AI, people are sending PII to these AI tools that are then sending it to their external APIs (especially among non-technical users). I think people will come to their senses soon, but the barriers of protection via processes and training have been eroded substantially with the easy adoption of AI.3. Data integrations with third parties is going to become trivial. For example, say you don't have budget for Fivetran and have to build your own connection from Salesforce to your data warehouse. The process of going through API docs, building a pipeline, parsing nested JSON, dealing with edge cases, etc takes a long time. I see a move towards offloading this work to AI \"agents\" (loaded term now I know), but essentially I'm seeing traction with MCP server. So data eng work is less around building data models for other humans, but instead for external AI agents to work with.Is this matching what you are seeing?edit: typos",

In my job, I think I have reached the boundary between data engineering and data science, and I'm out of my depth right now.I work for a government contractor. I am the only data scientist on the team and was recently hired. It's government work, so it's inherently a little slow and we don't necessarily have the newest tools. Since they have not hired a data scientist before, I currently have more infrastructure-related tasks. I also don't have a ton of people that I can get help from - I might need to reach out to somebody on a totally different contract if I wanted some insight/mentorship on this, which wouldn't be impossible, but I figured that posting here might get me more breadth.Vaguely, there is an abundance of data that is (mostly) stored on Oracle databases. One smaller subset of it is stored on an ElasticSearch cluster. It's an enormous amount that goes back 15 years. It has been slow for me to get access to the Oracle database and ElasticSearch cluster, just because they've never had to give someone access before that wasn't already a database admin.I am very fortunate that the data (1) exists and (2) exists in a way that would actually be useful for building a model, which is what I have primarily been hired to do. Now that I have access to these databases, I've been trying to find the best way to work with the data. I've been trying to move toward storing it in parquet files, but today, I was thinking, \"this feels really weird that all these parquet files would just exist locally for me.\" Some Googling later, I encountered this concept of a \"data lake.\"I'm posting here largely because I'm hopeful to understand how this process works in industry - I definitely didn't learn this in school! I've been having this nagging feeling that \"something is missing\" - like there should be something in between the database and any analysis/EDA that I'm doing in Python. This is because queries are slow, it doesn't feel scalable for me to locally store a bunch of parquet files, and there is just no single, versioned source of \"truth.\"Is a data lake (or lakehouse?) what is typically used in this situation?",

I wonder how long it has been available, and hence, whether I could have avoided the ordeals in getting PySpark working (and not very well, at that).Looking back at the files [here](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyspark/files), it seems that it started 8 years ago, which is much longer than I've been using Python, and much, much longer than my stints into PySpark. Is this a reasonably accurate way to determine how long it has been available?",

They'll also add only what's the absolute minimum. How are they going to maintain all that mess? They also think the API doesn't need any sorting or filtering and querying millions of rows daily is fine even though the rate limiting doesn't allow it. To me the point of an API is that it serves all the common use cases and is a pretty universal way to interface with the system. I think they are making things difficult on purpose and artificially creating themselves billable hours.",

Since all these servers are in LAN, storage is mounted via nfs on both trino worker and coordinator and hive catalog server. When I create table from trino, It creates it, and acts as a success, even when later i insert values into it and select it, it acts as everything is normal, even selecting .\"table$files\" works as expected showing correct path. But when I check the path its meant to be writing into, its empty. as I create a table, an empty folder with table name and uuid is created, but no data/metadata inside. Most likely it is being cached somewhere, because if i reboot the trino server (and not restart trino, bcz that does not change it), the message says: Query failed: Metadata not found in metadata location for table but cant create same table before I drop current one. BTW, dropping the table is also success, but does not remove the folder from the original storage. (the empty folder it creates)Please help me, I'm about to burn this place down and migrate to different country.",

It has significantly less powerbi than I expected and is actually 80% modelling / DWH work.There isn’t any direct Data employee, they have a consultant that visits once every 2 weeks and I can contact him online. When he’s teaching me he’s very helpful and I learn a lot. But like any consultant he’s incredibly bizzy as per usual.There is so much I still need to learn and realize. I am 22, and super willing to learn more in my free time, luckily my work environment isn’t soulcrushing but I want to make something of the opportunity. So far my work has provided me with udemy and I’m also going to get DataCamp. Still I was wondering if any of you guys had advice for me to improve myself and become a worthy Data engineer / data guy.Since right now it almost feels like starting as junior dev again that doesn’t know crap. But I’m motivated to work to get past that point. I just get the feeling it might not come from just doing my best at my workplace, just like when I was working as a webdev. I don’t want to fall behind my age expected skill levelWish you guys a good day and thank you for whatever advice you can help me out with.Hope to have a long and succesful career in data :)",

This is for a 100M+ row fact table that grows by 3-4M rows/day, and it's the first large-scale QuickSight embed for our team.We’d love any \"war stories\" or insights you have on the five gaps below please:1. **Dynamic filters** – We need to use the JS SDK to push `tenant_id` and ad-hoc date ranges from our parent app at runtime. Is this feature rock-solid or brittle? Any unexpected limits?2. **Pivot + bookmark persistence** – Can an end-user create and save a custom pivot layout as a \"bookmark\" *inside the embed*, without having to go to the main QS console?3. **Exports** – We have a hard requirement for both **CSV** and native **.xlsx** exports directly from the embedded dashboard. Are there any hidden row caps or API throttles we should know about?4. **SPICE vs. Direct Query** – For a table of this size, does an hourly incremental SPICE refresh work reliably, or is it painful? Any horror stories about Direct Query queueing under heavy concurrent use?5. **Row-level security at scale** – What is the community's consensus or best practice? Should we use separate QuickSight namespaces per tenant, or a single namespace with a dynamic RLS rules table?Links, gotchas, or clever workarounds—all are welcome. We're a small data-eng crew and really appreciate you sharing your experience!Thank you very much for your time and expertise!",

I’ve built several projects, some quite complex, like an image size compressor but none of that mattered when I failed to write a basic loop. Maybe it was the nerves, or maybe I just froze under pressure. I’m not entirely sure.I don’t know if it’s appropriate to share this here, but I felt the need to. This experience shook me. I realize now that I need to revisit the basics, not out of shame, but because I owe it to myself to rebuild with confidence.",

However, despite all my efforts, I’m starting to feel pretty dumb. It seems like everyone around me (especially the younger folks) is just picking it up so easily, and I’m struggling to even understand the basics sometimes.I guess I just feel a bit discouraged. Maybe I’m too old for this? But I really don’t want to give up just yet.Has anyone else been in a similar situation or can offer advice on how to keep going? Any tips on how to break through the initial confusion? Maybe a different learning approach or resources that worked for you?Thanks in advance, I appreciate any help!",

One game costs 3 credits. The machine has three reels, each displaying either an apple, a banana, or a clementine. If all three reels show the same fruit, the player wins. The following payouts apply depending on the fruit:- 3 apples: 10 credits- 3 bananas: 15 credits- 3 clementines: 20 creditsA player can deposit money or withdraw it.Optional RequirementsIf there is still enough time available, you can implement the following optional requirement:The player can increase their bet for a game. If they win, they are rewarded with more credits in proportion to the risk they took.```Now I got an E-Mail saying:> You brought a lot to the table in terms of personality and as a consultant, but unfortunately, the technical aspect didn’t quite meet their expectations.Can you tell me why I failed?- [The Repo](https://github.com/xtay2/one-armed-bandit)- [The Docs](https://editor-next.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xtay2/one-armed-bandit/refs/heads/master/docs/api-v1.yaml)EDIT: On the branch `feat/database` is also a version using PostgreSQL as persistent data storage.EDIT 2: Added the optional requirement(s).EDIT 3:I asked them if I should provide persistence & auth, but they responded saying:> The task doesn't have explicit requirements for persistence or user management. \"dillegence\" refers more to quality and care than to going beyond the requirements.> At the same time, we chose the task so that it can be completed in a manageable amount of time.

Cool, get some actual experience and don't just learn theory and how to write a console app. After some months of applying (keep in mind, during the two years the employer has no costs, since I don't get a salary from them and they don't have to pay taxes for me) I found a small, but established company that decided to take me. The CEO was very upfront about everything, there is nobody here that knows anything about coding, I would be the only one that maintains the main product of the company and he understands that I have to learn a lot before I become an expert. After a few days of thinking about it and talking to teachers and an acquaintance of mine I thought that this is a great opportunity to learn and become competent in a wide variety.It's my third month now and I still don't know what I am doing. We just started coding TicTacToe in School and at work I am currently (stuck at) rewriting a standalone part of the project with roughly 5k Lines, integration into multiple third-party services and a device developed by us. To my shame I have to admit I have vibecoded a large chunk of it. Now I am stuck on two projects, where the solutions seems like it would be solved by someone with actual experience within two hours.Did I fuck up, or is there some place I can get somebody that is somewhat knowledgeable in our tech stack to sit down with me for a day and explain some basic concepts?Thanks if anybody has some advice, and also thanks if you tell me that I'm an idiot that plunged himself too deep into the waters.Edit: Techstack is React, C#, hosted on Azure. Project I'm stuck on is an update from .NET3(in process) to .NET8(isolated worker), since the .NET3 pipeline fails to build.",

Starting off it was pretty fun and simple, create things, automate things etc. But within the last 6-ish months I've been pushing myself to learn more complex things. It started with webapps, Django, REST apis, etcThen moved onto database info, postgres etc.Then moved onto frontend with React etc. I began to feel like things were slowly *snowballing* out of control, that i didn't really understand how to code anymore, and that i was relying too heavily on docs/stack overflow etc. everything felt like a hacky-system that i was just sticking together.So i decided to go back to Python basics and do an intermediate project that doesn't rely on any of that. A chess engine.Something i almost attempted before, but decided to do web apps instead. And i can't even begin to understand what to do. I spent hours researching, planning etc. And when looking things up, you have 2 extremes. 1. No answer to simple questions. 2. A direct answer giving you all the code. Now i decided that it wasn't really something i wanted to do. And decided to think of another project... but tbh i just want to quit at this point. I miss the days where i would just create classes/objects from scratch, my own decorators, functions, inheritance etc. When i actually *made* things. Yknow?Now everything is: \" slap this thing thats already created into another thing. Spend months learning a framework on specific functions, states, objects, that change more frequently than your underwear. To put something together in 2 lines that you don't quite understand! \"Does anyone else feel like this? Am i just going about everything wrong? Should i start a project from scratch that i just absolutely don't touch other frameworks/modules etc?Kinda stuck, lost, and demotivated.",

It’s the same way I feel about my academics.My biggest goal has always been to expand my portfolio especially during the summer. And at first while classes were technically over in highschool, I was first being productive towards my goal spending everyday coding this one project. I later became tired and fed up with my process that I moved onto another as a break of sorts. Then another. And another. And at this point, I haven’t coded in a while in two weeks or done anything productive. I’ve really just been getting into crochet to take off the pressure about contractual stuff and just focus on something else for the time being like making a sweater I saw from Pinterest for instance..I have about three projects which are unfinished and I promised myself especially about the portfolio website that I will finish it because I have been working on that since last December. Then again the reason why it took awhile was because of I was trying to figure out and decide what the UI would look just to avoid large frontend revisions. Anyways, any advice for managing projects? I really want to be able to finish these independently and especially at least one of these within the end of the summer.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I see a lot of posts, particularly from people trying to learn about the dangers of AI. I think it's very easy to misuse it but there are a few simple things we can all do to keep ourselves growing. The issue with AI is that it's answers are too easy so they don't \"stick\" in your mind.1) Never copy and paste code. This applies to tutorials as well. The act of typing will help you remember. Pair this with consciously thinking about everything you type and scrolling through IDE intellisense suggestions.2) Always ask for an explanation. Even for simple things, just reading the explanation can help your brain.3) Get familiar with documentation. AI can spit out an answer, but it isn't necessarily giving you the best answer. Looking at docs (if they are good) will show you different ways of using certain features or components. Alternatively, ask AI for different options and explanations of what works best in what situations.4) Ask about design patterns and Strategies rather than specific code snippets. This has helped me a ton. It's easy to find an article about why x is better than y, but the reality is most of the time each strategy fits a different requirement better and sometimes it's about how you want to build your system. 5) if you don't need AI, don't use it. Even if it takes you a little longer to do something, forcing your brain to recall something will signal to your brain that that information is important and we should keep it. If you overly rely on AI, your brain will stop retaining the information. The same thing happens in a relationship. If your partner is responsible for feeding the pets, it's hard for you to remember. That is shared memory and it happens with AI.",

Started with editing (see: copying code into and altering) a 3D character controller state machine for godot, was pretty proud that I got it so that the player couldn't uncrouch underneath something and adapted someone else's code to make a leaning system. Realized the 3D game idea was way way too outside of my skill set so I downgraded to 2D, worked on that a bit, got caught up making screenshot mockups cause I'm an artist, barely really coded anything but figured that this was still too hard for me probably. Tried making pong. Too hard. Finally I just ate my pride and said I'd shed the need of trying to learn to program and learn a game engine at the same time and now I'm making a text adventure game in python.The reason I had my first win is cause I've had such a hard time coding anything by myself. I've always needed a tutorial and never come up with solutions on my own. I needed a bit of help to get this project rolling but overall but now I'm able to open up VS Code and work alone with googling and documentation reading. I made a really basic save system on my own! Came up with the problem, thought about it, and came to a solution on my own! It's far from robust or complex, there are probably a million better ways to do this but I did it by myself and I'd say it's reasonably complex considering I was having troubles coding a 2D character controller on my own.I've got a long way to go but I think this is a good ass win.

Sometimes, I read about people’s experiences as web developers or in other tech fields, and one common thing I come across is the negative side of being a programmer, like how it's hard to get a junior dev job, how companies often treat developers poorly, and how competitive the job market is.It makes me wonder, is all the learning even worth it at this point? Especially with concerns about AI taking over jobs. I’m anxious about whether this field will actually bear any fruit. I do like programming though.",

The curly braces especially, semicolons make so much sense and when looking at Python code snippets it just looks so unnatural. Yet so many people SWEAR by how enjoyable it is to use. So, I want to ask, is it really?Python does look easy, but the indentation makes no sense to me and it honestly makes code more difficult to follow for me. I have no experience in Python so I may be VERY wrong. But personally, even though I can understand Python code to a good extent, the indentation just throws me off and makes reading nested code a HEADACHE for me because I have to take a hot second on each line to see where the indentation begins and ends. Now, this could all be because of my unfamiliarity with the language, but isn't the whole point of Python to be easy to read and understand? It is easy to read, I understand most code snippets out there, but the whole indentation thing is just so confusing to me. Is this a normal thing to say? Am I going crazy for questioning Python's readability? I'll still learn it some day, but I just wanted to ask whether anybody has ever felt this way and how they overcame it, because I don't want to get a headache every time I create an API.",

That's (more or less) why we have the very popular rule of thumb in Python: multithreading for I/O-bound work, multiprocessing for CPU-bound work.Also thank you to u/HQMorganstern for the more detailed explanation",

Watching the channel grow over the years and gain millions of subscribers has been awesome.Lately though, I’ve noticed that most of the content has been focused on AI, especially in the Code Report series. I totally understand why AI is huge right now, and those videos are pulling crazy numbers. But I kind of miss his older content, like the classic “100 Seconds of (Tech)” videos, the JavaScript survival guide, or Web Dev 101. That kind of content was gold, especially for new and intermediate devs or engineers trying to get a solid grip on different technologies quickly.It does seem like Fireship is aware of this he even mentioned in the recent MCP tutorial video that it’s still a tutorial channel. So it’s nice to see that acknowledgment. And to be fair, even his newer videos still have that signature humor and creativity that made his channel stand out in the first place.Overall, I still really enjoy his channel and respect what he’s doing. It’s been a valuable resource for a lot of programmers, developers, engineers. Fireship has played a big role in making learning tech feel less intimidating and more fun, and that’s something I’ll always appreciate.",

I’m new to programming, have been dabbling for a couple months now and I recently started CS50 which so far has been great in helping build a more conceptual understanding of cs.However, I’ve been really struggling for the past two days. I get crazy brain fog while I’m watching the lecture (my digestion has been off lately so it might be a factor) which makes it nearly impossible to digest—no pun intended—some concepts from the course, such as functions and loops. It’s very hard not to let this obstacle convince me that coding is just not for me, but I can’t deny how this brain fog makes it extremely hard to focus and have mental clarity. As a side note, I’m also navigating a difficult situation in life and it’s bringing a lot of stress and frustration. Has anyone ever dealt with that? Any advice? How not to let this issue discourage you from continuing to learn… I’ve got a personal project I really want to work on, and the last thing I want to hear is that I won’t be able to make it :pensive_face:",

I am currently enrolled in option 2 but I know it is going to be a struggle. I’m wondering if I should try to teach myself python basics before I get to school so I have a chance at passing (reviews mentioned the level of coding involved is not actually appropriate for an intro level class, and only students with previous experience were able to do well) or see if I can ask an advisor about finding an approved alternative course. Luckily my dad knows python so I can ask him for help on assignments and stuff so I won’t be completely lost if this class is my only option. What should I do?

Some tiny fixes, stuff that's typical for THIS project, rummaging around in the database to fix some documents' flow for the users etc. It's not that I sit around doing nothing, there is work to do, but I feel more like a corporate excel sheet master than a SWE.There's little actual coding. The processes and flow are poor, the PM is rather bad, code reviews, well, at least sometimes they exist. In general, I make money, the job is steady, I save and invest, live with my mom, so getting laid off wouldn't be the end of the world. I'm just not learning much, or at least not the things that are considered good practice. I want to get good at SWE tho and challenge myself. In order not to fall behind I study on my own, but sometimes I'm just too tired, the university demands other things, or I just wanna do other things - I'm in my early twenties lol.In 2 years I'll have done what might amount to 6 months of work that my colleagues in well-managed companies/projects have done. When it comes to find a new position, odds are I won't even stand a chance compared to my peers with similar YOE. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but YOE that aren't proportional to my actual knowledge make me kinda anxious.Or maybe the baseline is that my YOE would be a way to get my foot in the door, and the rest is just a matter of getting prepared and passing an interview, and the rest is just fake it till you make it, until things start to click - just like it was for the first time:) What's your view/advice? Anybody who is/was in a similar situation who wants to share?",

I even spent days reading Reddit threads and Quora answers trying to “find the best roadmap.”* Guess what? I wasted 3 full months doing just this. Minimal progress. Constant overwhelm. I wasn’t practicing,  I was just researching how to practice.* It hit me hard when my senior told me: The best resource is the one you actually stick to.* That’s when things changed. I picked one creator whose teaching style I liked. I stopped second-guessing and stuck to their roadmap. Within weeks, I saw more clarity and growth than I had in the past few months.* Here’s what I learned: You don’t need 10 resources. Give yourself 1-2 days max to pick a creator/platform. Then stop looking. Start solving. That’s where the growth is.* Don’t fall into the trap that the next video or roadmap will finally unlock it. Progress doesn’t come from finding the perfect guide, it comes from showing up and putting in the reps.If you’re just starting out, learn from my mistakes. Pick one solid resource. Trust it.

The courses are very well put together and really make it easy and approachable to pick up and learn the foundational material. The community is exceptionally helpful, the AI tool for education theyve employed is very good at \"teaching\" you concepts without just flat providing the answers (very different from what the other AIs out there do), and you do feel as though you are progressing and learning as you go up in the subject matter.>**THE GRIPE** *i say this as someone who did NOT have a coding background*As you move along through the courses, especially once you hit the PyGame / Object Oriented Programming / Functional Programming areas, you will start to hit \"concept walls\" where you can't complete the answer just based on the information that's been previously provided.

It's just very frustrating at times to feel as though you've been paying attention to the materials and following along, only to suddenly hit a wall of knowledge and discover, \\[ no its designed to not be informed, so you have an urge to go out and find what you dont know \\]. Personally, if I'm paying for a service, I want the knowledge to be provided for learning, not that I have to go out externally elsewhere and hopefully discover it. >**THE WARNING**Content will become SIGNIFICANTLY harder as you progress. The Discord is there and does help a lot in answer basic questions, and some more advanced ones; but it does genuinely feel as though the course materials are being written more for people who are already have familiarity with Comp Sci / Programming, **ie the core basics**, and then the later courses are meant to build on top of that wider external schooling and knowledge. Those that are there to assist, again all well meaning and wanting to be helpful, advise on how to solve for it as if they were speaking to other programmers who also are familiar with the code youre having trouble with. Like hearing 2 experts talk to each other trying to solve a problem, if youre not on the same level knowledge wise, it becomes more difficult to follow along on what theyre trying to advise on how to correct for. >**FINAL THOUGHTS**The service provided is INCREDIBLY well worth the cost... to a point depending on where you're starting from. If you have some code formal training / teaching, it probably is easier to follow along, but its openly stated that there is a teaching approach of not providing all the resources / guideposts for you to follow, and that you should go beyond the platform to find some answers.**For me, I have issue with that approach as a service I'm paying for to learn a subject matter on** *but again, thats uniquely to me*I just want to share this to both promote the service, as I have been able to write functional python blurbs for solving my own small scale ideas and puzzles; but also as a warning that its VERY unlikely you can go into this, completely cold fresh and blind, and come out within 1 year as a trained backend dev with the full experience. I'll most likely renew my yearly membership for the platform, but there are hurdles that I now have to figure out the best way to learn-around instead of just beating my face into the wall as I have been for some problems.",

        "author": "NigoDuppy",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Let me start by saying I’m (early career) a year into this corporate job at a \"billion-dollar\" multinational company. I fully understand that any work I do while employed is legally the company's intellectual property. That said, this post is more about how I can take advantage of my contributions for my career rather than being brushed aside.A couple of weeks ago, I made an earlier post about a similar situation, but at a smaller scale. Since then, things have escalated quickly, and I feel the new developments warrant a separate post.Long story short, I modernized an outdated system with great success for our region. It gained a lot of traction so much so that a team from another region requested I build the same system for them, tailored to their needs.Now here’s where the new developments start. Apparently, while all this was happening, someone higher up at the global level got access to my project and showed it to their boss who is just one level below the CEO. I still have no idea who this person is or how they even gained access to my work. Anyways, this corporate leader was so impressed that they decided the system should be rolled out globally as soon as possible. The person who shared my project then took it upon themselves to assign a team dedicated to replicating it for all regions.Now this assigned team somehow managed to access my project (I genuinely suspect a security breach or admin-level involvement) and tried to reverse-engineer everything I built.. but failed. They then began trying to identify who was behind the project and eventually contacted my manager (the \"official\" project manager) by pulling him into a meeting without prior notice. Odd.So my manager then decided to setup a proper call with this team with me involved this time. In this call, they basically came forward and requested us to provide all the code, tools, and infrastructure so they can simply copy and paste it for all regions, as well as requesting several technical sessions. To make matters worse, they want me to handle all the IT bureaucratic processes for every region to get things set up. I can already see myself being roped into supporting all regions and not just my own at this point. Not only that, but I believe this \"replication\" approach will be destined to fail as each region has different user requirements and processes not quite comparable to ours. And I also strongly believe they will struggle to get anything running, due to their limited technical and business knowledge of the processes, and the type of technical questions I was being asked. Nevertheless, if this team rolls out my solution globally for each region, they’ll receive all the visibility and credit (they'll be hosting demo sessions with region leaders which for sure I wont be invited to), while I'll be essentially cast into the shadows. What’s frustrating is that I have full knowledge of the system and am responsible for it so why isn't my manager at least being the one leading this global rollout and not some random team?I’ve been trying to indirectly nudge my manager to take ownership of the global initiative, instead of letting this new team take over. But I’m not sure how this will play out. The person who assigned this team is closer to the corporate leader, while my manager is a few steps lower in the hierarchy. So far, all he’s done is try to keep our regional manager informed of the situation playing out. Realistically, only the regional manager can mention this to the corporate leader, but I’m not confident that will happen.My manager often says \"how will this benefit the team?\" But in this case, it’s clear he’s struggling to see any benefit in simply handing over our work to another team that will walk away with all the credit.We’re still in the early stages, and I haven’t handed anything over yet. But I’m deeply concerned about how this is unfolding. From a career perspective, it looks like I'm gaining nothing from this besides telling myself I did the work. Being so early in my career, a project like this would really benefit me tenfold. I really don't want to waste this chance to turn this into something beneficial.&nbsp;EDIT: Thank you to everyone who shared their perspective. I recognize that my tone reflected more negativity than I aim to carry as a person. I allowed ego to slip in due to the project's success. Moving forward, I’ll focus on assuming positive intent and professionally advocating for myself when possible as that is the only thing I truly have control over.",

Especially because the job was in-person and paid something like 50k, which is not much for Boston.I work in economics, so I'm curious to see if this experience is representative of the field overall right now and what that might signal for the trajectory of the economy. From browsing this subreddit, it does seem like there's a lot of lamenting the state of the job market, but I'd be curious to hear insiders' perspectives.For anyone involved in hiring, are you seeing similar levels of competition? If so, is this a recent occurrence or has it been ongoing for a while? Is the current hiring environment similar to previous periods you've experienced (the Dot-com bubble, the GFC, etc.)?",

After about 6–9 years in this role, is there really anywhere to go?Let’s be real — it’s a simple job. You build screens, hook up APIs, and maybe add some animations or state handling here and there. But when it comes to core business logic, anything that actually requires deeper system thinking or architectural decisions — all of that is almost always at the backend (for good reasons).And honestly, most app devs I’ve worked with don’t even try to go beyond that. Very little interest in performance optimization, state management patterns, or even understanding what happens behind the API. It’s mostly a UI plumbing job.So I’m wondering — is this it? Do people just keep doing the same thing for 10–15 years until they’re replaced by younger devs who can do the same job for cheaper? Or is there a natural transition path (into BE, product, or something else) that actually makes sense?Would love to hear from others who’ve been in the app dev track longer or made a pivot.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I work at a fairly established but small company that had about 200 people when I started. Now it’s down to about 120. No layoffs but there’s been some people singled out and fired, and a ton of churn. I suspect a lot of problems here are happening in the industry as a whole. For product and eng it’s 100% driven by low engagement and burnout. I only started here in August but it’s been a straight trend of just doing everything wrong. New product leader came in around when I did. Slowly ripped away any authority that ICs/managers have to define their scope or what to prioritize. It’s extremely top-down, do whatever the cofounders want now, and that was fairly insulated when I started. They’ve pushed out any and all leadership that were a source of any friction at the top, and I think they saw this new leader they hired was gonna validate anything they say. Now it’s only yes-people in the room. Teams and reorgs constantly happen at whims of leadership without really consulting anyone. This then impacts roadmap items but the expectations don’t change. Roadmap itself is never even really committed too, cause they change priorities there all the time, you never know when or why the thing you were working on for three weeks will get deprioritized. You also don’t know when something you thought you’d do a month later you’re now expected to present a prototype of at the end of the week. A lot of expected overtime work, not a lot of pay or advancement opportunity. Definitely a lack of clarity or support on directions given. I’ve seen people ask valid questions get put on PIPs basically. As a designer I can definitely say this is not a place I expect to do great work or anything I can really showcase. The top down mandate is quite simply, AI-wash the product. I worked on a project with that mandate, just impossible constraints and no scope clarity. So I had to challenge that team to really turn this into something that customers would value and pay for and set a small target. With the full support and backing of my manager we really pushed to make sure it’s at least providing real value to the user, compromised as quickly as possible when necessary to unblock Eng (we were all building the plane while flying it). We really inserted ourselves so that we don’t make terrible UX decisions even and especially when that made things a little harder. Worked really hard on it, set a bar for quality. Executives swooped in last two weeks before launch and started asking for tons of changes, same timeline. So, lost time QAing there that really would have made a difference. Delayed the launch. They freaked out and blamed everyone they were pushing to work 80 hour weeks for a month to get this done. An eng quit on the spot which I applaud. Sure enough it launched and immediately sold enough to make the company profitable for its first quarter in like two years. Did we get any additional respect or acknowledgement, maybe some trust and respect for our process? lol. Well, that product leader got all the credit somehow despite having very little involvement. They got a promotion, and my manager, the one really backing me up challenging them and the team, got demoted, so no design voice in the leadership room now. This is the same product leader who’s entire staff either quit or been let go since they joined, and a replacement hired for most of them. Despised by everyone in product, design, and eng now. Yet, great at rubbing shoulders with management and pleasing them. Way too small of a company for politics like that to really work, but sure enough they convinced founders that they’re the goat. They have multiple engagement surveys where we’ve basically flatlined to zero on product side since that leader started. Feedback has been given calling out leadership as the source. None of the driving behavior changed or was addressed by them, it only got worse. Then Eng started to feel the impact of this over the last 6 months. A lot of them started quitting, the best ones that had been there longest and had most domain knowledge. most recent engagement shows a big dip for them now too. Def cannot replace them faster than they quit right now and it’s an existential risk. It’s looking like the ship is gonna sink itself here. I’m also just wondering if there’s greener grass or is this just how the industry is gonna be for a while? Business idiots running everything into the ground with zero accountability, and ICs treated like disposable resources who can be replaced by AI if they go. It’s frustrating cause if they actually empowered us a bit more, we have the talent and means of making a great product that actually sells, but it’s like their own egos take priority and they can’t conceive of anyone knowing the business opportunities worth investing in other than themselves. Down to the micromanaged details, like they don’t trust or value the expertise they hired.",

For example, data engineering and data analytics roles. Most positions I keep seeing are in some metro area requiring relocation and not even tolerating any sort of remote applicant anymore. This is completely opposite to how it was when I entered the workforce in 2020. In 2020, people were excited to talk to me and reaching out all the time regardless of where I lived. Now they don't care what my qualifications are, how talented I am, what my skill set is. They just won't even consider me at all it's like they just close the door in a huff and cut off communications if I'm not directly in the local area. I can give you one example. Lowe's the hardware store. Back in 2021 they were trying to recruit me even though I wasn't in the area. I talked to the same recruiter again couple weeks ago, and she was very dismissive and condescending about me not wanting to relocate to Charlotte North Carolina, and was very adamant about the fact that I would have to drive outside of Charlotte about 20 mi north of the city to Morrisville where the job was located, which is honestly kind of stupid if you ask me? Why would I go and move to a big city right? And then live out in the middle of nowhere to commute to this weird corporate office. So I would basically be making my life worse and more costly",

Technically, I’ve been eligible to graduate for the past year, but I’ve been deliberately delaying it to continue doing internships and gain experience while at the same time applying for full-time jobs. My plan was always to hit the graduation button the moment something landed.So far, I’ve racked up **28 months of internship experience**, mostly including software and hardware development at places like Dell Technologies and a space agency. And yet, I’m still struggling to land a full-time role, let alone an interview.The job market here in Vancouver (and across Canada) has been... bleak. I’ll admit I’ve been picky, wanting to stay in here, but it's been *REALLY* tough. I’m feeling incredibly stuck and unsure of how to move forward.I have some options that I'm considering, but I just don't know which move is best1. Delay graduation again to do an Undergraduate Thesis in Robotics, hopefully to fluff my GPA a bit and make me more competitive for grad school. Problem is, though I have considered a master's program, I don't even know what I'd want that to be in.2. Graduate in August and spend day and *night* applying for jobs. Figure out a grad school to go to later and hope my CV is good enough to get in. Maybe do an accounting diploma in the evenings as a back-up (I've heard the memes, I did have a friend successfully land a job after a year of their diploma though)3. Go into Electrical trades (my friend spent 8 months looking for work and started doing this when he couldn't find anything).4. Join the Air ForceFor those in similar shoes, what did you do? Would love to hear if anyone’s been in a similar situation or has insight from the other side.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I am a ~~Senior~~ Backend Engineer who has never made it past Junior. I got fucked over by two jobs in a row over the past 4 years which held me back. Its a long story so I'll try to keep it somewhat short (because oh boy there is so much more I could talk about).The first one was one I held for 3 years. The company was tumultuous and there was high turn over, and a year into the job, half of the engineers were gone and replaced, and by year 3, I was the longest tenure engineer at the company. When I first started there, we had no titles besides Software Engineer and Senior Software Engineer. 2 years in, they decided they wanted to be more like other companies and decided to implement bands. At this point, I was doing system design, db design, security, re-architecture work, introducing process changes, leading meetings, mentoring, etc. I was pushing to get a promotion, because I was doing way more senior work than other seniors in the company, but I was told that they were making a rubric and had frozen promotions for 6 months.So, 6 months go by and we have this new salary/title band system, and we get a new HR system as well. I don't think too much of it until one day I go to submit some time off, and under my profile name, it says \"Software Engineer I\", the lowest title level. I'm stunned and go look at the org chart and out of 40 engineers, I am the ONLY ONE who is a Software Engineer I. I bring it up to the engineering manager and he tells me to just go through the review process and it should be fixed with the new rubric. So review time comes around and I finally get the rubric that I had been asking for for a month, and the new rubric ends up blocking my promotion.Why? Because whoever made the rubric decided one of the requirements to go from Engineer I to Engineer II is that you have \"Taken responsibility when your changes were responsible for a critical error\". Problem is, after 2.5 years, I never introduced a show-stopping bug. I was the only engineer in the company who never introduced a show-stopping bug. So apparently, I failed that requirement, so they weren't going to give me a promotion. I ended up getting laid off with a bunch of other people 6 months after.Then last year, I started working a job that was supposed to be a Senior Engineer position, but even though I did great on the interviews, because my previous position wasn't as a \"Senior\", they wouldn't give me the senior title. At this point, things were starting to get pretty bad with the job market and I was desperate, so I took it. Ended up getting laid off again with people late last year.Now, with how bad the market has gotten, I am struggling to get any traction. I am one of those devs who truly loves writing software, and I've loved it since I first tried it out in high school just for fun. I'm not the most genius engineer or anything like that, but I truly love it, and its not about the money for me. But these past 4 years have really killed my drive and motivation. Now here I am, barely getting any traction while job-searching for months, and since every job posting out there is for Senior+, I'm getting filtered out of jobs left and right. At this point, should I just \"lie\" (or rather, correct what titles I should have had)?Edit: To all the people saying \"senior titles don't matter\", go tell that to the ATS's. The market today doesn't care about your opinion on whether titles are meaningless or not, and I know full well that the titles don't mean a practical difference in capability. But its not your opinion or mine about whether titles have inherent meaning (which unfortunately they do in terms of org charts, compensation, HR, and many other ways that are not directly technical). You CAN and DO get filtered out of application processes by titles, and this isn't the kind of market where you can afford to have that kind of opinion while job searching.",

My thinking was that I'd take the route of automating everything I can to impress the devs and join them at the company, but no such luck. My company is mostly foreign, with about 70% of the staff being Chinese... including the entirety of the devs. I don't speak Chinese, and there's a blatant opportunity/ compensation bias towards my Chinese coworkers. Nonetheless, I get a few Automation certs, make a couple projects specifically for the company's benefit with the previous stack, and it gets me nowhere. A \"Thank you! Now get back to work\", and a 2% annual bump in my salary. So, while still trying to create applications/software to benefit my company, my main work has been devolved into manual testing. I'm desperately doing anything I can to code. But I feel like I've got the QA brand on me now after this long.Then I get home, see 3-5 more rejections from the prior days applications, apply to 15-20 more, leetcode, work on projects/ certs, go to the gym and lift out my frustration, and go to bed. It's been like this for **2 and a half years** now, and I'm losing my mind. I spend most of my days feeling like an absolute failure, and hating myself over this, and it's effecting my relationships because people are picking up on it now. I see friends/ acquaintances of the same age buying homes, having kids etc., that went right into the trades after high school. And I'm still living at my parent's place. I just feel so incredibly cheated and disheartened that those 4 years in college and countless post-midnight study grind sessions, along with all of the extra effort post-grad haven't gotten me anywhere.I just don't know what to do. I don't want to be a CEO. I'm not applying to FANG or anything like that. Just all normal, average companies. I don't care to be wildly rich. I just want to be able to comfortably support a future family, and buy a house for them, and live out the American Dream.

        "content": "Long story short, I started a new job at a FAANG company as a full stack engineer. Idk how I got it, but I got it. Before this, I was working as a Full Stack Developer for the last 4 years at a very small company. The typical task at my last job was very simple CRUD work with business logic sprinkled in and our whole system ran fine on a medium EC2 instance. Everything I learned for that job came from a Full Stack Udemy course.While I did go to a good university, my major was in Statistics, meaning that I don't have a computer science background and have been self taught. Other than the Udemy course, I took MIT's OCW class in data structures & algorithms ages ago which has helped when it comes to leetcode and the like. I also have a pretty decent understanding of high level system design from watching a ton of videos in preparation for interviews. This gave me enough knowledge to pass the interview.We have a few backend developers on the team and they talk about things like concurrency, race conditions, etc, and are all very smart coming from working at Google and a Quant firm. I get the gist of what they're saying, especially after googling the terms and realizing that I knew the concept but not the word, but at the same time, I sometimes feel like I know absolutely nothing and it's starting to worry me (tbf it's only been 2 weeks but still).What sort of courses should I take so I can also slowly start understanding what's happening and not feel out of place? I do prefer video lectures rather than a book. It can also be paid. Additionally, is there any advice you guys can give me to succeed in this role and successfully keep it? I feel like the last 4 years I've been playing little league and have only had to worry about such small things and picked up some bad habits, but now I'm in the big leagues and I feel so out of place.Thanks!",

        "content": "So a couple of years ago I wrote a script that did some clever tricks with the clipboard to streamline the otherwise manual effort of data population into an excel worksheet. I mainly wrote it for myself because I absolutely despise repetitive work, but word got around when I showed it to ONE person and I was persuaded to turn it into a standalone GUI tool. Eventually that task I entirely automated wasn't my responsibility anymore as I got a promotion and went to work on other projects. The individuals that wound up handling that task/responsibility heavily used my tool until it didn't work anymore because the structure of the source data changed, and the way the tool was written wasn't dynamic. So of course, they reach out to me to update it. I didn't really have time to update that thing, but they'd become so spoiled, I said okay. So I rewrote it. I implemented some pretty rudimentary data structures so it was dynamic and would work with any modifications to the source data. I also implemented some fuzzy matching so it would populate accurately regardless, whether there were differences in case or trailing spaces or whatever. One of the guys in the role decided to ask me for a walk through, because apparently, he has a CS degree. He looked through the code of the older version (static/hard coded) and the new version (dynamic/fuzzy) and said he didn't understand the updates --so he was going to work with the first one. Fast forward to yesterday and he's giving a \"demo\" on his \"updates\". On that call were members of management, eagerly anticipating something inventive and/or innovative from some supposed collaborative effort. I join the call late because I was super busy, but when I get on, he's walking through the logic, workflow, and data structures that I wrote in the first and second version. I'm sitting there like.. hmm.. this sounds like all of the functionality I built, and I'm wondering if I should air him out and let the entire group know. Of course I didn't because I'm better than that, but I did ask what improvements or updates he made (that constituted the meeting). The only thing he changed was swapping out one Excel read/write library for another, because the one I used (xlswriter) overwrites formulas in cells. Anyway, so while the tool isn't all that much of a big deal, because, I pretty much hacked it together in a couple of hours altogether to save myself some time, I can't help feeling a little petty about this dude passing along my work as his own. It's one thing to show the tool's usage, it's another to walk through the logic to upper-management, like he wrote the damn thing. AITA for even caring at all?",

I was really happy to get the job, a pay bump over my last role even though I’d have to go to the office 3/week instead of being fully remote. I started Monday. I had a 1hr meeting with HR where I also received my computer and someone was supposed to pick me up after the meeting as my onboarding guide. They never showed up. The HR guy spent almost an hr walking around the campus with me trying to figure out I should go and reaching out to my manager for guidance. My manager is a in whole different city and apparently nothing was planned for me. I ended doing nothing that day besides getting my computer. I personally reached out to the manager and he said he would call me but didn’t on the first day.2nd day, I had absolutely nothing planned on my calendar. I had no idea what I was supposed to do, who to talk to, and where to even site. Early in the morning I reached out to my manager to explain the situation and he called me and we had a 3 min team chat where he said he would assign me an onboarding guide. The whole day went by, nothing. Still nothing. And I still don’t have the guide.Today, 3rd… I had a one-hr HR meeting scheduled. Did that from 10 to 11. Since after that nothing else. I try to do some mandatory training that aren’t due for a full 6 months from now since I have nothing to do. I am on campus, not knowing where my desk is, who my teammates are, what my onboarding process is. Nothing. I feel like I am wasting my gas and money to go there just to sit in the cafeteria doing absolutely nothing. Tomorrow I’ll be “working” remotely. I have no idea what the plan is, nobody is saying anything to me, I don’t know anything about my benefits, I am not being helped by anyone.How should I behave in a situation like this",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I’m looking for people who might have gone through what I’m going through right now, and how they overcame it. I recently graduated college so I haven’t seen most of the world as of yet. I’m a Junior dev right now. 2 years of experience - this is the first and only place I’ve worked at. And it’s the only team I’ve worked with. I joined here straight out of college. Lately l have begun realizing just how emotionally invested I’ve become in this workplace. I’m so scared that this attachment will cause me to harm my own career as I would be resistant to switching jobs in the future, if I don’t fix this. First off, I have the best manager ever. Obviously I don’t have any reference points, as this is my first manager, but hearing stories from my friends - I consider myself to be pretty lucky. My manager is always pushing me to be the best, other senior leadership has told me that my manager talks very good about me to them, she is always available to explain things and is stern when I make mistakes. I’ve never been pinpointed or blamed for when Prod issues have happened, just reminded that these are very important incidents to learn from. I work in a finance heavy industry, so I had to learn A LOT about finance, and she taught me all of it. Second, my team is flexible. We aren’t expected to log in early if the need isn’t there. My manager is also fine with me taking multiple consecutive days off together if need be. We aren’t too personal with each other and I like the boundaries that everyone maintains. The work itself - it’s not tooooo interesting. I do work in finance, so it’s hard for me to accept what I’m doing actually matters. It feels like a zero sum game to me. The problems we solve with engineering have more to do with reducing the manual work for finance bros. So I always feel like I’m working underneath them as opposed to with them. The work hours can also stretch to 9/10 hours a day, sometimes.The end users of the product are a pain in the ass. They are the finance bros and they have an attitude problem. I do not like working for them or along with them. They don’t understand the complexity of software systems. They think just because a feature sounds so simple in their head it’s simple to build as well. The top-layer engineering leadership is also uninspiring. Their only motivation is (and they’ve spoken this out loud multiple times) to keep the finance bros happy and not lose our credibility in front of them. It feels like my job only exists to please them. Which is why in my head I want to change jobs, maybe look for something more interesting, fun and inspiring. But then I’m reminded of my star manager and amazing team. What if I’m actually very lucky where I am right now? What if I change jobs and it’s a stupid decision? I could be stuck somewhere where the manager is ass and working against me. I don’t know what to do. Is your guys’ work like this as well?",

        "content": "I have done B.Tech in CS and graduated in 2022 and I landed a FAANG internship. I thought a full-time offer was practically a sure thing.But then, no full-time offer materialized because of team structuring. Still, I secured an SDE-1 role at a major tech company, earning a solid 14-18 LPA.Within a year, I left the work as the work wasn't challenging me as there was literally zero work related to actual product development / core software engineering, the culture felt stagnant and I was hungry for more.After leaving that SDE-1 role without any full-time offer, I pivoted to a freelancing role while prepping for the interviews for full time role alongwith DSA, System Design etc.I interviewed with 50+ companies including Google, Amazon, Zomato etc last year for the initial 7-8 months period.The Google interview was four months of pure emotional journey. I aced the first two tech rounds with \"Strong Hire\" and “Hire” ratings, the third round got completely derailed with a \"No Hire\" for the technical part and rated \"Hire\" for Googlyness by the same interviewer. After this they ghosted me for two months without any 'team matching' calls. In my Amazon interview I sailed through their technical rounds but got rejected in the leadership evaluation. Out of five companies where I actually cleared all the interview rounds, four of them just straight-up ghosted me. The single offer I did receive was a massive 40% below my previous salary and demanded relocation. I declined it.After this period while freelancing I earned what I used to make from my previous salary within two months. Here, I took a break from job searching as it was draining me mentally. But after three months, reality hit when the freelancing projects dried up. I decided to upskill (enrolled in Harkirat's 100xdevs cohort) for full-stack development. Six months later, I'm only about 70% through the course. The freelancing money, my savings is now exhausted with only 3 months runaway.I've spent the last year grinding, working on my weaknesses. I've gone from zero to four to five production-ready MERN stack applications. I've genuinely evolved from an AI trainer(freelance work) to a full-stack developer.After these interviews, I figured out that three main issues consistently held me back:1. Role Mismatch: Companies just couldn't reconcile my AI training background with traditional SDE roles.2. Short Tenure: Leaving my first job within a year constantly came up.3. Weak Dev Skills (Back Then): Honestly, I just couldn't demonstrate core software engineering capabilities during technical rounds. API building, database schemas, system design.Now, I'm at a crossroads. I'm facing some big challenges:1. The CTC issue: My freelance income was hourly and in USD. When I mention my 25-30 LPA expectations, recruiters often ghost me. Should I anchor to my last full-time salary?2. Market Reality Check: With roughly 3 years of experience and this diverse background, is 25-30 LPA even realistic in today's market?3. Strategic Focus: Do I cast a wide net (remote, YC startups, EU, Dubai based) or grab the first decent Indian offer for stability?4. Ethical Job Title: During my freelance period, I applied my new full-stack skills to personal projects. Can I legitimately frame this as \"Contract Software Engineer (Full-Stack)\" on my resume, or is that crossing a line?5. Unable to get calls: Despite applying actively, I’m struggling to get interview calls and even when recruiters reach out those calls are not converted to interviews.To anyone who's been here, or helped someone through similar crossroads: what would you do?TL;DR2022 grad with 3 YOE (6 months of internship +1 yr FTE + 1.5 yrs freelance). Interviewed at 50+ top firms cleared 5, ghosted by 4, lowballed by 1. Took a break after a high-pay freelance gig; now out of work and savings running low. Built solid MERN stack projects. Need advice on CTC strategy, resume positioning, target companies, and rebuilding momentum.",

I also didn't get a FAANG internship during my studies (But I worked a 16 month internship at a big named non-tech company)I love coding on my own time and have a handful of portfolio projects in C++ game/engine development and web dev (I focus on this less, since I'm now doing it at my job) which helped me land my first job.I've been working at my current company for a year now, and have been doing full stack work. It's a tiny company, and the pay is nothing to write home about (I'm living with my dad since I can't afford rent in my city) I'm learning a lot though, and there's many opportunities to lead feature initiatives within the company which is nice for a first job. I can recognize there's no room for growth here beyond that though.My issue is not really knowing how to keep progressing my career. I keep seeing TikTok/Reels of the thousandth ivy league student happy about their internship/return offer to Meta or Citadel or something. These posts saturate social media to the point where it seems like the only paths to wealth are: Get a big tech internship while in school and land a return offer, make a 7 figure startup, or be banished to irrelevancy.I'm interested in those of you that were (are) in my shoes; what would you recommend someone like me do to keep progressing their career and land a reputable job in some big tech company? Is it just a matter of experience and interview prep, or should I be doing more like getting a masters? And does anyone have good advice to help with the anxiety of comparing yourself to those seemingly more successful/younger than you?Thank you!",

I am currently working with another startup, which are not that competitive and we have been working over 3 years now. It is really flexible job, I actually travel a lot and we don't have any work hours, I just need to get my tasks done and join regular calls. New position is offering 50% more pay, and possibility of getting raise as soon as I adopt the team. Downside is it is 9-5 job and I am in Europe, so I would need to work at late hours here. Should I accept the offer? There are no benefits since it is a contract based position, but I might get myself a much better offer from them if I prove myself in the team (maybe not!) What would you guys do? :)",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Long story short, I landed an amazing job as a SWE. It's at a very well known FAANG+ company and the team is sort of new and we'll be working on some interesting problems. Officially, I was brought on as a Full Stack engineer. Everyone on my team is incredibly nice but the people on my team are primarily backend developers tackling those interesting problems. The people on my team and the other people around me come from some incredible companies. Most come from Google, Meta, Amazon, Netflix, Snowflake, etc, and have all gone to some pretty incredible universities.Then there's me. I've been working for the last 4 years at a very small no name company making very simple CRUD apps. I also went to a good school but I majored in Math/Stats so I don't have much knowledge of computer science past what is offered in first and second year of uni (and have also lost all my math/stats knowledge as I've never had to utilize those skills in the last 4 years).I never really felt impostor syndrome in my last job because the work we were doing was pretty straight forward and our userbase was only like 200 customers. We weren't doing anything novel and it was extremely simple CRUD apps that we were making which ran on one EC2 instance. The people around me also came from self taught backgrounds like myself. This current company has millions of users and these guys are throwing around technical terms while tackling their backend problems at scale, while I'm just thinking that the knowledge I've gained in the last 4 years can all be learned from a simple full stack course on Udemy.I realize that I was brought on as a full stack engineer to probably build the frontend and connect it with the backend services that my team mates are making, but I feel so replaceable and useless, like an LLM can do my job.So, what should I do? Any advice is appreciated! **Edit:** First off, idk if this is even necessary since I was brought on as a full stack like I said, but if I was to take courses (free or paid) to level up my knowledge, which courses would you recommend? The only \"real\" CS course I took was a course at my school on DS&A, but past that I haven't really taken any traditional courses and is mostly self taught.",

I feel sad looking at my teammates being very busy and working all day and night and I almost always need to reach out to them for help with every task.I want to be useful to my team and feel more confident in myself but I'm not sure how , when or if I will even be able to do that. I don't want them to kick me out for being useless :(Looking for advice/tips. Thank you. Also for context: Graduated in 2024 with <1 year of total experience.",

I’ve been working on a startup for 1.5 years, I graduated almost a year ago. In the company I work for they only handle me support tickets, like go fix this and that, not building anything new or scaling or improving architecture and learning new things…I feel like I haven’t grown much in the last year and a half due to the nature on what they ask me to do, imnot learning a lot of new stuff, or how to make the system scale, perform better, implement patterns, decide as a senior engineer, etc etc. I have only gotten better at their system, and maintain it and it’s not fun… I can’t just quit, I depend on this incomeThat being said, I wanna still grow towards a more senior role, like a senior SWE or software architect. But my company is not helping much on it, so I decided to leetcode on my free time, watch tutorials, do udemy courses, read books, all at once but i advance too slow bc its a lot all at once…So what should I do to overcome this situation of being stuck? What should I focus on? I really wanna grow, kick ass and enjoy this just like I did when I was in college :(",

Neither the python-heavy nor the .NET-heavy roles are bothered by the TypeScript on my resume.Is this your experience? If so, why would it be? Where does this language rivalry come from?",

I'm having a severe case of imposter syndrome and just a feeling of isolation. I'm also work from home because it's a foreign company and my VISA hasn't been processed yet.I'm not sure what to do or how to improve from here. I'd really appreciate some advice on this.",

I take help often I make silly mistakes and don't really know what I'm doing most of the time. I don't come up with solutions I sometimes fill in the blanks if my senior gives me a hint. I really don't know why I'm not getting any negative feedback from anyone I truly don't know even if I take forever to finish simple stuff they say it's nothing out of ordinary to take a few days extra.My question: I'm not good at this I can't solve real problems I don't know what I am doing and somehow got lucky with a team and company.how do I deal with my own mediocrity?

        "content": "I feel that I am outmatched in terms of technical ability as a junior developer. My first job out of uni is a full stack web platform developer in my country’s public sector. While work hours and pay is decent, it is only a contract role, career progression is very slow if converted, and I have very little interest in my current industry. So I am looking to job hop in the next couple of years.I am competent at front end, but I struggle with backend tasks as I lack exp. I often require guidance on how to do stuff like Kafka streams, microservice programming in C#, SQL Schema configuration etc. In fact, it has come to the point where my team lead has stopped giving me backend tasks altogether, saying that I should just focus on front end for now, which was demoralising for me.I am definitely concerned for my future plans to job hop as I feel the competition. You have:1. Highflyer CS fresh grads who have tons of hackathon, internship and project exp who memorise all of Leetcode, and can easily land jobs at MNCs/Big Tech2. Offshore foreign devs who can do a junior’s work at a fraction of the cost and with more work hours3. AI LLMs which can streamline all the work of multiple junior devsMeanwhile there is me who cant even land a permanent role after uni grad and cant do backend coding to save his life.I am considering what to do at this point. My original idea was to read up on the side and do another web dev project tied to cloud services to showcase my fullstack skills, for a cause/industry that I’m passionate in. But the competition and job economy for devs will just not get easier from now on.Realistically however, would it be better for me as an average dev to eventually pivot to project management instead? From what I read, PM roles rely more on industry domain knowledge and soft skills, of which fresh grads, offshore devs, or AI LLMs would tend to not be as strong in. I do have some project leadership exp from various CCA and volunteering opportunities in the past. And of course, this still allows me to work on tech related projects. Can anyone advise me on this? Much appreciated.",

In my current company of employment, a QA Automation dev is on the same payscale as a front-end web developer. We have had front end devs move into QA and QA Automation, but we never had anyone move out of Automation into, well, anywhere else. Is my experience in this observation mostly a vacuum or is this actually a thing? I'm curious so I thought I would ask you guys!Thanks!",

Also the comments just don’t stop. I’ve gone through THREE rounds of comments and actions that I’ve handled and one round was mostly a bunch of I actions on something he misunderstood. The latest round is regarding how information is displayed, which no one else has had an issue with 6+ people, actively using the information given to debug every single issue we’ve had so far. All the info required to debug is present and there, but it could be cleaned up a little.

However, on the call they stated that compensation won't be offered until their project receives funding. The company has multiple projects that have received funding, but the one I applied for is very early and has not. I'm a fresh grad with no internships unfortunately and I need experience, but I also need pay, and this job seems to expect a full time commitment which I would not be able to balance with my current part time job that does pay.The biggest thing holding me back from taking this role is that the company is \"employee owned\" and during the meeting they talked about how ownership is taken by everybody and there will most likely not be a senior ahead of me providing guidance. I feel like I already know the answer, since I have bills to pay, but just curious as to what others would do in this situation.",

        "author": "besseddrest",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I've got 17 YOE but self taught, primarily frontend.I haven't been doing DSA a long time but I understand the most common ones I see in interviews (and honestly in my entire career I've rarely gotten LC in an interview, and yes I do think it's important for FE).w/ LC or any algo problem on any site, the problem I've found is I spend way too much time correcting for edge cases, or smaller bugs, and then I end up butchering my original solution to fit. It never fits, n this just tells me I don't actually know the algo well enough.I've developed some newer habits while prepping for some upcoming interviews, and I find that this approach I can learn the mechanics of the problem thoroughly and surprisingly I get success only after a couple clicks.I still spend a lot of time sussing out my solution, but in the end I feel like I really understand what to do.Basically:* I read the problem and based off what I currently know I just try to work it out in my head. I don't even write anything down. I just try to visualize it, with my current set of tools. A lot of walking around the house, talking to myself.* After I kinda adjust everything in my head, I open up AI chat and then i tell it my approach. I don't ask for code, I just want it to tell me what it thinks of my approach* I go back and forth repeatedly with AI on this. Until I have a better sense of what I want to code. Rinse & repeat, I still haven't written or asked for code* If i can't formulate something then I go to YT and look for a short on how the problem is generally solved - Neetcode is great for this because he'll visualize it for you before diving into code. I try to make sense of it before seeing how he solves the problem, but if it clicks then i don't even bother, but he does write in python often - I'm primiarly JS/TS so its nice that i still have to do the translation in my head* Then I finally start writing my approach and since I've gone over it repeatedly in my head, I have better direction. Your IDE will identify most of the silly bugs so, you just need to return something - this is my own IDE, not in LC's code editor.* When I'm done, I don't even run it - I just have AI review it and tell me again where I\"ve messed something up. Again, no code, just more back and forth with AI. Maybe I find that there's prob a better approach, so I redo my solution.* When AI (claude in my case) says it looks good, then I finally run it in leetcode/whatevercode. Usually there's minimal things i need to fix. I've been getting successful submits on the first tryTLDRThis is basically me, a visual learner, self taught - drilling into my head what I think will be a solid approach based off what I actually understand well. The repetition and being corrected _in discussion_ is really really good for me. A lot more time is spent thinking about the problem and talking through the different parts of the solution. The least amount of time is on the code, and there's almost no trial and error clicking. Feels great.The funny part is I don't really have the patience to go through the entire AI response, so I kinda skim just for \"this is where the problem is\". I don't even read the whole thing because I try to connect the dots of what its suggesting, on my own.Anyway, hope this helps. And yes, it's midnight on a Friday, and I'm workin on DSA. Cheers!",

        "content": "I graduated in May 2025 but I have had basically no success in applying to places, most of the time I don't even get the screening phone call and there's only been a few times where I went anywhere further than that. I'm starting to feel like I won't ever get any actually good job at all.Most positions I see have hundreds of applicants, which makes me think I'll never get in any of them. I am not a top 0.1% candidate, I don't have million dollar side projects, years of experience or a lot of charisma. Plus, there are not a lot of new grad openings in my area (Indiana) and I'm pretty sure I get filtered out of any applications I make to anywhere outside of the state (exactly 0 places out of state actually went further than the first application before throwing my resume in the garbage). Obviously it's a bad idea to move somewhere else without a job lined up, but pretty much everywhere is only hiring locally? There's also the problem where more recently it seems like all the entry level stuff has completely dried up, I only find one thing every few days at this point (everything else seems to want people who are 3+ years of experience in everything for something that says \"entry level\") (Even when I look for random low level help desk and other things they want people with a ton of experience always, and also they want \"excellent communicators\" which is something I am not)My [resume](https://imgur.com/a/xnfQFTn) is pretty bad but there's nothing significant I can change about it. The internships I got in college weren't really very computer science oriented (a lot of hardware stuff) which is just a big red flag on my resume I can't do anything with (sidenote: company A is like 1 guy so I probably can't go back there for a job, it's also not very programming based so I don't want to do it forever either). (sidenote 2: Yes I tried to get other internships, but my resume was even worse back then and the market wasn't exactly much better back then versus now). It probably looks bad that I had internships in the summer only but company A is a local place so I can't exactly stay there while going to college. I don't have metrics for everything which makes it look bad (are interns really supposed to be doing corporate espionage to look at company records to see the exact dollar value of everything they did?) (And I can't really lie and make up stuff since that would just look like obvious lies, some of the metrics I already have are already like that)I had a 3.93 GPA for my bachelors but that isn't actually very good (one of the people that interviewed me actually grilled me for not having a perfect 4.0, probably a reason I got rejected). Project wise I just have some projects on there, but those projects aren't \"real\" projects since 2 of them were class projects and the other one is something that didn't make money so companies probably just see it as just a random toy project. I'm also not an expert in all the 10 random technologies that get put in every job posting as well, which probably leads me to getting tossed out (even if I was, companies probably ignore everything that wasn't something I did in internships which cuts me out of 99% of positions)(My parents want me to apply to every random X years of experience position out there, which just seems pointless since in what world would I be put above the people who actually have X years of experience?)**Other things*** Networking * Networking is a complete non starter as I don't have the social skills to ever convince someone that I'm the best person for the job. My personality is pretty unlikeable (very introverted, don't like talking, not really capable of showing enthusiasm) and I have very little in common with other people * The people I've encountered in my classes aren't really going to help me either (presumably most of them are now entry level people as well and so they have 0 influence on the hiring process of any company) * There's basically 0 chance I become the hiring managers best friend and become someone they push ahead of other people* Internships * Not in college anymore, internships only take current students* Projects * Making a \"good project\" isn't something I can just do. To make the kind of project that actually impresses employers I would have to make a significant amount of money, and those kind of ideas are very hard to come by. Plus, that kind of thing would take 1 year or several years to actually produce which I can't exactly spend that amount of time unemployed (or in some menial dead end job) without leaving me stuck in that job because they think I can't do anything better* Do more leetcode * 99% of the time I don't even get to a point where they even give me any kind of technical evaluation, so it doesn't really help me to practice that more. It's not something I can put in a job application to get further* Move somewhere with more jobs * Terrible idea, I don't have a ton of money to waste moving out somewhere (especially considering how badly my job search is going, moving somewhere else isn't going to magically be 100x better)* Lie on resume * Also a complete non starter. I don't have the charisma to back up lies on my resume. Stretching experience numbers is something I'm already doing, but I can't just make up years of experience out of nowhere without making it look like obvious lies * If I say I have experience at X place then that would get seen in a background check and then I get thrown out immediately",

I don’t mind it too much as I’m in good terms with her and she mostly leaves me the fuck alone because 90% of the time I close out all my tickets.I’ve been working on this project that uses a LLM model to generate some output, but I don’t think it’s the right project to solve with LLMs because of the inconsistencies/inaccuracies generated in the output. But my manager seems to be convinced that we can make it work, we just need to try harder (improve the prompt, adjust the code, etc.) My company has zero experience building AI products wants to jump in the AI bandwagon and my manager wants to impress c-suite folks by solving business problems with AI. I have voiced my concerns several times how we are trying to solve a problem with the wrong tool or how we should change our approach as the project requires a more deterministic output. I have been ignored everytime and was either asked to just “improve the process a little more” or “don’t think too much, it’ll be fine”. I put duck tapes here and there and the end product is shit. My manager convinced me its fine as long as we make efforts in a positive direction, and at the end if we can’t build this there’s no real repercussions. Long story cut short we are few months into the project and I had to demo the app to the client we are building this for and they weren’t impressed with the inconsistencies in the output. Because at the end of the day it’s nothing like what my manager promised them and they are on our asses to build a working solution ASAP.At this point I think you can guess who’s on the hook for all of this? Fortunately the concerns I have expressed to her during the initial phase of the project is documented in emails. But at my company upper management doesn’t want to hear/doesn’t care if your direct manager is being a dick/is incapable and they tell you “you need to figure this out with your manager. Ain’t there nothing I can do about this”. So between me and my manager they’ll just take her word against mine (even with email proof) as I’m more “dispensable” in their eyes? If this project fails more than likely I’ll be blamed and let go as I’ve no doubt she’ll use me as a scapegoat.What’s my move here? I can’t just work harder during the weekends and crank this out. Really need your advice so I can form a strategy. Thank you in advance!",

For the next 3 years, I grew it to a team of 40 people and was in active negotiations with Nvidia to introduce RTX into our game (it was 2019 when Nvidia just published it). I was studying just enough to keep the scholarship, but nothing more.After we ran out of funding, and closing it, I joined an American based startup as VP of Product & engineering, but after 6 months got promoted to CIO, where I was responsible for our product portfolio and managing our engineering and R&D departments.During this time, I got headhunted by one of the largest corporations in Europe and wanted me to work as Senior Project Manager (had to wear Product Manager hat too often). They made it clear, they wanted me no mater what, doubled my salary and put me in big projects to work for. And after 2.5 years, it was one of the most amazing working experiences as had to deal with hundreds of engineers and millions of dollars in projects.After some internal things, I decided to go in business on my own, and start a digital agency. it was one of the roughest experiences even though within 1 year I had 3 other employees and 15 clients. And decided to close this in beginning of June.\\-- now July --I had an interview today, and one of the HR said that my CV seems like I'm lying. I just turned 29, so it is impossible for me to have done all of this. (I have recommendation letters, experience, posts and everything to prove my work...). I asked some of my friends about this and they said the same thing too, and even suggested I lower the tittle for example from CIO to just Head of Product Management Office.I'm looking to join startups where I can bring best of my experience and knowledge, but I am seriously getting worried what my friends are suggesting.from 50 tailored applications I have done, I've had only 1 interview, so I'm really wondering if ATS is screwing me up, or HR see's it and thinks \"just bloated stuff\" and ignores it.What do you think?im seriously stuck thinking for this.PS: made this post on EU version but got automatically removed.",

Tbh, we hardly had meetings and just had stand up oince a day and outside of that it was mostly reaching out to people for help and once a month a product meeting with the clients. Once a quarter we had a 2 day sprint planning event that really was a waste of 2 days with most engineers just nodding along while the managers and POs did all the talking.Second job was in FAANG - it seemed like even as a mid-level Engineer I had to spend half my day in meetings, a quarter of my day reaching out to people and the rest of the time coding. Obviously 2 hours coding isnt enough, so it caused people to have to work an extra 2-4 hours a day. Stand up was everyday for 30 minutes. No meetings friday was hardly respected. If you werent it felt like you were behind if your days didnt look like this. It was very on the go. Even in the meetings, it felt like everything was a discussion that took an extra hour of meeting time. ANythign brought up during parking lot took an hour to resolve. You put a for loop but a principal engineer wants you to do a while loop? Let's discuss it for an hour about why for loops are better or worse. If you needed to talk to anybody, you had to schedule time and theyd get annoyed if you went over the alloted scheduled time. It was stressfula nd when I left I was glad I was gone.Current job is at big tech but not FAANG - It seems meetings are the last thing on their mind. We have stand up twice a week. Twice a month we have an extended stand up. Even then it goes by pretty quickly (most of the time it takes half the scheduled time). Parking lot items are resolved really fast unless someone is confused about the code. Im still fairly new but i get the vibe that it's similar to my first job where you can just reach out to someone and tehy didnt mind spending an hour with you to talk it through. Once a quarter they do a \"no meetings week\" where major meetings are cancelled. This was a shocker i've never heard about, in my last job that is something laughable and seen as a waste of useful time. What's surprsiing is I make more in this job than I did in FAANG for what seems like will be less stress.Just wondering how common it is in other jobs when it comes to meetings?Edit: im 7 YOE as a backend SWE if that helps.",

        "content": "Hey everybody!For context: I'm Polish, 21 years old, first year into the CS degree, and 10 months of experience on my first job.When I landed the job, I was exhilarated. But as the time has been passing by, I've been getting more and more disappointed. I am on a project that hasn't got a lot going on. Some tiny fixes, stuff that's typical for THIS project, rummaging around in the database to fix some documents' flow for the users etc. It's not that I sit around doing nothing, there is work to do, but I feel more like a corporate excel sheet master than a SWE.There's little actual coding. The processes and flow are poor, the PM is rather bad, code reviews, well, at least sometimes they exist. In general, I make money, the job is steady, I save and invest, live with my mom, so getting laid off wouldn't be the end of the world. I'm just not learning much, or at least not the things that are considered good practice. I want to get good at SWE tho and challenge myself. In order not to fall behind I study on my own, but sometimes I'm just too tired, the university demands other things, or I just wanna do other things - I'm in my early twenties lol.In 2 years I'll have done what might amount to 6 months of work that my colleagues in well-managed companies/projects have done. When it comes to find a new position, odds are I won't even stand a chance compared to my peers with similar YOE. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but YOE that aren't proportional to my actual knowledge make me kinda anxious.Or maybe the baseline is that my YOE would be a way to get my foot in the door, and the rest is just a matter of getting prepared and passing an interview, and the rest is just fake it till you make it, until things start to click - just like it was for the first time:) What's your view/advice? Anybody who is/was in a similar situation who wants to share?",

There's really nothing to learn nor am I content with my salary so it's time to leave.Just finished with my phone interview recently. 30 minutes of behavioral with camera on and 30 minutes of a Leetcode problem. Was asked to implement autocomplete (trie tree). Have very few more screening in coming days. Surprisingly, it takes maybe 1 month for some to reach out. I have seen some of my co-workers finding new gigs and posting them on LinkedIn. Job market sucks but I am going to keep my habit of rinse and repeat.",

        "content": "I've been working in a mid-sized consulting company in the EU for about 3 years now. It’s stable, but its extemely boring, there’s no real growth, and I’m just mentally checked out at this point. It feels like I’m wasting my life. Recently I got the chance to interview with a super early-stage startup--10 people in total-- started by current and former researchers and professors. I don’t have all the details yet, but my expectation is that i will work more hours, which is fine. Right now, I just want to work on stuff and grow professionally. I’m aware of the risks: lower job security, and a lot of uncertainty. But staying where I am feels like a slow death career-wise. Has anyone here had a similar experience? Did it open new doors, or was it just stress in a different flavor?Cheers",
