Plans for Week 2 :-learn more about spark optimization, the things i missed and how these actually used in actual spark workflow( need to look into real industrial spark applications and how they transform and optimize. if you could provide some of your works that actually used on companies on real data, to refer, that would be great)-working more with parquet. (do we convert the data like csv or other into parquet(with basic filtering) before doing transformation or we work on the data as it as then save it as parquet?) -running spark application on cluster(i looked little into data lakes and using s3 and EMR servelerless, but i heard that EMR not included in aws free tier, is it affordable? (just graduated/jobless). Any altranatives ? Do i have to use it to showcase my projects? ) - get advices and reflect Please guide me.Your valuable insights and informations are much appreciated,Thanks in advance:red_heart:",

It’s far from complete and not meant to be a full showcase of every dbt feature, but more of a realistic example of how it’s actually used in industry (or at least at my company).Some of the things it covers:* Medallion architecture* Data contracts enforced through schema configs and tests* Exposures to document downstream dependencies* Data tests (both generic and custom)* Unit tests for both models and macros* PR pipeline that builds into a separate target schema (My meager attempt of showing how you could write to different schemas if you had a multi-env setup)* Versioning to handle breaking schema changes safely* Aggregations in the gold/mart layer* Facts and dimensions in consumable models for analytics (start schema)The repo is here if you’re interested: [https://github.com/Alex-Teodosiu/dbt-blueprint](https://github.com/Alex-Teodosiu/dbt-blueprint)I'm interested to hear how others are approaching data pipelines and warehousing.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "My career has definitely taken a weird set of turns over the last few years to get me to end up where I have today. Initially, I started off building Tableau dashboards with datasets handed to me and things were good. After a while, I picked up Alteryx to better develop datasets meant specifically for Tableau reports. All good, no problems there. Eventually, I got hired at by a company to keep doing those two things, building reports and the workflows to support them.Now this company has had a lot of vendors in the past which means its data architecture and pipelines have spaghettied out of control even before I arrived. The company isn't a tech company, and there are a lot of boomers in it who can barely work Excel. It still makes a lot of money though, since it's primarily in the retail/sales space of luxury items. Once I took over, I've tried to do my best to keep things organized but it's a real mess. I should note that it's just me that manages these pipelines and databases, no one else really touches them. If there's ever a data question, they just ask me to figure it out.Fast forward to earlier this year, and my bosses tell me that they want to me explore Azure, the cloud, and see if we can move our analytics ahead. I have spent hours researching and trying to learn as much as I can. I created a Databricks instance and started writing notebooks to recreate some of the ETL processes that exist on our on-prem servers. I've definitely gotten more comfortable with writing code, databricks in general, and slowly understanding that world more, but the more I read online the more I feel like a total hack and fraud.I don't do anything with Git, I vaguely know that it's meant for version control but nothing past that. CI/CD is foreign to me. Unit tests, what are those? There are so many terms that I see in this subreddit that feel like complete jibberish to me, and I'm totally disheartened. How can I possibly bridge this gap? I feel like they gave me keys to a Ferrari and I've just been driving a Vespa up to this point. I do understand the concepts of data modeling, dim and fact tables, prod and dev, but I've never learned any formal testing. I constantly run into issues of a table updating incorrectly, or the numbers not matching between two reports, etc and I just fly by the seat of my pants. We don't have one source of truth or anything like that, the requirements constantly shift, the stakeholders constantly jump from one project to the other, it's all a big whirlwind.Can anyone else sympathize? What should I do? Hiring a vendor to come and teach me isn't an option, and I can't just quit to find something else, the market is terrible and I have another baby on the way. Like honestly, what the fuck do I do?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey folks,As part of the Apache Gravitino project, I’ve been contributing to what we call a **“catalog of catalogs”** – a unified metadata layer that sits on top of your existing systems. With 1.0 now released, I wanted to share why I think it matters for anyone in the Databricks / Snowflake ecosystem.**Where Gravitino differs from Unity Catalog by Databricks*** **Open & neutral**: Unity Catalog is excellent inside the Databricks ecosystem. And it was not open sourced until last year. Gravitino is Apache-licensed, open-sourced from day 1, and works across Hive, Iceberg, Kafka, S3, ML model registries, and more.* **Extensible connectors**: Out-of-the-box connectors for multiple platforms, plus an API layer to plug into whatever you need.* **Metadata-driven actions**: Define compaction/TTL policies, run governance jobs, or enforce PII cleanup directly inside Gravitino. Unity Catalog focuses on access control; Gravitino extends to automated actions.* **Agent-ready**: With the MCP server, you can connect LLMs or AI agents to metadata. Unity Catalog doesn’t (yet) expose metadata for conversational use.**What’s new in 1.0*** Unified access control with enforced RBAC across catalogs/schemas.* Broader ecosystem support (Iceberg 1.9, StarRocks catalog).* Metadata-driven action system (statistics + policy + job engine).* MCP server integration to let AI tools talk to metadata directly.Here’s a simplified architecture view we’ve been sharing:*(diagram of catalogs, schemas, tables, filesets, models, Kafka topics unified under one metadata brain)***Why I’m excited** Gravitino doesn’t replace Unity Catalog or Snowflake’s governance. Instead, it complements them by acting as a **layer above multiple systems**, so enterprises with hybrid stacks can finally have one source of truth.Repo: [https://github.com/apache/gravitino](https://github.com/apache/gravitino)Would love feedback from folks who are deep in Databricks or Snowflake or any other data engineering fields.

I also had to evaluate the data quality.It took me about half a day to learn the tech through tutorials and examples, and a couple of hours to find all the incomplete rows, missing rows, and duplicate rows. I then had to visit family for a week, so I only had a day to work on it.When I talked with the company again they praised my code and engineering, but they were disappointed that I didn’t use the physics article to find out which values are reasonable and then apply outlier detection, filters or something else to evaluate the output better.I was a bit taken aback because that would’ve required a lot more work for a take home project that I purposefully was not prepared for. I felt like I am not that good since I needed so much time to learn the tech and domain, but my friendstell me I dodged a bullet because if they expect this much from a take home project they would’ve worked me to the bone once I was on the payroll.What do you guys think?

The day after finishing my final bachelor’s exam, I joined a big tech company where I got the opportunity to work on Azure, SQL, and Power BI. I gained a lot of experience there. I used to work 16 hours a day with a tight schedule, but my productivity never dropped. However, as we all know, freshers usually get paid peanuts for the work they do.I wanted to complete one year there, and then I shifted to a startup company with a 100% hike, though with the same workload. At the startup, I got the opportunity to handle a Snowflake migration project, which made me really happy as Snowflake was booming at that time. I worked there for 1.3 years.With the money and experience I gained, I achieved my dream of coming to the USA. I resigned, but since the project had a lot of dependencies, they requested me to continue for 3 more months, which I was happy to do.And by the god grace i was also worked as GA for 2 semester while doing my masters.Now, I have completed my master’s degree and am looking for a job, but it feels like nobody cares about my 3 years of experience in India. Most of my applications are directly rejected. It’s been 9 months, and I feel like I’m losing hope and even some of my knowledge and skills, as I keep applying for hundreds of jobs daily.At this point, I want to restart, but I’m missing my consistency. I’m not sure whether I should completely focus on Azure, Python, Snowflake, or something else. Maybe I’m doing something wrong.",

In November 2023, NHS England awarded Palantir a £330m contract to deploy a Federated Data Platform that aims to provide “joined up” NHS services. The NHS has many operational challenges around data such as the frequency of data for in-day decisions in hospitals and consuming health services in multiple regions or hospital departments because of siloed data. As a Platform Engineer now, having built data platforms and conducted cloud migrations in a few UK private sectors and coming to understand how much vendor lock in can have significant ramifications for an organisation. I’m astounded at the decision to see a public service consuming a platform with complete vendor lock in.This seems completely bonkers; please tell me you can host Palantir services in your own cloud accounts and within your own internal networks! From what I’ve read, Palantir is just a shiny wrapper built on Spark and Delta Lake hosted on k8’s with the choice of leaving insanely hard. What value-add does Palantir provide that I’m missing here? The NHS has been continually shifting towards the cloud for the last ten years and from my point of view, this was simply an architectural problem to solve to federate NHS trusts rather than buy into a noddy spark wrapper? Palantir doesn’t have much market penetration in the United Kingdom in the private sector, Beyond its nefarious political associations, I’m very curious to see what Americans think of this decision? What should we be worried about; politically and technically.",

Documentation is limited and inconsistent, with some scripts containing comments while others are over a thousand lines without any context. Communication is also spread across multiple messaging platforms, which makes it difficult to identify a single source of truth or establish consistent channels of collaboration.In addition, I have not yet had the opportunity to shadow a full migration, which has limited my ability to see how the process comes together end to end. Team responsiveness has been inconsistent, and despite several requests to connect, I have had minimal interaction with my manager. Altogether, these factors have made onboarding less structured than anticipated and have slowed my ability to contribute at the level I would like.I’ve started applying again, but my question to anyone reading is whether this experience seems like an outlier or if it is more typical of the field, in which case I may need to adjust my expectations.",

        "content": "We’re setting up event tracking: 13 structured events covering the most important things, e.g. view\\_product, click\\_product, begin\\_checkout. This will likely grow to 27, 45, 53, ... event types because of tracking niche feature interactions. Volume-wise, we are talking hundreds of millions of events daily.2 pain points I'd love input on:1. Every event lands in its own table, but we are rarely interested in one event. Unioning all to create this sequence of events feels rough as event types grow. Is it? Any scalable patterns people swear by?2. We have no explicit link between events, e.g. views and clicks, or clicks and page loads; causality is guessed by joining on many fields or connecting timestamps. How is this commonly solved? Should we push back for source-sided identifiers to handle this?We are optimizing for scalability, usability, and simplicity for analytics. Really curious about different perspectives on this.**EDIT:** To provide additional information, we do have a sessionId. However, within a session we still rely on timestamps for inference. \"Did this view lead to this click?\" Unlike an additional, common identifier between views and clicks specifically for example (like a hook that 1:1 matches both). I am wondering if the latter is common.Also, we actually are plugging into existing solutions like Segment, RudderStack, Snowplow, Amplitude (one of them not all 4) that provides us the ability to create structured tracking plans for events. Every event defined in this plan currently lands as a separate table in BQ. It's then that we start to make sense of it, potentially creating one big table of them by unioning. Am I missing possibilities, e.g. having them land as one table in the first place? Does this change anything?",

They have never worked with databases, and I was hired as a data engineer to support them. My approach was to design and build a database for their project.The project goal is to run a model more than 3,000 times with different setups. I designed an architecture to store each setup, so results can be validated later and shared across departments. The company itself is only at the very early stages of building a data warehouse—there is not yet much awareness or culture around data-driven processes.The challenge: every meeting feels like a struggle. From their perspective, they are unsure whether a database is necessary and would prefer to save each run in a separate file instead. But I cannot imagine handling 3,000 separate files—and if reruns are required, this could easily grow to 30,000 files, which would be impossible to manage effectively.On top of that, they want to execute all runs over 30 days straight, without using any workflow orchestration tools like Airflow. To me, this feels unmanageable and unsustainable. Right now, my only thought is to let them experience it themselves before they see the need for a proper solution. What are your thoughts?

I have been tasked with identifying methods to try and make these files more readable as we are a regulator and want people to get accurate information when they ask GenAI about our rules.Basically I want to try and make our PDFs as readable as possible for any GenAI our audience chucks their PDF into, without moving from PDF as we dont want the document to be easily editable.I have already found some methods like using accessibility tags that should help, but I imagine 300 pages will still be a stretch for most tools.My boss currently doesn't want to edit the website if we can avoid it to avoid having to work with our web developer contractor who they apparently hate for some reason, so adding metadata on the website end is out for the moment.Is there any method that I can use to sneak in the full plaintext of the file where an AI can consistently find it? Or have any of you come across other methods that can make PDFs more readable?Apologies if this has been asked before but I can only find questions from the opposite side of reading unstructured PDFs.",

        "content": "Hi, we're Alex and Kalan, the creators of Pontoon ([https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon](https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon)). Pontoon is an **open source, self-hosted, data export platform**. We built Pontoon from the ground up for the use case of shipping data products to enterprise customers. Check out our [demo ](https://app.storylane.io/share/onova7c23ai6)or try it out with docker [here](https://pontoon-data.github.io/Pontoon/getting-started/quick-start/).While at our prior roles as data engineers, we’ve both felt the pain of data APIs. We either had to spend weeks building out data pipelines in house or spend a lot on ETL tools like [Fivetran](https://www.fivetran.com/). However, there were a few companies that offered data syncs that would sync directly to our data warehouse (eg. Redshift, Snowflake, etc.), and when that was an option, we always chose it. This led us to wonder “**Why don’t more companies offer data syncs?**”. So we created Pontoon to be a platform that any company can self host to provide data syncs to their customers!We designed Pontoon to be:* **Easily Deployed**: We provide a single, self-contained [Docker image](https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon/pkgs/container/pontoon%2Fpontoon-unified)* **Support Modern Data Warehouses:** Supports Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, (we're working on S3, GGS)* **Multi-cloud**: Can send data from any cloud to any cloud* **Developer Friendly:** Data syncs can also be built via the API* **Open Source:** Pontoon is free to use by anyoneUnder the hood, we use [Apache Arrow ](https://arrow.apache.org/)and [SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy) to move data. Arrow has been fantastic, being very helpful with managing the slightly different data / column types between different databases. Arrow has also been really performant, averaging around 1 million records per minute on our benchmark.In the shorter-term, there are several improvements we want to make, like:* Adding support for DBT models to make adding data models easier* UX improvements like better error messaging and monitoring of data syncs* More sources and destination (S3, GCS, Databricks, etc.)In the longer-term, we want to make data sharing as easy as possible. As data engineers, we sometimes felt like second class citizens with how we were told to get the data we needed - “just loop through this api 1000 times”, “you probably won’t get rate limited” (we did), “we can schedule an email to send you a csv every day”. We want to change how modern data sharing is done and make it simple for everyone.Give it a try [https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon](https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon) and let us know if you have any feedback.

Worst of all, everyone in your company heavily relies on data export for reporting. Unfortunately getting that data has been an agonizing process since *forever*. The timeline (give or take) has been something like this:**ODATA (circa 2017)** \\- Paintfully slow and just plain stupid for any serious data export. \\- Relies on *URLs* for paging.. \\- Completely unusable if you had more than toy-sized data.**BYOD (2017-2020)** “Bring Your Own Database” aka *Bring Your Own Pain.* \\- No delta feed just brute-force emptied and inserted data again and again. \\- Bogged down performance of the entire system while exports ran until batch servers were introduced. You had to stagger the timing of exports and run cleanup jobs. \\- You could only export \"entities\" , custom tables required you to deploy packages. \\- You had to manage everything (schema, indexes, perf, costs).**Export to Data Lake (2021–2023)** \\- Finally, the least bad option. Just dumped CSV files into ADLS. \\- You had to parse out the data using Synapse which was slow \\- Not perfect, but at least it was predictable to build pipelines on. Eventually some delta functionality hacks were implemented.**Fabric (2023 → today)** **-** Scrap all that, because FU. Everything must go into Fabric now: \\- Missing columns, messed up enums, table schemas don't match, missing rows etc. \\- **Forced** deprication of Export to Data Lake, alienating and enraging all their customers causing them to lose all trust, causing panic \\- More expensive in every way, from data storage, to parquet conversion \\- Fabric still in alpha. Buggy as shit. Limited T-SQL scope. Fragile and can cause loss of data. \\- A hopeless development team on the Microsoft payroll that don't solve anything and outright lie and pretend everything is working and that this is so much better than what we had before.In practice, every few years an organization has to re-adapt their entire workflow. Rebuild reports, views and whatnot. Hundreds of hours of work. All of this because Microsoft refuses to allow access to production database or read-only replicas. To your own data.

I'm most comfortable with SQL. I find myself at an odd juncture.What should I do? Edit: My engagement is due to end in a few weeks and I'll have to look for a new one soon. I'm now questioning what kind of role would I be suited for, in the long term given the advent of AI.",

Things like version control, CI/CD, lineage, documentation, etc.I’ve noticed more and more people using dbt with Snowflake, but since I don’t have hands-on experience yet, I was wondering how do you usually orchestrate dbt runs when you’re using dbt core and Airflow isn’t an option?Do you rely on Snowflake’s native features to schedule updates with dbt? If so, how scalable and easy is it to manage orchestration this way?Sorry if this sounds a bit off but still new to dbt and just trying to wrap my head around it!",

        "content": "sparkenforce is a PySpark type annotation package that lets you specify and enforce DataFrame schemas using Python type hints.## What My Project DoesWorking with PySpark DataFrames can be frustrating when schemas don’t match what you expect, especially when they lead to runtime errors downstream.sparkenforce solves this by:* Adding type annotations for DataFrames (columns + types) using Python type hints.* Providing a `@validate` decorator to enforce schemas at runtime for function arguments and return values.* Offering clear error messages when mismatches occur (missing/extra columns, wrong types, etc.).* Supporting flexible schemas with ..., optional columns, and even custom Python :left-right_arrow: Spark type mappings.Example:```from sparkenforce import validatefrom pyspark.sql import DataFrame, functions as fn@validatedef add_length(df: DataFrame[\"firstname\": str]) -> DataFrame[\"name\": str, \"length\": int]: return df.select( df.firstname.alias(\"name\"), fn.length(\"firstname\").alias(\"length\") )```If the input DataFrame doesn’t contain \"firstname\", you’ll get a `DataFrameValidationError` immediately.## Target Audience* PySpark developers who want stronger contracts between DataFrame transformations.* Data engineers maintaining ETL pipelines, where schema changes often breaks stuff.* Teams that want to make their PySpark code more self-documenting and easier to understand.## Comparison* Inspired by [dataenforce](https://github.com/CedricFR/dataenforce) (Pandas-oriented), but extended for PySpark DataFrames.* Unlike static type checkers (e.g. mypy), sparkenforce enforces schemas at runtime, catching real mismatches in Spark pipelines.* [spark-expectations](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/spark-expectations) has a wider aproach, tackling various data quality rules (validating the data itself, adding observability, etc.). sparkenforce focuses only on schema or structure data contracts.## Links* PyPI: [sparkenforce](https://pypi.org/project/sparkenforce/)* Source code: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/agustin-recoba/sparkenforce)* Demo notebook: [Examples](https://github.com/agustin-recoba/sparkenforce/blob/main/src/demo/demo_notebook.ipynb)",

She has used this huge, slow, unvalidated query that I wrote for her to create reports with AI. She always wants stuff added to it so it keeps growing. She manually downloads data from customers into csv. AI wrote python to make html reports from csv.She’s made good reports for customers but it all lives entirely outside of our app. Shes having issues making it work for all clients, so they want me to get involved.My thinking is to let her do her thing, and then once designed, build the reports into our app. With the goal being:1) Using simple, validated functions/queries (that we spent a lot of time making test cases to validate) and not this big ass query2) Each report component is modularized and easily reusable in other reports3) Generating a report is all obviously automated. Now, they messaged me today about providing estimates on delivering something similar to the app’s reporting structure for her to use offline, just generating the html from csv, using the monster query. With the goal that:1) She can continue to craft reports with AI having all data points readily available 2) The reports can easily be plugged into the app’s reporting infrastructure Another idea that they thought of that I didn’t think much of at first was to just copy her AI generated html into the app so it has a place to live for clients.My biggest concerns are the AI not understanding our schema, what is available to use as far as validated functions, etc. Having to manage stuff offline vs in the app. Using this unnecessary big ass query. Having to work with what the AI produces.Should I push going full AI route and not dealing with the app at all? Or try to keep the AI just for design and lean heavier on the app side?Am I overreacting? Please help.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "So, we have multiple dbt projects at my employer, one which has three environments (dev, stage and prod). The issue we're having is merging from the staging env to prod. For reference, in most of our other projects, we simply have dev and prod. Every branch gets tested and reviewed in a PR (we also have a CI environment and job that runs and checks to make sure nothing will break in Prod from changes being implemented) and then merged into a main branch, which is Production. A couple months back we implemented \"stage\" or a UAT environment for one of primary/largest dbt projects. The environment works fine the issue is that in git, once a developer's PR is reviewed and approved in dev and their code is merged into stage, it gets merged into a single stage branch in git. This is somewhat problematic since we'll typically end up with a backlog of changes over time which all need to go to Prod, but not all changes are tested/UAT'd at the same time. So, you end up having some changes that are ready for prod while others are awaiting UAT review. Since all changes in stage exist in a single branch, anything that was merged from dev to stage has to go to Prod all at once. I've been trying to figure out if there's a way to \"cherry pick\" a handful of commits in the stage branch and merge only those to prod in a PR. A colleague suggested using git releases to do this functionality but that doesn't seem to be (based on videos I've watched) what we need. How are people handling this type of functionality? Once your changes go to your stage/uat environment do you have a way of handling merging individual commits to production?",

Especially for events that I'm not sure what params will be present, this will let me see everything present without any unknowns. The models will have an incremental load that add new columns on schema change - whenever a new param is introduced.Does this approach seem sound? I know the structs must be used because they are more efficient, and I'm worried I might be taking the path of least resistance and most compute.",

        "author": "XxThatWeirdGuyxX",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey all,I've hit a wall on what seems like a core use case for the modern AWS data stack, and I'm hoping someone here has seen this specific failure mode before. I've been troubleshooting for days and have exhausted the official documentation.My Goal (What I'm trying to achieve): An analyst logs into AWS via IAM Identity Center. They open our Amazon DataZone project (which uses the SageMaker Unified Studio interface). They run a SELECT * FROM customers query against a Redshift external schema. Lake Formation should intercept this and, based on their group membership, return only the 2 columns they are allowed to see (revenue and signup_date).The Problem (The \"Smoking Gun\"): The user (analyst1) can log in and access the project. However, the system is behaving as if Trusted Identity Propagation (TIP) is completely disabled, even though all settings appear correct. I can prove this with two states: 1.If I give the project's execution role (datazone_usr_role_...) SELECT in Lake Formation: The query runs, but it returns ALL columns. The user's fine-grained permission is ignored. 2.If I revoke SELECT from the execution role: The query fails with TABLE_NOT_FOUND: Table '...customers' does not exist. The Data Explorer UI confirms the user can't see any tables. This proves Lake Formation is only ever seeing the service role's identity, never the end user's. The Architecture: •Identity: IAM Identity Center (User: analyst1, Group: Analysts). •UI: Amazon DataZone project using a SageMaker Unified Domain. •Query Engine: Amazon Redshift with an external schema pointing to Glue. •Data Catalog: AWS Glue. •Governance: AWS Lake Formation. What I Have Already Done (The Exhaustive List): I'm 99% sure this is not a basic permissions issue. We have meticulously configured every documented prerequisite for TIP: •Created a new DataZone/SageMaker Domain specifically with IAM Identity Center authentication.•Enabled Domain-Level TIP: The \"Enable trusted identity propagation for all users on this domain\" checkbox is checked. •Enabled Project Profile-Level TIP: The Project Profile has the enableTrustedIdentityPropagationPermissions blueprint parameter set to True. •Created a NEW Project: The project we are testing was created after the profile was updated with the TIP flag. •Updated the Execution Role Trust Policy: The datazone_usr_role_... has been verified to include sts:SetContext in its trust relationship for the sagemaker.amazonaws.com principal. •Assigned the SSO Application: The Analysts group is correctly assigned to the Amazon SageMaker Studio application in the IAM Identity Center console. •Tried All LF Permission Combos: We have tried every permutation of Lake Formation grants to the user's SSO role (AWSReservedSSO_...) and the service role (datazone_usr_role_...). The result is always one of the two failure states described above.My Final Question: Given that every documented switch for enabling Trusted Identity Propagation has been flipped, what is the final, non-obvious, expert-level piece of the puzzle I am missing? Is there a known bug or a subtle configuration in one of these places? •The Redshift external schema itself? •The DataZone \"Data Source\" connection settings? •A specific IAM permission missing from the user's Permission Set that's needed to carry the identity token? •A known issue with this specific stack (DataZone + Redshift + LF)?I'm at the end of my rope here and would be grateful for any insights from someone who has successfully built similar architecture.

You end up writing tons of imperative Python and glue code that breaks easily, tracks nothing, doesn't perform well without custom infrastructure, or requires stitching individual tools together.* What if this fails halfway through?* What if I add one new video/image/doc?* What if I want to change the model?**With Pixeltable you define what you want, engine figures out how:** import pixeltable as pxt # Table with multimodal column types (Image, Video, Audio, Document) t = pxt.create_table('images', {'input_image': pxt.Image}) # Computed columns: define transformation logic once, runs on all data from pixeltable.functions import huggingface # Object detection with automatic model management t.add_computed_column( detections=huggingface.detr_for_object_detection( t.input_image, model_id='facebook/detr-resnet-50' ) ) # Extract specific fields from detection results t.add_computed_column(detections_labels=t.detections.labels) # OpenAI Vision API integration with built-in rate limiting and async management from pixeltable.functions import openai t.add_computed_column( vision=openai.vision( prompt=\"Describe what's in this image.\", image=t.input_image, model='gpt-4o-mini' ) ) # Insert data directly from an external URL # Automatically triggers computation of all computed columns t.insert({'input_image': 'https://raw.github.com/pixeltable/pixeltable/release/docs/resources/images/000000000025.jpg'}) # Query - All data, metadata, and computed results are persistently stored results = t.select(t.input_image, t.detections_labels, t.vision).collect()**Why This Matters Beyond Computer Vision and ML Pipelines:**Same declarative approach works for agent/LLM infrastructure and context engineering: from pixeltable.functions import openai # Agent memory that doesn't require separate vector databases memory = pxt.create_table('agent_memory', { 'message': pxt.String, 'attachments': pxt.Json }) # Automatic embedding index for context retrieval memory.add_embedding_index( 'message', string_embed=openai.embeddings(model='text-embedding-ada-002') ) # Regular UDF tool @pxt.udf def web_search(query: str) -> dict: return search_api.query(query) # Query function for RAG retrieval @pxt.query def search_memory(query_text: str, limit: int = 5): \"\"\"Search agent memory for relevant context\"\"\" sim = memory.message.similarity(query_text) return (memory .order_by(sim, asc=False) .limit(limit) .select(memory.message, memory.attachments)) # Load MCP tools from server mcp_tools = pxt.mcp_udfs('http://localhost:8000/mcp') # Register all tools together: UDFs, Query functions, and MCP tools tools = pxt.tools(web_search, search_memory, *mcp_tools) # Agent workflow with comprehensive tool calling agent_table = pxt.create_table('agent_conversations', { 'user_message': pxt.String }) # LLM with access to all tool types agent_table.add_computed_column( response=openai.chat_completions( model='gpt-4o', messages=[{ 'role': 'system', 'content': 'You have access to web search, memory retrieval, and various MCP tools.' }, { 'role': 'user', 'content': agent_table.user_message }], tools=tools ) ) # Execute tool calls chosen by LLM from pixeltable.functions.anthropic import invoke_tools agent_table.add_computed_column( tool_results=invoke_tools(tools, agent_table.response) ) etc..No more manually syncing vector databases with your data. No more rebuilding embeddings when you add new context. What I've shown:* **Regular UDF**: `web_search()` \\- custom Python function* **Query function**: `search_memory()` \\- retrieves from Pixeltable tables/views* **MCP tools**: `pxt.mcp_udfs()` \\- loads tools from MCP server* **Combined registration**: `pxt.tools()` accepts all types* **Tool execution**: `invoke_tools()` executes whatever tools the LLM chose* **Context integration**: Query functions provide RAG-style context retrievalThe LLM can now choose between web search, memory retrieval, or any MCP server tools automatically based on the user's question.**Why does it matter?*** **Incremental processing** \\- only recompute what changed* **Automatic dependency tracking** \\- changes propagate through pipeline* **Multimodal storage** \\- Video/Audio/Images/Documents/JSON/Array as first-class types* **Built-in vector search** \\- no separate ETL and Vector DB needed* **Versioning & lineage** \\- full data history tracking and operational integrity**Good for**: AI applications with mixed data types, anything needing incremental processing, complex dependency chains**Skip if**: Purely structured data, simple one-off jobs, real-time streamingWould love feedback/2cts!

Each of the sensor haves label's which we plan to utilize as influxdb tags. (Big warehouse ,3 sensors on 1m, 8m ,15m from the floor, across \\~110 steel beams) I have quite a list of **features** i want to support for our customers, and want to use InfluxDB Cloud to store RAW data in a 30 day bucket (without any further historical storage). * Live data updating in front-end graphs and charts. (Webhook endpoint -> CFW Endpoint -> Durable Object (websocket) -> Frontend (Sensor overview page) Only activated when user on sensor page.* The main dashboard would mimic a single Grafana dashboard, allowing users to configure their own panels, and some basic operations, but making it more user friendly (select's sensor1 , sensor5, sensor8 calculates average t&h) for important displaying, with live data updating (separate bucket, with agregation cold start (when user select's the desired building) * Alerts, with resolvable states (idea to use Redis , but i think a separate bucket might do the trick)* Data Export with some manipulation (daily high's and low's, custom down sample, etc) Now this is all fun and games, for a single client, with not too big of a dataset, but the system might need to provide bigger retention policy for some future clients of raw data, I would guess the key is limiting all of the dynamical pages to use several buckets.

For PBI Report Builder and my report design in general it is best to work with flat tables. The input comes from various Excel files and I process them with Python in our Lakehouse. That works great. The output column structure is like this:- Hierarchy level 1 (string)- Hierarchy level 2 (string)- Attribute group (string)- Attribute (string)- Value (mostly integers some strings)For calculations in the report it is best to have the value column only being integers. However, some values cannot be expressed as number and are certain keywords instead stored as strings. I thought about having a value_int and value_str column to solve this.Do you have any tips or own experiences?

        "author": "anyfactor",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Because I think I would like to do that.I like looking at data, though I no longer work professionally in a data analytics or data engineering role. However, I still feel like I could bring value in that area, on a fraction scale. I wonder if there is a role like a Data QA Analyst as a sidehustle/fractional role.My plan is to pitch the idea that I will write the analytics code that evaluates the quality of data pipelines every day. I think in day-to-day DE operation, the tests folks write are mostly about pipeline health. With everyone integrating AI-based transformation, there is value in having someone test the output.So, I was wondering if data quality analysis is even a thing? I think this is not a role to have someone entirely dedicated to full-time, but rather someone familiar with the feature or product to data analytics test code and look at data.My plan is to:- Stare the at the data produced from DE operations- Come up with different questions and tests cases- Write simple code for those tests cases- And flag them to DE or production sideWhen I was doing web scraping work, I used to write operations that simply scraped the data. Whenever security measures were enforced, the automation program I used was smart enough to adapt - utilizing tricks like fooling captchas or rotating proxies. However, I have recently learned that in flight ticket data scraping, if the system detects a scraping operation in progress, premiums are dynamically added to the ticket prices. They do not raise any security measures, but instead corrupt the data from the source.If you are running a large-scale data scraping operation, it is unreasonable to expect the person doing the scraping to be aware of these issues. The reality is that you need someone to develop an test case that can monitor pricing data volatility to detect abnormalities. Most Data Analysts simply take the data provided by Data Engineers at face value and do not conduct a thorough analysis of it and nor should they.But then again, this is just an idea. Please let me know what you think. I might pitch this idea to my employer. I do not need a two-day weekend, just one day is enough.",

        "content": "TL;DRI know enough about Python and SQL upto Joins but no standard database knowledge all through Chatgpt/Gemini and screwing up with some data that was handed to me. I want to learn more about other tools as well as using cloud. Have no industry experience per se and would love some advice on how to get to a level of building reliable pipelines for real world use. I havent used a single Apache tool, just theoretical knowledge and YT. Thats how bad it is.Hi everyone, Im ngl this thread alone has taught me so much for the work I've done. Im a self taught programmer (~4 years now). I started off with Python had absolutely no idea about SQL (still kinda don't). When I started to learn programming (~2021) I had just finished uni with Bio degree and I began to take keen interest into it as my thesis was based on computational simulation of binding molecules and I was heavily limited by the software GUI which my lecturer showed me could have been much more efficient using Python. Hence, began my journey. I started off learning HTML, CSS and JS (that alone killed my interest for a while), but then I stumbled onto Python. Keep in mind late 2020 to early 2021 had a massive hype of online ML courses and thats how I forayed into the world of Python.Given its high-level and massive community made it easier to understand a lot of concepts and it has a library for the most random shit you'd wanna not code yourself. However, I have realized my biggest limiting factor was:1. Tutorial Hell2. Never knowing if I know enough? (Primarily because of not having any industry experience with SQL and Git, as well as QA with unit testing/TDD. These were just concepts I've about).To put it frankly I was/am extremely underconfident of being able to build reliable code that can be used in the real world. But I have a very stubborn attitude and for better or for worse that has pushed me. My Python knowledge and my subject expertise gave me an advantage to quickly understand high level ML/DL topics to train and experiment with models, but I always enjoyed data engineering i.e., building the pipelines that feed the right data to AI.But I constantly feel like I am lacking. I started small[ish] since last December. MY mom runs a small cafe but we struggled to keep track of financials. Few reasons being, barebones POS system, with a basic analytics dashboard, handwritten inventory tracking, no accurate insights from sales through delivery partners. I initially thought I could just export the excel files and clean and analyze it in Python. But there were a lot of issues and so I picked up Postgres (open-source few!) with the basics (upto Joins, I use CTEs cause for the life of me I don't see myself using views etc.). The data totals up i.e., from all data sources to ~100k rows. I used sqlalchemy to pushed the cleaning datasets to a postgres database and I used duckdb for in memory transformations to build the fact tables (3 of them for the orders, items, and added financial expenses).This was way more tedious than Ive explained. Primarily due to a lot of issues like duplicated invoice no.s (the POS system was restarted this year on the advice of my mom, but thats another story for another day), basically no definitive primary key (created a composite key with the date), the delivery partners order ids are not shown in the same report as the master report, and so on. Without getting much into detail,Here is my current situation and why I have asked this question on this thread:I was using Gemini to help me structure the Python code I wrote in my notebook and write the SQL queries (only to realize it was not upto the mark so I pretty much wrote 70% of the CTE myself) and used duckdb engine to query the data from the staging tables directly into a fact table. But I learnt all these terminologies because of Gemini. I just didnt share any financial data with it which is probably why it gave me the garbage[ish] query. But the point being I learnt that. I was setting the data types configs using Pandas and I didn't create any tables in SQL it was directly mapped by SQLalchemy.Then I came across dimension tables, data marts, etc. I feel like I am damn close and I can pick this up but the learning feels extremely ad hoc and I keep doubting my existing code infrastructure a lot.So my question is should I continue to learn like this (making a ridiculously insane amount of mistake only to realize there are existing theories on how to model data, transform data, etc., later on). Or is it wise to actually take on a certification course? I also have zero actual cloud knowledge (have just tinkered with BigQuery on Googles Cloud skill boos courses)As much as it frustrates me I love seeing data coming together like to provide useful, viable information as an output. But I feel like my knowledge is my limitation.I would love to hear your inputs, personal experiences, book reccos (I am a better visual learner tbh). Most of what I can find have very basic intros to Python, SQL, etc. and yes I can always be better with my basics but if I start off like and get bored I know I am going to slack off and never finish the course.I think weirdly I am asking people to rate my level (cant believe im seeking validation on a data engg thread) and suggest any good learning sources. FYI If you have read it through from the start till here. Thank you and I hope all your dreams come true! Cuz you're a legend!",

Obviously, that's not preferred. But I recently joined a place that uses alembic and I'm not positive it's all that much better that pure SQL with no version control. (Only kind of joking.) It has weird quirks with it's autogenerated revisions, nullability and other updating aspects. The most annoying issue being that its autogenerated revision file for updates is always just creating every table again, which we haven't been able to solve, so we just have to write it ourselves every time.We use Microsoft SQL Server for our DB if that makes any difference. I've seen some mentions of Atlas? Any other tools folks love for this?",

This means I almost never find help except from my TAs and professors, which isn't always practical. Frankly, if I'm just trying to understand a basic logic error, or even just a simple API call, there's no need for this haughtiness and lack of help.Sorry for the mini-rant, but I needed to vent and understand if this is normal in our profession, or if I'm just unlucky with my peers.So, I need your help, as you know, I'm searching for a real, practical way to learn, and as I know now that my colleagues will never help me do that So I have 2 choices 1- Participating in open source communities, I heard that they are really friendly and welcoming. 2-using AI applications, as I was scrolling, I came across many tools like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/InterviewCoderPro/).

Some even, perhaps, hyper optimize to such a degree that it leads to analysis paralysis and then they eventually quit programming as a whole.So, how did the early guys do it? There was no Reddit (or forums) back then. So did you hyper optimize your learning path or were you like \"let's pick a book and start doing\"? How did you manage to learn a programming language (or programming in general) when there was no web (or perhaps when there weren't so many courses on Python, C, C++, Java, and Assembly)?Not trying to put anyone down (that applies to both the younger and the older generation). I'm just curious. I know this question has probably been asked at an earlier point in time. But I wanted to get the current perspective for people who are trying to learn in 2025.Thanks in advance!",

I felt like my degree didn't really set me up for success when it came to actual helpdesk things and I was struggling pretty substantially.Late 2023, I went back to school for full-stack development. I was told last month that I'm at my federal loan limit so I was forced to leave school. Now I'm enrolled in [boot.dev](http://boot.dev) and I'm also going to do a free Harvard course.I'm just anxious that this is a waste of time. I'm starting so late in life, and I won't have any official programming degrees, and I'm worried about AI replacing work in the tech industry by the time I'm finished learning.I guess I'd like to hear stories from people in similar situations for a little encouragement. I want to hear from other self-taught people who were able to land good jobs. I want to hear the challenges they experienced, and suggestions on what they'd do if they had to do it again.I'm working on building my linkedin network, but aside from just joining groups and connecting with people, I'm not sure what else I can do to boost my profile. I know in the corporate world, connections are a big part of finding a good job. Edit! Thank you everyone for your responses! I've learned that this isn't something I should pursue, especially since I'm not good at helpdesk and I won't have a CS degree. I just wanted to make sure I wasn't wasting time and money trying to learn something that won't help me succeed, so I greatly appreciate the insightful comments! On to the next best conquest haha!",

        "content": "This is driving me crazy. I’ll spend 2 hours watching a React tutorial, follow along perfectly, even build the project. Then the next day when I try to implement something similar… blank. Like I never watched it.Started digging into why this happens and apparently there’s a name for it - the “forgetting curve.” Some German psychologist figured out we lose about 70% of new info within 24 hours. Fun.Here’s what I think is happening with programming tutorials specifically:We’re basically just watching someone else code. It feels like learning because we can follow along, but our brains aren’t actually doing the heavy lifting. It’s like watching someone lift weights and thinking you got stronger.Most tutorials also cram way too much into one session. I counted - the last Next.js tutorial I watched introduced 12 different concepts in 45 minutes. No wonder my brain tapped out.And we never go back. We watch once, maybe take some notes, then move on to the next shiny tutorial. But memory doesn’t work that way.So I’ve been experimenting with some stuff that actually seems to help:After watching a section, I pause and try to write down everything I remember without looking. Painful but effective.I also try to explain concepts out loud like I’m teaching someone. Sounds dumb but it forces you to actually understand vs just recognize.The biggest thing though - I go back to my notes after a few days. Not rewatching the video, just testing myself on what I wrote down. Then again after a week.It’s more work upfront but I’m actually remembering stuff now instead of just collecting bookmarks.Anyone else struggle with this? What do you do to actually retain what you learn from tutorials?",

How did you bridge that gap between understanding math/logic and actually writing working programs?**Any tips, experiences, or encouragement would mean a lot.

You will learn much more by finishing any course than trying to constantly jump to a better one.# Lecture BasedThese are classes offered by universities (Harvard, MIT, Helsinki, etc). The structure is a weekly lecture given a professor, an assigned reading, and a problem set.They are generally self-paced. Some will grade your submissions, and some will even give you a certificate of completion, it's not worth much, but it can be motivating.**Harvard CS50** and friends (CS50P, CS50 AI, etc) — These serve as general introductions. They have been taken by thousand and are high quality. CS50 teaches you the basics of *C* (Week 1-5), *Python* (week 6), *SQL* (week 7), and finally some *HTML* with *Flask*. CS50P (Python) is similar but focuses on Python only, you cover the basics (conditionals, loops, exception, libraries, testing, I/O, and some OOP). If you sign up through EdX you can track your progress.# Text BasedThese courses are mostly text based, you read through a module then go practice an assignment.Popular courses include: The Odin Project, FullStack Open, FreeCodeCamp, and Code Academy.**The Odin Project** teaches you the basics of Web Development. The first part focuses on HTML, CSS, and JS. Then splits into either FullStack JS (React, Node, Express) or Fullstack Rails (React, Ruby). The final module offers tips on getting hired. They have a big discord community.**Fullstack Open** is another high quality resource focused on Web Development. It starts with the the basics of HTML & CSS, before quickly jumping into React. The next modules show you to work with NodeJS and express to build a backend.# BooksI'm a big fan books, anything from **O'Reilly**, **Manning**, or **Starch Press** is usually solid.Books like *Automate the Boring stuff with Python* are often recommended, you can download it for free.I learned C, C++, and Rust from books, ex: *Effective C*, *C++ Crash Course*, *The Rust Book*# Interactive**Scrimba** & **Bootdev** are websites that have interactive exercises, they follow a freemium model where some content is free, but you have to pay to unlock everything. I tired Scrimba and I was pretty impressed.# Others**100Devs** is another popular community with a large discord channel. The course is a series of videos by Leon Noel, there are weekly streams and weekly hours.**Udemy** — ex: **100 days of Code by Angela Yu**. This is a very popular course that focuses on building 1 python project per day, you start off with a Blackjack app, then Snake Game, parsing CSV data, building UI with Python, using a SQL db, using Flask, Git, etc. *This one is not free, you have to pay.***PluralSight** *—* Pretty good quality, has courses on most technologies. It's how I learned Docker, React, Angular, and a few others.No links due to Reddit Filters",

I will be thankful for every advice given by working professionals and seniors or people who this field Thanks for reading this shit load of a long post but I tried to keep it to the point while giving important details tl:dr \"I am in 3rd Year of degree didn't create projects,don't know much stuff afraid of Ai,need advice from professionals on what to do to catch up,confused on what to do. Advise me Like a complete beginner in CS\"Will be greatful for any insights",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I’ve built a personal project that’s basically a working proof of concept. It’s a search engine with a UI that can search across file types — PDFs and images, using either the in-app screenshotting feature or paths of the queries — and supports quick metadata editing on the matched results. It also uses SQLite database that can realistically handle up to a million files, and FAISS for indexing.It’s not production-ready yet, and it gets a bit buggy when stress-tested, but the core features are there and working as intended. I’ve put a lot of time into it and learned a ton, but I know I’m missing real-world experience — like working with a team, writing scalable code, and having people who actually know what they’re doing point out where I’m going wrong.I’m hoping to land an internship to gain that experience and also earn a bit to help pay for my tuition fees as I'm only 2 years into my CS journey as a student. Do you think a project like this is enough to get my foot in the door? Has anyone here landed an internship based on a personal project or PoC? How did you pitch it, and what did you focus on?Would love to hear your thoughts or advice!",

I decided out of the blue that I would like to try computer science because my coworkers suggested I’d be good at it but I never thought I was smart enough. I did a bunch of research, fucked around with python on codecademy, liked it, and took an intro to OOP course at my local technical college. I LOVED learning Java & decided I would pursue an associates in computer science. I took a SQL class and then I took an HTML and CSS class and now I’m learning visual C# which is super fun. I’m having a blast but I feel kind of lost. I’m doing part time college so I’m technically only on my second semester, but I still get such bad imposter syndrome & wonder if I’m smart enough for this. We’re starting to learn about abstract methods and interfaces and diving deeper into polymorphism and inheritance and I’m struggling a bit. My gift is that I’m a good problem solver and no matter what, I’m always able to pull through. I have a 4.0 gpa and I get great feedback on my assignments, but I don’t just want to do the bare minimum to get good grades I want to LEARN. I want to deeply understand what I’m doing and why, and that’s what I struggle with. I know the number one piece of advice I’m going to get is to pick something to build and just build it, but how do I do that while having a job and also doing 4 classes and also trying to have a life and take care of my mental health? It just seems so unrealistic? I feel like I’m missing something. Idk I just need some words of encouragement",

The last programs I did as a Flash programmer were in 2018 and 2019 (Adobe AIR). I did other programming work. Business stuff in other languages, but the educational apps, museum apps and even hardware interfacing apps were a joy to do with Flash. And of course 2d casual games.One example is the ability to do things like skewing text boxes. I could do things like control where each of the 4 corner points are and then use trig and other math to programmatically animate them.I miss it. I do stuff with the HTML canvas and enjoy that, but Flash was much more robust.Whenever I'd have like an IT person telling me that Flash sucked I would automatically think \"Well, they clearly do not know what they are talking about.\" Their criticism is about security and performance issues. It's a valid criticism. Flash had a lot of vulnerabilities because it gave freedom to the software engineer. Freedom which could be abused.There are certainly more business advantages to other types of software. I miss the math of it though. I'm kinda retired now so instead of trying to find a substitute, I enjoy making partial substitutes with Visual Studio.",

I've created a SQL Server database, scrapers, BI reports and scripts (in a VM) that automate many of the company processes (currently looking to get into SAP SDK). The thing is, I feel I could do so much better. Since I don't have any seniors to teach me, I feel I've been doing all of these without following good programming and security practices. For example, in the VM, I run all my daily automation scripts with Task Scheduler and .bats (last week I learned I should encapsulate these scripts). I don't know if my projects follow the best structure or if they are modular enough, etc. Although everything works and there's no complaints by the company, I know what I'm doing is not good enough and could learn so much more (and do things the \"correct\" way). What do you guys would recommend me I should focus on learning? Any books, courses or even bootcamps you recommend? What can I do differently? Although I don't feel like a junior anymore, I definetely feel there's so much I should learn before even considering calling myself a senior. Thanks for the help in advance!",

        "content": "I have been really struggling at times with the advice to just learn programming by jumping into projects.I have to think inductively and I am not fully prepared, even when I feel I have done my best to memorize, but I must not be doing enough to memorize. Only until I can recite every fact mentioned to me in the slide and more am I ready for the exam, or even my homework.At the very least, trying to memorize all the given axioms(definitions, rules, properties, relationships)gives you a vernacular to communicate confusion with a practice problem more clearly than “I don’t know where to start. I don’t get this.”the problem is when I also don’t know what exactly to memorize, such as in programming which can be more laissez faire in teaching, you are told to just start coding in order to learn.  When I tried to look into whether I should take ‘intermediate’ and ‘advanced’ intro to x programming language courses online at the very least to develop more vocabulary to google implementation and debug effectively, I saw comments such as these:[https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lj1ay9/stem\\_student\\_here\\_should\\_i\\_master\\_one\\_programming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lj1ay9/stem_student_here_should_i_master_one_programming/)Don't focus on languages. Think of something fun (database, web app, data science project, whatever), research what languages fit the use case and just build it. Nothing beats the skills you gather from solving your own problems and they will mostly be transferrable to other technologies later on.THAT BEING SAID, if you really want to get deep into understanding programming languages from the ground up, get yourself a copy of \"C - A modern approach\" (K. N. King, available on the internet archive for free). It will teach you the most fundamental of all programming languages, C, but almost more importantly: You will understand every other language afterwards more easily, especially a lot of design decisions in C++, Java, Rust and many more.It has little exercises and some larger programming projects in it to directly apply the stuff you read about. The book might seem intimidating at 800 pages, but it's actually a rather swift read, there are just a lot of examples and additional explanations. [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1f7rhs9/how\\_to\\_learn\\_advanced\\_python/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1f7rhs9/how_to_learn_advanced_python/)OP, everyone so far except the duck saxophone guy is giving you shitty advice.You already know decorators exist. You've never used them. Do you think reading about other things that also exist will help you learn how to use them?Don't read a thing. **If you want to learn advanced programming, start working on an advanced project**. Aim too high.When you can't figure out how to do something or think that there must be an easier way to do this or that, then go look that up, read that, and implement it. Then go on programming.Reading advanced literature without programming yourself is useless. I tried to follow this advice to just make projects even when I felt I was just incoherently babbling when searching for implementation approaches  and googling errors & bugs. I mainly just got yelled at on stack overflow for asking trite questions I could have googled and posting overly specific  project case scenarios,  but I lacked the vocabulary to dissect  and google my problems in a  better way.I might as well just try going through dozens of “master python books” because at least it’s something different, I am like a baby pointing at food it wants without any better way to communicate and getting yelled at for it.  sometimes I don’t even fully understand the ‘food’(implementation) I want because I cannot describe ‘tastes’ or ‘ingredients’(don’t understand how to design the pseudocode/blueprints properly or  account for every needed feature)I just know: “it needs to be sour”  But similarly to  a person learning a second language you must also commit the axioms to memory to then be able to question and deduce.  It is just hard memorizing so many things at once.  How do I allocate time between rereading over and over, trying to ask a question to actively engage then going on a wikipedia rabbit hole of concepts I don’t understand or questions I lack the field terminology to phrase coherently, and I ultimately feel it is ridiculous even though I try to remind myself it is necessary.recall back to grammar classes. compared to learning vernacular which is just involuntary exposure to people speaking 24/7, grammar has to be established by rote practice- but also by reading books for exposure to information. I  just keep forgetting, especially in programming, but I don’t reread books, I usually rewatch intro to x programming language video and then start trying to google reference to implement a feature for a project.I don’t know how trying to design a project then awkwardly googling with no real certainty of what you are looking for is any different than tutorial hell.",

I know \"hard\" is subjective but would you suggest this language for beginners? It seems simpler than others but doesn't seem to have the same use as another broader language like python or C.3. Finally, how difficult is it front other conventional languages? Since it's basically just a visual language used for web development, if a beginner learns say, python first, how easy would it be to transition to HTML.Hopefully these questions made sense.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not a copy and paster dude. I do use the code of chat gpt, I basically copy it by typing it myself and at the same time I’m asking chat gpt what certain things are. I than make notes and try explaining it in my own words. In this way, I learn new things about coding and how to apply it, especially with python(flask) and jinja I was wondering if some coders here with more experience, have any tips on how to actually learn how to code.

Not only leadership, but he has some options in the tech stack, so he wants us to go through and decide which frameworks/libraries to use. I have no experience in the industry, but I believe that's something that a system architect would do, no?I went with Firebase over MongoDB, since it offers built-in authorization and helps streamline the development process, and I don't think we'll need the level of control over our data that Mongo offers.So now I find myself overseeing backend development alongside other recent graduates, and I'm worried about how best to do things.

I was able to learn python well, but i feel like I'm at a crossroad:I could improve my \"low level\" skills, reading books about ASM, C and building my dream project; an operating system. I really want to step up my game and such a hard project can be the chance. Or, i could improve my \"high level\" skills, learning JS, react, next.js, nest.js, networking, creating a portfolio, maybe landing an internship somewhere and starting making money.I'm sure other people found themselves in similar situations, and I'd really love to hear what your experience was and what you could recommend.P.S. I know that ultimately it's only about my objectives, but currently, at my age, knowing that i still have 5 years of university to go, I just want to \"specialize\" in something. While I'd like to take the \"low level\" path for the knowledge I'd get, I'd also consider the \"high level\" path to start making profit from something I love.",

Most of the stuff I come across is basic git actions (add, commit, push etc.), but this is not really what I want to know.

        "author": "cs-grad-person-man",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "(TL;DR at bottom of post)First let's get one thing out of the way: I'm not suggesting that you lie as well. That's an individual decision. I'm here just to tell you about my experiences as being part of the hiring process for a FAANG-adjacent company.Secondly, I just want to state right away that I believe this is an issue that stems from the hiring / recruiter side more than it does on the candidate side. We are the ones who have drilled into your heads that you MUST have metrics, impacts and keywords or else your resume is \"trash\". Candidates are simply doing what they need to do to survive in this crazy market.With that out of the way.... let me tell you about my experiences.Every job posting that our team puts up receives roughly 2000 - 3000 applicants within a day or two. Out of this 3000, maybe 300 make it past the initial automated resume screen and online assessment. Out of those 300, a recruiter might chat with 30-50. And from that pool, only about 20-30 candidates ever make it to the initial phone screen and subsequent onsites.Now here’s the part that really opened my eyes: once you’re sitting on the other side of the table long enough, you start to notice patterns, and one of the biggest is how much of what’s on those resumes is either overstated, strategically worded, or just not true.I’ve lost count of the number of times we’ve brought someone in who claimed to have “architected a high-scale distributed system” and it turned out they wrote a couple of endpoints under heavy supervision. Or people who listed “launched a revenue-generating product used by millions” when, digging deeper, they built an internal tool with a handful of users. I’ve seen candidates inflate internship projects into “production systems,” or even list companies that, when we checked, they’d never actually worked at in any real capacity.A big one that’s become increasingly common is people lying about the technology stacks they’ve used. You’d be shocked how many resumes list technologies like Kubernetes, Terraform, or Kafka as “production experience,” but when we ask follow-ups in the interview, it’s clear they’ve maybe followed a tutorial or briefly shadowed someone who worked with those tools.And here’s an important reality that most candidates (and even some hiring managers) don’t fully realize: background checks almost never verify WHAT you did. They usually just confirm your job title and employment dates. So if someone says they built a large-scale React application or ran infrastructure on AWS, there’s no background check that’s going to expose that as false. Unless an interviewer digs into the details, the exaggeration often goes completely unchallenged.And the thing is, many of these candidates still get interviews. Sometimes they even get offers. Not because they’re necessarily more skilled, but because their resumes are packed with the right keywords and “impact statements” that our systems and recruiters are trained to look for. Meanwhile, a candidate who honestly describes their experience with modest, accurate language often never even gets a shot.This creates a really frustrating dynamic. The people who embellish tend to stand out in the resume pile, which pressures others to do the same just to keep up. And from where I’m sitting as a SWE involved in this process, that pressure is entirely on us, the hiring side, for building a system that rewards buzzwords and inflated claims over substance and honesty.So if you’re sitting there wondering why you’re not getting callbacks despite real skills and solid experience, it might not be because you’re underqualified. It might just be that you’re competing with a lot of resumes that have been heavily optimized, or outright fabricated, for the hiring process. And unfortunately, those are the ones that often float to the top.Our team specifically now mostly just relies on references or \"people who know people\". We value that far more than trying to hire someone who noone on the team can speak about.**TL;DR:*** People are inflating, exaggerating and lying on their resumes like you wouldn't believe.* The vast majority of honest candidates never even make it to the recruiter screening* I'm noticing it happen more and more (at least 70%+ of candidates who make it to onsite). Every resume has tons of impact, tons of metrics, tons of technologies. Yet the candidates can't speak about any of it in the interview.* I believe the blame is on the hiring side, not the candidates. It's been drilled into your heads to have metrics, impacts, and keywords to beat the ATS and impress recruiters* Our team is shifting to mostly just hiring people based on references instead. Far less risky.Has anyone else experienced this? I'm not sure what the solution is. Like I said, our team is now focused more on references than anything else but even that isn't a perfect system.",

While coaching them on 1:1, I notice they struggle to meet the basic SDE standards that are well within the scope of a new CS grad or at least something that is easy to find in internet.For example - there's a dude that wasn't able to understand that a javascript function can return another function and not just a concrete value/object. He also asked me how a basic lodash function work - which is basically 1 google search away. Another dude was not able to explain his thought process on the code he wrote because I found that there is no relevance of the change he made for the feature development that was assigned. So, on a high level, I have observed that they cannot grasp the understanding of the system, have patience to read through documentations, question what it does and how to think of when writing code. Now, there could be a couple of possibilities on this. First, maybe they are overwhelmed and feel like they need to push gold standard code from month 1, else they get fired. The brutal job market might be making them scared to lose the job and is presurring them to show up as an expert already. Second, maybe the ChatGPT really ruined their critical thinking ability and attention span for reading through documentations / articles. Third, could it be the toxic work culture at FAANG where there's a pressure of proving yourself to avoid layoffs? I am curious if the situation is same across all companies.",

I was laid off in June. Prepared hard, polished my resume with AI many times, applied to between 200-300 jobs in the span of 2 months. Got about 15 interviews, 4 offers. I think I could get more offers tbh but after I found the company I really liked I accepted an offer and stopped the interview process with the rest. I interviewed with Capital One, Visa, UKG, Amazon, Circle, Apollo, Citadel, FICO, GM and some no names or startups. That’s all to say that after reading reddit I was anxious to even apply but I think I got a decent amount of interviews and negotiated my offers to be either at the higher end of the salary range for the role or even above advertised. I do recognize it’s much harder for junior engineers these days but is there really a shortage for experienced engineers? I haven’t felt that. I’m not even a native English speaker although I do speak English fluently. I’m in the US. I also didnt lie on resume or cheated during coding rounds. Some of them I solved 100%, some not. For example for C1 I got 450/600 points on CodeSignal and still got a callback and an offer after clearing their power day. Ask me anything I guess. Happy to help someone if I can. No referrals though, sorry. I’ve just started a few weeks ago, too early to refer especially someone I don’t personally know. Here are a few things that I believe gave me an edge or worked in my favor:- referrals from my network- local jobs that required hybrid schedule- tailored resumes- soft skills- activity on LinkedIn (mostly commenting)I also tried to outsource the filling out job applications part so I can focus on preparing and interviewing but I didn’t have much success with freelancers from Fiverr.

        "content": "tldr; Find jobs that aren't on LinkedIn/Indeed and your chances of getting a job will dramatically improve.Some people know this, many don't: lots of jobs don't end up on LinkedIn and Indeed.* Sometimes companies intentionally don't post their jobs there because they don't want to be flooded by applications.* Sometimes LinkedIn just takes a few weeks or months to start scraping these companies because they are relatively small (15-100 employees).* Sometimes LinkedIn doesn't do a good job at scraping certain government/city/public sector job sites.If you're limiting yourself to the big sites then you are going to miss out on the jobs that don't get posted there. What's worse is that you will ONLY apply to the jobs that everyone and their dog is applying to, which means your competition will be 10x higher.Example: I recently came across an NYC startup hiring multiple software engineers remotely in Canada that is paying $240-$300k base for people with 4-10 years of experience. They have [3 job openings](https://meterwork.com/employer/affiniti_YhHt2) but LinkedIn shows 0 jobs for [their company](https://www.linkedin.com/company/affiniti-finance/jobs/).I know the above is true because I spend hours a week finding jobs for my job board and regularly find companies with 0 jobs on LinkedIn but multiple jobs on their career pages. My point is, you need to start thinking outside of the box when job searching, especially in today's environment. You can't expect to do the same thing everyone else is doing and to see different results.And job boards are just one source of finding job openings, there are a few others that most people don't even consider. Ya I know it sucks that you have to go through all these hoops and tricks to find a job, but at the end of the day you just gotta play the game if you want to have a shot at winning.",

This shit sucks.Big tech has gotten intense and stressful so its hard to chill there. Startups have insane competition and are tight on money so the expectations are you working super hard to make this thing survive.I understand this isn't true for 100% of companies but it feels like at least 70% of companies kind of suck to work at as a SWE. And by suck I mostly mean super stressful despite the pay and perks still being pretty good.In conclusion, if every company kind of sucks I might as well take the highest paid role I can since they're all going to have intense expectations.TLDR; does every company kind of suck to work at so take the job with most money?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Maybe I was naive at the time, but early in my career (early 2010s), it seemed like companies knew what they were doing a lot more. At my first two or three companies, the CEOs all had the same story: they came from outside of tech and decided to make software to solve some problem that they were having. They could clearly explain what the problems they were trying to solve were, and how the solution did thatThis seemed also true at bigger companies. Companies like google or netflix were at least *trying* to make products that appealed to consumers, even if it wasn't always a hit. Companies seemed to be run fairly well, or they were at least stable day to day. There was also lots of \"aspirational\" jobs, like places where if you got a job there, it felt like you hit the lotteryNowadays things just... don't really seem like that. It seems like every single company has *terrible* leadership. AI integration into *everything* seems like a good example, I don't know a single person in my life who has ever wanted to use one of these things, most (like me) find them actively annoying. Some of their ideas just seem really out there. Like how Zuckerberg was talking about making a social network where you interact with AI companions. ... Why would I ever want that?The companies just generally seem to be run more poorly. Vaguely communicated (if communicated at all) long term goals, seemingly no direction or conviction, no desire to compete and a seeming indifference to customer needs. Sometimes it even feels like they have an actively antagonistic view of their customers and people in general. Working at pretty much *any* company seems miserable",

I did make a change to my resume around the time I started getting more callbacks but it was a tiny change adding a couple of basic metrics about userbase of the projects I worked onI'm kinda curious if anyone else is experiencing more callbacks or if it really was the addition of basic metrics that is making the difference",

        "content": "Firstly, I want to say I'm not from the US, I'm from a small Eastern European country, so the job market here is probably not as bad as US or Canadian job market, that is because we don't have immigrants here. But it's still bad, if you're a junior / have no experience you will have hard time finding a job.My major was CSE ie Computer Science and Engineering which is like halfway between electrical and software engineers (but I focused on the software part, because that was the most interesting part to me).Barely anyone is hiring people without experience / juniors these days. The few places that do hire juniors get a large amount of applications and vast majority will be rejected. There is a very low amount of entry level jobs.Bootcamps were a thing in my country by mid 2010s already (some of them already went bankrupt by now) and due to the \"learn to code\" movement a lot more people took CS and related majors at Universities than before. As a result, the job market became very oversaturated at junior / entry level.There's also the AI hype which I think makes employers less likely to want entry lever developers.In mid to late 2010s people were told that \"coding is cool\", \"coding is an easy path to success\", \"it's easy to get high paying job if you get a degree\" and that kind of stuff. I was naive and hopped on the bandwagon.By the time I graduated in 2022, entry level developers were much less in demand than in mid / late 2010 because the market was oversaturated by then. I think the knowledge I had in 2022 would have been enough to land a job around 2015. I think the bar to enter IT is much higher than 10-15 years ago.I haven't worked in IT since 2022, moved on to other stuff. Why am I writing this? On one hand, to vent. On the other hand, to show the reality of this industry. (although this sub is already full of \"doom and gloom\" from what I've seen).This is a very competitive field, you're competing against developers from all over the world, from countries where salaries are lower. I have ex classmates from uni who graduated but do not work in IT either.",

        "content": "10 YoE, have explored various specialties and currently working for an AI tooling/infrastructure company. We're doing quite well, but man, I just feel like shit whenever I think too hard about it. This stuff barely works, it's barely getting any better, and the economic, environmental, and social costs of producing it are exploding exponentially.Before this, I worked at a company that did electronics manufacturing for various large corporations. We were poorly-run and a godawful waste of money. Before that, a company that made software that assisted in fracking. Before that, a company that staffed fucking *call centers*. I used to think that these were stepping stones to a meaningful job, but... I don't know what that would be, at this point. Maybe I could go work in clean energy? Or on theoretical AI research that might eventually yield more useful advances? Or... something else? I don't know.I love working on software. And when I was younger I really believed that I could make good money doing this, **and** do something that mattered at the same time. Now... I feel like I won't be morally clean unless I give all my money to charity and go become a monk and wear a hair shirt. I know that's ridiculous, I know it's black-and-white thinking, but I haven't found a good framework for working out the moral calculus here.It's even more exhausting because it seems like nobody in the industry of any note **cares** about any of this. It feels like I'm surrounded by people who believe that if we *just keep building,* something amazing will fall out -- as if these people didn't just live through the fucking crypto bubble and the rise of social media before that. The only high-profile people I hear talking about a moral hazard are the AI doomers, who are so infatuated with an imaginary apocalypse that they can't be bothered to think about the boring work of improving the real world. I know, this is a rant. To try to turn it into something more directed: have any of you felt this way and gotten back to a place where you felt good about what you do? If you did, did it involve changing jobs? What are you working on now?",

And it will make you feel that everything is hopeless.It's important for your mental health that you moderate this. Yes, the job market is bad, but the posts in this subreddit make it seem far worse than it is.Now for a **real talk** about some people...I've been going around helping people with their resumes and portfolios to fix potential issues, and one thing I have noticed is that there is a decent amount of people (not all) who could do a lot more to boost their chances but feel demotivated from the job market and have just given up too early.I'm talking people who have applied for tons of software jobs but don't have a single original complete project on their github, or who have just got their degree and have nothing else to back it up.Yes the job market is bad. Yes it is harder than it was a few years ago. No it is not impossible. While for a lot of people their resume and portfolio are strong, there is a decent amount who actually need some honesty and realize that part of the problem is them.The most recent one I saw was a guy saying the job market was cooked, the comments offering a lot of sympathy. But the guy had a mess of projects on his github in obscure niche areas of programming with no comments or READMEs or anything to help organize it or explain what it was. And then had one of the least concise resumes I'd seen, I had to read over half of it just to try and even figure out what tech skills he had. Yet had been complaining he hadn't been able to get a tech job despite trying for over a year. I was honest but kind about it and gave advice and told him to ask for honest advice from people rather than just getting sympathy.Before I get **downvoted into oblivion**, I am not saying this is true of everyone. It's just common enough from the posts I've seen in the last few weeks when I've looked at people's resumes and githubs/portfolios.* Have personal projects that are original. (Keep code copied from tutorials for learning, not for showing publicly)* Have tech skills that are relevant to jobs in your area.* Organize them neatly and with clear information for people to read.* Get your resume checked by different people. Do small projects with other people to show you can collaborate.* Help with open source projects to show you can meaningfully contribute to work that isn't yours.I am not denying at all that it's way harder than it use to be to land a tech job but it's not impossible either.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "We all know the job market for entry to mid-level SWE roles is rough right now. The whole \"do an 8 week bootcamp and land a job with basic JS\" approach is long gone.That said, I think it's unproductive to just say \"entry level SWE is dead.\"For context: I don’t have a CS degree. I did an 18 month apprenticeship, a bootcamp before that, then stayed with the company I apprenticed at for 3.5 more years. So about 5 years total experience, now mid-level, but all at one place. I’ve been out of the market the whole time and things have changed a lot, now looking for new opportunities and trying to get my bearings.I wanted to start a discussion about what skills are actually needed today to get hired as an entry or mid-level engineer, both for the benefit of people trying to break into the field for the first time and for mid-levels who are looking for a new placement after 3–5 years of experience.For entry I’d define it as something like:- Strong in at least one backend language- HTML, CSS, JS fundamentals- Understanding of version control and Git workflows- Testing basics (unit, integration, maybe e2e)- Databases (querying, relational vs non-relational)- Basic infra knowledge (what AWS is, main services and what they’re useful for)- Ability to debug code and solve basic errors- Basic understanding of work process and how to collaborate in a team5+ years ago this probably would have put you mid-level, so maybe I’m stretching it.On mid-level, I honestly don’t know how to define it. I feel the line between senior and mid has blurred a lot. Most times I just do the same stuff as the seniors on my team, they're just able to get it done faster, have more stuff in-flight concurrently, and they communicate with the non-technical people more than me. Maybe mid-level just needs the same skills as I listed above, but with more independence, more depth in certain areas, and the ability to not shit your pants when things go wrong in production.Curious what others think. What skills are truly needed now?EDIT: Thanks for the thoughtful answers. I’m mostly gonna stop engaging now since this thread turned into a circular degree vs no-degree debate. This sub isn’t a great fit for the kind of discussion I was hoping to have. If I see any genuine comments pop up I’ll read them though",

I am just wondering if there's *anything* whatsoever that I can do with it outside of CS or even outside of tech? I've been working fast food for the past several months since graduatuon and it's eating at me that I just wasted so many years and so much money. I know I can't sell it like a Hunter License or something but are there any kinds of jobs where to break in you just need a certain amount of math or stats proficiency (I took quite a bit in university) or it's an engineering job or something but they're okay with any sort of STEM degree?

Google is L3, but the salary looks like it will be around £100k, and since at AMZN I am getting internally promoted up, my salary will probably be about £100k too, as an L5. (I'm not sure of the bands, I think its like £85k base and some stock).Perhaps moving to google, I can get promoted soon-ish too, since I am not a new grad and L4 google is L5 amazon, so theres a big salary bump incoming too?Staying at Amazon could be good as it is pretty chill and team is comfortable, and I'm learning as an engineer, and I can get those stock options I guess, but I don't think staying comfortable is great? Also interviewing with a startup that pays around £130k, might be good - I can move and challenge myself elsewhere, take a risk while I'm young, and make more money for it too?A lot of my friends are saying stay for SDEII promo, then move e.g to google or Meta as SDEII, instead of starting again as SDEI. I don't think it works like that though? Not sure as I haven't ever job hopped haha.What would you do?",

        "author": "MarathonMarathon",

        "content": "(Have a hunch that a lot of the answers are gonna be \"myself\".)People often joke about CS grads having to pivot to nursing / trades / burger-flipping due to being unable to find employment in their field. But how dire does it actually get in terms of people you personally know?For me, despite being woefully unable to secure much progress through September as a senior set to graduate into an awful job market, even then it's not myself. There was some guy from my uni a few years older than me who did some drug dealing and ended up getting arrested. So while things do look economically bleak for me (and likely many others), at least I've got retained enough integrity not to end up turning to a life of crime and getting saddled on drugs (yet).It's not like I personally know this person though. He just happened to attend my school. Absolute rock bottom might be Luigi from last winter (who has a MS CS), but I'm pretty confident most people don't personally know him.Most people I know are students lol, my age or younger. All my tech classmates who have graduated before me (2025 or earlier) are gainfully and relevantly employed to at least some extent right now.In terms of people I actually know, mine would have to be one friend's sibling who majored in IT and hardly cared about anything, who right now just has a remote help desk job that pays less than McDonald's. At least it's not only paid but domain-relevant, and I'm sure many grads would be dying to be in a similar situation. My friend told me their sibling *could* upskill to IT Engineer if they just put in the effort but they just choose not to. Still, it's an IT help desk that pays peanuts, and wouldn't have even required a degree a few years ago.",

He informs me that I have been fast tracked to the final interview for a senior level position. It’s in 5 hours. The interview is an hour long and according to glassdoor it’ll be full of coding and coding technical questions. I have been cramming Java all day, but it’s pretty futile to think I’m going to have anything beyond a basic explanation of concepts in time for this interview.

        "content": "I think I first start to get into programing was when I was 10? Using some Pascal IDE on my old Windows XP (I'm not that old at all, just grew up poor), that I hacked together from parts of all the other broken computers I had.I always loved to fix things, break things, then fix them again. Computers and programming is actually what got me into fixing other things. Electronics, then cars, then I even started building stuff (like carpentry). I guess it sort of inspired me to be a \"life long learner\".For work as a teen, I went towards anything where you could fix stuff, or solve a problem people had. So I worked as a trades assistant in a variety of differrnt trades, and a machine operator until I had the money to go university to study CS, with the idea that this was going to be it for me as this as what I'd *always* done.What I noticed along the way with study is my urge to code in my own time wained as I studied. As well as this, I guess particularly in the last 10 years, I've developed a general disinterest in tech advancements and new software. To be honest, I resent a lot of it, because most of the stuff I inevitably have to use feels convoluted, old reddit > new reddit, type thing. Now that I do have some work experience I've realized one important thing I never considered:**Problem solving in the realm of software development is nothing like problem solving for yourself, or small clients** If I fix a thing for a client (as a tradesman), it's immediately rewarding. You're helping someone with something they can't provide themselves, and it's usually something they need. It's immediately rewarding (for me).The process of building software for a company, who's problem is they want/need more money, does not provide me with that same sense of reward and satisfaction.Even the whole idea of \"continuous improvement\" irritates me. Constantly changing stuff for the sake of... I'm not really sure? And often in the process, just making the product worse. I guess this is coming off as more a rant, but particularly I wanted to ask has anyone felt the same way, and what did you pivot to?",

All of them eventually were marked as “not selected”, I never even got to talk to a recruiter or start the hiring process for any of the roles I applied to.this week I received an email from a recruiter with the title “Let’s reconnect”, and in the email they asked me to pick a time to have a 15min chat. They didn’t mention any specific job openings(I applied to around 8 since may), all they said was that the meeting was to discuss my skills and career aspirations. The openings I applied to are all still inactive on Microsoft Careers.Anyone ever got contacted like that and/or know what I should expect out of this call?",

        "content": "I'm entirely self taught, I picked up a project 8 years ago that ended up getting me a job offer related to the project after two years of working on it. I learned entirely on the go, picked everything up as I needed it for the work being done. But now the company I'm with is slowly dissolving and likely has only a few years left and I personally may have even less than that before they just decide to lay me off to help them delay the inevitable.The thing is, right now I have extremely good savings and virtually zero debt. I own my home with no mortgage to pay, my utility bills are cheap, own my car, and have zero reason to move from where I am considering how good the cost of living is and how much of my family is around me. I don't like the idea of moving for work.So my hope was to find literally any local-ish tech job or something fully remote (but lol, all remote jobs are inundated with applicants), there's a decent amount on offer because I'm only an hour out from a major city and right next to it is a sort of 'corporate hub' that has all of the state's big businesses. I didn't give a shit if I'm making half the pay of a cs newly grad, I applied for literally everything that I thought I could do. Ended up with around 80 applications sent, using a resume my buddy who's a team lead for a big tech company helped me build up with more than enough decent projects listed.In the end I got three interviews, all of them were technical focused. None of them went well, they all seemed to immediately acknowledge that I don't have a degree and went really hard on testing the limits of my knowledge. Things that I've never had to learn, like databases or algorithms. I knew they were over the moment they started throwing vocabulary at me that I had never even dreamed of. I still did my best, hoping to God maybe they were just pushing my buttons to test me, but nope, didn't end up working.So I go back to my buddy and his advice was basically to check out WGU, told me that I'd probably be able to finish a degree in a decent amount of time, especially if I optimize credits with Sophia and study (the website, not the act of studying). That I'd be able to rush through courses that cover topics I already know and fill in gaps of knowledge with courses I don't already know.I do think it's a decent idea, but my alternative is to just pick up more certs and start to learn topics outside of my knowledge zone, and that would probably end up taking less time, effort and money, but I have no idea if that's even going to make it any easier to continue my career.",

Thankfully I grew up with parents who have been fairly reasonable when it comes to my academics (though admittedly falling short in other sectors), and I'm well aware that letter grades mean jack shit when it comes to employability, but man, the sentiment does ring true when it comes to what you need to do to get interviews, ace interviews, and receive offers.You have to outcompete everybody (technically, behaviorally, experientially) for a small number of roles (often just 1 or 2). Could range from 50 to 5000 applicants per role. But even if you do get selected you have to prove you're better than like 10 to 200 people. Referrals and nepo can help a slight bit, but they're no panacea (and I think part of the problem here is my family and I not knowing enough high-ranking people at smaller companies). Even the CS adjacent jobs like IT and data analysis or business analysis which might be more boring or compensate less face similar gauntlets as they seem to attract even more people from even more walks of life. It's like a shitty tournament or Squid Game.Which means, if you're not the best of the best? You end up in the rejection pile. Big companies or small companies, 50k or 6 figs, government or industry, all seem crazy competitive, and oftentimes you end up rejected for no reason.I just wish I could've punched my past freshman self in the face and shake some sense into him. Whether that means taking CS, upskilling, interview prep, and LeetCode / systems design more seriously, or just choosing a different field altogether, it's hard to tell. But I feel like with so many applications per week and hardly a single callback, even with what I've been told is an impressive-seeming resume, it's getting hard to see anything but disaster down the line.I feel like I grew up hating competition, and was never really the type to win trophies in high school or anything. I remember sitting in my high school's auditorium listening to the vice principal name everyone who was in the top 10% GPA of the class, and I was sadly not one of them. I was hoping things could've changed for me in college, but sadly, the way things are right now for me, I'm woefully average. If you gave me an interview right now, there's a good chance I'd fall flat on my face. I've done some drilling and it's not like I'm anywhere near the stage where I can't even do twoSum, but many times it's still a toss-up. And I feel like no matter how well I do, there's always going to be some other applicant in the same loop with the same interviewers who will surpass me in skill, prowess, and ability to explain themselves, and who is thus going to be deemed better qualified for the role.",

I got a mostly positive response to that mostly pessimistic post. I updated based on recent data and expanded to cover industries that rely on Tech and Quant related skills. I’ll repost to finance careers as well this time.In my original post, I shared that in my experience the job market largely reflects confidence that earnings growth will outpace inflation and bond markets. Here’s the S&P 500  [YOY RE growth](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-real-earnings-growth/table/by-quarter) over the last nine months:* Mar 31, 2025  10.58%* Dec 31, 2024  6.15%* Sep 30, 2024  6.11%* Jun 30, 2024  5.12%[Real M2 Money Supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2REAL) appears to have also reverted back to a normal rate of growth from before the pandemic. That, in addition to the earnings growth, should start a return to a “normal” job market. Unfortunately, back-to-normal is taking longer than anyone wants.I poked around a little more and noticed the following trend for S&P 500 [YOY Real Sales Per Share growth](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-real-sales-growth/table/by-quarter) over that same time period:* Mar 31, 2025  2.25%* Dec 31, 2024  2.24%* Sep 30, 2024  2.75%* Jun 30, 2024  1.95%That suggests that companies realized earnings growth not through sales but instead through cost cutting by presumably reducing headcount. I posted a public [dashboard on FRED that shows headcount growth flatlining](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/dashboard/121649) (you can create your own economic dashboard on FRED).Unfortunately, I don’t think lower rates alone from the Fed will be enough. Also, unlike what I wrote in my original post, I don’t think there are any safe jobs or companies. Here are some other larger trends I’ve begun looking at - I am curious if others on Reddit agree or disagree:1. Between security concerns, software as a service, and low/no code customization, the number of products and versions have shrunk. Hence, companies have eliminated many jobs patching older versions of SW or journeyman jobs maintaining custom code.2. Overall, [the number of publicly traded companies has shrunk](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LDOM.NO?locations=US) since the 1990s. If it wasn’t for SPACs, the numbers would likely have gone even further lower. With fewer companies, M&A, auditing, compliance, and finance all rely on less and less headcount.3. The [increase in college educated professionals](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1MJlq) has diluted the unique value of any college degree. Even if you suspended H1B and OPT roles, it wouldn’t change the scale at which college educated professionals now participate in the job market relative to what they did 20 years ago.Growth in public companies followed public market deregulation by Reagan in the 1980s and not regulating the internet starting with Clinton in the 1990s (Sec 230). I think we’re similarly at a point where we need to assess the structure/incentives of market regulation across the board.",

These 2 seem to be the best options when it comes to online Master's degrees from what I've researched, but I don't know if Master's are the best choice or if they're really the 2 best choices.I'd love some direction from those who are more experienced.Thank you in advance.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm looking for some advice on how to approach a conversation with my manager about my recent performance review and compensation as an engineer with only 1 YOE.I just received my first annual review yesterday and got a 5/5 overall with absolutely stellar written feedback (e.g., \"often finding innovative solutions superior to solutions that may have been proposed by senior engineers\", \"gone above and beyond in taking ownership and assuming the role of subject matter expert\").At the end of our meeting, my manager only offered a 4% raise and told me that I wasn't put in for a promotion because \"it just doesn't happen after 1 year\". When asked, he mentioned that a promotion could be considered in my next annual review.I don't think this compensation reflects the value I've brought to the company or my team. This raise puts me at 78k while the position's listed salary band is 70-90k. I expected to be at the very least in the upper half of this salary band. I've also been praised for my work by many senior colleagues, even frequently mentioning that they think I deserve a promotion. All this makes me feel that I'm severely undercompensated.I'm not sure what my strategy should be when walking into his office on Monday. Should I push for a promotion to get a larger raise (I've heard stories of 7-10% at my company)? Should I just push for a larger raise without promotion? Should I negotiate other benefits like more PTO?I have been actively applying for about 4 months now, but haven't gotten any offers back yet, so I unfortunately don't have anything to leverage beyond my 1 YOE and many character references at this company. I really just don't want to waste another year in my HCOL area with poor compensation to get another disappointing raise.",

Outside of me, my boss, and our data scientist none of us are on the same page about anything. We all have a guy who is more or less “the project leader” and could be considered our superior. He’s been writing a program for about two years for one of our data tasks. It’s terrible. Like the dude is passing images into pandas dataframes and then iterating over the dataframe. To run the program once would take around 75 hours. I managed to cut it down to just under an hour. It’s not accurate either but that’s a story for another time.Well this superior says he wants to run his code. If we have any ideas for changes to the code we need to run it by him for him to change. Even regarding the massive runtime cut I had, he would prefer to make the changes himself. The issue is 1.) he’s not good at coding 2.) he’s extremely busy so a simple change might take an entire week. My boss told me to just change the code without letting him know. He and a few others have done this in the past before (this superior is typically weird like this about his code). I feel bad because I am pretty close with this superior on a personal/irl level and I’m also a bit fearful he’ll see the changes at some point and get mad. Not sure what to do about this.",

These days, I’m hardly getting any interviews at all.At this stage, would getting a BS in Software Engineering improve my career prospects? I’m considering options like WGU, or a Canadian university program that has a co-op component and try getting internships in big companies? Also with ageism and offshoring, I am becoming disillusioned with tech.

I did well enough in this degree that they hired me as a undergraduate TA to teach tutorials and grade exams for 3 out of the 5 years of my undergrad. I graduated right into the height of the pandemic so at the time, with the uncertainty of how the pandemic would shake everything up, even though I was looking for a job in data science or related fields, I took the first thing I could get. The first job I got was related to front-end web development at a government agency and I stayed there for 5 years. I was a top performer for the last few years of my employment there (always got glowing reviews from my managers), but since front-end was something I kind of fell into, I decided to go back to school for CS and so started applying for schools again last September. Additionally, I have a younger sibling that was accepted to Google as a SWE this past year, so that gave me extra inspiration to work on myself.Right before I started school again this month, my team was made redundant and I was laid off. I was hoping to work there at least one more year while I took part time studies (I am part time for my first year as my math and stats degree requirements have all transferred and my gen-ed requirements waived), but fortunately I have enough savings to get me through my entire degree. My current school (York University) is probably a tier-2 equivalent school (if you would consider the University of Toronto a tier 1 school). However, I want to do co-op which would extend my second degree to 4 years. Between co-op and EI (which I applied for as I am a part time student) I will have some financial buffer. But what I'm truly worried about is the CS market still being absolute shit by the time I graduate. I tell myself that this market downturn is only temporary as advancements in AI will most likely plateau, maybe the government down south stabilizes and the economy with it too, and like all market downturns there will be a time where it resurges but that's never a certainty.If it were just me I think I would be able to manage. But my parents are getting up there in age and I'm afraid that if I can't get a job as soon as I graduate then I won't be able to support them when they retire. What is the best way for me, currently, to best maximize my employment chances as soon as I graduate (in terms of CS fields focus on) - given that I have a math and stats background I think either AI or Fintech would be my best options. I will network and do side projects. Ultimately the dream would be to join my younger sibling in working at a FAANG but for now I just need to maximize my chances at quick employment after graduation. I'm hoping my previous experience and math/stats background will set me apart from other fresh grads when the time comes.",

I see people say “if I can’t get a job offer or internship I will just go to grad school”, as if this route is smarter financially. Grad school is incredibly expensive, federal aid is non existent for grad students, scholarships incredibly difficult to come by, and loans carry high interest rates. How in any way is this better than graduating, working a temporary job while continuing to code and build projects and apply to jobs?During school we must build side projects because the degree is in computer science not software engineering, the paper is not enough. If this is the case, why would post graduation be any different in that you would work a normal job and continue to grind. Are internships impossible to come by after graduation? If you graduate without internship experience you are somehow walled away because internships are a prerequisite to swe junior rolls? I would imagine you could find a gig even at a small company. Even if it took a while, your progress would still be faster because you’re not pushing the goalpost back two years. I’m just curious to hear from those with this opinion how continuing education is the safer route. If you’ve read this thank you and I look forward to your input.",

I have a non-technical bachelors and have been slowly pivoting my career into a data-related role, recently deciding to go back to uni.The CS masters is more general and has modules that are very ai focused, as well as an applied stats module and a machine learning module. The Stats and DS course is exactly what it says on the tin, and is more specialist. I am open to the idea of going for technical jobs like data scientist or more human facing roles like a data consultant. My biggest concern is which would look better to an employer. I know that DS isn't as highly regarded as CS generally speaking, and that DS is very hard to break into with just a masters. So please let me know if DS would be worth my time? And if not, if I was to go down a more human facing route, which would be better? Thank you anyone for your time!",

For the past few years I have had good jobs both as a designer and as a frontend developer, and things seemed to go well for me on both ends (financially and career wise). This year, however –with the surge of AI–, I no longer have a stable job and find myself lost in such a competitive market. I am trying to find ways to stay relevant in this aggressive, quick-changing industry, which has led me to explore new opportunities in other not-so-competitive areas and job positions. So my question for all of you is, why do you think these two roles haven't gained as much visibility yet, and what advice would you give to someone like me who stands right in the middle between design and development, with no formal CS-related education?Thank you for reading.edit: typos",
