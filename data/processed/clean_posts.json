        "content": "*Disclaimer: this post is nothing but a rant.*---I've recently inherited a data project which is almost entirely based in Azure synapse.I can't even begin to describe the level of hatred and despair that this platform generates in me.Let's start with the biggest offender: that being Spark as the only available runtime. Because OF COURSE one MUST USE Spark to move 40 bits of data, god forbid someone thinks a firm has (*gasp!*) small data, even if the amount of companies that actually need a distributed system is less than the amount of fucks I have left to give about this industry as a whole.Luckily, I can soothe my rage by meditating during the downtimes, beacause testing code means that, if your cluster is cold, you have to wait between 2 and 5 business days to see results, meaning that each day one gets 5 meaningful commits in at most. Work-life balance, yay!Second, the bane of any sensible software engineer and their sanity: Notebooks. I believe notebooks are an invention of Satan himself, because there is not a single chance that a benevolent individual made the choice of putting notebooks in production.I know that one day, after the 1000th notebook I'll have to fix, my sanity will eventually run out, and I will start a terrorist movement against notebook users. Either that or I will immolate myself alive to the altar of sound software engineering in the hope of restoring equilibrium.Third, we have the biggest lie of them all, the scam of the century, the slithery snake, the greatest pretender: \"yOu dOn't NEeD DaTA enGINEeers!!1\".Because since engineers are expensive, these idiotic corps had to sell to other even more idiotic corps the lie that with these magical NO CODE tools, even Gina the intern from Marketing can do data pipelines!But obviously, Gina the intern from Marketing has marketing stuff to do, leaving those pipelines uncovered. Who's gonna do them now? Why of course, the same exact data engineers one was trying to replace!Except that instead of being provided with proper engineering toolbox, they now have to deal with an environment tailored for people whose shadow outshines their intellect, castrating the productivity many times over, because dragging arbitrary boxes to get a for loop done is clearly SO MUCH faster and productive than literally anything else.I understand now why our salaries are high: it's not because of the skill required to conduct our job. It's to pay the levels of insanity that we're forced to endure.But don't worry, AI will fix it.",

Here are a few:- We are in a near constant state of migration. We keep moving from one cloud provider to another for no real reason at all, and are constantly decommissioning ETL pipelines and making new ones to serve the same purpose. - We have many data vendors, each of which has its own standard (in terms of format, access etc). This requires us to make a dedicated ETL pipeline for each vendor (with some degree of code reuse).- Tribal knowledge and poor documentation plagues everything. We have tables (and other data assets) with names that are not descriptive and poorly documented. And so, data discovery (to do something like composing an analytical query) requires discussion with senior level employees who are have tribal knowledge. Doing something as simple as writing a SQL query took me much longer than expected for this reason.- Integrating new data vendors seems to always be an ad-hoc process done by higher ups, and is not done in a way that involves the people who actually work with the data on a day-to-day basis. I don’t intend to complain. I just want to know if other people are facing the same issues as I am. If this is true, then I’ll start figuring out a solution to solve this problem. Additionally, if there are other problems you’d like to point out (other than people being difficult to work with), please do so.",

Pulled Playlist data using Spotify API 2. Created a staging Postgres DB to store raw data of the Playlist 3. Cleaned the data and modeled the data into a STAR schema in a new db.4. Created Facts table containing granular data for Playlist- track_id, names, artists id , album ID5. Created dimension tables - for artists (ID and names) , for albums (ID and names)6. Used Genius API for fetching lyrics for each track7. Created another dimensions tables for lyrics (IDs and lyrics as text)8. Used Gemini API (free tier) to analyze lyrics for each song to return a json output. {'NSFW_TAG: [EXPLICIT/MILD/SAFE]}, {'Keywords found': [list of curse words found}9. Updated the lyrics dimensions to store the NSFW tagging and keywords.I have planned few more steps to execute:1.Use AIRFLOW for orchestration2. Recreate it in cloud instead of local dbdB3. Introduce some visualizations in power bi or tableau to show some charts like artist vs NSFW tagging , etc.So at this point, I am looking for feedback:1. to improve my skills in Data Engineering.2. Also since the Data size is very small, any suggestions on how to create a porject with larger datasets.Any feedback is appreciated and would help me immensely.",

The benchmarks covered both full initial loads and Change Data Capture (CDC) on a large dataset (billions of rows for full load, tens of millions of changes for CDC) over a 24-hour window.More details here: [https://olake.io/docs/connectors/postgres/benchmarks](https://olake.io/docs/connectors/postgres/benchmarks) How the dataset was generated: [https://github.com/datazip-inc/nyc-taxi-data-benchmark/tree/remote-postgres](https://github.com/datazip-inc/nyc-taxi-data-benchmark/tree/remote-postgres)# Some observations:* OLake hit \\~46K rows/sec sustained throughput across billions of rows without bottlenecking storage or compute.* $75 cost was infra-only (no license fees). Fivetran and Airbyte costs ballooned mostly due to runtime and license/credit models.* OLake retries gracefully. No manual interventions needed unlike Debezium.* Airbyte struggled massively at scale — couldn't complete run without retries. Estuary better but still \\~11x slower.Sharing this to understand if these numbers also match with your personal experience with these tool.Note: Full Load is free for Fivetran.",

For example, if a model score > 1 would break the downstream app, you catch that issue (and then log it/warn and/or raise an exception). You’d also easily isolate the records with problematic data. This isn’t revolutionary or new - what I wanted was a way to do this in fewer lines of code in a way that’d be more understandable to people who inherit it. There are other packages that aren’t pandas specific that *can* do the same things, like great expectations and pydantic, but the code is a lot more verbose. Really I just want honest feedback. If people don’t find it useful, I won’t put more time into it. pip install framecheckRepo with reproducible examples:https://github.com/OlivierNDO/framecheck",

But that didn't change, it was like that before the increase in costs.* The tables follow the \\[One Big Table\\](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/one-big-table/) data modelling * It could be something else, but the incremental in costs came just after that.My question would be, is it possible that changing the partition granularity from DAY to MONTH resulted in such a huge increase or would it be something else that we are not aware of?",

        "content": "**Hi folks,**I’m a data scientist, and over the years I’ve run into the same pattern across different teams and projects:Marketing, ops, product each team has their own system (Airtable, Mailchimp, CRM, custom tools). When it’s time to build BI dashboards or forecasting models, they export **flat, denormalized CSV files** often multiple files filled with repeated data, inconsistent column names, and no clear keys.Even the core databases behind the scenes are sometimes just raw transaction or log tables with minimal structure. And when we try to request a cleaner version of the data, the response is often something like:>“We can’t share it, it contains personal information.”So we end up spending days writing custom scripts, drawing ER diagrams, and trying to reverse-engineer schemas and still end up with brittle pipelines. The root issues never really go away, and that slows down everything: dashboards, models, insights.After running into this over and over, I built a small tool for myself called **LayerNEXUS** to help bridge the gap:* Upload one or many CSVs (even messy, denormalized ones)* Automatically detect relationships across files and suggest a clean, normalized (3NF) schema* Export ready-to-run SQL (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite)* Preview a visual ERD* Optional AI step for smarter key/type detectionIt’s free to try no login required for basic schema generation, and GitHub users get a few AI credits for the AI features. :link: [https://layernexus.com](https://layernexus.com) *(I’m the creator just sharing for feedback, not pushing anything)*If you’re dealing with raw log-style tables and trying to turn them into an efficient, well-structured database, this tool might help your team design something more scalable and maintainable from the ground up.Would love your thoughts:* Do you face similar issues?* What would actually make this kind of tool useful in your workflow?**Thanks in advance!** Max",

        "content": "I would like to hear any recommendations for my future studies.I'm a Data Engineer with 3YOE, and I'm going to share some of my background to introduce myself and help you guide me through my doubts.I'm from third world country and have an Advanced English already, but still today working for national companyes earning less than 30k USD yearly.I graduated in Mechanical Engineering, and because of that, I feel I lack knowledge in Computer Science subjects, which I'm really interested in.Company 1 – I started my career as a Power BI Developer for 1.5 years in a consulting company. I consider myself advanced in Power BI — not an expert, but someone who can solve most problems, including performance tuning, RLS, OLS, Tabular Editor, etc.Company 2 – I built and delivered a Data Platform for a retail company (+7000 employees) using Microsoft Fabric. I was the main and principal engineer for the platform for 1.5 years, using Azure Data Factory, Dataflows, Spark Notebooks (basic Spark and Python, such as reading, writing, using APIs, partitioning...), Delta Tables (very good understanding), schema modeling (silver and gold layers), lakehouse governance, understanding business needs, and creating complex SQL queries to extract data from transactional databases. I consider myself intermediate-advanced in SQL (for the market), including window functions, CTEs, etc. I can solve many intermediate and almost all easy LeetCode problems.Company 3 – I just started (20,000+ employees). I'm working in a Data Integration team, using a lot of Talend for ingestion from various sources, and also collaborating with the Databricks team.Freelance Projects (2 years) – I developed some Power BI dashboards and organized databases for two small companies using Sheets, excel and BigQuery.Nowadays, I'm learning a lot of Talend to deliver my work in the best way possible. By the end of the year, I might need to move to another country for family reasons. I’ll step away from the Data Engineering field for a while and will have time to study (maybe for 1.5 years), so I would like to strengthen my knowledge base.I can program in Python a bit. I’ve created some functions, connected to Microsoft Graph through Spark Notebooks, ingested data, and used Selenium for personal projects. I haven't developed my technical skills further mainly because I haven't needed to use Python much at work.I don’t plan to study Databricks, Snowflake, Data Factory, DBT, BigQuery, and AIs deeply, since I already have some experience with them. I understand their core concepts, which I think is enough for now. I’ll have the opportunity to practice these tools through freelancing in the future. I believe I just need to understand what each tool does — the core concepts remain the same. Or am I wrong?I’ve planned a few things to study. I believe a Data Engineer with 5 years of experience should starts understand algorithms, networking, programming languages, software architecture, etc. I found the OSSU University project (https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). Since I’ve already completed an engineering degree, I don’t need to do everything again, but it looks like a really good path.So, my plan — following OSSU — is to complete these subjects over the next 1.5 years:Systematic Program DesignClass-based Program DesignProgramming Languages, Part A (Is that necessary?)Programming Languages, Part B (Is that necessary?)Programming Languages, Part C (Is that necessary?)Object-Oriented DesignSoftware ArchitectureMathematics for Computer Science (Is that necessary?)The Missing Semester of Your CS Education (Looks interesting)Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to TetrisBuild a Modern Computer from First Principles: Nand to Tetris Part IIOperating Systems: Three Easy PiecesComputer Networking: a Top-Down ApproachDivide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized AlgorithmsGraph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data StructuresGreedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic ProgrammingShortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About ThemCybersecurity FundamentalsPrinciples of Secure CodingIdentifying Security VulnerabilitiesIdentifying Security Vulnerabilities in C/C++ Programming or Exploiting and Securing Vulnerabilities in Java ApplicationsDatabases: Modeling and TheoryDatabases: Relational Databases and SQLDatabases: Semistructured DataMachine LearningComputer GraphicsSoftware Engineering: IntroductionEthics, Technology and Engineering (Is that necessary?)Intellectual Property Law in Digital Age (Is that necessary?)Data Privacy FundamentalsAdvanced programmingAdvanced systemsAdvanced theoryAdvanced Information SecurityAdvanced math (Is that necessary?)Any other recommendations is very welcoming!!",

Are there established best practices or conventions by layer (raw/staging/core) that you follow for datetime handling?2. For wallclock `DATETIME` values (timezone-naive), is it recommended to convert them to a standard timezone-aware format during ingestion?3. Regarding the presentation layer (specifically Looker), should time zone conversions be avoided there to prevent inconsistencies, or are there cases where handling timezones at this layer is acceptable?Any insights or examples of how your teams have handled this would be extremely helpful!Thanks in advance!",

I’m using tools I love — GCP, Airflow, Spark, SQL — and have built a strong reputation with my manager, who’s expressed interest in converting me to full-time when the budget allows. The catch? There’s no clear timeline, and I’m expecting my first child later this year, so stability and benefits are becoming a priority.Now, I’ve been approached with a full-time offer at a smaller company working in healthcare data. The role offers the stability I’m looking for, but the tech stack centers around Microsoft Fabric, which I know is still new and polarizing in the data engineering community. I haven’t worked with Fabric directly, but I understand the concepts (like medallion architecture, data governance, etc.). I’m just not sure if this is the right move for long-term growth — especially since I enjoy hands-on coding and working with more flexible, open tools.My questions:Has anyone made a similar shift from tools they love to a more rigid/abstracted stack? How did it go?How much of a “career risk” is moving into Fabric right now, given it’s still maturing?What would you prioritize in this situation — toolset you love or full-time security (especially with a growing family)?What other factors should I be weighing in this kind of decision?Appreciate any insights or personal experiences you can share!",

Configure Postgres and create test table bash # Create replication user docker compose exec postgres psql -U dbz -d inventory -c \"CREATE USER repuser WITH REPLICATION ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'repuser';\" # Create test table docker compose exec postgres psql -U dbz -d inventory -c \"CREATE TABLE customers (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255), email VARCHAR(255));\" # Enable full row images for updates/deletes docker compose exec postgres psql -U dbz -d inventory -c \"ALTER TABLE customers REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;\"# 3. Register Debezium connectorCreate a file named `register-postgres.json`: json{ \"name\": \"inventory-connector\", \"config\": { \"connector.class\": \"io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector\", \"database.hostname\": \"postgres\", \"database.port\": \"5432\", \"database.user\": \"repuser\", \"database.password\": \"repuser\", \"database.dbname\": \"inventory\", \"topic.prefix\": \"inventory\", \"slot.name\": \"inventory_slot\", \"publication.autocreate.mode\": \"filtered\", \"table.include.list\": \"public.customers\" } }Register it: bash curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data u/register-postgres.json http://localhost:8083/connectors# 4.

Currently, they mainly want to run batch job pipelines, and a clear requirement is that the orchestration tool must be self-hosted on Kubernetes AND OSS.My initial thought was to go with Apache Airflow, but the growing ecosystem of \"next-gen\" tools (e.g. Dagster, Prefect, Mage, Windmill etc.) makes it hard to keep track of the trade-offs.At the moment, I tend towards either Airflow or Dagster to get somehow started..My key questions:* What are the meaningful pros and cons of Airflow vs. Dagster in real-world deployments?* One key thing could also be that the client wants this platform useable by different teams and therefore a good Multi-tenancy setup would be helpful. Here I see that Airflow has disadvantges compared to most of \"next-gen\" tools like Dagster? Do you agree/disagree?* Are there technical or organizational arguments for preferring one over the other?* One thing that bothers me with many Airflow alternatives is that the open-source (self-hosted) version often comes with feature limitations (e.g. multi-tenant support, integrations, or observability e.g. missing audit logs etc.). How has your experience been with this??An opinion from experts who built a similar self-hosted setup would therefore be very interesting :)",

        "author": "octolang_miseML",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I’m an ML Engineer working in a team where ML is new, and I’m collaborating with data engineers who are integrating model predictions into our data warehouse (DWH) for the first time.We have a traditional DWH setup with raw, staging, source core, analytics core, and reporting layers. The analytics core is where different data sources are joined and modeled before being exposed to reporting.Our project involves two text classification models that predict two kinds of categories based on article text and metadata. These articles are often edited, and we might need to track both article versions and historical model predictions, besides of course saving the latest predictions. The predictions are ultimately needed in the reporting layer.The data team proposed this workflow:1.Add a new reporting-ml layer to stage model-ready inputs.2.Run ML models on that data.3.Send predictions back into the raw layer, allowing them to flow up through staging, source core, and analytics core, so that versioning and lineage are handled by the existing DWH logic.This feels odd to me — pushing derived data (ML predictions) into the raw layer breaks the idea of it being “raw” external data. It also seems like unnecessary overhead to send predictions through all the layers just to reach reporting. Moreover, the suggestion seems to break the unidirectional flow of the current architecture. Finally, I feel some of these things like prediction versioning could or should be handled by a feature store or similar. Is this a good approach? What are the best practices for integrating ML predictions into traditional data warehouse architectures — especially when you need versioning and auditability?Would love advice or examples from folks who’ve done this.",

So, what I am thinking is creating a \"gold\" layer table with a stable schema according to what we need for analytics then add an ETL job that converts from raw to \"gold\" (quotes because I don't necessarily to go full medallion)This way, when the source schema changes, we only need to update the ETL job rather than every analytics report.

Each Lambda generates a CSV file based on its specific logic.Sometimes, the CSVs produced by these different Lambdas have data quality issues – things like missing columns, unexpected NaN values, incorrect data types, etc.Before storing the data into DynamoDB, I need a process to:1. Gather the CSV outputs from all the different Lambdas.2. Check each CSV against predefined quality standards (correct schema, no forbidden NaN, etc.).3. Only process and store the data from CSVs that meet the quality standards. Discard or flag data from invalid CSVs.4. Load the cleaned, valid data into DynamoDB. This is a side project, so minimizing AWS costs is crucial. Looking for the most budget-friendly approach. Furthermore, the entire project is in Python, so Python-based solutions are ideal. Environment is AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB).**What's the simplest and most cost-effective AWS architecture/pattern to achieve this?**I've considered a few ideas, like maybe having all Lambdas dump CSVs into an S3 bucket and then triggering *another* central Lambda to do the validation and DynamoDB loading, but I'm unsure if that's the best way.Looking for recommendations on services (maybe S3 events, SQS, Step Functions, another Lambda?) and best practices for handling this kind of data validation pipeline on a tight budget.Thanks in advance for your help! :)",

Or do I really just need to set up a bunch of data factory or airbyte jobs to replicate/sync the source down to the dbt target?Also, I realize azure sql is not really a columnar storage warehouse platform, this is not TB or barely even GB of data though, so it will probably be alright if we're mindful of writing good code. And if we needed to move to azure postgres we could, if we had a way to deal simply with getting the source replicated out to somewhere I can run dbt, meaning either cross-database queries, or to a database that allows running DDL statements.Open to all ideas and feedback here, it's been a pain to go one by one through all the various azure/ms sql replication services and find that none of them really solves this problem at all.Edit - data factory may be the way? Trying to think about how to potentially parameterize something like this docs page is doing so I dint need a copy activity for all 140 or so tables that all need maintained manually. Some will be ok as full replacements, others will need incremental to stay performant. I’m just woefully inexperienced with data factory for which I have no excuse [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/tutorial-incremental-copy-portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/tutorial-incremental-copy-portal)",

Currently, data validation is a manual process: we review each product individually for logical inconsistencies. For example, if the text attribute \"ingredient declaration\" contains animal rennet, the “vegetarian” multiple choice attribute shouldn’t be “yes.”We estimate there are around 200 of these logical rules to check per product. I’m looking for a way to automate this: ideally, a team member clicks a button in the PIM, which sends all product data (CSV format) to another system that runs the checks. Any non-compliant data points would then be compiled and emailed to our team inbox.Exporting the data via button click is already possible. Automating the validation and sending a report is where I’m stuck. I’ve looked into it and ended up with Power Automate (we have a license) as a viable candidate, but the learning curve seems quite steep.Has anyone tackled a similar challenge, or do you have tips or tools that worked for you?

It recursively flattens the JSON so you can reference any nested field like you would a table.[UI to call remotelookup for a given field.

Also, what would the consequences of not hiding API keys be and will the rest of the code still be visible to people I share it with?Edit: thank you for all the comments everyone—they’ve been very helpful and eye opening. As an addendum, here’s my plan to address all the security concerns that have been brought up:(First, though, I’ve already revoked/made new API keys and haven’t committed them to GitHub, so please don’t worry about that anymore.)1. I think I’m going to go with GitHub secrets as the most simple way to still have the page functional and secure on pages to share with potential co-ops. Alternatively, I’m going to look into Netlify, which a lot of people have recommended as a simple solution. 2. After that’s done, I’m going to create an alternate version where I use PHPmyAdmin to store the keys and then retrieve them with PHP to showcase doing both (that’s the plan anyways). I’ve avoided PHP since I don’t really understand servers and hosting (haven’t had a class on that yet). Like I don’t know how to make PHP work outside my XAMPP htdocs folder, and it won’t be functional for people I share with (to my knowledge).As always, any additional advice would be appreciated, especially if there’s anything wrong with my intended approaches",

I slacked off, build horrible projects when I did work, and didn’t progress far. I’ve been unemployed for two months and never got consistent with my android education until last week. I’ve been hearing nothing but doom and gloom about the job market and my own stupidity made everything way worse.

        "title": "Can't really understand the benefits of object oriented programming compared to procedural approach...",
        "author": "travel_through_r",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi! I'm new here, so sorry in advance if I broke some rule.Anyway... During high school, I learned procedural programming (C++), basics of data structures, computer architecture... and as a result, I think I've become somewhat skilled in solving algorithmic tasks.Now at university, I started with object oriented programming (mostly C++ again) and I think that I understand all the basics (classes and objects, constructors/destructors, fields/methods, inheritance...) while all my professors swear that this approach is far better than procedural programming which I used to do (they mostly cite code reusability and security as reason why).The problem is that, even though I already did dozens of, mostly small sized, object oriented programs so far, I still don't see any benefits of it. In fact, it would be easier to me to just make procedural programs while not having to think about object oriented decomposition and stuff like that. Also, so far I haven't see any reason to use inheritance/polymorphism.The \"biggest\" project I did until now is assembler that reads contents of a file with assembly commands and translates it to binary code (I created classes Assembler, SymbolTable, Command... but I could have maybe even easier achieve the same result with procedural approach by simply making structures and global functions that work with instances of those structures).So, my question is: **can someone explain me in simple terms what are the benefits of object oriented programming and when should I use it?**To potentially make things easier to explain and better understand the differences, I even made a small example of a program done with both approaches.So, lets say, you need to create a program \"ObjectParser\" where user can choose to parse and save input strings with some predefined form (every string represents one object and its attributes) or to access already parsed one.Now, let's compare the two paradigms:**1. Procedural:**\\- First you would need to define some custom structure to represent object: struct Object { // fields }\\- Since global variables are considered a bad practice, in main method you should create a map to store parsed objects: std::map objects;\\- Then you should create one function to parse a string from a file (user enters name of a file) and one to access an attribute of a saved object (user provides name of the object and name of the attribute) void parseString(std::map& objects, std::string filename) { // parsing and storing the string } std::string getValue(std::map& objects, std::string object_name, std::string attribute_name) { // retrieving the stored object's attribute }\\* Notice that you need to pass the map to function since it's not a global object\\- Then you write the rest of the main method to get user input in a loop (user chooses to either parse new or retrieve saved object)**2. Object oriented**\\- First you would create a class called Parser and inside the private section of that class define structure or class called Object (you can also define this class outside, but since we will only be using it inside Parser class it makes sense that it's the integral part of it).One of the private fields would be a map of objects and it will have two public methods, one for parsing a new string and one to retrieve an attribute of already saved one. class Parser { public: void parseString(std::string filename) { // parsing and storing the string } std::string getValue(std::string object_name, std::string attribute_name) { // retrieving the stored object's attribute } private: struct Object { // fields Object(...) { // Object constructor body } } std::map objects; }\\* Notice that we use default \"empty\" constructor since the custom one is not needed in this case.\\- Then you need to create a main method which will instantiate the Parser and use than instance to parse strings or retrieve attributes after getting user input the same way as in the procedural example.**Discussing the example:**Correct me if I wrong, but I think that both of these would work and it's how you usually make procedural and object oriented programs respectively.Now, except for the fact that in the first example you need to pass the map as an argument (which is only a slight inconvenience) I don't see why the second approach is better, **so if it's easier for you to explain it by using this example or modified version of it, feel free to do it.****IMPORTANT**: This is not, by any means, an attempt to belittle object oriented programming or to say that other paradigms are superior. I'm still a beginner, who is trying to grasp its benefits (probably because I'm yet to make any large scale application).Thanks in advance!**Edit**: Ok, as some of you pointed out, even in my \"procedural\" example I'm using std::string and std::map (internally implemented in OOP manner), so both examples are actually object oriented. For the sake of the argument, lets say that instead of std::string I use an array of characters while when it comes to std::map it's an instance of another custom struct and a bunch of functions to modify it (now when I think about it, combining all this into a logical unit \"map\" is an argument in favor of OOP by itself).",

Literally have written hundreds of pages of IT documentation, guides, scripts, etc. Documenting literally everything I do and writing automation to do things easier.My CTO said that the head of dev needed my help with something and I was told that she noticed the way that I document and script and needed my cross-functional knowledge for something that our application (that we sell to clients) does with good documentation and validation.Long story short, she needed a JSON schema so they could make JSON files for something the application does that integrates with IT systems our clients use. Something to define all of the configurations possible and enumerate all the values for each property so that the configuration could be validated by our software's automation. (Most devs know very little about IT infrastructure, so my cross-functional knowledge was know enough of both worlds to be able to make something sensible.)It's such a small thing, but she assigned a task in their dev tracker and I did a PR into a live software project for a company that I work for the first time in my life and even though I'm not a dev (yet!) it's still made me feel like in a small part I'm almost reached that thing that I've literally dreamed of doing for 35 years.I didn't have anyone else to share this with, so I hope you don't mind me sharing the story here.",

From their other rules, it seemed to potentially imply that they only wanted one window/tab open, so I went into this test with no resources.Suffice it to say, it didn't go so well. It was in JavaScript, which I was learning at the time, and the most important question on the test relied heavily on JavaScript string methods, which I have never memorized (even Python or Java string methods, I'll generally look up).So my question: Does knowing string methods off the top of your head indicate that you are a good programmer? Since you have had so much experience programming that it's trivial to remember and use them? I figure that in the real world, methods, libraries, etc., can always be looked up, so I don't typically set aside storage space in my brain to remember all of them.

        "content": "I started my programming journey almost four years ago when I was 18, with no background in computers. I began with HTML, basic CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. Later, I discovered Laravel, a PHP framework, and started working on backend development. Over time, I became skilled in Laravel and really enjoyed building applications.As I grew, I realized that I needed a deeper understanding of PHP itself, so I took the time to learn PHP as well. I ended up creating the backend for many mobile applications and worked on complex projects. At that time, I was working at a service-based company, so I had to work on whatever came my way. That’s how I also ended up learning Node.js.You could say I’m a backend developer who can work with a variety of frameworks like Laravel, Livewire, CakePHP, and Node.js.Currently, I’m working at a fintech, product-based company. But here’s the funny part — even after four years of experience, I still feel like something is missing. I’m not sure what to learn next to truly grow. I've never done LeetCode problems, but I’m very good at solving real-world, complex problems that arise during application development.I also have a basic understanding of low-level languages like C++. But now I’m at a crossroads. Sometimes I feel like I should improve my JavaScript skills and learn React. Other times, I feel drawn toward AI and want to explore how to get better at that.There’s a lot of confusion in my mind right now.I’m 22, and I still love learning and building new things. I genuinely enjoy creating. But I’m unsure what to learn next — something that will help me grow both financially and technically, and truly make me better.Can you guys please give me some good advice ?",

It may not use the latest tools, but I’ve heard it actually teaches how to think like a programmer and builds real logic skills.Once I finish it, I plan to take the University of Helsinki’s Java MOOC. Again, sticking to fundamentals and learning the core ideas, not just trendy frameworks.For context, I’m not naturally a math person either—I’m teaching myself beginning college algebra right now. That’s less about going old-school and more because I never had a college education, so I’m starting from scratch across the board.So, does this sound like a solid strategy?

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I was a math/CS major in college, and afterwards worked for two years as a software engineer (in Java/SQL). I then switched careers and spent the next 25 years successfully doing something completely unrelated, writing code only extremely occasionally in essentially \"toy\" environments (e.g., simple Basic code in Excel to automate some processes). In the meantime, I sort of missed \"real\" coding, but not enough to switch back careers, and I completely missed all the developments that happened during those 25 years, in terms of tooling, frameworks, etc. Back when I was coding, there was no GitHub, Stack Overflow, Golang, React, cloud, Kubernetes, Microservices, etc., and even Python wasn't really a thing (it existed, but almost nobody was using it seriously in production). I now have an idea for an exciting (and fairly complex) project, and enough time and flexibility (and fire in the belly) to build it myself - at least the initial version to see if the idea has legs before involving other people. Haven't had such an itch to code in 25 years :) So my question is - what is the fastest and most efficient way to learn the modern \"developer stack\" and current frameworks, both to start building quickly and at the same time make sure that whatever I do is consistent with modern best practices and available frameworks? The project will involve a big database on the backend, with a Web client on the frontend, and whatever is available through the Web client would also need to be available via an API. For the initial version, of course I don't need it to support many requests at the same time, but I do want to architect it in a way that it could potentially support a huge number of concurrent requests/be essentially infinitely scalable. I'm not sure where to start \"catching up\" on the entire stack - from tools like Cursor and GitHub to Web frameworks like React to backend stuff - and I am also a bit worried that there are things \"I don't know that I don't know\" (with the things I mentioned, at least I know they exist and roughly understand what they do, but I am worried about \"blind spots\" I may have). There is of course a huge amount of material online, but most of what I found is either super specific and assumes a lot of background knowledge about that particular technology, OR the opposite, it assumes no knowledge of programming at all, and starts out with \"for\" loops and such and moves painfully slowly. I would very much appreciate any suggestions on the above (or any parts of the above) that would help me catch up quickly (obviously not to the expert level on any of these, but to a \"workable\" one) and start building. Thank you so much!",

The idea is to create a simple but useful tool that helps track and plan chess study sessions.Here’s what I’m thinking it could include:* Logging how much time you spend training and breaking it down by category (like tactics, openings, endgames, etc.)* Weekly planning (customizable by category or phase)* Personal notes for each session* Stats over time (weekly/monthly) with charts* Daily reminders and puzzles based on what you’ve been training* The option to export all your data to CSV or ExcelI’m still pretty new to all this, and I don’t really know everything that goes into building an app like this, and I'm not sure what would be the best language or tools to use—especially for building the UI, storing the data, and maybe even connecting it to platforms like Lichess or [Chess.com](http://Chess.com) in the future.So my question is: **What does it actually take to build a desktop app like this? What programming languages, tools, or technologies would you recommend? And where should I start if I want to learn how to build it from scratch?**",

During that time, I completely lost touch with coding and now barely remember anything.Despite that, working in tech as a software developer has always been a dream. I sometimes doubt if I’m smart enough, but I’m willing to give it everything I’ve got.I don’t plan to go the traditional college route. I believe real skills and practical projects matter more than degrees today. So, I’m choosing the self-taught path.My question is:Is it truly possible to become a front-end developer through self-learning and land an internship or junior role within a year if I build a few good projects?Would love to hear from anyone who’s done it or is on the same journey.",

Even a simple tic tac toe game it's difficult and I can't understand why.In the past, when I didn't understand something I always relied on YT videos and tutorials, but for Java I can't find any of that.

The issue is that throughout the whole semester we only covered the mathematics side of functional declarative programming however we never had any practice. I simply cannot wrap my head around the syntax of declarative programming since what I have been learning is imperative. Everywhere i look online shows basic examples of it like \"lst = \\[x\\*2 for x in lst\\]\" and there are no examples of more complex code, e.g. nested loops or branching. On top of this, everywhere that mentions declarative programming they all say that you should not update values throughout the lifespan of the program but that is quite literally impossible. I have spoken to my teacher multiple times and joined several support sessions but i still have no clue how to program declaratively. I understand that i need to \"say what result i want, not how to get to it\" but you still write code in a specific syntax which was simply not exposed to us at a high enough lvl to be able to go and write a small program.

I just can't ever remember code syntax and structure. Going from C++ to C# was especialy frustrating. I can't tell you how many times I wrote Console.PrintLine() instead of Console.WriteLine(). I constantly have to have a reference open on my computer to help me remember syntax. Here's an example: Lets say I'm building a class. I would need to have something like this open to help me remember syntax: public class MediaItem { // Properties common to all media items public string Title { get; set; } public int PublicationYear { get; set; } // Constructor for the base class public MediaItem(string title, int publicationYear) { Title = title; PublicationYear = publicationYear; Console.WriteLine(\"MediaItem constructor called.\"); } // A virtual method that can be overridden by derived classes public virtual void DisplayInfo() { Console.WriteLine($\"Title: {Title}\"); Console.WriteLine($\"Publication Year: {PublicationYear}\"); }I would need to have this open in OneNote so I can reference because my memory is so terrible.

I’ve fully completed NeetCode 150 and am now revisiting it by doing 2 problems a day until I reach mastery.To be honest, my previous work experience isn’t something I can highlight strongly on a resume. So now I’m focused on **building my profile**:* Developing and hosting full-stack projects* Actively contributing to open-source (recently made a contribution to a Flask-based issue)* Improving my GitHub profile with solid commits, PRs, and documentation* Planning to learn AI/ML fundamentals as a long-term goalMy goal is to **land a high-paying backend or full-stack role**, ideally at a top company. I’m ready to put in 8–10 hours of focused work, 6 days a week.If you've been in a similar position or have advice on project ideas, profile-building strategies, or job search tips — I’d really appreciate the help!",

I have made solid progress and feel confident in my luau skills, however It really does not matter much as Luau is one of the easiest programming languages, and even then I sometimes struggle with it, looking at other more advanced individuals code or talk about coding makes me feel like that's not the field for me, I mean I admire them a lot and would really like get on their levels but it also makes me feel really stupid... I might be wrong tho, maybe this is like saying an English speaker can't be fluent in french just cause he gets confused hearing people speak french , although he did not even bother learning the language first(I think that's a decent analogy lol) so if you are someone really into programming, did it feel the same getting into programming?",

One from the Syrian Virtual University (SVU), which is online but officially recognized in some parts of Europe (e.g. Anabin in Germany).2. Another from University of the People (UoPeople), which recently gained WASC regional accreditation in the U.S.Both are affordable and online-based, but I'm aware that they're not high-ranked or traditionally prestigious.\\*\\*My question is:\\*\\* If I work hard to build a strong portfolio, gain real experience through freelance work, internships, competitions, or open-source contributions — can this realistically compensate for the perceived weakness of these degrees in the job market?Also, will these degrees (plus strong experience) be enough to help with international job opportunities or even immigration in the tech field?I’m open to working at small/medium or large companies. I'm just trying to understand what is realistically possible and what’s not.Any insights from those who've worked in the industry or hired developers would mean a lot.Thanks in advance!",

        "author": "ProudProgress8085",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey, guys! I'm planning to self-study computer science from scratch with the goal of reaching a job-ready (junior-to-mid level) skillset. My focus is on mastering both core CS concepts and practical skills. I want a clear, efficient roadmap that covers fundamental topics, hands-on coding, and system design — essentially the skills expected in a CS job, even if I don't plan to apply for one. Here's my current plan: 1. Core CS Fundamentals: Study algorithms, data structures, operating systems, networks, databases, and computer architecture. 2. Programming Proficiency: Deeply learn one or two programming languages (considering Python and JavaScript/TypeScript). 3. Project Development: Build real-world applications (web and backend) and contribute to open-source projects. 4. System Design: Learn scalable architecture principles, database management, and cloud deployment. I'll use a mix of free online courses (like CS50, MIT OCW, The Odin Project, and freeCodeCamp) alongside other online resources. ### My Questions:- Is this roadmap practical? What changes or additions would you recommend?- What are the best, up-to-date resources for self-learning computer science (e.g., YouTube channels, blogs, creators, platforms)?- Given the current trends of vibe coding, what can self-learners prioritize or skip?- Any vibe coding tools to recommend?- What common mistakes should self-learners in CS avoid?I'd love to hear from anyone who has successfully self-studied CS or has experience in the field. Thanks in advance!",

Looking at job security, it seems that .NET is a pretty good gamble.So for those of you working in the field:* What back-end tools, frameworks, or skills should I be learning alongside .NET to be job-ready?

After using PyInstaller Extractor, I was left with a folder containing several .pyc files and a .pyz subfolder containing an extensive Python directory. I’m pretty sure I found the specific .pyc file that does what I’m looking for, but there are a lot of additional .pyc files in that directory that I’m struggling to understand the purpose of. The folder that contained the .pyc files and the .pyz directory looks like it mostly has initialization and compatibility code snippets, (the application references several .pyd and .dll files so I assume this is mostly related to compatibility between Python code and a windows executable file) but I’m not sure I understand why the meat and potatoes are all in a subfolder.",

        "content": "Quick context: I’m 20, studying computer engineering (9th semester), and I’ve been working at the same company for two years. I started in Big Data (a bit over a year), then moved to RPA (around 8 months — I really liked it), and now I’m doing full stack (been at it for 5 months). I’ve done most of it relying heavily on AI tools, and honestly, I don’t know how I’ve managed without a strong foundation in programming and other basics.I don’t feel super comfortable with that — kind of mediocre, to be honest. The university covers stuff very superficially, and I haven’t had time to go deeper on my own. I’d really like to focus on learning to code properly and choosing a clear path (I finish my degree in about 8 months, so I think that’s enough time to get on track). The thing is, I’m not sure if I should stick with full stack (since I already have experience), go into cybersecurity (which I really like — especially applied to space systems), or think long term about something like aerospace engineering.Here’s what’s been going through my head:Should I stick to what I’m already doing (full stack), even if it doesn’t excite me?Should I go all-in on what I love, even if I have zero experience in it?Is it normal to feel like an impostor or just “bad” at this when you're relying so much on AI to get by?How did you figure out what to specialize in?Also, I’m thinking about moving out, but I’m earning only 2 million COP (~$500), and my family keeps telling me to wait until I graduate. I feel this pressure to make moves now, but I don’t want to mess things up either.Any advice, thoughts, similar experiences — all are welcome!",

It's not normal and I think it is breaking our industry.I was talking to a family member who was a developer in in 90s, and he said any time he needed a job he would apply to 5 roles and get at least one job offer. Not necessarily an amazing offer in his words, but something. In the 2000s, he said it was a bit more competitive, but could land an offer for every 10 applications. Even in 2015, I found I could apply to 20 or 30 jobs and be relatively confident in getting an offer. Assuming I wasn't stretching myself, most jobs I was applied for I would get an interview for, even if we determined it wasn't a good fit.But now I am regularly seeing people say you need to submit 100s to 1000s of applications to get a job. & applying to 100 jobs without getting past the screener.I feel like the ladder has been pulled up & the hiring process has become fully kafkaesque. its a regular refrain here now that you can be the best applicant for the role and be filtered out by the ATS, it depends on your luck. this system seems designed to abuse people seeking work rather than find the best applicant. For those of us who can take advantage of our professional networks, we might still find we only need to have 20 or 30 conversations with people to land our next role. Since we can get referrals or speak directly to hiring managers out of band.But every publicly posted job getting +1000 applicants. If things continue at this rate we will soon see people saying we will need 10,000 or 100,000 job applications submitted in order to land a role. I don't know what the solution is but this just doesn't make sense and seems completely awful. turning the job market into a casino isn't helping employees or employers.",

Yesterday, the startup that had the culture and the work I’ve always dreamed about working at rejected me. The other one ghosted me. Why? Not because I was bad, or because I failed the interview. They just wanted someone with more experience on their stack. All those interview requests went the fuck away. I think that stung more than anything. I put in the work, so much work. I didn’t even fail through any fault of my own. I don’t know what I’m going to do. I really really don’t. Since that, I think I’ve actually applied to 145 apps in the past 2 days.

I said, “That works, I’m looking for something above $150K.” I think this was my first mistake, more on that later.I am a person with low self esteem(or serious imposter syndrome) and when I say I nailed all 8 rounds, I really must believe that. The recruiter followed up the day after 8th round saying team is interested in extending an offer. Then on compensation expectations the recruiter said, “You mentioned $150K earlier.” I clarified that I was targeting the upper end based on my fit and experience. They responded with, “So $180K?” and I just said yes. It felt a bit like putting words in my mouth.Next day, I got an email saying that I have to wait for the offer decision as they are interviewing other candidates. Haven’t heard back since. I don’t think I did anything fundamentally wrong or if I should have regrets but curious what others think.Edit: Just to clarify, in my mind I thought that’s how negotiations work.

        "content": "The market is tough for inexperienced folks. That is clear. However, I can’t help but notice how many people are not really doing what it takes, even in good market, to secure a decent job (ignore 2021-2022, those were anomalously good years, and likely won’t happen again in the near future).What I’ve seen:1. Not searching for internships the summer/fall *before* the summer you want to intern. I literally had someone ask me IRL a few days ago, about my company’s intern program that literally starts next week…. They were focusing on schoolwork apparently in their fall semester , and started looking in the spring.2. Not applying for new grad roles in the same timeline as above. Why did you wait to graduate before you seriously started the job search? 3. Not having projects on your resume (assuming no work xp) because you haven’t taken the right classes yet or some other excuse. Seriously?4. Applying to like 100 roles online, and thinking there’s enough. I went to a top target, and I sent over 1000 apps, attended so many in-person and virtual events, cold DMed people on LinkedIn for informational interviews starting my freshman year. I’m seeing folks who don’t have the benefit of a target school name literally doing less.5. Missing scheduled calls, show up late, not do basic stuff. I had a student schedule an info interview with me, no show, apologize, reschedule, and no show again. I’ve had others who had reached out for a coffee chat, not even review my LinkedIn profile and ask questions like where I worked before. Seriously?6. Can’t code your way out of a box. Yes, a wild amount of folks can’t implement something like a basic binary search.7. Cheat on interviews with AI. It’s so common.8. Not have basic knowledge/understanding (for specific roles). You’d be surprised how many candidates in AI/ML literally don’t know the difference between inference and training, or can’t even half-explain the bias-variance trade-off problem.Do the basic stuff right, and you’re already ahead of 95% of candidates.",

        "author": "megariffs",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "If you work at a company that uses old tech stacks and processes, try not to stay at that company for too long (unless they are transitioning to using a newer tech stack and processes) because when it's time to work at another company, your lack of experience in newer tech and processes may come back and bite you. They're good to gain professional experience but after a couple of years, you should try and find another job that's more in line with what industry is going towardsWhen I graduated from college in 2016, my first job was a full-stack developer at a company I was working at while I was in college doing completely different work. I became their first in-house developer after I developed their Intranet site (as an internship project for my university) and redesigned their one of their customer referral forms. Their tech stack at the time was [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Forms for their customer portal and VB6 for the application that their employees used.After getting an opportunity to work at a startup that my former boss help start in 2022, I quit my then current job to work there. Less than a year later, I was let go due to \"inexperience\" even though I've done all my tasks on time, quickly learned React (the company initially was using [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Forms as a proof of concept before switching to React and [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core Web API), and I was receiving good reviews from my manager a month earlier. I believe I was scapegoated because the team itself was under performing, but I digress. With that being said, I learned quite a bit before I was let go. My first employer never used GitHub/Azure/etc, so I was unfamiliar with committing code, branch concepts, creating a PR, etc. I was also unfamiliar with newer [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) concepts like Dependency Injections, Program.cs, Middleware, etc that were in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core. Working at the startup exposed me to all of that.Luckily, I was able to find another job (which paid even more money) in less than 3 months. It was another company that used [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Forms for one of their applications and a mixture of [VB.NET/VB6](http://VB.NET/VB6) for another application. Fast forward to last month (April 3rd 2025), my position was eliminated. Therefore, I got laid off due to the company restructuring after having a bad financial outcome from the previous year. This time around, I wasn't let go due to performance. In fact, they emphatically praised me for being a great developer. My boss's boss emailed me afterwards to let me know that I can use him as a reference for another job and he'll reach out to contacts to see if anyone of them are looking for a developer to hire.Within the last several weeks, I was able to get an interview at 3 companies (2 contract jobs and one direct to hire). This week, I made it to the second round of one company before they decided to go in another direction. They told my recruiter that my in-person interview was excellent but another candidate they interviewed had more experience, so they decided to go with the other candidate. This time around, the companies I worked at previously never used automated testing, Microservices, CI/CD pipelines, service bus technology, etc. I felt like my lack of experience using those concepts came back and bit me.Regarding the two other companies, I did make it to the third round of the direct to hire job, but I'm afraid that my lack of experience using .NET based service bus tech and potentially other tech may get in the way of me landing this job. I'm going to spending the entire week brushing up on those concepts before my final interview. I did get a job offer from the first company I interviewed at, but I'm hesitant to work there because it's only 3 month contract, it's a long commute to another state (40-45 min drive), and they want me to use React. I haven't used React in over a year.TLDR; Don't be like me and stick around at a company for too long that uses old tech stacks and processes or not spending enough time to learn newer tech. Granted, I tried to do that at times, but I have a newborn now. Also, my partner can be quite needy and wants to spend a lot of time with me. We've got into arguments in the past over me wanting to spend time after work to work on projects to develop new skills.Edit: Grammar",

I still have no idea what they’re asking applicants to do. He does the actual assessment, comes out and says he got 1/2 of one question done (there were two), and it had the same level of convolution and indecipherability. What the hell is up with that? Are we testing SWE interns ability to decipher cryptic messaging now? He has a legit disability, but there were no accommodations for that either. Edit: for those asking, I don’t remember the question details, this happened a few weeks ago but I’ve been stewing since and finally decided to post/rant to get it off my chest.

I am the best at building front ends, but apparently I'm not the best at figuring out wordle edge cases while people with half my experience stare me.If you are in college for CS, I cannot tell you strongly enough to change your major to business. You're going to put in thousands of applications even when you have a decade of experience and you will have to go through endless interview rounds. Even when you are in demand, you will still need to jump through these endless hoops where people ask you completely useless facts and then smirk at you when you don't figure out the specific edge cases in the worldle app the made you code.Please do not respond to this by saying \"well that's just because it takes 5 interviews to tell whose a good software engineer.\" It doesn't. Software engineering is like any other profession, we do not need these endless tests.I feel like I am going crazy and seriously thinking about leaving the industry for one with an actual sane interview process.

I can do sliding windows and depth first searches off the cuff. I'm exhausted because unlike in the first seven years of my career, people have started to have 5 interviews on average, *including* coding tests. If everybody had reasonable hiring processes *like they used to* I would not be as angry even if I were failing them, because at least then I could move on quickly.Edit 2: I am not asking to do away with coding interviews. I think they're dumb but people have been complaining about them for a decade so I understand why companies do them. I'm asking to do away with these ridiculous processes that are 5 rounds *on average* and go back to have 1) a screening call 2) an onsite, 3) and then a reference check, a process which ANY REASONABLE COMPANY should be able to evaluate an employee. Sure ask our coding questions in the onsite, but my god. I interview with startups, who fail thirty percent more often then regular businesses. Every single of one of those failing businesses had elaborate hiring processes. Startup failure rates are blazingly high, 30 percent higher than other small businesses, because they do things like these stupid elaborate hiring processes.",

On the other hand, a software engineering job in a company such as AWS or Meta would help me gain practical experience nonetheless",

Wish everyone luck thank you for replying to my rent :red_heart::red_heart:——— original post below ————Sorry for the strong wording. I’m writing this post as I am having a meltdown from a broken refresh token integration of an app and push notifications not working on another app and I can’t take this anymore I don’t feel much joy from coding, got a CS degree and sucked at it but somehow passed and got my bachelor’s.Got into web development and I’m always ok at the basics like css, buttons, the simple stuff But slowly you start working on react apps then mobile apps with react native or flutter. One day I realized I can only build apps from examples, and I never really understood a lot of the concepts and I didn’t have the energy to learn, or the curiosity or the brain capacity evenAlso as the job responsibilities pile up, I realized I’m not the best at communicating or requesting access for resources. It’s common to work with legacy code or clients api without having clear documentation and expected to figure it out. And often being the only developer on a project and not even that good at the tech. I’m stuck at the job because , bills, and really not good at it. A few times I was really close to getting fired but didn’t, I don’t know what to do anymoreOk now my lorezapem has taken effect and I can communicate with my coworkers without crying, I am concluding this post. Im gonna woman up and ask for someone to debug with me I’m so sorry for the rambling.",

I got job with events and drones, Toured the country, did camera work semi professionally using other peoples equipment, went from NYC to LA and everywhere in-between while living in Pittsburgh. (got to work for Disney, amazon-studios, NBA, multiple MLB teams) Took some studio training got certified. and I made money doing it. The problem is, I started working at an amazon warehouse and I've gotten very \"lazy\" at first it was just to pay bills, make ends meet, but then I got benefits, insurance ect, but you're a work horse, you move boxes for 10 hours at a measly 24.35 an hour. It's not sustainable, I do want to go back into film but it's been 2 years later with only a few side gigs worked here and there as a production assistant. (mostly because I haven't pursued anything because of financial hardship and the steady pay is worth more to me than random amounts of 1099 based pay here and there)On a whim, I decided to have Amazon pay me to learn how to drive a truck ( semi-drivers are also needed in film too) and at the time it just seemed to be a good thing to fall back on and I day dreamed about getting to travel again and get paid to do it.That said, I kind of don't want to see myself as a trucker for life ( as funny as an idea that was at the time as a way to get out of back breaking labor)I was from a generation that was always told learn to code ect.... What's going on with that? I have zero interest to be a blue \"collar\" worker, and I need an extra set of skills if working BTS isn't a viable long term career (its not)I just want that desk job and that 80-100k a year. Thought of going into game dev and heard a lot of \"well don't want to do that because it'll beat that passion out of you for gaming\" don't really care about passion projects, I just want to work. Don't mind my vision being shared or not shared, just want to make money. Is coding still in, is tech dead? am I barking up the wrong tree,would it be stupid at nearly 30 to say \"Yeah I could be a game dev if i want.\" or should I look at something else tech related or is tech just too competitive now?No kids, no plan to ever have kids, current gf doesn't want kids.If tech isn't it then i'll probably spend the next few years buying the film equipment I had my eye on for years, building a better pc, learning editing, working PA as often as I can and doing that grind (which trust me it's a grind, some weeks I made 200 dollars other weeks I made 3200) But I would love the comfort of a cozy desk job.

Argued everything and even one time called me weird because he didnt agree with some of my work ethic. He interrupted everyone and would extend scrum by an hour if someone dared to disagree with him. He didnt scream but you could tell he was always on verge to (maybe had a few hr calls in the past). He basically built everything and he is one of those guys who likely will never lose his job because he may be a dick but he gets the job done.

I got my current and first job because I was cheap (my starting pay was far below market rate for SE1 role), and the hiring manager was impressed with a systems programming and os architecture project I had on my resume and my github from one of my classes which was written in C. My job uses a techstack of syncfusion c# winform frontend and an old C backend that was originally written before I was even born.I've been spending my free time upskilling, mostly working with .net core & react, and python as I'd like to get a full stack or backend role with a more modern and common techstack. But problem is, every job I've applied to that uses anything remotely modern hasn't given me any call backs. The only jobs I have heard from are ones that I didn't even apply to that want the same thing as my current job does, a cheap junior that knows C.I'm guessing part of the reason why I'm not getting callbacks is not just because of how bad the market is, but because in a recruiters and hiring manager's mind, why take a chance on someone who currently works with something arachic, when you can just get someone who has actual job experience in what they use. How do I get out of being pigeonholed? I tailor my resume to the job I apply to as best I can, but it's not like I can rewrite the experience section of my resume that shows I deal with winforms and C.",

You can be onboarded directly by the department of defense, either CIA or NSA. They conduct the background checks, etc, everything. The process for a Top Secret clearance with Full Scope Polygraph takes 1-2 years. 2) as per Executive Order 12333, it is illegal to spy on American citizens. You can read it. If you are concerned about the activities of these agencies as they relate to our citizens, all I can say is read it :slightly_smiling_face:3) you don't need to join the military. You can join as civilianNow. Why does this matter? **The IC is starved for tech professionals**.Oh, you started at the NSA and updated your linkedin? You now get 1-3 messages daily by headhunters and also get cold called 2-4 times a day by real people, not robots.So, ok... What's the salary?Think about the department of defense budget. Go look it up if you don't know it. In government, at GS-11, I started at 100k with 5 y exp. Meh, not the best. But I'm actually leaving for Microsoft, still working in the cleared space, with a TC around 250. Microsoft offers +25% base salary (yes, that's right) to people with Top Secret (TS/SCI) with Full Scope Poly (FSP).There are hundreds of contractors that will throw a 150-170 base salary at you like it's nothing. Because, contractors bill the federal gov $500/hr *for a level 1 programmer*. There are signs as I drive to work trying to poach the government employees. Last month I saw a 30k signing bonus sign. The thing is, you probably won't be a 500k TC superstar in 5 years in the IC. You'd have to own your own contacting company. BUT you will always, always, always, have a job. Because the federal government will always have money, and we need more than ever tech experts. Our adversaries aren't slowing down. If you think this is a plug for US gov, it's not. I won't speak to US policy. I just do my job. And I never have to worry about if I find another job later. Unfortunately the federal gov is at a hiring freeze. But feel free to Google \"NSA jobs\". It's not a secret thing. It's just little known.",

        "content": "I've been working as a Software Engineer for a little over 3 years now, and I want to emphasize that various AI tools have been incredibly beneficial for my overall productivity and speed in which I can complete tasks.However, at least in my position, I've noticed management becoming increasingly aware of how much faster AI can make my colleagues and I work. As a result, it seems like the amount of work expected to be completed has sharply increased—and ironically enough—the job has gotten more stressful.I used to be assigned several stories per sprint, and could finish them with ample time, all while learning something too. However recently it has felt like since management knows about how AI is, they load us up on our sprints, where I'm getting double the amount of tickets as I was before, and even junior developers are leading entire initiatives of our project, and they too have voiced feelings of intense pressure.As a result of this, I'm starting to feel like my love of programming and problem-solving is dwindling. Each ticket I hardly have the time to truly think about solutions and research and learn, because I'm expected to use AI to grind out the solution and move onto the next. This has made me feel like I'm burning out a bit, because instead of learning things I feel more like a prompt engineer at most and just gluing solutions together and moving onto the next ticket, with little time for anything else because the work volume has drastically increased.Was wondering if anyone else has had feelings similar to this? Any advice? Would be greatly appreciated, thanks!",

        "content": "For a long time, I’ve been obsessed with prestige and what people think of me. Only recently have I started to realize that this focus has been damaging.Back in college, I struggled to land strong internships. When people asked where I interned, I’d feel insecure.This past new grad job hunt season was different. I did extremely well. But instead of simply feeling proud, I found myself bringing it up in almost every conversation — how many offers I got, how hard the decision was. My close friends pointed out that my conversations shifted away from hobbies and life to career decisions, leveling systems, and growth.When it came time to choose between job offers, I tried everything to make the “right” decision. I asked all my friends and family. I read every blog and polled every possible forum. I was obsessed with finding the most validated, socially acceptable path — the one society would approve of. Obviously it didn’t work. Eventually, I had to ask myself: *Why do I feel the need to share my successes so often? Why is this decision so agonizing?* And I think the honest answer is that I care a lot about how others perceive me.But digging deeper, that desire doesn’t feel purely ego-driven. In tech, **career advancement almost entirely depends on perception.** Recruiters scan for brand names. Managers reward visibility. Friends decide whether you’re worth a referral. Your market worth is defined by what others think, not by what you think you’re worth.That’s why I find myself highlighting my accomplishments and leaning toward prestige. I want to be seen as someone worth helping, worth investing in. I want future recruiters to see my resume and not hesitate. But in the process, I’ve started to value prestige more than my own long-term goals and personal values.Choosing between offers this season was especially hard because they represented opposite sides of this internal conflict — one path aligned with prestige, the other with personal fit.Conventional advice says to “stop caring what people think.” But is that even realistic when almost every system in tech (and the world in general) is based on what others think of you and how you're ranked?",

With benefits and bonus I'm just over 200k but I see all my peers at FAANG with the same YOE getting TC around 300k+. I've chalked up this difference to the stock options I receive being illiquid but even if we hit our goal IPO valuation (likely as we have a billionaire angel investor but it may take years) I'd be barely ahead of them in terms of total pay over the 5+ years of our overall career, while also having taken on far more risk. I'm considering attempting to make the jump into a bigger company to get some more upward growth options. The problem is that I hear the market is super competitive now so I'm not sure if its worth investing the time into getting back into interview shape. I'm also worried about burnout, since I am fully remote here and usually only go in-office twice a week for food. Big companies seem to be hard pushing RTO and I would miss being able to take work-cations around the world.With all that being said, do you guys think its the right career move to make the jump? I've been here since graduating almost 5 years ago and am starting to feel a bit stagnant. It's like golden handcuffs except instead of good TC the carrot is just a relaxed schedule and remote option which seems to be dwindling. Those of you who have made the transition from startups to big tech, was it difficult to get interviews and offers? Did you think it was the right move career-wise?",

        "content": "***Disclaimer: This post is not about me but a friend of mine. That nevertheless doesn't invalidate the seriousness of the situation. There’s a TL;DR at the end if you need it.***I've been working as a software engineer at my current company for about 2 years. From the very beginning, I disclosed that I have SLE lupus (an autoimmune condition), which means I’m constantly on anticoagulant medication. I also have a physical disability that makes daily commuting difficult.Thankfully, things were manageable for a long time—my role allowed for hybrid work, with some days in-office and others WFH. That balance helped me stay productive and committed despite my health challenges.But everything started shifting this year.The company is preparing to go public and has been carrying out silent layoffs—mostly through performance improvement plans (PIPs). WFH flexibility has been dialed back, and there's increasing pressure to be in-office regularly. I complied with the new expectations despite the strain, kept putting in the hours, met all deadlines, and consistently received positive feedback.However, over the past couple of weeks, my health has taken a serious turn. I’ve developed gangrene in my left index finger—there’s a chance I could lose it, or even more fingers if it spreads. I was terrified to ask for leave, hoping things would heal. I kept working—coding one-handed with my right hand—just to avoid raising red flags.Then two days ago, I was blindsided.My manager scheduled a recorded meeting and placed me on a PIP, claiming I had negative feedback from past team leads. This was shocking, since one of those leads had publicly praised my work before, even in front of my current manager. After the meeting, my manager called me privately, off the record. He implied that he had no real control over the situation and gently suggested I start looking for a new role while going through the PIP.So here I am—on a one-month PIP, with a two-month notice period after that if things don’t improve.And now my health is at a breaking point. I need time off, but I can’t afford to lose this job. My medical expenses are piling up fast. If I lose this income, I’ll probably have to leave my apartment and move back in with my parents, who are already under financial strain.I need advice. Please.* Should I try explaining the full extent of my condition to HR or management again and ask to pause the PIP or adjust expectations?* Should I ask for a quiet exit now with some kind of severance instead of going through a likely-failed PIP?* Has anyone faced something similar—being disabled and seriously ill while also under pressure to perform or leave?Please don’t just say “prioritize your health and quit”—I wish I could, but I don’t have that privilege. I'm trying to survive, not just live. Any practical advice or shared experiences would really mean a lot right now.**TL;DR:** **Software engineer with lupus + physical disability. Was managing well with hybrid work until company began silent layoffs via PIPs. Now being forced into WFO, health has worsened (developed gangrene in hand), but afraid to take leave. Just put on a PIP despite positive past feedback. Manager privately suggested I start job hunting. Can't afford to lose job due to high medical costs. Looking for advice on whether to fight the PIP, talk to HR, or ask for severance.**",

        "content": "So here’s a bit of context. I graduated in 2017 with a degree in Civil Engineering. A couple years later I decided to switch careers, so I went back to school to study Computer Science. A bunch of my credits were transferred, so I finished the CS degree in 3 semesters with a 4.0 GPA and graduated in 2020. Since then… nothing. I’ve been applying for dev jobs ever since but haven’t been able to land a single proper interview. I didn’t do any internships because I didn’t know the job market would be this bad which I regret right now. I couldn’t afford to sit around waiting, so I’ve been working full-time in sales to pay the bills which makes it a bit harder for me since I don’t have a lot of free time to focus on job hunting and building projects.That said, I didn’t give up on tech. I’ve been learning on my own, building personal projects whenever I have a bit of free time, and I’ve also worked with a small agency on a project basis (not full-time) since late 2023.At this point I’m honestly burnt out and confused. Is it my resume? My background? Is the market just that bad? I’d really appreciate any advice or feedback, especially from anyone who broke in after a similar detour.",

        "author": "Accipitrim",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi folks, I'm a junior dev currently a year into their first job at a well-known tech company (non-FAANG) in the bay.**((This part is just me ranting so you can just skip to the bottom to read my questions))**I know I should be grateful to have a job in this economy, but I am absolutely miserable at work due to various factors (uninteresting work, long hours, toxic team, micromanaging etc.) and I feel that I've hit the lowest point of my mental and physical health. I've lost at least 15 lbs due to lack of appetite from stress. Everyone in my team works \\~50 hours every week. Maybe these aren't \"crazy\" hours, but I joined the company expecting a regular 40 hour work week, so I was unpleasantly surprised. I used to be of the mindset that I just needed to work my 9-5 and leave, but my manager actually reprimanded me specifically for not working long enough hours and being slow on my tasks only couple months into the job. I'd say this is when I started becoming very unhappy at my job as I became extremely anxious about my work hours and performances afterwards.All of my coworkers are much *much* older than me. And while most people have been pleasant to work with, I have also been thrown under the bus by my manager over a minor issue that was not my fault because one of the senior members of the team took a disliking of me. This happened \\~5 months into the job. I'd say I'm on good terms with everyone now, but this left a very sour taste in my mouth. Also, the vast majority of my team consists of first-gen immigrants who speak to each other in a foreign language that I do not understand at work. This, combined with the fact that I'm the only junior in my team, makes me feel very out of place.I still plan on staying here for at least for a year so that I could keep my sign-on, but I flirt with the idea of quitting without any backup plan if it comes to that, though I likely never will given the state of the economy (alternatively, get hit by a car on the way to work). The pay is on the lower end of the average for the bay area and I also got a rather low annual raise, which has been one of the final straws for me.\\-----------------------------------------------------I know that the biggest issue right now is that the job market for any entry level SWE is very saturated. However, I'm also a bit confused on how to start applying for jobs as someone with a full-time work experience:* Which roles do I even apply for? Should I still be applying to New Grad roles? I've heard that 1 YOE is not much different from New Grad. Based on what I have seen, most job postings have been only for mid to senior level roles. There doesn't seem to be many entry level roles that are posted year round. A lot of generic SWE roles still require 2 to 3+ YOE in the description. Should I still shoot my shot regardless? Or would it just be a waste of time?* Is it okay for my resume to be similar to what I had from college (ie. work experience, college projects, and engineering-related extracurriculars) with just the addition of my work as a full time engineer?* If I switch jobs before my first promotion at the company, would this set me back a year in terms of promotion? But to be honest, I'm not sure if I'll even get promoted in this team since my manger seems to have a bad impression of me.",

Or does it come naturally when a need arises. I know people will learn by seeing these proposals and getting into new code bases like I am now. I’m just curious how the first adopters come across them.",

        "content": "I’m at a pretty stressful crossroads and could really use some guidance. I recently turned 30 and am struggling with the reality that I don’t have professional experience in my field. Most of my work has been tied to school projects, so my portfolio isn’t as strong as I’d like.While I don’t consider myself the best or smartest (sometimes I feel the exact opposite), I’ve always been quick to understand things. I’m good at breaking down complex problems, and I’ve received praise for it my entire life. However, discipline has always been a challenge for me. I’ve managed to get by relying on my intellect while doing far less work than I should have. But recently, I’ve started implementing good routines and becoming productive every day.I’m an international student in the U.S., working toward my master’s in Math with a concentration in Computer Science, and my bachelor’s degree was also in CS. All I need to do to graduate is submit my thesis. The pressure is mounting because my time to stay in the country is running out unless I secure a job soon. I’m actually being forced to start using my OPT (limited work eligibility) time to submit my thesis by December and graduate.I feel overwhelmed trying to figure out how to compete in the job market despite these challenges. For reference, I’m currently near Houston, Texas. So far, I’ve applied to fewer than 50 jobs. Most of the time, I don’t get responses - sometimes I get rejections - but I’ve never had an interview.For those who have been in similar situations - or those who’ve successfully transitioned into a career without much experience - how did you do it? Can I make my school projects look more compelling to employers? Will they even look at them? Do I have a chance?I know that if I’m given an opportunity in a work environment, I’ll reach a high-performance level very quickly. I just don’t know how to show this potential to employers. I also can’t seem to get my resume under two pages.Any advice on networking (which I’ve struggled with as an introvert with few close friends), skill-building, or navigating job searches efficiently would be incredibly helpful.Finally, thank you whoever you are for taking the time to read this. I’m crossing my fingers for something that gives me hope - that I haven’t completely wasted my life and opportunity here. In the meantime, I'm making small victories, like finally maintaining a steady routine of working on my thesis and working on my resume/linkedIn/applying for jobs full-time.",

        "author": "Wonderful_Analyst_50",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I graduated college with a bachelors degree in computer science a while ago and ever since I’ve been living with my parents while doing delivery services like Instacart and uber eats to make money while I try to search for a job as a software engineer. As you can guess I haven’t really gotten anywhere with that. I even attended a software engineering bootcamp last year to try to bolster my resume (may not have been the smartest idea in hindsight but I enjoyed it and met some cool people so I don’t regret it) but still nothing. My family is now trying to push me to apply for a masters program focusing on something like cybersecurity or biotech (which feels a little outside my comfort zone as I wasn’t great at biology) claiming the masters is the final piece I need to make it all come together. Honestly the thought of putting so much more time and money into a field that has had fruitless returns so far gives me a ton of anxiety and I don’t want to come out the other side of it multiple years from now tens of thousands of dollars in debt and be in the same position I’m in now. I was lucky enough that I could get my bachelors degree mostly for free due to my father’s VA benefits but I’d be too old to qualify for that once I get into a masters program so I’d be paying full price this time around. I also burned out pretty hard towards the end of my bachelors (partially due to Covid) and pretty much dragged myself across the finish line so the thought of going back after a few years away is pretty daunting.Ultimately though I know I need to do something and I’m sick and tired of the position I’m in. I feel like I’ve put my life on hold for years trying to start it from the best position possible and I’m at a point where it just doesn’t feel viable anymore. Living with my parents for this long just doing deliveries and job applications every day has made me pretty depressed and I kind of just want to get a regular non-tech job, move out into an apartment with a friend, and figure out my life from there. At the same time though I feel like if a masters degree would genuinely be very useful in the long run, I’m being short sighted and years from now I’d regret not getting it. Especially considering my parents are willing to keep housing me while I go back to school so I’d probably be making my life more difficult by moving out instead, even if it would probably improve my mental health.I do genuinely enjoy coding and would consider myself pretty good at it, but I wouldn’t say I’m passionate about it or anything. I don’t really feel passionate about anything really, I kinda just want to have a good life making comfortable money and not hating my job. When I changed my major to computer science it seemed like a pretty straight shot, I enjoyed it more than my other classes, I was naturally very good at it, and there seemed to be a pretty direct path of internship (check) -> degree (check) -> high paying job (crash and burn). The market crash happened right before I graduated so I found it to be extremely unlucky timing and have pretty much been trying to play catch up ever since.Basically I’m just looking to see if anyone has any thoughts on the usefulness of a masters degree in the current market and if it would be a good use of my time and money or not. Or maybe even if there’s any CS related jobs I could get with my current degree that I may have overlooked so far (I’ve mainly been focusing on full stack development). Any advice is very appreciated.TLDR: I’m wondering if a masters degree is worth the time and money in this current tech market or if there are any other type of CS jobs I could get with my bachelors that are commonly overlooked. Or should I just cut my losses, find a non-tech job, move into an apartment with a friend, and try to figure out my life from there.",

After that, I have 4 years of experience in an IT Consulting firm - my job title said \"Consultant.\" I mostly worked on production support (incident management and bug fixes) for client projects, primarily on the backend which for the most part, involved a Java-based low code integration development platform and Oracle DB/SQL on the database side. Occasionally, I would use Core Java as and when needed. I also got familiar with version control and CICD concepts.While working on this job, I had been parallelly doing a lot of self learning on fundamental CS topics like Data Structures, Algorithm design and analysis. I eventually left to pursue a Master's in Computer Science where I am currently enrolled. Today, an Amazon recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn to set up an SDE-2 interview. I have been practicing LeetCode and intend to complete at least the Neetcode 150 and Blind 75 in the coming days. My Master's coursework has involved a lot of Low Level Design/Object Oriented Design Patterns and I have been learning High Level System Design from online lecture videos.However, I am not sure if my earlier work experience makes me suitable for an SDE-2 role at Amazon. I haven't really done any significant System Design in my previous role and I am not sure how to deal with the Behavioral/Leadership Principles based rounds where they question you about your earlier work experiences.As I'll be graduating from an MSCS program soon, should I ask the recruiter for an SDE-1 role instead? I'm not sure if she even recruits for SDE-1 and it's not clear if down leveling to SDE-1, in case I meet the SDE-1 bar but not the SDE-2 one, after the interview is an option. I would greatly appreciate any insights on what is advisable given my background. Thank you!",

To be honest I'm dog shit at interviewing, and I hate leet code, and I almost never get responses from apps, this seemed like a fluke. Additional info: my current company has assigned us 3 new offshore teams, who have taken around 60% of our old workload. We've focused on new things, and have work flowing, but it seems like the goal is for the offshore teams to take more as time passes.Am I being stupid not just taking the confirmed job?

I hear people say work in projects and stuff but how likely would that help? Any has successes bouncing back after not working in the field? I have like 1.5 yoe and a cs degree",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So, I’m wanting to go to school to get my bachelors in CS, but with reading different things about layoffs and reading other things saying layoffs happen in every industry (which I know is true), and with the advancement of AI, I’m confused on what the future of the tech industry is looking like. Are so many layoffs happening because of the industry being over saturated with people who aren’t really serious about tech/don’t have degrees? I want to get my BA in CS because I’ve also read a lot that it can give you more job opportunities and potentially higher pay, but from all the different things I’ve read I’m just honestly starting to get really confused. I am genuinely interested in getting my degree and learning coding, I’ve wanted to learn coding and more about computers for a while, and after doing more research I feel like I would like working in the industry. I’ve also read that a CS degree is the most flexible/universal in the tech industry, but even before reading about that as I was looking up different kinds of tech jobs, I figured CS would be best. I am mainly interested in becoming a software engineer, but I’ve also looked into data analytics, cloud engineering, and UX design. It is true that I want a high paying career, but I also want a career with growth opportunity, and to do something that I’m actually interested in. So I am genuinely interested and determined to be successful, will it still be worth it for me to get a CS degree?",

I really like school/learning and would enjoy getting my masters/doctorate.2. I enjoy teaching + tutoring. And I'm pretty good at it.3. I kinda hate the grind of industry.4. Summers off for my kids5. With an additional 5 years of industry pay I'll have a NW large enough to coast for a very long time on reduced income. Then hopefully in \\~10 years I'll be established enough as a professor to make more money within that fieldDownsides1. Industry pays way way more, duh. Average in the cost of school + opportunity cost of not working it's *way way way* more.2. From what I understand, new professors actually just get kicked around as an adjunct for many years and basically treated like studentsI have \\~8 years in industry and have worked for some big names like Google and Amazon which I suppose could help get some early career movement as a professor. Anyone done this? Any additional insight?",
