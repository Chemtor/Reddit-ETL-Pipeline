Second try was kafka clusters at each site but management became a full time job, needed way more hardware than budgeted, configuration issues between sites I spent more time fighting it than building features. We went way simpler didn't need maximum speed, just reliable data collection with minimal babysitting that handles network failures because factory internet sucks. Found messaging that runs on cheap hardware, handles hub and spoke setup, saves data so we don't lose anything when connections drop, small servers at each factory, machines connect locally. If the site loses internet local monitoring keeps working and syncs when back we are using nats now it handles 500 machines without drama.Learned edge first matters way more than raw speed for iot, devices should work independently and sync when they can, not depend on constant cloud, simpler beats complex sometimes.",

        "author": "lostmyway573",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Obvious throwaway account is obvious.My job is a data engineer for a medium-ish sized company, been here for just over 4 years. This is my first \"data\" job, but I learned a good bit about SQL in previous roles. Our department / my team manages our BI data warehouse, and we have a couple of report developers as well. When I read and study about modern data engineering practices, or modern development practices / AI usage, I feel like I'm a caveman rubbing sticks together while watching flying cars go by me every day. I'm considering switching to a DevOps position in my company because I enjoy working with Linux and smaller applications, but also because I feel like this position is a complete dead end - I have no room to exert creativity or really learn anything on the job because of the reasons I'll detail below.Until about 2 years ago, our data warehouse was basically one large SQL database (MS SQL). Standard Kimball-style facts/dimensions, with a handful of other nonstandard tables scattered here and there. We also have a few separate databases that act as per-department \"sandboxes\" for business analysts to build their own stuff, but that's a whole separate story. The whole thing is powered by SSIS packages; OLTP data transformed to a star schema in most cases. Most of it appears to be developed by people who learned SSIS before SQL, because in almost every process, the business logic is baked into transformations instead of scripts or code. I expected this from a legacy setup, and shortly after I started working here it became known that we were going to be migrating to the cloud and away from this legacy stuff, so I thought it was a temporary problem that we'd be walking away from.How naive I was.Problem #1: We have virtually no documentation, other than the occasional comment within code if I'm lucky. We have no medallion architecture. We have no data dictionary. Pretty much all the knowledge of how a majority of our data interacts is tribal knowledge within my department and the business analysts who have been here for a long time. Even the business logic of our reports that go to the desks of the C-levels gets argued about sometimes because it's not written down anywhere. We've had no standard code practices (ever) so one process to the next could employ a totally different design approach.Problem #2: Enter the cloud migration phase. At first, this sounded like the lucky break I was hoping for - a chance to go hands-on with Snowflake and employ real data engineering tools and practices and rebuild a lot of the legacy stuff that we've dealt with since our company's inception. Sadly, that would have been way too easy... Orders came down from the top that we needed to get this done as a lift-and-shift, so we paid a consulting company to use machine learning to convert all of our SSIS packages into Azure Data Factory pipelines en masse. Since we don't have a data dictionary or any real documentation, we really had no way to offer test cases for validating data after the fact. We spent months manually validating table data against table data, row by row. Now we're completely vendor-locked with ADF, which is a massive pile of shit for doing surgical-level transformations like we do. Problem #2A: Architecture. Our entire architecture was decided by one person - a DBA who, by their own admission, has never been a developer of any sort, so they had no idea how complex some of our ETL processes were. Our main OLTP system is staying on-prem, and we're replicating its database up to Snowflake using a third-party tool as our source. Then our ADF processes transform the data and deposit it back to Snowflake in a separate location. I feel like we could have engineered a much simpler solution than this if we were given a chance, but this decision was made before my team was even involved. (OneLake? Dynamic Tables?)Problem #3: Project management, or the lack thereof. At this inception of this migration, the decision to use ADF was made without consulting anyone in my department, including our manager. Similarly, the decision to just convert all of our stuff was made without input from our department. We were also never given a chance to review any of our existing stuff to determine if anything was deprecated; we paid for all of it to be converted, debugged it, and half of it is defunct. Literal months of manpower wasted. Problem #4: Looking ahead. If I fast forward to the end of this migration phase and look at what my job is going to be on a daily basis, it boils down to wrestling with Azure Data Factory every day and dissecting tiny bits of business logic that are baked into transformations, with layers upon layers of unnecessary complexity, let alone the aforementioned lack of code standardization.This doesn't feel like data engineering, this feels like janitorial code cleanup as a result of poor project planning and no foresight. I'm very burned out and it feels hopeless to think there's any real data engineering future here. I recently picked up the Snowflake SnowPro Core certification in my downtime because I really enjoy working with the platform, and I've also been teaching myself a bit about devops in my spare time at home (built a homelab / NAS, stood up some containers, gonna be playing with K3S this weekend). The saving grace is my team of fellow developers. We've managed to weed out the turds over the past year, so the handful of us on the team all work really well together, collaborate often, and genuinely enjoy each other while being in the trenches. At the moment, I'm staying for the clowns and not the circus. Am I crazy, or is this a shitshow? Would anybody else stay here, or how would anyone else proceed in this situation? Any input is welcomed.edit: for clarity, current architecture boils down to: source OLTP > replicated to Snowflake via third-party tool > ADF for ETL/ELT > destination Snowflake",

        "author": "Hofi2010",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "In an enterprise setting we spend $100k+, in bigger orgs even $xM+ for transforming data at scale. To create the perfect data source for our business partners. Which often or most of the time is under utilized. To do this we use a data warehouses (Redshift, Snowflake) or lakehouse (Databricks, ADF, …). The new platform made it easier to handle the data, but it comes with a cost. They are designed for big data (TB’s to PB’s of data), but arguably in most organization most data sources are a fraction of this size. Those solutions are also designed to lock you in with proprietary compute and data formats as they say necessary to provide the best performance. Whenever our Redshift Datawarehouse struggled to keep up AWS’s answer was, “oh your cluster head node is not keeping up with the demand you should upgrade to the next bigger instance type” problem solved and cost was doubled. But now with cheap object storage and open data formats like iceberg it should be possible to get the same performance than Snowflake, Redshift and Databricks at a fraction of the cost. But in order to transform your data you need compute and your data need to be ingested into the compute, transformed and written back in the transformed format to your datalake. The object storage and network speed between storage and compute is usually your bottleneck here. I made some experiments with different EC2 instances and duckdb (just saying I am not affiliated with the product). I had a 85GB timeseries data stream (iceberg) that needed to be pivoted and split into 100 individual tables. On a regular general purpose compute instance t3g.2xlarge that took about 6-7 hours to complete. Then I used i4g memory optioned instances with more memory and network bandwidth up 25 Gbps and it halfed the time. Then I found these new instances network optimized c8gn and they managed to do all 100 tables in 20 mins. Compare this to databricks (Databricks was reading from s3), which took 3 hours. Databricks cost for this transform was $9.38 and the EC2 instance did it for $1.70. So huge savings with a bit of engineering.Wanted to share this and wanted to hear some stories from others in their pursuit of cheaper data transformation options EDIT: just to clarify. I am not proposing get rid of data warehouse or lakehouse, just saying you can save by “outsourcing” compute for batch transformations to much cheaper compute options so you can keep your actual warehouse/lakehouse small.",

And what would make me confident in such tool?Since dbt became popular, we can roughly define a transformation as:* a SELECT statement* a schema definition (optional, but nice to have)* some logic for materialization (table, view, incremental)* data quality tests* and other elements (semantics, unit tests, etc.)If we had a standard we could move a transformation from one tool to another, but also have mutliple tools work together (interoperability).Honestly, I initially wanted to start building a tool, but I forced myself to sit down and first write a standard for data transformations. Quickly, I realized the specification also needed to include tests and UDFs (this is my pet peeve with transformation tools, UDF are part of my transformations).It’s just an initial draft, and I’m sure it’s missing a lot. But it’s open, and I’d love to get your feedback to make it better.I am also bulding my open source tool, but that is another story.",

I only want masking to happen in the **consumption views** that are built on top of those tables. However, it looks like BigQuery doesn’t allow applying policy tags or masking policies directly to views.Has anyone dealt with a similar situation or has suggestions on how to approach this?The goal is to leverage Google’s built-in tools instead of maintaining our own custom anonymization logic, which would simplify ongoing maintenance.

The infrastructure is very \"do it yourself\", and now that I’m near the end of my degree, the data volume has exploded and the organization has become a serious maintenance problem.Currently, I have a Linux server with a /data folder (\\~800GB and growing) that contains:* Climate datasets (NetCDF4, HDF5, and Zarr) — mainly MERRA-2 and ERA5, handled through Xarray;* Tabular data and metadata (CSV, XLSX);* ML models (mostly Scikit-learn and PyTorch pickled models);* A relational database with experiment information.The system works, but as it grew, several issues emerged:* Data ingestion and metadata standardization are fully manual (isolated Python scripts);* Subfolders for distributing the final application (e.g., a reduced /data subset with only one year of data, \\~10GB) are manually generated;* There’s no version control for the data, so each new processing step creates new files with no traceability;* I’m the only person managing all this — once I leave, no one will be able to maintain it.I want to move away from this “messy data folder” model and build something more organized, readable, and automatable, but still realistic for an academic environment (no DevOps team, no cloud, just a decent local server with a few TB of storage).What I’ve considered so far:* A full relational database, but converting NetCDF to SQL would be absurdly expensive in both cost and storage.* A NoSQL database like MongoDB, but it seems inefficient for multidimensional data like netcdf4 datasets.* The idea of a local data lake seems promising, but I’m still trying to understand how to start and what tools make sense in a research (non-cloud) setting.I’m looking for a structure that can:* Organize everything (raw, processed, outputs, etc.);* Automate data ingestion and subset generation (e.g., extract only one year of data);* Provide some level of versioning for data and metadata;* Be readable enough for someone else to understand and maintain after me.Has anyone here faced something similar with large climate datasets (NetCDF/Xarray) in a research environment? Should I be looking into a non-relational database?Any advice on architecture, directory standards, or tools would be extremely welcome — I find this problem fascinating and I’m eager to learn more about this area, but I feel like I need a bit of guidance on where to start.",

I want human input on the smartest most elegant solution.Also to preface I have a bunch of experience with SQL, but not so much experience with Python beyond building machine learning algorithms and doing basic imputation/re-expression, which is why I'm not sure what tool is better.Context-context:I work with transaction data. We have tables with account info, customer info, transaction code info, etc. I've already aggregated all of the basic data and features, runs pretty fast. But once I add the 400 buckets/features, it runs slow. For each transaction category and a bunch of time frames (ie. month buckets for the past two years, so you'll have a\\_category\\_last\\_month, a\\_category\\_last\\_last\\_month, b\\_category\\_last\\_month, etc) I need to do a bunch of heavy aggregations ie minimum amount spent on a single day during given month.Right now it's all done in SQL. I'm working on optimizing the query, but there is only so much I can do and I dread working on the new 1000 categories they want. What is the best way to go about my task? What would SQL handle better and be better/more elegant for code written vs Python? AI suggested to create a row for each feature instead of column for every single customer and then have Python pivot it, is this a good option? I feel like more rows would take even longer to run.",

Tools-wise this mainly means Ab Initio and Informatica plus most rdbms.I am happily employed but I fear the sun looks to be setting on this tech as we all start to build pipelines using cloud native software. It is wise for me therefore to apply some time and effort to learning either Azure, GCP or AWS to safeguard my future. I will study in my own time, build some projects of my own, and get a vendor certification or two. I bring with me plenty of experience on good design, concepts, standards and good practice; it’s just the tooling.My questions is which island to hop on to? I have started with GCP but most of the engineering jobs I notice are wither AWS or Azure. Having started with GCP I would ideally stick with it but I am concerned how few gigs there seems to be and it’s not too late to turn around and start with Azure or AWS.Can you offer any insight or advice?",

The pay is the same as I make and a better retirement pension if I stay long term. One the one hand I want to stay at my current job because doing a full migration will help me better my technical skills for long term. On the other hand this is my chance to step into management and ultimately I want to explore the management route because I am scared that AI will eventually make my mediocre DE skills obsolete and I don’t want to be laid off at 50 without much prospects. Both the current job and the new job offer are remote. Would love your suggestions and thank you in advance. Edit - The new job has been described as overseeing a team of 5 that will start a migration to databricks and duck db from Oracle. They use microstrategy as their semantic layer. I would be initially learn the existing system and then work with vendors and work with the team to migrate the data. I am 42 with a family living in a MCOL area and financially doing alright with decent savings but definitely need to work till 60 unless I get an unexpected windfall.",

These jobs, responsible for replication from HANA to Snowflake, uses spark.What's the best approaches to achive this? Should I go for ADF only, Databricks only or ADF + Databricks? The HANA is on-prem.Jobs overview-Currently, we have a metadata-driven Glue-based ETL framework for replicating data from SAP HANA to Snowflake. The controller Glue job orchestrates everything - it reads control configurations from Snowflake, checks which tables need to run, plans partitioning with HANA, and triggers parallel Spark Glue jobs. The Spark worker jobs extract from HANA via JDBC, write to Snowflake staging, merge into target tables, and log progress back to Snowflake.Has anyone gone through this same thing? **Please help.**",

        "content": "TLDRDBA here, in many years of career, my biggest drama to fight were always metrics or lack of.Places always had a bare minimum monitoring scripts/applications and always reactive. Meaning only if it’s broken, it alerts.I’m super lazy and I don’t want to be awake 3am to fix something that I knew was going to break hours, days ahead. So as a side gig, I always tried to create meaning metrics. Today my company relies a lot on a grafana+prometheus setup I created because the our application as a black box. Devs would rely on reading logs and hoping for the best to justify a behaviour that maybe was normal, maybe was always like that. So grafana just proved it right or wrong.Decisions are now made by people “watching grafana”. This metric here means this, this other means that. And both together means that.While it still a very small side project, now I have been given people to help me to leverage that to the entire pipeline, which is fairly complex from the business perspective, and time consuming, given I don’t have a deep knowledge of any of these tools and infrastructure behind it and I learn as I find challenges.I was just a DBA with a side project hahaa.Finally my question:Where do I start? I mean, I already started, but I wonder if I can make use of ML to create meaning alerts/metrics. Because people can look at 2 - 3 charts and make sense of what is going on, but leveraging this to the whole pipeline will be too much for humans and probably too noise. It a topic I have quite a lot interest but no much background experience.",

        "content": "Hi everyone,At my company, we are currently reevaluating our data integration setup. Right now, we have several Docker containers running on various on-premise servers. These are difficult to access and update, and we also lack a clear overview of which pipelines are running, when they are running, and whether any have failed. We only get notified by the end users...We’re considering migrating to Azure Container Apps or Azure Container App Jobs. The advantages we see are that we can easily set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to deploy new images and have a straightforward way to schedule runs. However, one limitation is that we would still be missing a central overview of pipeline runs and their statuses. Does anyone have experience or recommendations for handling monitoring and failure tracking in such a setup? Is a tool like Sentry enough?We have also looked into orchestration tools like Dagster and Airflow, but we are concerned about the operational overhead. These tools can add maintenance complexity, and the learning curve might make it harder for our first-line IT support to identify and resolve issues quickly.What do you think about this approach? Does migrating to Azure Container Apps make sense in this case? Are there other alternatives or lightweight orchestration tools you would recommend that provide better observability and management?Thanks in advance for your input!",

Does anyone know of any resources, information, or quite literally any helpful ideas for determining where to begin? I am well versed in excel and sheets, I'm moderately capable with basic automations and workflows, although I haven't spent much time yet learning how to use app scripts, API's, nor how to go about developing a system of data consolidation in which the data is being collected using different platforms. For instance our LMS is Powerschool which also serves as our SIS although we use a platform called Dean's list for behavioral monitoring. Additionally our standardized test scores come from 2 different sources. Any help, direction, etc would be incredibly helpful. If I wasn't swamped and overwhelmed with all of my other duties I would take the time to learn it all on my own but we operate so stupidly and in such disorganization most hours of my day are spent doing things that could easily be incorporated into workflows, if I could figure out how to use the API's to allow data to be shared with various platforms(google workspace, Powerschool, Dean's list, etc).",

I did a bunch of e learning courses over the years and realized it is more or less a waste of time unless you actually get to apply that knowledge in a real project, better sooner than later.Technical skill-wise: mostly SQL, Python here and there and a lot of ABAP 3 years ago. The rest of the time just using GUIs (SAP users will know what i am talking about) **Expectations / Priorities:**1. I would like to switch from consultant to inhouse. 2. I would like to diversify my skill set and add some non-SAP tools and technologies to my skill set.3. I would like to strike a better balance between pure data engineering (as in coding, SQL, data analysis, data cleansing etc.) vs. other parts of the job: doing workshops, communication, collaborating with team members. Wouldnt mind gaining some managerial responsiblity either. Past 3 years i felt like a \"only\" data analyst, writing mostly SQL and analyzing data.4. Over the course of these 5 years i never really felt like i was part of a team working on a mission with a any degree of purpose whatsoever. Would like to have more of that in my life.5. I would like to stay located in Switzerland but open to work remotely.I applied to a decent amount of jobs and having a tough time to find an entry point with my starting position. I would be more than happy to prepare before starting a new position through online courses in case there it is expected to have knowledge around certains tools / products / technologies.I am also considering to do freelancing, but i am unsure how much of the above list would actually improve in that setting. Also i wouldnt really know where and how to start / get clients and would require some networking i suppose. I am reducing my working hours next year to introduce more flexibility to my daily life and foster my search for a more fulfilling job setup. I am also aware that the above wish list is asking for a lot and most likely i will have to make some sort of compromise and will never check all the boxes.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I work for a small organization and we have built an ETL pipeline with Python and SQL for Power BI dashboards. Here is the current process:There are multiple python scripts connected to each other by importing in-memory dataframes. One script runs multiple complex SQL queries concurrently and there are other scripts for transforming the data and uploading to SQL server. The pipeline transfers 3 MB of data each time since it queries the most recent data and takes 2 to 3 minutes to execute each day.This is hard to automate because the databases require VPN which needs 2fa. So we have been working with the IT solutions team to automate the pipeline.The easiest way to automate this would be to deploy the code onto a VM and have it run on a schedule. However, the solutions team has proposed a different approach with Azure Data Factory:* ADF orchestrator invokes \"Copy Data\" activity via self-hosted IR via to the source DB* Data is copied into Azure Blob Storage* Function App executes transformations in the Python scripts* Self-hosted IR invokes \"Copy Data\" with Source as transformed data and the SQL Server as the sinkThe IT solutions deparment said this is the best approach because Microsoft supports PaaS over IaaS and there would be overhead of managing the VM.I am just wondering if this solution would be overkill because our pipeline is very small scale (only 3 MB of data transferred on each run) and we are not a large company.The other problem is that nobody on the team knows Azure. Even though the IT solutions team will implement everything, it will still need to be maintained. The team consists of a business analyst who only knows SQL and not Python, a co-op student who changes every 4 months and myself. I am just a student who has worked here on many co-op and part time roles (currently part time). The business analyst delegates all the major technical tasks to the co-op students so when I leave, the pipeline will be managed by another co-op student who will only be there for 4 months.Management currently support the ADF approach because it is Microsoft best practice. They believes that using a VM will not be best practice and they will need to hire another person to fix everything if it breaks. They also want to move to Fabric in the future for its AI/ML capabilities even though we can just build ML pipelines in Python.I am not sure if I am overthinking this or the ADF solution is truly overkill. I am fine with learning Azure technologies and not opposed to it but I want to build something that can be maintained.",

        "author": "overwhelmed_and_shy",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello everyone,I’m a CTO of a small startup in South America (limited budget, of course) with a background in software development. While I have academic knowledge in Machine Learning, AI explicability, and related topics, I’ve never worked on a professional data team or project. In most academic projects, we work with ready-to-use datasets, so I’ve never had to think about creating datasets from scratch.We’re a 60-person company, with only 5 in tech, working in the accounting industry. We have four main applications, each with its own transactional Postgres database:- Backend: Serves a hybrid mobile/web app for customers and a back-office application for employees. It handles resources for customer enterprises and our in-house CRM.- Tasks: An internal task and process orchestration app (using Camunda).- CMS: A content system for website campaigns, offers, landing pages, etc.- Docs: An internal Wiki with markdown files documenting processes, laws, rules, etc.The databases are relatively small for now: Backend has 120 tables, Tasks has 50, and most tables have around 500k rows from 4 years of operation. We’ve plugged all of them into Metabase for BI reporting. We have some TVs around the office with real-time dashboards refreshing every 30s (for example for the sales team tracks daily goals and our fiscal team tracking new urgent due tasks). Employees also use detailed tables for their day-to-day needs, often filtering and exporting to Excel.We’ve hit some bumps in our performance and need advice on how to scale efficiently. Most BI reports go through a view in the Backend database that consolidates all customer data, which contains many joins (20+) and CTEs. This setup works well enough for now, but I’m starting to worry as we scale. On top of that, we have some needs to keep track tasks in our Camunda system that are late but only for delinquent customers, so I have to join the data from our Backend database. I've tried Trino/Presto for that but it had a really bad performance and now we are using a Postgres Foreign Data Wrapper and its working well so far... Joining data from our Camunda system with the Backend database to track late tasks, the query performance takes a big hit since it's going through the same consolidated view (it was either that or repeat the same joins over and over again). To address this, we’ve decided it’s time to create a Data Warehouse to offload these heavy queries from the databases. We’re using read replicas, indexes, etc., but I want to create a robust structure for us to grow.Additionally, we’re planning to integrate data from other sources like Google Analytics, Google Ads, Meta Ads, partner APIs (e.g., WhatsApp vendor), and PDF content (tax guides, fiscal documents, bank reports, etc.). We’d like to use this data for building ML models and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), etc.We’ve also been exploring the idea of a Data Lake to handle the raw, unstructured data. I’m leaning toward a medallion architecture (Bronze-Silver-Gold layers) and pushing the \"Gold\" datasets into an OLAP database for BI consumption. The goal would be to also create ML-ready datasets in Parquet format.Cost is a big factor for us. Our current AWS bill is under USD 1K/month, which covers virtual machines, databases, cloud containers, etc. We’re open to exploring other cloud providers and potentially multi-cloud solutions, but cost-effectiveness is key.I’m studying a lot about this but am unsure of the best path forward, both in terms of architecture and systems to use. Has anyone dealt with a similar scenario, especially on a budget? Should we focus on building a Data Warehouse first, or would implementing a Data Lake be more beneficial for our use case? What tools or systems would you recommend for building a scalable, cost-efficient data pipeline? Any other advice or best practices for someone with an academic background but limited hands-on experience in data engineering?Thanks in advance for any tip",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I keep running into conflicting opinions on this, so I’m curious how other teams actually handle it in practice.Context: think of a product with **EU customers and non-EU engineers**, or generally a setup where data residency / GDPR matters and you still need to debug real issues in production.I’d love to hear how your org does things around:**1. Where you are vs where the data is*** Which country/region are *you* working from?* Where is your main production DB / warehouse for that data (EU region, US, multiple regions, etc.)?**2. Who gets to touch production data*** Do individual engineers have **direct access** to prod DBs/warehouses/logs, or is it mostly through internal tools / dashboards?* Is access **permanent** (e.g. read-only role you always have) or **on-demand / temporary** (someone grants it when needed)?* Are credentials shared (team accounts, jump boxes) or strictly individual + SSO?**3. Debugging real issues**When you hit a bug that *only* shows up with real production data, what do you actually do?* Point a debug build at prod?* Query the prod DB/warehouse directly?* Ask a DBA / data / platform team to pull what you need? How often does this happen for you (roughly per week / month)?**4. Data residency / regional rules in practice**If you’re **outside** the region where the data “should” live (e.g. you’re in the US/UK, data is “EU-only”): what’s the real process?* You still query it directly (VPN/bastion/etc.)* Someone *in-region* runs queries / exports for you* You rely on pre-built tooling / dashboards and never see raw rows Are there any “unofficial” workflows (Slack messages like “hey can you run this query for me from EU?”)?**5. Guardrails & horror stories*** Do you have masking / RLS / separate views specifically for debugging?* Any guardrails like time-limited accounts, strict audit logs, approvals, etc.?* Have you seen any near-misses or incidents related to prod access (accidental UPDATE without WHERE, GDPR concerns, etc.)?**6. If you could change one thing*** If you had a magic wand, what’s the first thing you’d fix in your current “debugging with prod data” setup? (Could be policy, tooling, process, anything.)Feel free to anonymize company names, but rough industry and team size (e.g. “EU fintech, \\~50 engineers” or “US B2B SaaS, mixed EU/US users”) would be super helpful for context.Really curious how different teams balance “we need real prod data to fix this” with “we don’t want everyone to have God-mode on prod”.",

        "content": "At work we have a data source exposed through a Django API that another team is developing and maintaining. We need data from that data source, and right now instead of querying that Django API directly, we have a C# backend that manually models a lot of the same data as the Django API but with a slightly different structure/models, and then we have a cronjob that synchronizes the data from one database to the other using both APIs every 10 minutes. The cronjob took a week to implement. Last month, someone on my team spent 2 weeks simply updating the model in our backend because we needed some new data from the Django API and it didn't really fit in to our models. That also required a new synchronization cronjob to be created, and the old one broke. The tech lead for the team says that the benefit of this system is that if the service we are relying on goes down, we still have enough data to show important information. I've asked why we don't just create automated replicas in different clusters (we already have replica sets for everything that gets deployed), and he said that the world is just not that simple and that bugs would still propagate through all replicas.So am I just inexperienced, or should we be querying the main data source?",

Our current financial dataset had like 2m rows, each of this row has a field called “amount” and this field is in USD, so I created 9 amount bins and then created a sub partition strategy to make sure within each bin the max partition size is 1000 rows. This helps me handle imbalance amount bind and then for this type of dataset i end up with 2000 partitions. My current hardware configuration is:1. Cloud provider: AWS2. Instance: r5.2xlarge with 8 vCPU, 64gb ram. I have our model in s3 and then i fetch it during my pyspark run. I don’t use any kryo serialization and my execution time is 27 minutes for generating the similarity matrix using a multi-lingual model. Is this the best way to do this? I would love if someone can come in and share that i can even do better. I want to compare this then with snowflake as well; which sadly my company wants us to use and i want to just have metrics for both approaches.

However, I occasionally question this confidence, wondering if it stems from the repetitive nature of the process or the current absence of a direct manager to provide supervision and critical technical oversight.I was quite concerned when the CDO asked me to define the role I should assume starting next month, given the upcoming senior hire. * Should I assume the leadership risk and position myself to manage the new senior hire (e.g., as a Team Lead or BI Manager)? * Should I explore an alternative career trajectory, such as transitioning toward a Data Scientist role? * What critical internal questions should I ask myself to ensure I make the most informed decision about my future path?*Should I ask for a salary update? of how much? 15%?I think they see me with leadership potential but I definitely think that I need to improve as a DE to have more confidence in myself.

I soon realized how unrealistic the implementation of it was, especially if you have multiple collections with millions of records each. That's when I started the journey of learning how databases are implemented.After a few weeks of research and coding, I've completed the first version of my file-based database. This version is append-only, using LSN to insert, update, delete, and locate records. It also uses a B+ Tree for collection entries, allowing for fast ID:LSN lookup. When the B+ Tree reaches its max size (I've set it to 1500 entries), the tree will be encoded (using my custom encoder) and atomically written to disk before an empty tree takes the old one's place in-memory.I'm sure I'm there are things that I'm doing wrong, as this is my first time researching how databases work and are optimized. So, I'd like feedback on the code or even the concept of this library itself.Just wanna state that this wasn't vibe-coded at all. I don't know whether it's my pride or the fear that AI will stunt my growth, but I make a point to write my code myself. I did bounce ideas off of it, though.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I have been working on this idea since 2017 and wanted to share it here because the data engineering community deals with structured data, schemas, and long-term maintainability every day.The idea started after repeatedly running into limitations with JSON in large data pipelines: repeated keys, loose typing, metadata mixed with data, high structural overhead, and difficulty with streaming due to nested braces.Over time, I began exploring a format that tries to solve these issues without becoming overly complex. After many iterations, this exploration eventually matured into what I now call Internet Object (IO).Key characteristics that came out of the design process:* schema-first by design (data and metadata clearly separated)* row-like nested structures (reduce repeated keys and structural noise)* predictable layout that is easier to stream or parse incrementally* richer type system for better validation and downstream consumption* human-readable but still structured enough for automation* about 40-50 percent fewer tokens than the equivalent JSON* compatible with JSON concepts, so developers are not learning from scratchThe article below is the first part of a multi-part series. It is not a full specification, but a starting point showing how a JSON developer can begin thinking in IO: [https://blog.maniartech.com/from-json-to-internet-object-a-lean-schema-first-data-format-part-1-150488e2f274](https://blog.maniartech.com/from-json-to-internet-object-a-lean-schema-first-data-format-part-1-150488e2f274)The playground includes a small 200-row ML-style training dataset and also allows interactive experimentation with the syntax: [https://play.internetobject.org/ml-training-data](https://play.internetobject.org/ml-training-data)More background on how the idea evolved from 2017 onward: [https://internetobject.org/the-story/](https://internetobject.org/the-story/)Would be glad to hear thoughts from the data engineering community, especially around schema design, streaming behavior, and practical use-cases.",

When running an ETL for **Orders**, I always need a specific version of Customers to be present before the join step.However, when a pipeline starts fresh, the Customers dataset for the required version might not yet exist in the source.My question is: **How do people typically manage this kind of data dependency?** During the Orders ETL, how can the system reliably determine whether the required “clean Customers (version X)” dataset is available?Do real-world systems normally handle this using a **data registry** or **data lineage / dataset readiness tracker**? For example, should the first step of the Orders ETL be querying the registry to check whether the specified Customers version is ready before proceeding?",

In a previous company I worked for, they used Snowflake to do the heavy lifting and allowed internal analysts to hit Snowflake directly (from golden layer on). But the datatables with data to be exposed to external people were copied everyday to AWS and the external people would get data from there (postgres) to avoid unpredictable loads and potential huge spikes in costs.In my current company, the backend is built such that the same APIs are used both by internals and externals - and they hit the operational databases. This means that if I want to allow internals to access Snowflake directly and make externals access processed data migrated back to Postgres/Mysql, the backend needs to basically rewrite the APIs (or at least have two subclasses of connectors: one for internal access, other for external access).I feel like preventing direct external access to the data platform is a good practice, but I'm wondering what the DE community thinks about it :)",

As far as I know, if you send a Parquet file through Kafka, you cannot modify anything in that file before it is deserialized. So you cannot do column pruning or small reads. You essentially lose every single benefit of Parquet.So why do these articles and guides insist about using Parquet with Kafka?",

May be because their Intern or Junior was working on creating these files the files were very erroneous. We had a meeting discussed a few solutions and decided that the client will upload sales data files to the FTP server. Current Process - • Download files from FTP to Local folder named Raw. • Use Python script to add two new columns - Branch Name and Branch Code. • We achieve this by including a dictionary in python code that adds these columns based on file names. For example - file name 045_inv.csv then Manhattan since code for Manhattan is 045. We repeat this for invoice line and invoice customer. • Save these to a new local folder - Processed • Use Python script to read files from Processed load them to PGSql db containing three tables - invoice, invoice_line, invoice_customer• Three python scripts for three tablesMy Request - 1) How can I make this process smoother and more seamless? 2) What is the best way to automate this? 3) what checks can I perform to ensure that data health and accuracy is maintained",

        "content": "I spent the first year of learning programming doing a bunch of things wrong, and I want to save anyone else the headache. **1. Don't start with Python.**Yeah, everyone says \"Python is easy\" and \"best for beginners\". The truth is, it's way too forgiving. I got used to writing code that worked without understanding what was actually happening under the hood. Then I jumped into Rust later and realized I basically had to relearn everything; memory, types, how the computer actually handles your code. If I could go back, I'd start with something a bit more challenging that actually teaches you the fundamentals.**2. Don't rely on AI chatbots.**I spent months having chatbots \"help\" me write code. Sure, it works, but I didn't actually learn anything. Struggle a bit, break things, debug it yourself. That's how real understanding happens.**3. Stop just following tutorials.**I wasted months cloning tutorials, thinking I was learning. Most of it didn't stick. The moment I started building tiny projects I actually cared about, things finally clicked. Even a dumb little project that scratches your own itch will teach you more than ten tutorials ever will.**4. Learn the tools, not just the language.**Knowing syntax isn't enough. Debugging, testing, version control, libraries, deployment... all that boring stuff actually matters. I ignored this at first, and it hurt me later when I tried to build real things.**5. Embrace being stuck.**If you're never confused, frustrated, or banging your head against a wall, you're not really learning. Those are the moments when growth actually happens.",

The income is good, but sales is slowly burning me out and I feel like I don’t have any “real skill” or long-term stability.I’ve always been fascinated by computers and technology, even though I never studied anything related to it. I finished only high school (general gymnasium), and never went to university.Recently I’ve been seriously considering switching to **software engineering**. I’m ready to dedicate all my free time outside of work to learning programming and building skills, and I’m highly motivated to build a long-term career in this field.My main dilemma is this:**At 28, does it make sense to start a CS degree (which would take 3–4 years), or is it better to follow a structured self-study path + build a portfolio and projects?**Since I’d be learning while working full-time, time is my biggest constraint, and I want to avoid wasting years if a degree isn’t necessary for entering the industry — especially for EU/German or US remote positions.I’d also love to hear examples from people who were in a similar situation (switching careers later, learning while working full-time, or transitioning with or without a degree) — how did it go for you, what worked, and what would you do differently?I’d really appreciate honest advice from people who transitioned later or from those hiring developers.

The review process has a lot of \"Why did you do it this way\" with IDKs followed up. There have been several attempts to change this from a cultural standpoint opening up office hours to ask questions of more skilled engineers giving more flexible deadlines and a couple really hard conversations about their performance with little result.

        "content": "I'm working at a startup, and joined for a data science role, but around 4 months ago I got assigned frontend work and that's what I've been doing since then. The one skill I've always prided myself on is my adaptability. I pick things up pretty fast. The thing is, since I started this job, I feel like my stress and anxiety have been really high. It's not my boss, because honestly the work environment and my boss are absolutely amazing. They've been really supportive and encourage me to ask more questions, and they have told me that they know I'm new and will be slow, and with time and understanding I'll get faster, but I'm really paranoid that it's been 4 months and even though I'm a bit faster, I'm still pretty slow and for the past 3 months or so, I've been delivering tasks later than I'm supposed to, sometimes by a day or two, sometimes even longer. I feel like the stress is really clouding my thinking and it's causing me to feel really overwhelmed, and because I'm not able to get done within the working hours, I've been working off the clock too, and it feels like practically every waking hour I'm either worried about work or I'm working. Even my dreams are work related now. I feel like I'm not too bad yet, because I'm somehow still functioning, but I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of a breakdown. The other day, I was really stressed out about not being able to complete work on time, and the team was testing the product, and found a bug in some code I had written a week ago. It was really minor, a change that I'd forgotten to push, but for some reason I started panicking a lot over it, and ended up leaving office early because I started to feel dizzy. Earlier this week, I was so stressed out while working from home that I straight up cried for almost an entire day. I've communicated the stress aspect with my boss a little bit, and he's been really understanding and kind, telling me that he understands that people don't function well under stress, asking why I'm feeling this way, if changing the scope of my work would help, and encouraging me to ask others for help more. He even told me I have an excellent work ethic, and that his only feedback for me so far is that I need to communicate more, rather than just giving status updates.The thing is, I don't know how to get out of my own head about this. I feel like I'm the slowest one at work, and everyone at work seems to know what they're doing. I feel like I am really far behind them in terms of skill, and it makes me even more worried about the fact that I'm slow. There isn't any external indication that they may fire me anytime soon, and I know that this is just a job and others will come along, but I just, don't know what to do. I barely have a life outside work, my parents are always worried when I call, because I barely talk to them, and when I do talk to them about how I'm doing, they're worried that I may be depressed or that the job is too much for me. I'm also really scared that I might be pushing the limits with how understanding my boss is. What do I do?",

I went from React to C/AL to my current job where I use C sharp.I feel like I have no experience in anything and lack the basics. At the same time, I am given tasks with fairly tight deadlines every day, which I am forced to manage with AI.I don't learn anything new, and when I'm put in front of an editor without AI, I have a mental blank and can't write anything.I've always had a sort of imposter syndrome, but right now it's skyrocketing. I don't know where to start to fix the problem. I could study C sharp, but my current goal is to change job because I'm not happy at all. The problem is that I don't know what tech stack I'll end up with.",

Ill make it again. For the rest, I want to thank specially @Reasonable_Run_5529 and @1lann for their support and helping me find solutions and understand the situation, and also to all of you who answered with helpful comments. Media lib is store in a cloud service now and will improve my backup process as well as my non-using-ai-code-without-reading-system (was 3AM in my defence...) :)Hey everyone,I’m completely desperate right now so I hope someone here can tell me if there’s still hope.I had a full Next.js portfolio website on my Mac (macOS, APFS). Everything was pushed to GitHub. The repo had all my source code, the app folder, components, images, everything. But I was having issues with huge file sizes, so I started cleaning the .next folder.Chati told me to use:npx git-filter-repo --path .next --invert-paths --forceThis completely rewrote the repository history, deleted the remote origin, and left only a tiny repo with ~20 objects. When I pushed again, GitHub got overwritten and now shows only a minimal repo with a single package.json. All my commits and file history on GitHub are gone.Worse:During the cleanup, I somehow deleted the actual project folder on my machine too. The folder exists, but it only contains:•.git•.history•package.json•node_modulesAll my source files, images, pages, components, routes — literally everything — are gone.GitHub has no old commits.git fsck shows nothing recoverable.APFS snapshots don’t seem to contain user workspace files.VSCode backups folder is empty.No Time Machine.As a last resort, I ran PhotoRec on the disk. It recovered 130,000 files from the drive, but most are random binary or gibberish. I filtered them down to ~3,000 possible code/text/json files and ~138 files that mention React/Next/framer-motion, but most seem corrupted or system files.At this point I genuinely don’t know if:1.The source files still exist somewhere on disk2.The APFS filesystem keeps deleted user folders in snapshots3.GitHub has any way to restore overwritten commits4.PhotoRec recovery of .ts/.tsx/.js files is even realistic5.I should keep searching through the recovered mess or accept they’re goneIs there ANY way to restore an overwritten GitHub repository, or recover deleted APFS files like a Next.js project?Or am I basically screwed unless I rewrite the entire thing manually?Thanks for your help",

And it may look like it, but to me it's more like an exponentially harder process to learn, with the stacking and holding of abstract concepts all at once. And some concepts just don't click in my mind.like, if learning a concept was like pattern-recognition and pattern-internalisation through memorisation and repetition, then that would be a life-saver, but from reading stuff online, I presume it's more like the solving of abstract problems through some sorta inherent reasoning.Now, I don't wanna get into software engineering, I wanna get into cybersec, and hopefully become a pentester one day. But there's no clear answer on whether pentesting requires high-level coding or not, like I know the basic stuff like for/while, if/elif/else, collections, arithmetic operators, bunch of methods, little bit of functions and file handling, but that's about it.",

I heard that if I study for three years and then one more year, I can earn an extra degree — so I plan to stay in community college for a total of four years.Right now, I’m a first-year student learning the C language.But honestly… it’s my first time ever learning about computers, so I’m having a hard time keeping up. I started getting confused when we began learning about nested if statements :loudly_crying_face:Anyway, here’s my main question::backhand_index_pointing_right: What do you think is the most important thing to focus on when studying C?I plan to review everything during the vacation, and I want to know which parts are absolutely essential — the “you must know this no matter what!” kind of stuff.If you could also share your own study tips or personal tricks, that would mean a lot! I’ve realized that what we learn from textbooks and what’s used in real-world programming are totally different things.I’ve thought about switching to another language, but I still believe that C is the foundation of programming. Python feels simpler, but sometimes harder to fully understand.I know it might be a bit surprising to see a Korean student pop up here, but I wanted to ask this question in a big, experienced community like this one.I’ve read some posts here, and many people seem super knowledgeable and kind. This is my first time joining a foreign community, so I might make some mistakes — but I’ll do my best!Thanks so much for reading, and I really appreciate any advice you can share :folded_hands:",

        "content": "I realize this might not be within the rules of the sub. If not, I’m sorry.Rant time. If you don’t want to hear a rant, leave now. I’ve tried 30 times to make an MSIX package using the tool from an installer I made that works perfectly fucking fine. The process is completely unpredictable, the only thing I know with certainty is that it will fail. Well, one time I managed to make a working package but I was unable to reproduce it even when doing the exact same thing.The error logs. When I look at the error logs, it is like Greek. It makes no fucking sense. It will tell me I had a file name that was too long. Which file? No clue. What the filename was? Not provided. Utter horseshit. Another example: it tells me a file name somewhere in my 1.5GB of dependencies has an incorrect character. Which one? Who fucking knows. Horse shit.Meanwhile, you can download Advanced Installer to do the work for you. Oh wait, the professional license you need to make an MSIX installer is SIX HUNDRED fucking dollars; straight up evil. It’s like they know how fucking shit this process is and decided to take advantage of the pain. I honestly don’t know how anyone gets an app onto the Microsoft store. It seems impossible for a team of one, me, to do this. This process is so bureaucratic and bloated that you need about 20 different identifiers over your numerous files to all line up, just so you can say “yup, I made this.” Horse shit. Not to mention the signing process which is annoying as fuck.On the MSIX Packaging Tool, if your thing fails for whatever reason, you have to restart the process, meaning you have to uninstall your app, remove any extraneous files, restart your computer for good measure, and have a perfect working environment because it “watches” you install your app. What a great fucking idea. I’m sure nothing would interfere with that, ever.I’m angry. I’m pissed the fuck off. I have wasted so much time on this. I just want to submit something to the fucking Microsoft store. Why is that so fucking brutally hard? I have a perfectly working .exe installer and they could look at my source code for all I care. It’s so dumb.I’m tired. I guess I just won’t submit an app to the Microsoft store. Their loss. Assholes. FUCK!",

Now, I am required by the business rules to only set the state to Finished in the database only if notification to an external API is successful. But it can be the case that the external API notification is okay, then the save to the db failed, and thus the API is already notified. If let's say there is a background job that periodically reruns the function, the API will be re-notified. Thus what I thought was to add a state Notifying such that before notification, and the state is not Notifying, then set the state to Notifying, then notify. Thus on retries we avoid double notifying if setting state to Finished is failed.But this makes me have to introduce a new state. Is there a better way?",

I understand C++ as C but with additional functionality and tools, but I don't know what those specific tools are.I like learning about how computers work under the hood and wish to expand my knowledge but don't know which one to choose. I am likely looking into getting a CS degree and want a head start before I start applying and want to expand my knowledge and understanding.After that, I don't know exactly what kind of project I should make. If you have any suggestions, that'd be greatly appreciated! I want more to do projects for the sake of learning over any practicality. If you have any books you find to be helpful, please send them. I like having something in my room full of information that reminds me to try to complete it. If you have any online resources, that'd be appreciated as a stepping point for the book.Thanks in advance!EDIT: I should've clarified my question to \"after you're no longer a COMPLETE beginner.\" Another thing I should've clarified is my understanding. I should've said now that I have a simple understanding of OOP and functional programming, not an understanding. There's a difference there I should've elaborated on. I'll try to be more specific in the future because I was not specific enough for this post. I am still a beginner and I meann't have to phrase my questions about how I should take the next jump.

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I have an idea for a project I want to program, but before I get started I need to know how effective modern captchas are at actually at detecting and stopping bots. If bots can easily pass as humans through all detection methods then my project is a non-starter. I know bots can do things like, be given spending money and then find a person to solve the captcha for them, but I'm just looking at what bots can do by themselves without any outside help.I'm finding some results through research, but none of it is what I would consider conclusive or scientific. Mostly I'm just finding people maybe making up stories, sharing anecdotes, that kinda thing. I'm not seeing a lot of demonstrations of bots beating captchas but then again if they were doing this I doubt I would see somebody uploading themselves doing it on youtube.I have some vague knowledge of how captchas work, and that a big part of why they work at all is because, at least in Google's case, they read a bunch of metadata such as speed, how you move your mouse, etc. But I'm very lacking in specifics and I'm open to learn more about them.From some demonstrations I've seen, it looks like if you show a captcha image test to an AI, it will correctly find the squares with the specific object. But then if the AI or an automated program tried to input those results, it would fail due to not passing the metadata stuff? Is that a correct assumption or can AI bypass these checks now? Wouldn't it be pretty trivial to beat this by just making a robot physically tap a phone screen?I'm not asking if captchas are 100% effective, because I know that's not possible. But even if they're 90% effective, for my purposes that would be good enough. Besides that I'm also open to implementing more ways to verify if someone is a bot, but I'm looking for methods that are quick and practical like how captchas are. Maybe making the user solve multiple captchas instead of just one?",

Just knowing what the hell is going in my computer and being able to comfortably use terminal (zsh?) (I couldn’t even install Puppeteer properly lol). I imagine the language also may depend on the process being run? Honestly i don’t know. This is the only thing in the list I cannot think of a specific project for.2. Coding for after effects; I’m interested in automating “randomized” movement for grid photo collages with very specific parameters which I’d love to modify as the video goes on.3. Making a website for my portfolio (I work with audiovisual media) in such a way I feel I have control over it (I used Cargo but, because I don’t understand the HTML and barely get the CSS, I’m not getting the best out of it). I’d like it to be as interactive as possible!4. Making a repository style wiki to post online (Tried and failed with mediawiki, that uses PHP(?)) and compile essays, bibliography, etc. Think monoskop but way smaller and very very open to publish its community’s work.5. Using touchdesigner’s code (JS) to creatively alter and enhace live visuals (I know the gist of the software by now, but knowing how to use it with code will give me much more control over it!)6. Making tiny games in godot (C++), I just want to make a one level platformer as a gift to a friend who loves platformers. And the tiniest visual novel for a friend who loves those but ik I could use ren’py for that, which would be a separate thing+language (I read Python can be used for renpy as well as its DSL).I know there is no “right” or “easiest” way to approach coding as a beginner, and that no language is better than the other, I’m just mostly wondering which of these projects specifically appears to be feasible in the shortest amount of time or least amount of steps/smaller learning curve, if that’s even something that can be answered.Is these are way too ambitious, I would start off by the closest project that is actually accesible for a beginner and work my way to one of these.Take all this in the context that I don’t even know what the simplest coding terms mean lol. Also! I don't intend to use AI to do this, because I like the challenge of figuring things out, so it's not something I'm factoring in to consider how \"easy\" something would be.I have read about this and checked out this subreddit's linked posts, but I love hearing from people one on one.

Basically now, when I program:I look at a problem or an exercise or something I can't do. * I break it down into chunks of what I need to do. * Bash my head too solve each chunk, looking up stuff OR using AI too explain what I need and why for chunks I just have no idea what do do. So for example, when I needed to make a basic Farenheit too Celsius Java Program. * I broke it down too reading user input, formula, and output answer. * So I looked up the Java MOOC course on how too program user input, use something called scanner. And asked AI for the formula for Farenheit too Celsius. F -32 times 5/9, with \\* and decimal points in Java. Okay. And I know System.out.println. But wait, program is still not outputting. I ask AI to explain the issue. Turns out, I declared a variable wrong. Then, I try too improve it. I ask AI what I can do too make the program better. They suggest how to do While Loops. Okay, I ask for an example and look that up in Java MOOC and try too implement it. I've been doing it on my Lab exercises, and I find I retain more information this way. Is this an effective method of programming? or am I better off just going full no AI?",

        "author": "anabolicbob",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I think that one of my biggest intellectual weaknesses is constructing a more complex chain of logic while at the same time remembering what has already been constructed and how they work together.While other areas have improved noticeably, such as the ability to break down problems into their smallest components or remember how the syntax works (using c++ BTW), I'm not sure my brain's \"multi-threading\" ability is improving significantly. Practically this means that even after coming up with the solution and battle plan, as soon as I get coding with a bunch of variables that need a class type from here with an instance from there calling something from another place, even trying to stay organized I can feel the spinning plates of data in my head get out of hand. My workaround is to comment the hell out of everything, for example \"// 'r' now contains a pointer to 'rects\\_' from rect\\_packer which has x, y, h, w, etc. data\" because even though it's so obvious at the time when I come back to it in a couple hours or a couple days I have to click through all the files again just to re-understand what is doing what. I've also thought perhaps I'm being to \"greedy\" with keeping stuff smooth in my head; afterall that's why we write stuff down so we don't have to be amazing at recall. To hopefully improve this ability I'm working on the Trachtenberg method and doing 3x3 digit multiplication which seriously over clocks my mental CPU but I can manage, however I'm not sure if there is something better I can do to improve the \"concurrent logic buffer\" size in my head.",

I checked around with the last one and sadly they are all aimed at uni students so I dont really fit for them. I have looked at the first two and I have found varying qualities and costs associated with the different courses, but I cant seem to figure out which one to use as they all seem similar.I have a few quick questions if you guys wouldnt mind answering:1. What is a good online site to use?2. Should I go for a larger, more well known company for recognition or just a smaller one?3. How important are certificates?4. On sites such as Udemy, is it better to buy a course or their subscription?I am in the UK so the sites mentioned in the FAQ dont tend to work as well. I tried looking at the government boot camp website, but that doesnt have anything in my areaIn another area as well, what are good things to focus on so I can actually get interviews? At the moment, my programs are quite simple and related to each other so they dont make me stand put much.",

        "content": "I found an Acer Aspire 14 AI Snap-X1/32/1024/IPS on sale for €620 during Black Week in the EU. It comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon X1-26-100 processor and a 14\" WUXGA 120 Hz display. I’m unsure whether it’s a good buy or if I should instead spend about €530 more and get a MacBook M4. The MacBook is nearly double the price, but it tends to hold its value better and usually lasts for many years. Reviews of the Acer haven’t been very encouraging.For context, I’m planning to study Computer Science for the next five years. And just use it daily for developing etc, One thing that consistently annoys me about Windows laptops is the fan noise under load and the frequent Windows updates. another issue that i have read is the Snapdragon may have software compatibility quirks.The MacBook M4 (16 GB RAM, 256 GB storage) is currently discounted to €1,148 in the EU. Should I go with the budget-friendly Acer or invest in the MacBook for the long term?extra information, i already own a high-end gaming Windows PC, but i dont even play that much, and not planning on using either laptops for gaming anyways.",

Can you estimate the project's complexity (considering I'll be working on it in my spare time, which is limited)?So, my stack is.NET and C# — I chose them because I'm most familiar with them, although I know other languages ​​as well. The development environment is VS (not Code).I decided to choose PostgreSQL because it's free, and I have experience with it.React is a popular frontend framework; I have experience with it. I haven't yet decided on the language: JS or TS.So, it will be an API + UI project.Regarding the project itself, I've decided to do something like this. The system downloads and parses currency rates from various sources (primarily from national banks), exchange rates, and where possible, historical data (mostly daily data, not per-second). Then, via the API and web application, it can be viewed, analyzed, and downloaded. I chose such a project because that was truly useful and, in my opinion, fairly straightforward. On the one hand, I want to create something useful, perhaps with real users, feedback, and so on, which will motivate me. On the other hand, I don't see any particular technical difficulties.Yes, I have experience programming in various languages ​​and environments, and I have experience working with data, but I'm not a programmer. The goal of all this is to have fun (I enjoy programming for its clear, logical narrative and organization), and also to learn skills that can be useful in my work.",

The third one I don't like since the endpoint is not mapped to an entity directlyWhat do you think, or do you have other ideas on how to tackle this requirement?And in interviews like this in general, do you think it is okay if we require the user to provide IDs of the entity they are seeking as query parameters?",

I'm going to use a Linux development environment, so download and set up your favourite Linux system: I'm using Lubuntu 18.04.\\>I'm going to target two hardware platforms: Intel x86-64 and 32-bit ARM. I'll use a PC running Lubuntu 18.04 as the Intel target, and a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian as the ARM target.\\>On the Intel platform, we are going to need an existing C compiler. So, install this package (I give the Ubuntu/Debian commands):So my two questions are:Q1) If I want to follow along and build the compiler, how do I do so if my processor is not an x86-64 ?Q2) It says to use Lubuntu 18.04 but I read that this isn’t supported anyway and it won’t be safe to use it if I will be using the internet etc. Anyway around this? If I use a diff operating system than what he uses, will that also make it impossible to follow and build along with him?Thanks so much !Edit: found something interesting:[https://studios.ptilouk.net/superfluous-returnz/blog/2022-03-16\\_macos.html](https://studios.ptilouk.net/superfluous-returnz/blog/2022-03-16_macos.html)A tutorial on how to cross compile to macOS - but here’s what confuses me - at the end he tests it in a Mac virtualbox; so why not right from the get go just install this mac virtualbox or some other container or VM thing and the install vs code in that and then do all the building?",

So don’t bogged down by the hype.[Twitter post](https://xcancel.com/AndrewYNg/status/1989003741316673714)[Blog post](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-327/)Highlighting the most relevant bits:> Andrew Ng @AndrewYNg > I recently received an email titled “An 18-year-old’s dilemma: Too late to contribute to AI?” Its author, who gave me permission to share this, is preparing for college. He is worried that by the time he graduates, AI will be so good there’s no meaningful work left for him to do to contribute to humanity, and he will just live on Universal Basic Income (UBI). I wrote back to reassure him that there will still be plenty of work he can do for decades hence, and encouraged him to work hard and learn to build with AI. But this conversation struck me as an example of how harmful hype about AI is.> […]> Even though LLMs can handle a much more general set of tasks than previous iterations of AI technology, compared to what humans can do, they are still highly specialized. They’re much better at working with text than other modalities, still require lots of custom engineering to get it the right context for a particular application, and we have few tools — and only inefficient ones — for getting our systems to learn from feedback and repeated exposure to a specific task (such as screening resumés for a particular role).> […]> AI has stark limitations, and despite rapid improvements, it will remain limited compared to humans for a long time.> […]> Modern AI is a general purpose technology that is enabling many applications, but AI that can do any intellectual tasks that a human can (a popular definition for AGI) is still decades away or longer. This nuanced message that AI is general, but not that general, often is lost in the noise of today's media environment.> […]> Similarly, the progress of frontier models is amazing! But not so amazing that they’ll be able to do everything under the sun without a lot of customization. I know VC investors who are scared to invest in application-layer startups because they are worried that frontier AI model companies will quickly wipe out all of these businesses by improving their models. While some thin wrappers around LLMs no doubt will be replaced, there also remains a huge set of valuable applications that the current trajectory of progress of frontier models won’t displace for a long time.",

Big surprise, the deadline has been pushed. After weeks of trying to force a broken system into production my manager finally came to the realization that the timeline will have to shift and we have to meet the requirements of the actual dev team and their stakeholders. I want to say thanks for all the support on my last post, the advice to document everything really came in handy. I started giving written summaries of meetings into the main slack channel directly. Started writing emails and cc'ing people. It def helped me have my case about communication from my end.",

I was laid off ~1.5 months ago from my previous firm and worked with a specialized headhunter who focuses on placing prop trading SW and FPGA engineers. I didn't personally submit any applications—everything was handled by my HH. We applied to eight firms/quant funds in a targeted fashion. My HH's relationship with certain firms allowed me to bypass a few bureaucratic HR stages and get in front of hiring managers immediately.This was my first time on the market as a Senior and my interview experience mostly aligned with how I chose to prepare. The mix of questions I encountered was roughly 9:1 domain-specific C++ to LeetCode-style DSA. There were a bunch of questions on deep C++ features, trading-specific minutiae (exchange protocols, executing a low latency strategy on a particular exchange), lock-free algo knowledge, etc. Ironically, the rounds that tripped me up the most _were_ LeetCode-style questions, so I regret not doing more than the 10-15 questions I practiced but overall my preparation was accurate.I withdrew from the interview process at three firms since I received a solid offer from a firm I liked (on a desk/team I liked as well). I anticipate I would've gotten another 1-2 offers had I seen those through to the end but I was satisfied.* Timeline from start of search to offer: 1 month* TC: ~$500K* Location: Chicago* Preparation: 10-15 LeetCode questions and implementing dozens of lock-free/high-performance data structures in C++. Reading a few intermediate to advanced C++ books to refresh (think Nicolai Josuttis, et al.). Playing around with some language features in the newer standards (C++23/26).",

Received an offer for a Staff UI Architect position at a well known semiconductor company (not Nvidia).This position is really unique- it's a hybrid of Front End Engineering + UI/UX Design. I was tested on designing UI's for semiconductor (switches, data center etc) data visualization, as well as javascript fundamentals. I initially asked, wouldn't you want a graphic designer since bulk of the work is UI/UX design? but they said no, they could never understand the technicals of FE dev nor EE. they wanted someone who knew UI/UX design, FE, AND EE. So i was a unique fit for the role.Stats:\\-280k TC\\-High level role with mostly design + telling other devs what to create, less coding\\-5 days a week, 30mi commute (45m no traffic, 1.5hr traffic), absolute killer. + Occasional travel overseas to india.**UPDATE** 4 days a week, 30mi commute 10AM-2:30PM, avoids traffic, 45mins. On call for overseas folks 8-10PM.\\-highly rated on glassdoor, low layoffs compared to peers\\-incredibly smart EE folks with buncha guys PhD from MIT in Physics, cutting edge tech\\-I studied EE in college but pivoted to FE dev and now this is almost going back to my roots.\\----I have an potential incoming offer with a well known Streaming company (not Netflix), traditional Senior Front End SWE. Estimated stats:\\-220k TC\\-Standard Senior IC role, all coding\\-3 days a week, 7mi commute (15-30mins)\\-low rated on glassdoor, citing poor leadership\\-huge fan of their product, if i told my friends i worked here they'd be like thats so cool!Thoughts? I always love getting opinions from reddit so do please give your honest opinions!I will give back to the community and do a write up of my interview experience in 2025, with interview questions, app:offer ratio etc. I studied so fukin much my brain's gunna melt. Thanks!PS- job market is hard af (worse than 2008-2012) dont let anyone tell u otherwise. i had to study 3x harder than before.",

I even had one guy try to convince me to move to California from the Midwest for a contract role. When I told him I’m not moving across the country to a HCOL area for a contract role he replied “but you’ll get to work alongside Nvida!!!” To which I replied “yeah with no job security, no guarantee of a role after 6 month contract is up, no PTO, less benefits and no paid holidays.” He started blabbering about Nvidia again and I hung up on him. Is this the future of work? Just a giant contractor workforce so these companies can offer us shittier/no benefits and even less job security so they can pad their bottom dollar even more? Why are these recruiters expecting me to move across the country for a contract?",

I’ve only been working there for a month and was in the same place as all of these people so I try and help as much as I can, but so many of the messages I’ve been getting are terrible. Here’s what I’ve identified to hopefully help some people improve their chance at getting a referral.Don’t say stuff like:“Hey cristinon, I’m really impressed by Company and would love to hear about how your team operates day-to-day. Could we chat sometime?”Super vague, unclear what you want. Ask a specific question if you are genuinely interested.“I’m curious how your team uses Tech and Tech in production, would love any insights you can share!”Again vague and I can’t tell you these specifics.“I’m very interested in the engineering culture at Company, could you tell me more?”The worst one this must be some kind of template because I get it so much. What am I supposed to tell you? Ask a specific question.“I’m exploring opportunities in software engineering at Company, are there any roles I could apply for?”Look on the careers page, some people even say this after mentioning they have applied to a certain job. I don’t work in HR idk.“Could you let me know if your team is hiring?”Again, idk ask HR or look on the website.“I will send you my résumé, please review it and let me know whenever you’re free.”I’ve gotten this word for word. I’m not your boss, or the hiring manager. Sounds too commanding.“I’ve heard great things about your team and Company, and I’d love to know how you got started there.”I applied just like you are, idk what I am supposed to say. Very vague.“Would love to hop on a 15-minute Zoom to hear about your experience.”Type whatever question you have I don’t have time for calls. It’s not my job to hire people.The fix for all of these is to directly ask a specific question. Make it easy for the person to reply and be nice and that’s all it takes.If any of these people had just asked something specific like “Can I get a referral?” I would have gladly tried to help. Instead I don’t know how to even reply so I don’t.TLDR:- keep your message short (few sentences)- be nice- don’t ask for calls- ask something easy to answer- be specific- understand what position the person you are messaging has- don’t give tons of vague compliments- don’t be overly formal",

I can put a ton of effort into troubleshooting some failure and fix it, just to get grilled in a meeting on the one little detail that I missed. I can work hard on a project just to get asked by my manager why it isn't done yet.Speaking of my manager, he is an anxious basket case who will randomly walk up during the day and ask me to drop everything that I'm doing to work on something \"urgent\". After finishing the \"urgent\" task, he'll ask me about the work that got postponed and why it's behind schedule. To make it even worse, he'll do it in the most condescending way, asking if I \"need help\", or trying to reassign my work to others. No, I don't need help. I need you to leave me alone so that I can do my work that I was already planning to do.As for the work itself? Very rarely do I get to build or design something interesting. The majority of the time, I'm digging through the shitheap trying to figure out what this service with 20k lines of code and no comments does. Or reading through internal documents that were written by someone with a 3rd grade vocabulary and not updated for the past decade.Very rarely do I heard any kind of positive feedback. Most often it is criticism. You could've done this faster. If I do it faster, it could've been cleaner. This despite the fact that our codebase is filled with garbage code that I had to dig through to get what we have today.I also don't really feel like I'm learning valuable skills. I spend maybe 15% of my time *actually writing code.* The rest of my time is spent digging throug garbage trying to figure out why nothing works.I don't know how to end this post, so here's a link to an article about bananas.

Seems like with Comp Sci careers you can advance perfectly fine without any post-secondary education. Would a part-time MBA actually move the needle for a software developer? Or a master’s in computer science? I don’t want to let this benefit go to waste, but time is a limited resource too, and I don’t want to sink a few years into something that barely impacts my career.FWIW I also am a boot camp grad, and with the decline in reputation of coding boot camps lately, I do wonder if it'll be worth it getting a \"legit\" comp sci degree to strengthen my credentials and protect my career prospects long-term.Would love to hear your thoughts, thanks in advance!\\------**EDIT**: just to provide some additional context -> The company I worked at prior to this one was quite established. Not FAANG, but a major bank. My resume has some interesting projects. I'm not exactly drowning in recruiter linkedin messages everyday, but I also don’t have trouble landing interviews. Given that, would getting a formal CS degree still be worth it to “solidify” my legitimacy, or is it unnecessary at this point?**EDIT 2:** Something I mentioned in a reply that I’d like to hear more perspectives on:with AI making it easier for people to fake experience or inflate resumes, do you think companies might start relying more on formal degrees again as a credibility filter? It’s something that honestly gives me a bit of anxiety, since I came up through a bootcamp route.",

My interests in the future are to work on backend systems.I recently got a full time offer from Atlassian and I am expecting to receive a full time return offer from AWS (not sure when but I got the incline email in September). Below are the comp packages for the offers (all in CAD):Atlassian:* 105k base* 10k sign-on bonus* 10% yearly bonus* 100k RSU (linearly loaded)* Remote work (plan to stay in Vancouver area as I am settled here)* Team matching will be done when I onboard in August 2026AWS (based on a friend's recent offer letter):* 115k base* 35k sign-on bonus* 110k RSU (5/15/40/40)* 5 day RTO at Vancouver office* Most likely will be team matched to a team in AWS billing orgI'm really happy to get an offer with a company that is remote first but my concern is making sure I get good experience on my resume to help build my career.I'd love to hear from anyone who has worked at Atlassian. What's the engineering culture and career growth like.?Also I am seeking advice on what to do if AWS return offer comes through.edit: added punctuation.Update:I wanted to say thank you to everyone who commented! It's been interesting to read through the your guys opinions and advice. I still have some time to decide with the offer I have, I will update this post later with my thoughts.",

        "content": "No question, just sharing and discussing my experience with the UK job market.So, I graduated with a masters in mathematics in early 2020, and got my first offer for a developer job just under 2 years later at the end of 2021 on a 20k salary. I left after a year because it was shit.- They had unreasonable expectations. My first task assigned on day 2 was to independently build an entire data analysis and prediction system from scratch. Literally just \"here's all the data we have, we want to do XYZ, go and figure it out and make it work, and have it ready in 3 months\" and no other guidance or requirements- It was highly stressful with bad WLB. Unpaid overtime was expected of everyone regularly, and people were asking and answering questions late into the evening most days, and on most weekends- They had a horrible open office environment with music playing in the background, people constantly talking about non-work-related things, people regularly shouting information from one side of the room to the other, and a table of customer support right in front of me taking phone calls all day- Mandatory 9-5 in office 5 days a week, no exceptions. A day out of the office for any reason is a day's pay deducted from your salary- Near-minimum wage salaryAfter I left (and before I left), I started applying for more jobs, expecting that it wouldn't take too long to find a new job, since my new CV was much much better than my old one.Anyway, long story short, after 3 years of applying to jobs (mostly software dev but not entirely), I had a total of zero offers.More recently, I decided that since I quite like driving, I'd start looking at driving jobs. HGV driving seems like something I'd like, but the training and licensing costs thousands so there's no way I can afford it. I also started looking at delivery driving, and here are the results of my job search.Software dev (approximate numbers): https://i.imgur.com/bYlxdC4.pngDelivery driving: https://i.imgur.com/VVUppoQ.pngSo... a slightly different experience. I applied, got a response the next day asking to confirm that yes, I can actually drive, and then had a call to arrange my start date where I would begin training. No CV needed to apply, no experience needed, no references needed, no interviews, and no other questions. Just \"can you drive\" and \"when can you start\". Oh and it pays 50% more than my 2022 software dev job.I now see that this is what it looks like for a job to be in demand. If tech was in demand, you'd apply, prove that you can write basic code, and then get an offer. And yet, somehow, people STILL think that tech is in high demand and there is a shortage of developers.",

I am already cleared for my master's classes. Honestly I am very burnt out doing this and school. I am clocking 30-40 hours a week at this internship with school. with a total weekly load of around 70-80 hours. doing this would continue to pad my resume, but kill my soul inside, not because i hate the work. I love it. but because i fear I won't be able to find work without more experience. they are not paying me terrible for this internship around 30/hr. they also treat me like a real engineer. so, I have learned a lot and had a blast it is just a lot juggling school and this. I am burnt but I see how horrible the market is. and want to keep buffering my resume given any chance to increase my odds of getting a job. I have no doubt they are probably exploiting me, but I need the experience to break in so i am willing to tolerate it.",

I think I need a reality check, especially from those who have worked in this field for a number of years.**TL;DR:** Top-tier education (CS PhD). Landed a quant developer job at a fund in a low-tax / no-tax region. Pay is relatively good (\\~$185k tax-free money). Job was a \"bait-and-switch\", which went from building cool new tech to endless data-munging. I'm miserable and have lost passion for coding.**My Background:*** **Education:** PhD in CS (Systems and Networking) from a top Asian university. BSc from another top Asian university.* **Current Role:** 1 year as a quant developer at a financial firm (think HFT or fund) in a major hub with very low / no taxes.**The \"Golden Handcuffs\":*** **Salary:** In the $180-190k USD range, tax-free.* **Perks:** Good vacation and remote policy.**The \"Bait-and-Switch\" Problem:*** The first 6 months was great. I was tasked with a challenging R&D project using a modern tech stack (Rust), which I had to learn on the fly. It was exactly what I wanted.* Afterwards, that project was suddenly and quietly de-prioritized. My manager reassigned me to what is effectively a data integration role. My entire job now is just endless, repetitive grunt work, fighting with terrible data formats from vendors and doing basic ETL.* To make it worse, the senior devs on the team have all managed to get themselves onto new, interesting projects, leaving me and other juniors to handle this \"data plumbing.\" Management is vague when I raise concerns. Changing teams isn't an option either.I feel that my passion for coding is gone, extinguished by this job. I feel miserable and am experiencing burnout symptoms. I have zero energy or interest in side projects or open source (which I was quite keen on before).**My Questions:**1. Is this loss of passion just a temporary reaction to this specific job? Or is it a sign I'll just end up in another \"boredom -> misery\" cycle if I change jobs?2. Am I just being an entitled or lazy person who \"hates all work\"? The relatively decent salary makes me feel incredibly guilty for complaining.3. What's a viable path? Other quant firms, tech companies, crypto, or simply stop complaining and keep cleaning data?I feel like my career is stalling and I'm wasting my life. Any advice would be appreciated.",

It's safe to say that my school is in the top list.But here’s what’s messing with my head, it’s not just Reddit saying CS is cooked. Almost everyone I talk to in real life says the same thing oversaturated, too competitive, no jobs etc. Seeing it everywhere makes me second guess whether I’m making a mistake.I’m not choosing CS blindly. I genuinely enjoy it, and I know every field has its own problems right now. I just want to know if I’m being unrealistic for choosing CS in 2025, or if it’s still a reasonable path as long as I go in with the right expectations and work ethic. Also I'm not in the field only aiming for money. Would love honest takes from people actually in the field.",

        "content": "I’m currently a junior SWE at LinkedIn in Bay Area(~1.5 years experience) and recently got an offer for an IC3 role at Robinhood. I’m conflicted on whether to take it.The team’s work isn’t super exciting product-wise, but the tech stack is modern and the career growth seems stronger than at LinkedIn. The work is also technically complex, which is appealing.My main hesitation is location — I’ve been in the Bay Area for ~1.5 years, but I really want to move to NYC, where most of my friends and family are. I can see my social life improving drastically there.Option A – Take the Robinhood offer- Location: Menlo Park (Bay Area) — I really wanted NYC- Pay: ~10% increase from LinkedIn- Equity: Better long-term upside than Microsoft/LinkedIn, but possible short-term downside- Career growth: Likely stronger (faster-paced team, more technical scope)- Mobility: Can’t change location while on the same team — I’d need an internal transfer to move to NYC- Promotion policy: Must stay at least 1 year in a role before being eligible (regardless of total experience)- So realistically, I’d be in the Bay for at least a year before I could transfer or get promoted (IC3 → IC4 after ~2.5 YOE)- Promotion timelines at LinkedIn are similar anywayOption B – Stay at LinkedIn- I could ask the recruiter to pause my Robinhood application and reopen it in January to see if any NYC teams open up (not guaranteed)- In the meantime, I’d stay at LinkedIn, though I’m feeling stagnant and unmotivated- LinkedIn has better WLB and is easy to coast at (though that may hurt long-term growth)- I could also interview for other NYC roles in early 2025, but the prep/interview grind is taxing and affects my current job performancePriorities (in order)1.Long-term career growth2.Being in NYC3.Compensation / equity4.Work-life balanceRobinhood would push my career forward technically, but I’d have to stay in Menlo Park for at least a year working on a product I’m only moderately excited about.Staying at LinkedIn feels stagnant, but gives me flexibility to pursue NYC roles sooner — though that path is uncertain.Would you:- Take the Robinhood offer as a growth move, stick it out in the Bay for a year, then try to transfer to NYC or pivot externally?or- Decline and wait to reapply in January for potential NYC roles (and keep searching in the meantime)",

        "content": "I have been with my current employer for five and a half years and have held my current position, senior engineer, for two and a half years.For the past two years, I have effectively took the job of my team's technical lead after taking charge of our largest and longest-running project to date, which spanned nearly two years. I acted as the project lead and architect, while also implementing a significant portion of the actual code.After the project was successfully completed and delivered, I expected management to be receptive to promoting me. However, they sidestepped the question by moving me into a \"Software Architect\" role. I am expected to own the technical direction of the aforementioned project and guide other teams as well too. They will move me to report to my current second-line manager but this does not include a promotion.This is particularly disheartening because I pushed myself exceptionally hard over the past two years and that took a toll on my personal life.Consequently, I am now exploring opportunities outside my current company. My hesitation stems from three factors: First, the current job market is challenging. Second, although I have been performing as a technical lead, my official title does not reflect this experience. Third, while my base salary is market-average, my total compensation, which includes additional pay for on-call duties and RSUs comprising about 25% of my yearly income, is well above market expectations for my formal title.I was recently approached for a \"Senior Engineer\" position and successfully interviewed for the role. This opportunity would match my current base salary plus on-call compensation, but I would lose the 25% of my income tied to RSUs. The company itself is exciting, they are involved in problems that are high in scale and they have a nice buzz in their domain.Given this, am I making a mistake by considering this role, which involves switching \"back\" to a senior title and accepting less total compensation?EDIT:Thanks for the answers! Everybody seems to be somewhat of the opinion that I would be making a mistake.This opportunity also offers a major perk, the work environment. The team is composed entirely of senior and staff engineers at a startup focused on building highly scalable solutions.",

I don't wanna put all my eggs in one basket for like IT if I do end up with a dev role but I feel like my mind is trying to go too many ways on top of the time this job hunt has been taking and I feel my motivation dwindling and I feel my skills suffering more than growing. My last job kinda left a bad taste in my mouth for development work so personal projects feel more like a chore and I hit that motivation issue. I had motivation months ago but I feel like I've landed and am stuck in a rut. Also all that on top of hearing about horror stories of folks in CS fields who are being overworked. Is this feeling common? If not what advice do people have?",

I don't know what these companies want but it's very frustrating and demoralizing if you're a job seeker. I can only imagine junior devs or people with out of date skills have it even worse. If I was at least given an interview with the hiring manager (technical or otherwise) and bombed it, that would be fair, but I was rejected without the hiring manager ever meeting me, even though the HR screener thought I was a good fit.

He said that he understood, but in the last year or so I keep getting shifted off projects and I am not able to acclimate myself to a single workflow.* Before this I was doing OS automated testing in Python with Pytest.* I was switched to a new team which does Python testing with Squish. So I was brought up to speed on that.* One of the other testers introduced a new way to run our automated tests through Jenkins. So I was brought up to speed on that and got a Jenkins pipeline we as testers could deploy from for verifying changes we did to our branches before merging to master. Eventually having to update existing tests because they were having issues running through Jenkins.* There was some drama from management and the testers on workflows. Not going into it, but it led to a lot of flip flopping between the old and new workflows.* The last PI there was a high priority project that needed assistance and I was told to assist for 6 weeks on manually running complex test scenarios that hadn't been automated yet.* I feel adrift, useless, and unproductive. I cannot focus and I am still trying to find ADHD techniques to focus but am having trouble finding one that works.I don't know what is happening, I was good at my job up until COVID and now I feel as though I am worse than when I was entry level. I have a massive headache and my brain feels like its trying to escape my skull because of the anxiety.Edit: I am getting medication.",

I've applied what I've learned to my job, creating easy to read dashboards for various metrics and automating many of my data cleaning tasks with Python. When I talked to my cousin who works in tech about the feasibility of switching careers into something like Data Analyst or Business Analyst, he told me \"to be completely honest, your resume won't get looked at without a related degree.\" He told me that the stuff I learned is \"easily replaceable with A.I\" and that I need to get way more technical and learn Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, or a very specific technical field along with a degree in order to have a chance at switching industries.I was disheartened to hear this, but if he's telling the truth, I don't want to waste my time self-learning if it's not going to lead to a job. I didn't want to go back to school given the extensive time and money commitment it would be, but if it's the only chance I have to find a higher-paying job, I can bite the bullet.

I’ve also considered FAANG, but the roles I’ve been interviewed for are usually highly niche or very company-specific.In summary, I love the work I do and genuinely enjoy my job.

Looking at some other posts and data points, it seems that others have managed to negotiate for higher.Just wondering if theres any possible repercussions for me trying to negotiate again, what a good target is (asking for sign on maybe?), or just any general advice for offer negotiations through email.

I am being paid pretty low and spent my unemployment being depressed and taking care of a family member. I applied for a state job and got in. They use legacy tech like Java EE. I am not sure if this is a right move and I would like for a decent company atleast once. But the current work is hectic and I working a lot and getting exhausted. My contract is ending in this month and the only job I got is this state job. I don’t know how to proceed and earn atleast 100k. My current pay is less than 75k per annum. Since layoffs are pretty common in this industry I would like to know if this is an idea to join the state job for job security?. While working there I am also thinking of preparing for interviews and aim for decent paying jobs. Can anyone give me any suggestions to improve my salary?",

A couple of those years were spent in sales engineering but otherwise I've been committing code on a daily basis. I wouldn't say I have ever loved it but I've always enjoyed it. I got into the game late -- I started learning to program a few months before my 30th birthday -- but I never felt at a disadvantage. I've been able to roll with the punches and learn new techs throughout my career.The last few years have been different. I've had a few bad experiences at companies, including one where the CEO was lying about the company's finances. They missed payroll for my first two pay periods, and after about 6 months I got laid off. Since then, I've struggled to stay motivated and find a job in my area (cloud with a focus on Kubernetes, working almost exclusively in Go).I know part of my struggle is the market, but I also know part of it is that the optimistic utopianism that dominated the industry in my early career seems to have given way to a much darker culture that is very extractive and impersonal, even soul crushing at times. I find it very hard to stay motivated in the current climate. It's possible that this is just a reflection of the job market tilting in favor of employers, since the utopianism and benevolent paternalism of companies always kinda felt like BS anyway. But I'm not sure.I know AI has something to do with it, but I don't understand it enough to know what's coming down the pike. I'm not worried about chat bots writing code so much as I'm worried that handcrafted software will be replaced by AI. I would like to embark on a new phase of learning and figure out a new direction for my career, but I'm really stuck. I don't know if this is just a temporary lull or if I need to find a different specialty, maybe one that's AI-based.Any technical or non-technical advice is welcome. I really just need to figure out a way forward.",

        "content": "I have a little over five years of experience at the same FAANG. I was promoted a few years ago and landed on a team with good WLB. In late 2023 that team was cut, but I managed to move internally and have been there since.That layoff pushed me to build my first startup between 2023 and 2025 while working full time. For a bootstrapped product it did well early on, but after 1.5 years and some unavoidable headwinds, I shut it down and we sold it for scraps. That experience made it clear how empty my FAANG job felt in comparison. Startup life was intense, exciting, and the complete opposite of cushy FAANG work.At the start of 2025, after shutting down the company, I tried to fill the void by interviewing aggressively, mostly at unicorns. I went through five full loops and 30+ rounds of leetcode and system design. I ended up with nothing, burned out, and unsure whether I even wanted the roles I was chasing.In the spring, a colleague asked me to help with their fintech startup after their CTO stepped away. I joined part time and have been with them for six months. It has been a great experience with 7k MAU, ~$15m in annual GMV, and we just raised. It feels like a natural step up from my first startup in terms of maturity and traction.My only concern is that all this fulfilling work I do on the side is essentially invisible. I cannot talk about much of it, and companies rarely care about it on a resume. Even my first startup’s early traction, $150k GMV in three months with 6k signups, never seemed to impress anyone - they don’t care or get it. Meanwhile, I feel stagnant in my FAANG job and I am not learning much, but the pay is hard to walk away from.Ultimately, I’m just tired of having two hands in two different pots all the time. I’m concerned about my career prospects. What do yall think?**TLDR:** Five years into FAANG, built one startup that I shut down, now part-time at a fintech that just raised $10m. FAANG job feels stagnant, startup work is fulfilling, but none of it is visible on a resume. Debating whether to go full time on the startup and worried about the career risk in general.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey fellow dev,The job search has been rough these past couple of months. Ever since the H1B visa tax changes, I’ve seen an uptick in interview requests, but landing offers is still proving to be a real challenge. Many companies have packed interview calendars, which makes scheduling and momentum tough. Out of all the interviews I’ve done, I’ve only made it to one on-site so far. In one case, an interviewer even called in sick mid-interview, so I had to reschedule.One company had me go through three phone interviews. The recruiter later told me they’re considering down-leveling me because I don’t have experience with Java Spring—even though I’ve been solid on the technical side. They want one more phone round to “get more signal.”I’ve noticed a pattern: when the phone screen is purely technical, I tend to do well—about half the time I make it to the onsite. But I’ve never cleared a hiring manager screening round in my entire career. Ironically, I’ve passed hiring manager interviews during onsites, probably because they’ve already seen strong technical feedback by then.Over the past month, I’ve been working on STAR-formatting my past impact stories and aligning them with the usual “ideal corporate teammate” attributes. Still, I’m not sure if I’m hitting the mark.One recent hiring manager screen was especially tricky. It was a 30-minute video call. The first half was standard—what I’ve worked on, what technologies I’ve used. Then came the curveball: “Is there anything you don’t like about your current company or would want to change?” I figured dodging it would tank the interview, so I answered honestly. I said that if I were to start a company, I’d invest more in engineering processes and development environment, since I currently spend about 20% of my time firefighting. He followed up by asking what I’ve done about it. For the record, I had raised concerns with my manager (who brushed them off). I told the interviewer that I’ve been pushing for simplification in all aspect.I’ve seen this pattern before—where the interviewer asks what language I prefer for the next step in the interview process (I said Python), and it feels like a setup to give me false hope. Maybe I’m reading too much into it, but these interviews are really tough when you’re not naturally social or charismatic.I guess I’m wondering: am I overthinking this? Or are hiring managers just extra picky right now? I’d love to hear how others have navigated this, especially if you’ve struggled with the same kind of behavioral hurdles.Thanks for reading.------------------------------------I've been employed a lot.

I'm also in early stage interviewing with Home Depot for their 2026 SWE Internship, but I probably won't know if I get that offer for the next few weeks. Is it reasonable to ask Macy's for an extension, or should I just accept it now? The difference in pay is negligible, but is the difference in company worth it?",
