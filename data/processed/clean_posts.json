        "content": "Hey everyone,I recently finished up a take home task for a data engineer role that was heavily focused on AWS, and I’m feeling a bit puzzled by one thing. The assignment itself was pretty straightforward an ETL job. I do not have previous experience working as a data engineer.I built out some basic tests in Python using pytest. I set up fixtures to mock the boto3 S3 client, wrote a few unit tests to verify that my transformation logic produced the expected results, and checked that my code called the right S3 methods with the right parameters. The interviewer were showering me with praise for the tests I have written. They kept saying, we do not see candidate writing tests. They keep pointing out how good I was just because of these tests.But here’s the thing: my tests were super simple. I didn’t write any integration tests against Glue or do any end-to-end pipeline validation. I just mocked the S3 client and verified my Python code did what it was supposed to do. I come from a background in software engineering, so i have a habit of writing extensive test suites. Looks like just because of the tests, I might have a higher probability of getting this role.How rigorously do we test in data engineering?",

        "title": "Why data engineers don’t test: according to Reddit",
        "author": "PotokDes",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Recently, I made a post asking: Why don’t data engineers test like software engineers do? The post sparked a lively discussion and became quite popular, trending for two days on r/dataengineering.Many insightful points were raised in the comments. Here, I’d like to summarize the main arguments and share my perspective.The most upvoted comment highlighted the distinction between data testing and logic testing. While this is an valid observation, it was somewhat tangential to the main question, so I’ll address it separately.Most of the other comments centered around three main reasons:1. Testing is costly and time-consuming.2. Many analytical engineers lack a formal computer science background.3. Testing is often not implemented because projects are volatile and engineers have little control over source systems.And here is my take on these:1. Testing requires time and is costly**Reddit:** The decision to invest in testing often depends on the company and the role data plays within its structure. If data pipelines are not central to the company’s main product, many engineers do not see the value in spending additional resources to ensure these pipelines work as expected.**My perspective**: Tests are a tool. If you consider your project simple enough and do not plan to scale it, then perhaps you do not need them.**Reddit:**: It can be more advantageous for engineers to deliver incomplete solutions, as they are often the only ones who can fix the resulting technical debt and are paid more for doing so.**My perspective**: Tight deadlines and fixed requirements mean that testing is usually the first thing to be cut. This allows engineers to deliver a solution and close a ticket, and if a bug is found later, extra time and effort are allocated from a different budget. While this approach is accepted by many managers, it is not ideal, as the overall time wasted on fixing issues often exceeds the time it would have taken to test the solution upfront.**Reddit:**: Stakeholders are rarely willing to pay for testing.**My perspective**: Testing is a tool for engineers, not stakeholders. Stakeholders pay for a working product, and it should be the producer's responsibility to ensure that the product meets the requirements. If I personally were about to buy a product from a store and someone told me to pay extra for testing, I would also refuse. If you are certain about your product do not test it, but do not ask non-technical people how to do your job.2. Many analytical engineers lack a formal computer science background. **Reddit:**: Especially in analytical and scientific engineering, many people are not formally trained as software engineers. They are often self-taught programmers who write scripts to solve their immediate problems but may be unaware of software engineering practices that could make their projects more maintainable.**My perspective**: This is a common and ongoing challenge. Computers are tools used by almost everyone, but not everyone who uses a computer is a programmer. Many successful projects begin with someone trying to solve a problem in their own field, and in analytics, domain knowledge is often more important than programming expertise when building initial pipelines. In companies just starting their data initiatives, pipelines are typically built by analysts. As long as these pipelines meet expectations, this approach is acceptable. However, as complexity grows, changes become more costly, and tracking down the source of problems can become a nightmare.3. No control of source data **Reddit:**: Data engineers often have no control over the source data, which can lead to issues when the schema changes or when unexpected data is encountered. This makes it difficult to implement testing.**My perspective**: This one of the assumptions of data engineering systems. Depending on the type of the data engineering system, data engineers very rarely will have a say in there. Only where we are creating the analytical system for the operational data, we might have a conversation with the operational system maintainers.In other cases when we are scraping the data from the web or calling external APIs, it is not possible. So what are the ways that we could do to help in such situations?When the problem is related to the evolution of schema (case when data fields are added or removed, data type changes): First we might use schema-on-read strategy, where we store the raw data as they are ingested, for example in JSON format in the staging models, we extract only the fields that are relevant to us. In this case, we do not care if new fields are added. When columns that were using are removed or changed the the pipeline will break, but if we have tests they will tell us what is the exact reason why. We have a place to start investigation and decide how to fix itIf the problem is unexpected data the issues are similar. It’s impossible to anticipate every possible variation in source data, and equally impossible to write pipelines that handle every scenario. The logic in our pipelines is typically designed for the data identified during initial analysis. If the data changes, we cannot guarantee that the analytics code will handle it correctly. Even simple data tests can alert us to these situations, indicating, for example: “We were not expecting data like this—please check if we can handle it.” This once again saves time on root cause analysis by pinpointing exactly where the problem is and where to start investigating a solution.",

        "author": "ssinchenko",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I often hear the question of why Apache Spark is considered \"slow.\" Some attribute it to \"Java being slow,\" while others point to Spark’s supposedly outdated design. I disagree with both claims. I don’t think Spark is poorly designed, nor do I believe that using JVM languages is the root cause. In fact, I wouldn’t even say that Spark is truly slow.Because this question comes up so frequently, I wanted to explore the answer for myself first. In short, Spark is a unified engine, not just as a marketing term, but in practice. Its execution model is hybrid, combining both code generation and vectorization, with a fallback to iterative row processing in the Volcano style. On one hand, this enables Spark to handle streaming, semi-structured data, and well-structured tabular data, making it a truly unified engine. On the other hand, the No Free Lunch Theorem applies: you can't excel at everything. As a result, open-source Vanilla Spark will almost always be slower on DWH-like OLAP queries compared to specialized solutions like Snowflake or Trino, which rely on a purely vectorized execution model.This blog post is a compilation of my own Logseq notes from investigating the topic, reading scientific papers on the pros and cons of different execution models, diving into Spark's source code, and mapping all of this to Lakehouse workloads.Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with Databricks or its competitors in any way, but I use Spark in my daily work and maintain several OSS projects like GraphFrames and GraphAr that rely on Apache Spark. In my blog post, I have aimed to remain as neutral as possible.I’d be happy to hear any feedback on my post, and I hope you find it interesting to read!",

        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering.So about 2 months ago when DuckDB announced their instant SQL feature. It looked super slick, and I immediately thought there's no reason on earth to use this with snowflake because of egress (and abunch of other reasons) but it's cool.So I decided to build it anyways: Introducing Snowduckshttps://preview.redd.it/s50m6as7ge8f1.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd6492295dae218aa8ff2d27b517f2992c389903Also - if my goal was to just use instant SQL - it would've been much more simple. But I wanted to use Ducklake. For Reasons. What I built was a caching mechanism using the ADBC driver which checks the query hash to see if the data is local (and fresh), if so return it. If not pull fresh from Snowflake, with automatic limit of records so you're not blowing up your local machine. It then can be used in conjunction with the instant SQL features.I started with Python because I didn't do any research, and of course my dumb ass then had to rebuild it in C++ because DuckDB extensions are more complicated to use than a UDF (but hey at least I have a separate cli that does this now right???). Learned a lot about ADBC drivers, DuckDB extensions, and why you should probably read documentation first before just going off and building something.Anyways, I'll be the first to admit I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I also don't even know if I plan to do more....or if it works on anyone else's machine besides mine, but it works on mine and that's cool.Anyways feel free to check it out - [Github](https://github.com/danjsiegel/snowducks)",

My main tasks are integrating customers’ ERP systems with our software and building ETL processes.Now, I’m about to transition to a new internal role focused on building digital products. The tech stack will include Python, SQL, Snowflake, and dbt.I’m planning to start learning Snowflake before I move into this new role to make a good impression. However, I feel a bit overwhelmed by the many tools and skills in the data engineering field, and I’m not sure what to focus on after that.My question is: what should I prioritize learning to improve my career prospects and grow as a Data Engineer?Should I specialize in Snowflake (maybe get certified)? Focus on dbt? Or should I prioritize learning orchestration tools like Airflow and CI/CD practices? Or should I dive deeper into cloud platforms like Azure or Databricks?Or would it be even more valuable to focus on fundamentals like data modeling, architecture, and system design?I was also thinking about reading the following books:•Fundamentals of Data Engineering — Joe Reis & Matt Housley•The Data Warehouse Toolkit — Ralph Kimball•Designing Data-Intensive Applications — Martin KleppmannI’d really appreciate any advice — especially from experienced Data Engineers.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I know \"modern data stack\" is basically a cargo cult at this point, and focusing on tooling first over problem-solving is a trap many of us fall into.But still, I think it's incredible how difficult simply getting a client to even consider the self-hosted or open-source version of a thing (e.g. Dagster over ADF, dbt over...bespoke SQL scripts and Databricks notebooks) still is in 2025.Seems like if a client doesn't immediately recognize a product as having backing and support from a major vendor (Qlik, Microsoft, etc), the idea of using it in our stack is immediately shot down with questions like \"why should we use unproven, unsupported technology?\" and \"Who's going to maintain this after you're gone?\" Which are fair questions, but often I find picking the tools that feel easy and obvious at first end up creating a ton of tech debt in the long run due to their inflexibility. The whole platform becomes this brittle, fragile mess, and the whole thing ends up getting rebuilt.Synapse is a great example of this - I've worked with several clients in a row who built some crappy Rube Goldberg machine using Synapse pipelines and notebooks 4 years ago and now want to switch to Databricks because they spend 3-5x what they should and the whole thing just fell flat on its face with zero internal adoption. Traceability and logging were nonexistent. Finding the actual source for a \"gold\" report table was damn near impossible.I got a client to adopt dbt years ago for their Databricks lakehouse, but it was like pulling teeth - I had to set up a bunch of demos, slide decks, and a POC to prove that it actually worked. In the end, they were super happy with it and wondered why they didn't start using it sooner. I had other suggestions for things we could swap out to make our lives easier, but it went nowhere because, again, they don't understand the modern DE landscape or what's even possible. There's a lack of trust and familiarity.If you work in the industry, how the hell do you convince your boss's boss to let you use actual modern tooling? How do you avoid the trap of \"well, we're a Microsoft shop, so we only use Azure-native services\"?",

I have a somewhat successful career working 10 years in consulting and 3 years at Microsoft as a CSA.My wife is 29 years old, has a somewhat successful career on her filed which is Chemical Engineering. She started in the labs and moved to Quality Assurance investigator later on, she is now just got a job as a Team Lead in a quality assurance team for a manufacture company (big one). Now she is struggling with two things:- As she progress in her careers, specially working with manufacturing plants, her work life balance is not great, she always have to work “on site” and also need to work in shifts (12 hours day and night shifts)- Even as a Team Lead role, she makes less than a usual data engineering or security analyst would make in our field.She has a lot of experience handling data, working with statistics and some coding prior experience.What are your opinion on me trying to get her to start again on a data engeineer, data analyst role?I think if she studies and get training she would be a great one, make decent money and be able to have work life balance much better than she has today.She is afraid of being to old and not getting a job because of age vs experience.",

Unit testing is about making sure that some dependency change or code refactor doesn’t result in bad code that gives wrong results. Integration and e2e testing are about the whole integrated pipeline performing as expected. All of those could, in theory, be written as pytest tests (maybe). It’s a “build time” construct, ie *before* your code is released. Data quality checks are about checking the integrity of production data as it’s already flowing, each time it flows. It’s a “runtime” construct, ie *after* your code is released. I’m open to changing my mind on this, but I need to be persuaded.",

        "author": "Which-External6344",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I am a data analyst mostly focused on business intelligence and data analysis. Know SQL, Python, Metabase (BI Tool).The company I work for hires a third-party software company that has built and maintains custom apps and software for us including POS (point-of-sale) and Inventory Management software. Additionally, they built us a customer facing mobile application (we're a restaurant group).They (the software company) uses a Mysql version 5.7 database which I understand reached end of life in 2023. This has caused some annoyances like not being able to use dbt or upgrade past version 0.47.9 of Metabase. Recently, I asked them if we can/should upgrade to Mysql 8 at some point and if there is anything we should worry about since version 5.7 reached end of life (like security, tech debt, etc.).Their response was \"It (5.7) is still widely used today and we don't need to worry about any vulnerabilities, we'll look into upgrading though\". Then after they \"looked into it\" they said it is best for us to stick with 5.7 for \"stability\". I am not a data or software engineer, but it SEEMS like what they really mean is \"It would be a lot of work for us to migrate everything over to version 8 and we don't want to deal with that\". I'm not saying it wouldn't be a lot of work, but my feeling is that using 5.7 is not as common as they try to make it out to be and they just don't want to deal with the upgrade and all that it entails.I'll say again, I know migrating over to 8 would likely take days/weeks/months(?) and is not just a \"click here to migrate and...done!\" kind of thing. The benefits may seem small - me being able to use things like ctes, window functions, the latest version of Metabase (which has some feature that would really benefit us) - but would nonetheless be a great improvement. 1) Is mysql 5.7 still that commonly used?2) Would most company's have already upgraded?3) Besides being an inconvenience, are there actual security issues to worry about if we don't upgrade?",

It's built to scale out as a production-grade, distributed query engine capable of providing low latency, high concurrency analytics, ELT at scale, and particularly powerful analytics on Iceberg, but it's also capable of running on small datasets on a single laptop for those looking to give it a lightweight try.If you're interested in learning more about Core and its launch, Firebolt's CTO Mosha Pasumansky and VP of Engineering Benjamin Wagner wrote [a blog explaining more about what it is, why we built it, and what you can do with it.](https://www.firebolt.io/blog/introducing-firebolt-core) It also touches on the topic of open source - which Core isn't.One extra goodie is that thanks to all the work that's gone into Firebolt and the fact that we included all of the same performance improvements in Core, it's immediately debuting at the top spot on the [Clickbench benchmark.](https://benchmark.clickhouse.com/) Of course, we're aware that performance isn't everything, but Firebolt is built from the ground up to be as performant as possible, and it's meant to power analytical and application workloads where minimizing query latency is critical. When that's the space you're in, performance matters a lot... and so you can probably see why we're excited.Strongly recommend giving it a try yourself, and let us know what you think!",

So I’m not sure if it’s being applied at all. Possibly a bug?As a workaround, I thought of scripting each table process using XMLA and scheduling it in steps. But that would mean one step per table — which is messy and hard to maintain. I also saw references to  and  in XMLA, but it looks like you can’t run multiple transactions in a single XMLA script unless you’re using a SOAP/XMLA client — not SSMS or Invoke-ASCmd.**My questions:**1. Is there a clean way to process each table in its own transaction (automated)?2. Is the \"separate transactions\" checkbox in SSIS known to be buggy? Or is there a workaround?3. If XMLA is the best approach, how can I structure it to avoid memory crashes without having to create 20+ steps manually?Any help or experience appreciated",

        "author": "Lastrevio",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi, I just learned the basics of AWS and I'm thinking of getting my hands dirty and building my first project in it.I want to call the Spotify API to fetch, on a daily basis, the results of a certain Spotify playlist (haven't decided which yet, but it will most likely be top 50 songs in Romania). From what I know, these playlists update once per day, so my pipeline can run once per day.The end goal would be to visualize analytics about this kind of data in some BI tool after I connect to the Athena database, but the reason I am doing this is to practice AWS and to put it as a project on my CV.Here is how I thought of my data schema so far:I will have the following tables: f_song, f_song_snapshot, d_artist, d_calendar.f_song will have an ID as a primary key, the name of the song and all the metadata about the song I can get through Spotify's API (artists, genre, mood, album, etc.). The data loading process for this table will be UPSERT (delta insert).d_artist will contain metadata about each artist. I am still not sure how to connect this to f_song through some PK-FK pair since a song can have multiple artists and an artist can have multiple songs so I may need to create a new table to break down this many-to-many mapping (any ideas?). I also intend to include a boolean column in this table called \"has_metadata\" for reasons I will explain below. The data loading process will also be upsert.f_song_snapshot will contain four columns: snapshot_id (primary key), song_id (foreign key to f_song's primary key), timestamp (which represents the date in which that particular song was part of that playlist) and rank (representing the position in the playlist that day from 1 to 50). The data loading process for this table will be ONLY INSERT (pure append).d_calendar will be a date look-up table that has multiple DATE values and the corresponding day, month, year, month in text, etc. for each date (and it will be connected to f_song_snapshot). I will only load this table once, probably.Now, how to create this pipeline in AWS? Here are my ideas so far:1). Lambda function (scheduled to run daily) that calls Spotify's API to get the top 50 songs in that day and all the metadata about them and then dumping this as a JSON file in an S3 bucket.2). AWS Glue job that is triggered by the appearance of a JSON file in that bucket (i.e.: by the finishing of the previous step) that takes the data from that JSON file and pushes it into f_song and f_song_snapshot. f_song will only be appended if a respective song is not already in it, while f_song_snapshot will *always* be appended. This Glue job will also update d_artist but not all the columns, only the artist_id and artist_name, and only in the cases in which that artist does not already exist, and in the case in which a new artist is inserted, has_metadata will be equal to 0 (false) and all other columns (with the exception of id, name and has_metadata) will be NULL.3). Lambda function, triggered, by the finishing of the previous step, that makes API calls to Spotify to get the metadata of all the artists in d_artist for whom has_metadata = 0. This information will get dumped as a JSON in another S3 bucket.4). AWS Glue job that gets triggered by the addition of another file in that artist S3 bucket (by the finishing of the previous step) that updates the rows in d_artist for which has_metadata = 0 with the new information found in the new JSON file (and then sets has_metadata = 1 after it is finished).How does this sound? Is there a simpler way to do it or am I on the right track? It's my first time designing a pipeline so complex. Also, how can I connect the M:M relationship between the f_song and d_artist tables?",

        "content": "I've built a system where Spark Connect runs behind an API gateway to push/pull data from Delta Lake tables on S3. It's been a massive improvement over our previous Databricks setup — we can transact millions of rows in seconds with much more control.What I want now is user authentication and access control:* Specifically, I want certain users to have read-only access.* They should still be able to submit Spark SQL queries, but no write operations (no INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.).When using Databricks, this was trivial to manage via Unity Catalog and OAuth — I could restrict service principals to only have SELECT access. But I'm now outside the Databricks ecosystem using vanilla Spark 4.0 and Spark Connect, which I want to add, has been orders of magnitude more performant and easier to operate, and I’m struggling to find an equivalent.Is there any way to restrict Spark SQL commands to only allow reads per session/user? Or disallow any write operations at the SQL level for specific users or apps (e.g., via Spark configs or custom extensions)?Even if there's a way to disable all write operations globally for a given Spark Connect session or app, I could probably work around that for my use case by leveraging those applications at the API layer!Would appreciate any ideas, even partial ones. Thanks!!!EDIT: No replies yet but for context I'm able to dump 20M rows in 3s from my Fargate Spark Cluster. I then make queries using [https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.toLocalIterator.html](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.toLocalIterator.html) via Spark Connect (except in Scala). This lets me receive the results via Arrow and push them lazily into my Websocket response to my users, with a lot less infra code, whereas the Databricks ODBC connection (or JDBC connection, or their own libs) would take 3 minutes to do this, at best. It's just faster, and I think Spark 4 is a huge jump forward.",

I'm using dbt with DuckDB for transformations.I've been following best practices and have defined a silver base layer where type conversion will be performed (and tested), but I've been a bit underwhelmed by dbt's support for this.I come from a SQL Server background where I previously implemented a metadata catalog for type conversion in pure SQL - basically storing target strong data types for each field (varchar(20), decimal(38,4), etc.) and then dynamically generating SQL views from the metadata table to do try\\_cast operations, with every field having an error indicator.It looks like I can do much the same in a dbt model, but I was hoping to leverage dbt's testing functionality with something like dbt-expectations. What I want to test for:* Null values in not-null fields* Invalid type conversions to decimals/numerics/ints* Varchar values exceeding max field lengthsI was hoping to apply a generic set of tests to every single source field by using the metadata catalog (which I'd load via a seed) - but it doesn't seem like you can use Jinja templates to dynamically generate tests in the schema.yml file.The best I can do appears to be generating the schema.yml at build time from the metadata and then running it - which tbh isn't too bad, but I would have preferred something fully dynamic.This seems like a standard problem, so I imagine my approach might just be off. Would love to hear others' opinions on the right way to tackle type conversions and validation in dbt!",

I know this is generally forbidden in Kimball modeling, but its unclear to me what the right solution should be. In my scenario, I need to merge two concept from different sources: Stripe invoices and a Salesforce contracts. A contract maps 1 to many with invoices and this needs to be connected at the line item level, which is essentially a product on the contract and a product on the invoice. Those products do not match between systems and have to be mapped separately. Products can have multiple prices as well so that add some complexity to this. As a side note, there is no integration between Salesforce and Stripe, so there is not a simple join key I can use, and of course, theres messy historical data, but I digress.Does this relationship between Invoice and Contract merit some type of intermediate bridge table? Generally those are reserved for many to many relationships, but I'm not sure what else would be beneficial. Maybe each concept should be tied to a price record since thats the finest granularity, but this is not feasible for every record as there are tens of thousands and theyd need to be mapped semi manually.",

        "author": "the_aero_guy",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I am an junior data engineer and I have recently started in a project here at my company. Although it is not a critical project, it is a very good one to improve my abilities in data modeling. So when I dove into it, I have got some questions. My main difficulty here is *how to and what to start thinking of when modeling the data from the original relational model to a start schema data model where it can be used by the dataViz people in PowerBI*.Below is a *very* simplified table relationship that I built to illustrate how the source tables are structured.[Original relational model](https://preview.redd.it/htaxxfp5o38f1.png?width=1278&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb45d6238590975b76a78cb3676fa2e8089211b3)*Quick explanation of the original architecture:*Here, it is a *sort* of snowflake architecture, where the main table is clearly Table A, which stores the main reports (type A). There are also a bunch of tables B's which are from the same type of report (type B) with some columns in common (as seen in the print) but each table has some exclusive columns, which depends of the report the user want to fill (TableB\\_a may have some type of infos that do not need to be filled in TableB\\_d, and so on).So for example, when a user creates a main report in TableA in the app interface, they can choose if they will fill any type B report and, if so, which reports of type B they will fill. There must be a type A report and each one of them can have 0 or many type B reports.Each type B tables can have another two tables:* one for the participants assigned to the type B report* and other to the pictures attached to each of the type B report.There are also many other tables seen in the left side of the picture that connects to TableA (such as Activities and tableA\\_docs) and user related tables, like Users, UserCertificate and Groups. Users, specially, connects to almost every other table by the column CreatedBy.*My question:*I need to create the new data modeling that will me used in PBI and to do so I will use views (there is not a lot of data, so the performance will not be affected). I actually do not know how to start and which steps I can take to start the modeling. But I have an idea:I was thinking about using star schema where I will have 2 fact tables (FT\\_TABLE\\_A and FT\\_TABLE\\_B) and some dimension tables around them. For FT\\_TABLEA I may use TableA directly. For FT\\_TABLE\\_B, I was thinking of joining each trio of tables (TableB\\_x - TableB\\_x\\_pics - TableB\\_x\\_participants) and then union them all using the common columns between then. The exclusive columns may be kept to be consulted directly in the original tables since for the dashboard their data is not important).For the dimensions, I think i can join Users, Groups and UserCertificate to create DM\\_USERS, for example. The other tables can be used as dimensions directly.To link the fact tables between themselves, I can create a DM\\_TA\\_TB, where it will stores the IDs from tables b and the ids from table A (like a hash map).So is my approach correct? Did I start well? I really want to understand **which approach I can take** in this kind of project and **how to think** here. I also want to know great references to study (with practical examples, please).I also do not master some concepts, so I am open to suggestions and corrections.EDIT: Here are some of the metrics I need to show:\\* the status of the reports of Type A and B's (are they open? are they closed?) for each location (lat long data is in TableA and the status is in each TableB) and the map plot to show where each report where filled (independently of the B type of the report)\\* The distribution plot for the level of criticality: how many B reports for each level (10 for low level, 3 for mid level and 4 for high level) (this will be calculated using the data from the reports)\\* alerts for activities that are next to deadline (the date info is in TableB)\\* How many type A and Type B reports are given to each group (and what are their status).\\* How the Type B are distributed between the groups (for example, Group 1 have more activities related to maintenance while Group 2 are doing more investigations activies)And etc. There are other metrics but these are the main onesThanks in advance!",

        "author": "caleb-amperity",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all,My name is Caleb, I am the GM for a team at a company called Amperity that just launched an open source CLI tool called [Chuck Data](https://chuckdata.ai). The tool runs exclusively on Databricks for the moment. We launched it last week as a **free** new offering in research preview to get a sense of whether this kind of interface is compelling to data engineering teams. This post is mainly conversational and looking for reactions/feedback. We don't even have a monetization strategy for this offering. Chuck is free and open source, but just for full disclosure what we're getting out of this is signal to drive our engineering prioritization for our other products.# General PitchThe general idea is similar to Claude Code except where Claude Code is designed for general software development, Chuck Data is designed for data engineering work in Databricks. You can use natural language to describe your use case and Chuck can help plan and then configure jobs, notebooks, data models, etc. in Databricks. So imagine you want to set up identity resolution on a bunch of tables with customer data. Normally you would analyze the data schemas, spec out an algorithm, implement it by either configuring an ETL tool or writing some scripts, etc. With Chuck you would just prompt it with \"I want to stitch these 5 tables together\" and Chuck can analyze the data, propose a plan and provide a ML ID res algorithm and then when you're happy with its plan it will set it up and run it in your Databricks account.Strategy-wise, Amperity has been selling a SAAS CDP platform for a decade and configuring it with services. So we have a ton of expertise setting up \"Customer 360\" models for enterprise companies at scale with any different kind of data. We're seeing an opportunity with the proliferation of LLMs and the agentic concepts where we think it's viable to give data engineers an alternative to ETLs and save tons of time with better tools. Chuck is our attempt to make a tool trying to realize that vision and get it into the hands of the users ASAP to get a sense for what works, what doesn't, and ultimately whether this kind of natural language tooling is appealing to data engineers.My goal with this post is to drive some awareness and get anyone who uses Databricks regularly to try it out so we can learn together. # How to Try Chuck OutChuck is a Python based CLI so it should work on any system. You can install it on MacOS via Homebrew with: brew tap amperity/chuck-data brew install chuck-dataVia Python you can install it with pip with: pip install chuck-dataHere are links for more information:* Git repo: [https://github.com/amperity/chuck-data](https://github.com/amperity/chuck-data)* Website: [https://chuckdata.ai](https://chuckdata.ai)* Launch video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3BBaLPYukA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3BBaLPYukA) * Discord: [https://discord.gg/f3UZwyuQqe](https://discord.gg/f3UZwyuQqe)If you would prefer to try it out on fake data first, we have a wide variety of fake data sets in the Databricks marketplace. You'll want to copy it into your own Catalog since you can't write into Delta Shares. [https://marketplace.databricks.com/?searchKey=amperity&sortBy=popularity](https://marketplace.databricks.com/?searchKey=amperity&sortBy=popularity)I would recommend [the datasets in the \"bronze\" schema for this one specifically](https://marketplace.databricks.com/details/6bc4843f-3809-4995-8461-9756f6164ddf/Amperity_Amperitys-Identity-Resolution-Agent-30-Day-Trial).

        "content": "Hi all,I’m transitioning from a software engineering background into data engineering, and while I’ve got the basics down—pipelines, orchestration tools, Python scripts, etc.—I’m running into challenges around safe development practices.Right now, changes (like scripts pushing data to Hubspot via Python) are developed and run in a way that impacts real systems. This feels risky. If someone makes a mistake, it can end up in the production environment immediately, especially since the platform (e.g. Hubspot) is actively used.In software development, I’m used to working with DTAP (Development, Test, Acceptance, Production) environments. That gives us room to experiment and test safely. I’m wondering how to bring a similar approach to data engineering.Some constraints:* We currently have a single datalake that serves as the main source for everyone.* There’s no sandbox/staging environment for the external APIs we push data to.* Our team sometimes modifies source or destination data directly during dev/testing, which feels very risky.* Everyone working on the data environment has access to everything, including production API keys so (accidental) erroneous calls sometimes occur.**Question:**How do others in the data engineering space handle environment separation and safe testing practices? Are there established patterns or tooling to simulate DTAP-style environments in a data pipeline context? In our software engineering teams we use mocked substitutes or local fixtures to fix these issues, but seeing as there is a bunch of unstructured data I'm not sure how to set this up.Any insights or examples of how you’ve solved this—especially around API interactions and shared datalakes—would be greatly appreciated!",

        "content": "Hi all!Writing to get advice and perspective on my situation. I’m a, still junior, data engineer/sql developer with an engineering degree and 3 years in the field. I’ve been working at the same company with an on-prem mssql DW.The DW has been painfully mismanaged since long before I started. Among other things, instead of using it for analytics, many operational processes run through it where no one was bothered to build them in the source systems.I don’t mind the old techstack, but there is also a lot of operational legacy. No git, no code reviews, no documentation, no ownership, everyone is crammed which leads to low collaboration unless explicitly asked for. The job however, have many upsides too. Mainly, the new management since 18 months have recongnized the problems above and are investing in a brand new modern data platform. I am learning by watching and discussing. Further, I’m also paid well given my experience and get along well with my manager (who started 2 years ago).I have explicitly asked my manager to be moved to work with the new platform (or improve the issues with the current platform) part time, but I’m stuck maintaining legacy while consultants build the new platform. Despite this, I truly believe the company will be great to work at in 2-3 years. Have anyone else been in a similar situation? Did you stick it out, or would you find a new job? If I stay, how do I improve the culture? I’m situated in Europe in a city where the demand for DE fluctuates.",

        "content": "Hello,I'm working on a Python ETL on Databricks, and I've run into a very specific requirement where I feel like I need to interact with Spark's or Hadoop's more \"internal\" methods directly via the JVM.**My challenge (and my core question):**I have certain data consistency or atomic operation requirements for files (often Parquet, but potentially other formats) that seem to go beyond standard `write.mode(\"overwrite\").save()` or even the typical Delta Lake APIs (though I use Delta Lake for other parts of my pipeline). I'm looking to implement highly customized **commit logic**, or to directly manipulate the list of files that logically constitute a \"table\" or \"partition\" in a transactional way.I know that PySpark gives us access to the Java/Scala world through `spark._jvm` and `spark._jsc`. I've seen isolated examples of manipulating `org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem` for atomic renames.However, I'm wondering **how exactly am I supposed to use internal Spark/Hadoop methods like** `commit()`**,** `addFiles()`**,** `removeFiles()` **(or similar transactional file operations) through this JVM interface in PySpark?*** **Context:** My ETL needs to ensure that the output dataset is always in a consistent state, even if failures occur mid-process. I might need to atomically add or remove specific files from a \"logical partition\" or \"table,\" or orchestrate a custom commit after several distinct processing steps.* **I understand that solutions like Delta Lake handle this natively**, but for this particular use case, I might need very specific logic (e.g., managing a simplified external metadata store, or dealing with a non-standard file type that has its own unique \"commit\" rules).**My more specific questions are:**1. What are the **best practices for accessing and invoking these internal methods** (`commit`, `addFiles`, `removeFiles`, or other transactional file operations) from PySpark via the JVM?2. Are there **specific classes or interfaces within** `spark._jvm` (e.g., within `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.FileFormatWriter` or `org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem` APIs) that are designed to be called this way to manage commit operations?3. What are the **major pitfalls to watch out for**? (e.g., managing distributed contexts, serialization issues, or performance implications).4. Has anyone successfully **implemented custom transactional commit logic in PySpark** by directly using the JVM? I would greatly appreciate any code examples or pointers to relevant resources.I understand this is a fairly low-level abstraction, and frameworks like Delta Lake exist precisely to abstract this away. But for this specific requirement, I need to explore this path.Thanks in advance for any insights and help!",

        "author": "thro0away12",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm somebody who worked as a data analyst, data scientist and now data engineer. I guess my role is more of an analytics engineering role, but the more I've worked in my role, it seems the future direction is to make my role completely non-technical, which is the opposite of what I was hoping for when I got hired. In my past jobs, I thrived when I was developing technical solutions in my work. I wanted to be a SWE but leap from analytics to SWE was difficult without more engineering experience, which is how I landed my role. When I was hired for my role, my understanding was that my job would be that I have at least 70% of the requirements fleshed out and will be building the solution either via Python, SQL or whatever tool. Instead, here's what's happening:* I get looped into a project with zero context and zero documentation as to what the project is* I quite frankly have no idea or any direction with what I'm supposed to do and what the end result is supposed to be used for or what it should look like* My way of building things is to use past 'similar projects', navigate endless PDF documents, emails, tickets to figure out what I should be doing* I code out a half-baked solution using these resources* I get feedback that the old similar project solution doesn't work, that I had to go into a very specific subfolder and refer to a documentation there to figure out something * My half-baked idea either has to revert back to completely starting from scratch or progressively starts to bake but is never fully baked * Now multiply this by 4, plus meetings and other tasks, so no time for even me to write documentation. * Lots of time, energy gets wasted in this. My 8 hour days have started becoming 12. I'm sleeping as late as 2-3 AM sometimes. I'm noticing my brain slowing down and a lack of interest in my work. but I'm still working as best as I can. I have zero time to upskill. I want to take a certification exam this year, but I'm frequently too burnt out to study. I also don't know if my team will really support me in wanting to get certs or work towards new technical skills. * On top of all of this, I have one colleague who constantly has a gripe about my work - that it's not being done faster. When I ask for clarification, he doesn't properly provide it. He constantly makes me feel uncomfortable to speak b/c he will say 'I'm frustrated', 'I wanted this to be done faster', 'this is concerning'. Instead of constructive feedback, he vents about me to my boss and their boss. I feel like the team I work on is very much a firm believer that AI will eventually phase out traditional SWE and DE jobs as we know today and the focus should be on the aspects AI can't replace, such as us coming up with ways to translate stakeholder needs into something useful. In theory, I understand the rationale, in practice....I just feel translation aspect will always be midly frustrating with all the uncertainties and constant changes around what people want. I don't know about the future though, whether or not trying to upskill, learn a new language or get a cert is worth my time or energy if there won't be money or jobs here. I can say thugh those aspects of DE are what I enjoy the most and why I wanted to become a data engineer. In an ideal world, my job would be a compromise between what I like and what will help me have a job/make money. I'm not sure what to do. Should I just stay in my role and evolve as an eventual business analyst or product manager or work towards something else? I'm even open to considering something outside of DE like MLE, SWE or maybe product management if it has some technical aspects to it.",

        "author": "Peppers_16",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "**TL;DR:** Metrics look wrong (e.g. bot traffic), analysts estimate what they *should* be (e.g. “reduce Brazil visits by 20%”), and we apply that adjustment inside the DAG. Now upstream changes break those adjustments. Feels like a feedback loop in what should be a one-way pipeline. Is this ever OK?# Setup:Go easy on me — this is a setup I’ve inherited, and I’m trying to figure out whether there's a cleaner or more robust way of doing things.Our data pipeline looks roughly like this:**Raw clickstream events** :down_arrow: ***Visit-level data*** — one row per user \"visit\", with attributes like country and OS (each visit can have many clicks) :down_arrow: ***Semi-aggregated visit metrics*** — e.g., on a given day, `Brazil`, `Android` had `n` visits :down_arrow: **Consumed** in BI dashboards and by commercial analystsHopefully nothing controversial so far.Here’s the wrinkle: Sometimes, analysts spot issues in the historical metrics. E.g., they might conclude that bot traffic inflated `Brazil/Android` visit counts for a specific date range. But they can’t pinpoint the individual \"bad\" visits. So instead, they estimate what the metric *should* have been and calculate a scalar adjustment (like x0.8) at the aggregate level.These adjustment factors are then applied **in the pipeline** — i.e. post-aggregation, we multiply `n` by the analyst-provided factor. So the new pipeline effectively looks like:Raw clickstream :down_arrow: Visit-level data :down_arrow: Semi-aggregated visit metrics :down_arrow: **Apply scalar adjustments** to those metrics :down_arrow: DashboardsAnalysts are happy: dashboards aren't showing janky year-on-year comparisons etc. # Why this smells:Basically, this works until some change has to be re-calculated on past data. Every time we make improvements upstream — e.g. reclassify visits based on better geo detection — it changes the distribution of the original aggregates. So suddenly the old adjustment (e.g., “reduce Brazil visits on 2024-01-02 by 20%”) no longer applies cleanly, because maybe some of those Brazil visits are now Mexico.That means **the Data Engineering team has to halt and go back to the analysts** to get the adjustments recalculated. And often, those folks are overloaded. It creates a deadlock, basically.To me, this feels like a kind of *feedback loop* snuck into a system that’s supposed to be a DAG. We’ve taken output metrics, made judgment-based adjustments, and then re-inserted them *into* the DAG as if they were part of the deterministic flow. That works — until you need to backfill or reprocess.# My question:This feels messy. But I also understand why it was done — when a spike looks obviously wrong, business users don’t want to report it as-is. They want a dashboard that reflects their best estimate of reality.Still… has anyone found a more sustainable or principled way to handle this kind of post-hoc adjustment? Especially one that doesn’t jam up the pipeline every time upstream logic changes?Thanks in advance for any ideas — or even war stories.",

This is will create a far more professional looking website that would look better on my CV but the time invested in these tools might be better used for actual DE tools like Spark, NoSQL, Kafka etc. I am passionate about data and I like building pipelines and I really don't have any interest in frontend.But on the other other hand, what's the likelihood that I need to learn Spark, NoSql, Kafka? People on this sub harp on about how DE is not an entry-level role anyways so would it branching out be more beneficial for someone who's just getting started? Also do employers even look at personal projects?On the other other hand, am I just overthinking this and is my ADHD making it hard for me to make a final decision?Thoughts please!",

It’s been a long road.I was in and out of college for nearly 10 years... sometimes motivated, sometimes burned out. Eventually, I went back to my original major (computer science), got my associate’s degree, and was accepted into a university to finish my bachelor’s.That same month, I moved into a new apartment and met my (now) wife. We hit it off immediately, and after a year of dating, I proposed. Life was moving fast... and for once, in the right direction.After graduation, I spent about a year job hunting. I submitted over 500 applications, spending mornings writing tailored cover letters and revising my resume to match each company’s stack and values.The first company to interview me ended up hiring me after three rounds.1. **Initial screen (google meet)**: resume, background, and intro to the company.2. **Technical interview (google meet.. 4 hours!)**: a mix of debugging, CS fundamentals, and even some brain-teaser-style problems (think: goblin guarding a bridge).3. **Final interview**: in-person, 3.5 hours away. They covered the hotel, gas, and meals.Coming from 15 years in food service, I had never felt so professionally respected. I know this might be standard for many in tech, but it meant the world to me. I worked hard for it and it finally paid off.If you’re out there feeling discouraged, unsure if you’ll ever make it... I’ve been there. More than once. Don’t give up. You’ve got this.",

I tried to undo the last commit but at first it said something about a soft reset not being possible, but I tried again and accidentally ended up uncommiting older changes and the previous revisions my team had done didn't get changed back.

Haven't pushed anything luckily, but soo lost and panicking atm and reaaaly need to get back to the project.

I've been making almost exclusively C and C++ programs and libraries for a few years now, and never really touched anything else. However, I've recently started trying to make stuff for Android and for the web, and **dear lord it's soo much more complicated**.The main problem i have, specially when making Android apps, is that a minimal \"hello world\" example is very complex. I got used to starting with literally 1 file (main.c / cpp), 1 command (the compiler doing its thing), and 1 resulting file (the binary).With Android, a minimal working example has dozens of files, a dozen processes running in the background, a dozen dependencies being downloaded while building, and even if you do everything right, sometimes a bug in one of those hundreds of failure points just breaks everything.A similar situation happens with webdev, though an **actual** minimal project only requires HTML, with most of the complexity existing on the server setup.I know this sounds like a rant, so here's the actual question: Is there a good reason for this, or is it just a case of an environment evolving badly over time?",

I keep reading about it's limitations and how there are libraries out there who can help with this stuff and even if I do encounter it at work, won't I just learn it on the job? Won't I just discuss it with a team on how to implement it?I don't know, I'm new to this so I'm not very sure how to think about this. I see a lot of attention on recursion and all that, but it seems like a solution that only works for such specific and situational problems, or that only works to train the developer to learn to break down problems.

        "content": "So I've been programming for the better part of a decade now (5 years professionally) and as the title says, most of my education in programming comes from teaching myself, or learning on the fly at work, as the programming education I got in my college degree was lacking at best, due to it only being a class or two on python. However while I would consider myself a decent programmer and have been able to tackle any project that's been thrown my way so far, I've been applying to jobs lately and I'm terrified of live programming interviews, mostly due to the fact that while I can certainly work on projects, most of my learning has been more practical than theorical and my fundamentals are weak, and I feel like interviewers notice that.Another reason is that I feel like learning those fundamentals can help me become a better programmer overall, and help me notice and work on any bad habits I have most certainly acquired over the years.Has anyone here been in a similar situation? What would you recommend?I struggle with keeping myself motivated when it comes to learning theory, but when I'm in an environment that is more structured, with tests and deadlines I'm better at following through, so I've been thinking of enlisting in a couple of classes at my local community college, however as those tend to be pretty expensive, I would like to hear any alternatives you might have.Thank you all!",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey everyone,I wanted to put this out there because I’ve been struggling a lot with my growth as a developer and I think I need some external perspective and advice.I’ve been working as a developer for about 4 years now. Recently graduated with a degree in CS, but most of my college years were during the pandemic—so, let’s just say the education wasn’t the most hands-on or practical.To be honest, I feel like I’ve skipped a lot of important steps in my learning journey. I learned (more or less) the basics for starters such as algorithm, datastrucutres and OOP, then jumped straight into building things with frameworks without really understanding the underlying principles or best practices. On top of that, I’ve become overly reliant on AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.). They help me get things done fast, but I’m painfully aware that they’re also masking my gaps in knowledge and critical thinking when it comes to code design, architecture, and problem-solving.On the job side, I’ve never worked on a big team. All of my jobs and freelance projects have been solo. I’ve literally never had a code review in my life. No senior devs to learn from. No one to point out my bad habits. As a result, I have no real benchmark for how “good” my code actually is. I’m constantly second-guessing myself—am I writing maintainable code? Am I using the right patterns? Am I leaving massive performance or security issues behind without realizing it?My main focus has been backend development—working with NestJS, building REST APIs—that’s the part I actually enjoy the most. But I’ve mostly worked fullstack because that’s what companies have been hiring for. I know I need to broaden my skills—GraphQL, performance tuning, security best practices, proper testing strategies, etc.—but I’m honestly lost on where to start and what’s most important to prioritize.Another weakness: I’ve never developed the habit of properly reading and understanding documentation. I’ve mostly been learning through random tutorials, StackOverflow, and now AI. I know this is unsustainable long-term, but every time I sit down to “study” or deep dive, I get overwhelmed and default back to just shipping code.So yeah… I guess I’m at a crossroads. I want to level up. I want to break this cycle. But I feel like I’ve built my developer career on shaky foundations and now I don’t know how to rebuild while still working full time.**If anyone has been through something similar (or has advice on how to build real confidence and technical depth after years of winging it), I’d love to hear your perspective.**What would you focus on first if you were in my shoes? How do I realistically improve my fundamentals while balancing work?Thanks for reading.",

My lecturers were software engineers at top companies and gave so much valuable advice and insight into what it’s actually like working as a software engineer. But whilst learning, they said it’s not important for us to know and fully understand everything, it’s just about us knowing that these things exist and so when we would get the job, we aren’t unfamiliar with certain tech vocab and we can just search it up in the job. So right now I’m about to start React with TOP. But in the back of my mind I know that when it came to the async topics for eg, I didn’t fully understand it and it’s just in the back of my mind. I’d typically just make sure I’m somewhat familiar with it and then just move on. I’ve read the docs but don’t fully get it. I don’t know if me wanting to fully 100% get it is my perfectionist side and therefore perhaps slightly pointless when considering the advice my lecturers gave, or if me having a decent grasp on it is a enough and now I can just move on. I’d really appreciate hearing people’s opinion on this :)",

        "content": "Hi everyone. I'm a 17 year old student from Argentina, currently preparing to study Computer Science at university next year. Lately, I've been diving into low-level programming out of genuine interest. Things like operating systems, compilers, and so on.I’ve read many times that there's a shortage of young developers in these areas, especially compared to the overwhelming number of people going into web development. That sounds like an opportunity, but I don't really see a lot of job listings for low-level roles. Not as visible or as frequent as web/backend openings.So, I’m wondering:* Is low-level programming still a viable and a realistic path?* How do people usually find jobs in this space? Are they mostly through networking, open source contributions, or something else?* Are remote jobs in this field even common, or is being in certain countries a must?* How realistic is it to break into this field from Argentina or Latin America in general?I’m not against going the backend route (which I don't like in any way), but I really enjoy low-level stuff and would love to keep that door open — ideally both as a career and as a serious hobby.Any guidance, stories, or pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Things are generally going well, my work gets done, and I’ve handled some fairly complex features according to my tech lead. I’ve also worked with pen testers, supported QA, and regularly get asked questions about one of our key new features.However, my confidence keeps taking hits. For example, I recently upgraded our Node containers to Node 22 and updated some code using new JS features. But the cloud builder was still on Node 18, and tests failed. A mid-level dev suggested I talk to DevOps since they own the cloud builder and can proparly upgrade it quite easy, which I did, and I submitted my PRs. The next day, my tech lead upgraded the cloud builders himself and told me that I could’ve done it myself, and explained how to do it.Something similar happened a couple of months ago, and I promised to flag such situations earlier, but now I just feel dumb again. These moments hit me hard and make me second-guess myself, even though I’m trying to learn, ask questions, and be proactive.My tech lead and manager have both said I’m doing well, and that I should start doing my own features (which I’ve started planning), but when I make mistakes like this, I feel like I am shit.I know this is likely coming from me more than anyone else, but it doesn’t make it any easier.Has anyone else felt this way early in their career?

It’s been a steady job, but I’ve hit a point where I really want to progress, earn a better salary, and feel like I’m actually growing in my career. The problem is — I feel completely stuck and unsure of the right direction to take.I dabbled in web development years ago (HTML, CSS, a bit of jQuery) and had a couple of jobs back in the 2010-12s, but tech has moved on so much since then. Now I’m looking at everything from JavaScript frameworks like React, to modern build tools, version control, APIs, and responsive design — and honestly, it feels like a huge mountain to climb. I worry I’ve left it too late.Part of me thinks I should go down the cloud or cybersecurity route instead. I’ve passed the AZ-900 and looked into cloud engineering, but I only know the networking basics and don’t feel that confident with scripting or using the CLI. AWS also seems like a potential direction, but I’m just not sure where I’d thrive.To complicate things, I suspect I have undiagnosed ADHD. I’ve always struggled with focus, information retention, and consistency when learning. It’s only recently I’ve realized how much that could be holding me back — and making this decision even harder.What triggered all this is seeing someone I used to work with — he’s now a successful cyber engineer in his 20s. It hit me hard. I know it’s not healthy to compare, but I can’t help feeling like I’ve missed the boat.I’m torn:•Is web dev too layered and overwhelming to break into now?•Can someone like me still make a comeback and get hired in this field?•Or should I pivot to something more structured like cloud or cyber, where maybe the learning path is clearer?I’d really appreciate any advice from those who’ve been through a similar fork in the road — especially if you’ve changed paths later in life or dealt with ADHD while trying to upskill.Thanks for reading.

But with AI tools now, where you can have help writing code and explanations, is it different?How much of actual programming do you really need to memorize these days? Is it enough to just understand what’s happening at a high level, to know what you’re trying to do and why it works, and just look up the details as you go? Or is it still important to know all the algorithms, data structures, and other fundamentals in order to really be a programmer and write solid code?I guess I’m trying to compare it to math class, where it felt like they acted as if you’d never be allowed to use a calculator or look something up, when in reality you could. So I’m asking any professional programmers out there: Do you just know a lot of this stuff naturally because you’ve been doing it for so long, or do you think it’s still essential to learn and really know certain core things, with everything else being okay to look up as needed?",

I haven't gone in-depth with anything just yet.

However, I hit a wall trying to setup and implement Visual Studio Code.With JavaScript, I could just make a js file in any text-based editor, even notepad, and just go. But C# it feels like I need all these add-ons, libraries, plugins and more just to START learning what I can do besides Console.WriteLine(). I feel like I'm being sold dependency on one specific program than learning a language.

However, I’ve also seen people mention that it’s quite expensive, and I’m unsure if the value justifies the cost.If you’ve taken the course (or know someone who has), could you please share your thoughts? Specifically:How was the quality of instruction and mentorship?Was the content in-depth and well-structured?Did it actually help with getting a job or improving your skills?What was the total fee, and do you think it was worth it?Also open to suggestions for other similar programs — paid or free — that offer a structured path to becoming a well-rounded software engineer.Thanks in advance!",

I read how something works if I need it and then program it at the same time. For example I am going through The Odin Project right now. Nearly done with the react course. And for example if I learn a new topic without programming it yet, reading the documentation is so boring to me. Yes I do like to read to understand the main concept but really reading the whole documentation is soooo dry to me.DId anyone ever suffer with that kind of problem? Is programming maybe wrong for me?

I do have a few questions and would appreciate your advice:1. What should be my ideal roadmap or study plan to cover CS50 efficiently in this time frame?2. How many hours should I ideally dedicate each day, considering I want to complete as much as possible before July ends?3. Are there any particular lectures or concepts that generally require extra attention or are tougher to grasp?4. Would you recommend taking notes? If yes, should I write down everything the professor says, or focus on key points? Also, is it better to keep digital notes or go old-school with pen and paper (I don't have prior experience of making digital notes but I need to learn)?5. How does submission of problem sets and projects work?6. Are there any specific tools or software I need to install beforehand?7. How does the free certificate process work? Is it automatic or do I need to register separately?8. Any extra advice, personal experiences, or tips you’d like to share would be greatly appreciated!Thanks a lot in advance!

The games would be 2D puzzle and arcade-style games, mostly web-based and would include a lot of web-dev skills (mostly front-end but also some back-end). All code for the games would be written in plain JavaScript/HTML/CSS, instead of relying on a game-engine/library.I'm trying to understand:(1) Do people feel like learning to program by programming games would given them a solid foundation, or that game programming would leave out too much of \"real-word programming\", like making websites, analyzing data, generating reports, setting up databases, etc.?(2) What sites/curricula do you already know about for learning to program by making games, and what's your opinion of them?",

Every time I try, I either don’t know where to begin, get overwhelmed, or hate the code I’m writing and give up. My GitHub is empty. My resume feels like a joke. I haven’t done any real internships or built anything I’m proud of.I feel like I’ve wasted the past few years and now I only have one year left before I’m supposed to go out into the real world and start applying for jobs. I’m terrified that I’ll graduate with a degree but no real experience, no confidence, and no direction.I don’t want to give up I want to learn and build, I just don’t know where to start or how to push past this block. Every “getting started” guide feels like it’s written for people way ahead of me. I’m good with Java and I’ve taken courses in OOP and data structures but I’ve never applied any of it in a real world setting.To those of you who were in a similar position and turned things around how did you do it?What projects do you recommend for someone trying to build a real portfolio from scratch?Is it too late to land a job or internship before graduating?How can I rebuild my confidence and get back on track?Any honest advice, resources, or personal stories would really mean a lot. I’m tired of feeling like I’m just coasting through and want to use my final year to make a comeback.Thanks for reading",

However, to me, what they call \"opinion-based\" questions are the most interesting type of questions and they tackle the problem of possible ways of solving something.I'm a newbie programmer. I'm developing a C# program. My program has a Configuration class, where I basically need only 1 instance of the object for an entire run of the program, which tells me the class could be designed as a Singleton. However, there is a twist. My program is able to do calculations. A calculation takes some while to complete. My program can only do 1 calculation at a time, but it is possible to set multiple calculations in a queue. A calculation requires the Configuration. When I set a calculation in a queue, I want to take a \"snapshot\" of the state of the Configuration at the specific time, therefore create some sort of a copy of the Configuration. Now my question is - does this go against the Singleton principle? Please be lenient with me. As I say, I'm a newbie, not a C# world champion, so some constructive points would really help me. Thank you very much for any recommendations.",

        "content": "Hola comunidad,Soy de México, recién egresado de la carrera de Ingeniería en Desarrollo y Gestión de Software, y actualmente estoy tomando el bootcamp de FullStack Open, a manera de ya iniciarme en un solo camino para conseguir mi primer empleo.Cuando inicié, mi idea era posicionarme como **desarrollador fullstack** (React, Node.js, etc.), pero conforme avanze en el bootcamp y empiezo a investigar el mercado laboral en México, me han surgido dudas.He notado que:* Hay **una saturación brutal en frontend**, especialmente en vacantes donde piden React o similares.* Muchos juniors salen con ese mismo stack, y he visto cientos de postulaciones por una sola vacante.Estoy empezando a pensar si **en lugar de venderme como fullstack, sería mejor especializarme en backend**, que es un área donde se exige más lógica, estructura y hay un poco menos de competencia.Ya tengo una base en JS con React y Node, pero me interesa explorar algo con **tipado fuerte y más estructura**, como **Java con Spring Boot(algun otro que me recomienden)**. Incluso he pensado que, si en algún punto quisiera volver al frontend, podría aprender Angular, que parece tener más presencia en empresas medianas y grandes.Me gustaría escuchar sus opiniones:* ¿Creen que tiene sentido posicionarse como **backend developer** desde el inicio?* ¿Vale la pena explorar Java/Spring o algun otro?* ¿O es mejor pulir mis habilidades en JS fullstack y simplemente destacar más por calidad que por tecnología?Agradezco cualquier consejo, experiencia o enfoque que puedan darme :folded_hands:",

        "content": "32M, Canada. I'm not sure \"experienced\" is the right flair here, since my experience is extremely spotty and I don't have a stable career to speak of. Every single one of my CS jobs has been a temporary contract. I worked as a data scientist for over a year, an ABAP developer for a few months, a Flutter dev for a few months, and am currently on a contract as a QA tester for an AI app; I have been on that contract for a year so far, and the contract would have been finished a couple of months ago, but it was extended for an additional year. There were large gaps between all those contracts.As for my educational background, I have a bachelor's degree with a math major and minors in physics and computer science, and a post-graduate certification in data science.My issue is this: I see generative AI as contributing to the ruination of society, and I do not want any involvement in that. The problem is that the entirety of the tech industry is moving toward generative AI, and it seems like if you don't have AI skills, then you will be left behind and will never be able to find a job in the CS field. Am I correct in saying this?As far as my disgust for the tech industry as a whole: It's not just AI that makes me feel this way, but all the shit the industry has been up to since long before the generative AI boom. The big tech CEOs have always been scumbags, but perhaps the straw that broke the camel's back was when they pretty much all bent the knee to a world leader who, in additional to all the other shit he has done and just being an overall terrible person, has multiple times threatened to annex my country.Is there any hope of me getting a decent CS career, while making minimal use of generative AI, and making no actual contribution to the development of generative AI (e.g. creating, training, or testing LLMs)? Or should I abandon the field entirely? (If the latter, then the question of what to do from there is probably beyond the scope of this subreddit and will have to be asked somewhere else.)",

        "content": "I wanted to share a frustrating experience I had with a company’s hiring process.A few weeks ago, I received an email from **ThirdLayer** saying they found my application interesting and invited me to complete a take-home challenge. Without much context or follow-up, the email stated:**“Please complete no later than 3 days from the time of this email.”**It didn’t matter when I saw the message or what I had going on--they expected urgency and precision on my end. It was already late in the recruiting season, but since they were a YC startup, I decided to give it a shot. I put in \\~30 hours of focused work. They asked for a full-stack AI copilot that integrates with Google Drive, retrieves relevant snippets, and could be tested by their team, which is an insane task to do in 3 days imo. I still attempted to build it, recorded a video walkthrough, sent them a GitHub invite as requested, and submitted it all on time.No response. Not after 3 days. Not after 7. They didn’t even accept the GitHub invite.  It’s disappointing--especially when they pushed for urgency and responsiveness, but couldn’t extend even basic courtesy in return. I feel like I wasted so much time. I wouldn’t be nearly as frustrated if they had just ignored my application from the start. What stings is that they did respond, assigned an extremely demanding task, and then completely disappeared. Even a simple rejection email would've been good.Behind every resume is a real person with real commitments. I was proud of what I built, and getting ghosted like this felt incredibly disrespectful. Venting to the people around me helped but they also couldn't believe that the company would simply choose not to respond. I guess I moved on now but just sharing this in case others have had similar experiences or know what to do.",

        "content": "Working on an early-startup and while we have been developing fast, my startup co-founder's vibe coding almost broke our product multiple times. We're at the point where we have a few thousands of users, so we can't just mindlessly push to main.But here's an example. Was implementing a rating system the other day for our product where users could essentially rate a piece of content and I had implemented it in a way such that database queries and writes are efficient. I implement the rating system, it's working, and then hand it off to my co-founder to improve the UI as they like. Next thing I know, my co-founder said they noticed a bug and said they fixed it, and I pull their changes. I'm shocked to find that some of the loading times for the sections where ratings are being fetched are extremely slow, which confuses me, as I checked that querying should be quick earlier.I asked my co-founder what was the bug they found earlier. They said they were noticing when a user updated a rating on one page and then navigated to another page, the rating wasn't updated. They thought it was some caching issue (not really understanding how our current caching works since rating data wasn't even be cached on the client) and decided to input the entire section into Claude and ask to fix it and then copy and paste. Claude spitted out a new section that fetched the data in an extremely inefficient way causing the slow load times.I look into the code for about 10-15 minutes. I realized the error didn't have to do with the database or caching at all, but simply because co-founder (or Claude I guess) added different rendering logic on the UI for showing the ratings in one section compared to an other section (so the ratings were being properly updated under the hood but appeared to not be consistent because of UI inconsistencies). After I push the fix, I'm just thinking, yes this was relatively small, but I just lost over 10 minutes fixing something that wouldn't have been an issue with basic software engineering principles (re-using existing code / simple refactoring). Imagine if we were still just pushing to prod.There's another story I could tell here, but this post is already getting long (tldr is co-founder tried to vibe code a small change and then f'd up one of our features just before launch which I luckily noticed on the deployment preview).So, when people say \"AI is going to replace software engineers\", I have to laugh. Even on something that people (wrongly) think is simple like frontend, the models are often crapping out across the board when you look at [benchmarks](https://www.designarena.ai/). I also remembering watching videos and reading articles on products like Devin AI failing over 50% of real-world SWE tasks. Don't be fooled by the AI hype. Yes, it will increase productively and change the role and responsibilities of a SWE, but a non-technical PM or manager isn't just going to be able to create something on a corporate scale.",

Most of the team was non-technical, there were a few other devs on the team but they worked on other stuff, I was the only one working on these java applications so no one really knew what I was doing, as long as the applications worked they were happy. I quickly realized my boss knew very little about development. I would do about 1-2 hrs of work each day then spend the rest of the day doing nothing, and my boss was still impressed and gave me great performance reviews. After 2 years I found another job because I was underpaid and honestly I was bored. My current job has the opposite problem, I work pretty hard and often even work more than 8 hours a day just to keep up with the other devs. The pay is a lot better but it's kind of stressful. I am starting to wish I stayed at the other job even though I made less money. Or I wish I could find a middle ground where the work is challenging enough so I am not bored, but not stressed either.I am curious how hard you work, is there anyone here who does nothing or almost nothing?",

        "content": "Now to start, I will say AI is a fantastic tool. It makes development cycles much much faster. Things that I thought would originally take weeks now take days. That said, the more and more I am using AI for coding, my initial awe at the technology continues to wear off, and now claims that coding will be dead or SWE will go extinct seem far-fetched or overly optimistic at best.After working on some stuff for the past few months, for the initial MVP or demo or prototype, I was always able to spin up something decent with AI. However, when I would create stuff even on the scale of just a few hundred or few thousands of users, I would notice that things would start to break down, and AI actually missed a lot of things during development such as: 1. Performance Optimization: AI won't immediately implement stuff like caching systems, pagination, and database design optimization or indexing without explicitly being told. Let's take caching for example. I wanted to cache results on a page to speed up load times and reduce unnecessary queries to the database. I gave the AI a file for a page to implement caching for and it did it, but then I realized that there was a design flaw that didn't lead to the best UX (when user is performing mutation actions, it seems like the page wasn't being updated until the cache expired so I should clear or update the cache on those actions). Now this may seem like something trivial to a developer, but I doubt a non-technical person using AI would be able to catch these details, know what files to edit, and spin up something fully optimized. Tldr here is that if I just pretty much let AI create my whole app for me, I would end up with something incredibly non-optimized, slow, and would have poor user experience for a larger audience. 2. UI/UX: A lot of people think that frontend will be the first to go. Yes, AI can currently basically zero/one-shot landing pages and basic crud apps. But when these apps need to scale to at least hundreds of thousands of people, and stuff like device responsiveness and accessibility or other UI/UX features becomes important, AI is not giving you solutions out-of-the-box unless it's guided. I came across this [UI/UX benchmark](https://www.designarena.ai) to compare different models, and models today do struggle at really creating production/professional sites, though vibe coding might suffice for a marketing site or hobby app. Those are a few things I noticed, but there are even more things that I mentioned such as infrastructure and systems design, security, etc. that AI isn't getting right yet on its own, and I would be surprised if a person with little-to-no programming experience could ensure are implemented correctly. Now of course, what exactly software engineers do will change (and it already has), but I still think SWEs will still need to serve as an \"architect\" for the AI while the AI takes the role of the \"construction worker\" or \"builder\". We have seen what happens when we allow bad architects to design buildings and infrastructure (people lose their lives). The same should probably apply to who we have use AI to design crucial systems.",

I mean the bubble around creating chat applications or other Gen AI applications that are just wrappers around models from the big 4-5 companies. I want to get some opinions from people who know this field. People who work in the trenches every day. I work at a small company (or I did, I'm in the process of being laid off). They do contracts for small companies, and some sub contracting for the government. My Ceo, my CTO, and the head of software engineering are all obsessed with Gen AI, agentic frameworks. They are having us build internal tools to create our own chatbot, that they want to market out to other companies and sell. The other day, we were working on a translation \"tool\" within the mcp architecture. One of our senior devops guys, who is very smart and great at the job, asked point blank \"why would a company want this service can't they just ask chatgpt to translate the document?\" The answer, right now, is that chatgpt is a black box. You don't really have any concept of auditibility, how long it actually took to translate the document, what it cost, how accurate it is, etc, just using chatgpt. When you use tools like Langchain and Langfuse with an LLM engine you can track these things. Today, this is useful and I understand the business argument for doing it. But to me it feels like a giant bubble waiting to pop. All we are doing, and anyone else claiming to have a chatbot or agentic system, is putting a wrapper on llms developed by the big 4-5 companies. This seems unsustainable to me as a business model. Let's say tomorrow, Anthropic comes out and says now we have an agentic tool that works directly with Claude models, it's configured to work with them out of the box, and it includes full tracing and auditibility of everything you do. And then 2 months later, Open AI releases their competing tool. Why then would anyone use a bunch of cobbled together 3rd party tools to accomplish the same thing, instead of just signing deals with one of those companies? I feel that once that happens, and I am positive it will happen, the whole ecosystem around agentic applications/MCP/chat applications will collapse. Does this sound crazy to everyone? I'd love to hear some opinions.",

It would be built by pulling all the logs we already collect on all of our network. This would be significantly more detailed than sapience is, and while we do already collect all of these logs, I think this is creepy behavior.

Many complain about how doctors go to school for so long and make so little, but I went to school for just as long(my masters thesis took a while) and I had a 3 year \"residency\" first job for $60k a year, I broke six figures post covid and at this point Im making $0. If I chose MD path Id be making $200k-$600k/year at this point for the rest of my life.",

My relationship with my manager has always been rocky - he has a non-technical background and is currently only an L5. I've spoken to my Sr. SDE and others for advice - they have also had issues with him prior, being very assertive and not taking differing opinions well. I will admit that I can be very combative/vocal (I'm American, he's international).Nevertheless, from 2024 to 2025, I was top of the team in code output and was getting “promo-track” feedback every 1:1. However, long story short, we've had a series of increasingly bad arguments that have broken our relationship: * Early Jan, I pushed back on my manager’s micro-managing, and he got angry, called me into a meeting immediately* He's called me \"defensive\", \"lacking ownership\", and having a \"victim mentality\" for asking for examples for growth areas during end-of-year reviews* I started documenting 1:1s with emails, and he said it felt overly formal and asked me to stop* He prevented me from mentoring an intern because he \"didn't trust me\" after I told him not to micromanage me again in AprilI escalated to my skip last week because it was affecting my mental health. During my meeting with my skip, he even said (verbatim), \"Your manager has a very, very big ego and is hard to work with, it's not just you\". My skip just had a meeting with me today and said that all the managers (my manager, him, and their manager) met and discussed allowing me to transfer to a sister team, effective immediately, as a change of scenery and environment.I desperately need help as to what to do here. I'm just very burnt out from the situation and want to leave. I feel like I failed somehow and want to quit. Here are my options:1. Transfer under sister team now (new tech stack, new manager)1. Stay, wait for focus + pivot, trigger FMLA 1. Stay, invoke FMLA ASAP for mental healthI'm really just done with this company and want to go for option 3. All thoughts appreciated, feeling boxed in.Edit w/ Update:Ended up choosing option 1 thanks to everyone’s advice. Felt like a rock has lifted off my chest really. Went around and gave notice to those on my team whom I’m close with, it was nice but bittersweet :smiling_face_with_tear: They all agreed I made the right choice, lamenting they should all do something collectively to complain against the manager.",

Two questions, second one was pretty tricky (especially given the time constraints) but I managed it. Next round was a video interview with the intention of 20 minute conversation and 40 minute coding challenge. What was the problem? Traveling Salesman problem! Expected to be solved in 40 minutes. This problem(and b-trees) are something I haven’t studied in a long time, so best I could do was a greedy approach in the time given.So, is this a skill issue? Should I accept that there is just no correlation between the skills to get a job and the skills to be good at a job and waste a bunch of my time studying b trees and graph theory and the freaking TSP, or did I get hosed here?It’s my first time interviewing at a FAANG company, so while this feels ridiculous, maybe this is normal? Maybe this is just where the market is currently at? Maybe they wanted to see how candidates react to being faced with an impossible task? (40 minutes for TSP is asinine, right??)",

However, application pages are well past just a resume and cover letter. Now they want me to fill out fields like “How many years of experience in React do you have” or the same with NoSQL or database. Typically I am inclined to answer honestly. However I feel that these fields are often just auto filters that will punish you hard for lying and you’ll never have a person even glance at your resume.

I had nearly two decades of experience building all kinds of things. From game engines to low-level graphics to machine learning, but no degree, no big-name companies on my resume, and most of my freelance work was under NDA, so I couldn’t even show it off publicly. Since then, I learned to approach things differently: I started using platforms like LinkedIn more actively, did a bit of networking, and made a point of showing off my skillset.The post got downvoted pretty heavily. A lot of people didn’t like how I phrased things or maybe didn’t believe someone in my situation could be skilled. Whatever the reason, I got the message: *“You’re not supposed to complain. Just stay in your lane.”****But here’s the update:*** I landed a job as an Embedded Software Engineer.Over the summer, I was approached by three companies. What changed was how I presented myself. I started using LinkedIn actively, and Premium honestly helped me get visibility. On top of that, I shared more of my personal projects and made my skills visible.One company I haven’t heard back from yet. For another, the recruiter told me the position was put on hold but asked if they could reach out again when hiring resumed. For the third, I made it deeper into the interview stages.I was told there were other applicants, most of whom had degrees, but I still ended up getting the offer at the top of the pay range they advertised. The role is Embedded Software Engineer, and honestly it’s a higher-level position than I expected to land right out the gate, but one I’m confident stepping into.What helped most was having solid personal projects to point to. During the technical interview, I didn’t have any trouble with the questions, and the team lead seemed to get a good impression of me fairly quickly.If you’re self-taught and don’t have a degree, the most useful advice I can give is to make your work visible. Start publishing your projects on GitHub, put together a simple portfolio website, and make sure you’re using LinkedIn. If you’re able to afford Premium, it was surprisingly helpful during my job search and the only reason I used it was because they gave me a free trial.What really got the process moving was a recruiter reaching out based on the broad strokes of my resume. Once someone technical took a closer look at what I’d done, things moved quickly from there.I do want to ask though: Why did it seem like people hated my original post so much? I can guess and make inferrences, but I would like to know. It was sort of discouraging and I did shift my focus for a little while as a result, but things went really differently on this last hunt just from some strategic changes.",

Currently I'm interested to continue progressing as an IC but I have zero interest in management, because I hate having to have that responsibility and sitting in meetings all day long sounds horrid.My concern though is that above senior, it seems your responsibilities end up becoming cross-team. With that sounds like a lot of stress. The people I work closely with that are above senior seem like they're always busy throughout the day and even get pinged oftentimes post 5 or 6PM. Feels like they always have a ton on their plate to do both in terms of coding, designs, attending meetings, etc. And the ones I know even still feel like their output outside of meetings is high. Like their brain is just completely on for the entirety of the work day, something I cannot do.I hope to progress above Senior but I don't want to have to sacrifice a ton of WLB for that. Currently I enjoy my WLB. I work remotely, start at like 9-9:30 and end at 5-6, depending on if I have impromptu meetings (my personal policy is end independent work at 5 but if someone needs to meet with me I can stretch until 6, especially since my team is in CT or PST). I completely ignore any pings before/after and that's not a problem. I feel like with my current workload in my team and company, I can progress in my career while still having sufficient brain breaks throughout the day, and at least in my team, there's good support and little pressure.At risk of sounding greedy, my current TC is around like $200k~ but I hope to reach like $300k+ in <7 years, without having to kill myself with work and stress for it. I also have problems with anxiety which is pretty bad in high-pressure, hectic environments that I assume a lot of higher level engineers have to deal with given their responsibilities. I know other companies can pay that amount of mid-level and seniors...but they also work you to the bone. I want to know if my prospects are too idealistic, hence why I'm asking if engineers above senior here can pitch in and let me know how their WLB experiences have been like. Obviously it's company and team dependent but I assume there's a level of similarity between companies given a similar breadth and depth of responsibilities.And I guess a second question to my main one is if you guys think (if you can even predict the future) that the answers to my first question are even relevant like 7+ years down the line.",

This usually takes around 10 to 15 minutes, so by the time I start coding, there's only about 10 to 15 minutes left to finish up and answer any follow-up questions (for each question).In mock rounds with friends, the main feedback I received was that I start coding too late. At first, I thought that was okay since I’m still a new grad and learning, but now I wonder if interviewers expect someone faster and someone who's a perfectionist.

I contributed to core distributed systems work and overall would say I had a strong start to my career.Unfortunately I left without another job lined up, mostly due to burnout and a family tragedy (my brother passed away). When this initially happened I tried to push through and keep the job anyway but once I had some level of financial cushion to support it I thought that thought a year or two out of the workforce would help me process some of the grief I was feeling day to day. The time off ended up lasting longer than I anticipated because it hasn’t been exactly easy to get hired again. I’m actively rebuilding momentum — applying to jobs, prepping for interviews, working on side projects, reconnecting with mentors, and I also got accepted into an MS CS program this fall (with a focus on AI/ML).The gap will be around 2–3 years total by the time I’m back in full swing. I’m not sure whether to focus fully on grad school or keep pushing hard for jobs now. Part of me worries I burned too much credibility by leaving when I did and being out this long.So here’s my question:Has anyone here come back successfully from a gap like this? Do hiring managers actually give people like me a second shot, or should I expect to start from a lower level (if I get hired at all)?Any blunt or realistic advice is appreciated.

        "content": "TL;DR, I finished my first year of my Computer Science degree poorly and I’m considering switching to Humanities/Political Science or something similar (which I am definitely more interested in), but I have concerns related to opportunities, income, work, etc.I’m 19 (turning 20), from New Brunswick, Canada. I always liked technology and thought I’d do well pursuing a computer science but after doing my first year in two parts, I’m honestly not sure.Ended my year with only a 2.5 GPA. Surprisingly I did meh in my other classes but still passed (C’s, B-‘s) profs were probably generous, but I did horrible in my Java class and got a D, so I’d have to retake it. Overtime I feel like I’ve grown disinterested in Java and as much as I tried in the classes (along with my other ones), but there’s just no way I can catch up on pace especially given the fact that during classes I also had to work part time 20 hours/week to help my family with rent/utilities/etc. I ended up relying a lot on “online tools” more than I’d like to admit, as disappointing as it is to the integrity of my university. Hate to make excuses but I really would dedicate more time to my studies if I didn’t have to work so much, I live with a single parent who is lower income and I have to help out.That being said, I’m wondering if I should change my major to Political Science or a related field, like maybe History or something in the Humanities field. My best class was an A- in Sociology, which I took as an Elective. I also went to a political science professor’s lectures often out of interest, and he’s pretty damn good. I sometimes engaged more than the people actually taking the course did.Politics or History (particularly Canadian) something I’ve grown extremely interested in over the past few years now and I’m pretty knowledgeable on Legislative matters. I’ve used newspaper archives often and contributed to hundreds (and personally written 100+) of encyclopedic texts about New Brunswick related topics on Wikipedia, so it’s probably clear I have much more of an interest in Humanities/Politics/History than I do CS. If you’ve read anything New Brunswick-related on WP chances are I’ve contributed to it in some shape or form. I’d be interested in maybe some sort of Government position but I’m just concerned about job opportunities for that field. Whichever route I take, I’ll have to take out a student loan due to being low income. I do feel pretty disappointed in myself for making these sort of considerations after a year though; I had used up all of the RESP money saved up for me towards something I performed so poorly in and I’d feel even more behind on life than I already do if I were to switch.Any potential advice?

When I try to ask questions or show initiative, I usually get ignored.One turning point: a few weeks ago there was a deployment issue, pods didn’t come back up, and the client was getting frustrated. My lead was away. I took the initiative to pull ArgoCD credentials from AWS Secrets and started troubleshooting. It wasn’t reckless, just needed. Client first. When my lead came back, he blew up. That’s when I knew I couldn’t wait around anymore. I fewl dejected that despite being hungry for knowledge, showing initiative multiple times, my messages are completely ignored on slack. I’ve started building my own projects and am studying for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate cert. I want to be intentional now. Not wasting time on random thimgs. I’m 37, time’s not on my side.I’m from a third world country and making peanuts. My goal is to get skilled enogh to earn around $4k–$5k/month remotely. I don’t need shortcuts.

As a solo developer, I now seem to be jack of all trades but master of none.Have been a solo worker for most of my career, never worked in a team of more than 2-3 developers. Never had the opportunity to build a network of sorts. No word of mouth referrals either. Job market seems quite tight and with the growing financial obligations, it seems like the walls are closing in. Me overthinking things to oblivion doesn't help either.Polishing up my resume, have joined many social groups currently building their products, in efforts to see if they could be interested in my services. Sent a few cold DMs on how, I could assist with a particular feature then are talking about. Nothing has panned out yet though. Being an introvert doesn't help the the need for being more public and people facing, but I for sure need to change that.Seeking guidance on where to look, what I could do better, how best to position myself.

A big part of it is rebuilding basket pages into our own tags, storing the data in cookies (encoded), and then decoding and extracting that information to use within overlays. We do a lot of function-based scripting inside our custom tag framework.While the work is quite technical and logic-heavy, we don’t use tools like Git or VS Code — everything is done in a more limited environment. There are three of us on the team, but realistically only two of us are carrying the workload, and it’s been like that for the past three years I’ve been here.To make things worse, the pay is barely above minimum wage, which is incredibly disheartening given the responsibility and effort we put in. I feel overworked, undervalued, and burnt out.I want to move on, but I’m unsure of where I stand. Should I only be applying for junior roles, or does my experience qualify me to aim for mid-level positions? More than anything, I just hope that my next role doesn’t drain me the way this one has. :frowning_face_with_open_mouth:",

So I’m hoping to find 1 or 2 people (max) who are also committed to prepping regularly and want to hold each other accountable. Ideally, we’d meet at least twice a week to mock interview, share progress, and keep each other on track to practice daily until the end of the year.I know it’s not January 1st, but I still think we can crush this goal in 2025. I’m based in the US (EST), so I’d prefer folks in the same time zone to avoid scheduling issues. I’m flexible for sessions after work or on weekends.If this sounds like something you’d be into and you’re serious about it, feel free to DM me!Yes… I edited my post with gpt….",

        "content": "I got my first dev job after college by basically just saying I had taken a few classes on LLVM. I spent my time there working on an AI compiler stack (Torch-MLIR) doing relatively menial things like implementing ops and fixing packaging issues. After 2 years with the company, it got bought by AMD. The team's focus shifted away from the flagship product and into more internal things, leaving me as one of the few people working on it. Since there wasn't much development happening, I worked mostly on GUI and even less on compilation. Then, after a year at AMD, I got laid off. I haven't been able to find work in almost 8 months now.There were a number of reasons for my layoff, I think. I was one of the only people on the team without a Master's degree. I've been having ADHD issues that caused my performance to drop for a month or two before the layoff. But more importantly, I don't think I had the skills to keep up with the trajectory of the team. Everyone was moving off of supporting models on hardware and onto optimization and other such stuff internal to AMD. And as I've gotten out into the field again, a field that's changed a lot since 2021, I find that I'm lacking basically everything I'd need to get another compiler job.I don't have a Master's, I don't have any optimization knowledge. My expertise is PyTorch, Torch-MLIR, and IREE. PyTorch knowledge is useful, but only insofar as it applies to building models. Torch-MLIR and IREE seem to just not be used by anyone but my former company, and now no one at all. Hell, AMD's even hiring for my old position. I've applied and been denied multiple times.I really like compilers, but if there's no future in this for me I'll switch to doing something else. Can anyone give me some advice on this? I've tried asking my old coworkers for career advice but none of them have responded, and I'm starting to get desperate.[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/cHA7eV9.jpeg) my resume.",

I found computers cool when I was a kid and liked the idea of building programs that could do stuff. I am/was an average student in school and didn't create a new programming language when I was 13. I was oblivious about IT taking over the world and didn't know anything about programming until I was 17. I studied Comp Sci in an average university in my hometown and passed with average grades. I took a software dev job in a small firm with an average pay. I was suffering with a severe inferiority complex because I wasn't exceptional.I moved to Germany from India to pursue a master's degree in CS and left my job. Now I see people from all over the world doing amazing stuff. I'm sitting in a class where there are undergrads who are 18 years old, who have been coding since they were 12 (real nerds), interned at big tech or selling their own SaaS products. I'm 26 and barely know 3 programming languages. It takes me quite a lot of time to understand mathematical concepts. I'm happy that I'm now exposed to rigorous math stuff which I skimmed through in undergrad, but still I feel lagging so far behind.To people who aren't computer nerds but have a decent career while managing other interests, how did you make it? How do you not get disappointed with yourself when people who are much younger than you are faring far ahead in their career? Is being average okay in a field where we compete with millions of people all over the world and also a looming threat of AI taking over our jobs?",

There's a potential pivot opportunity, but it's unclear if leadership will pursue it or cut losses. I'm confident in job security through Q1/Q2 2026, but beyond that is uncertain.The startup obviously carries its own risks - they have one year of runway and are planning a $4-6M seed round in 2026. If they fail to raise, I’d be cooked.  But I do think they have an acceptable shot at hitting their fundraising goal – the CEO is a previous founder; both the CEO and CTO are Ivy grads in their late 30s with a lot of relevant industry experience; the business model makes sense; they have customers lined up, with each contract bringing in between 300-500k in revenue (contracts are not typically recurring).**Learning & Growth:** My current role has limited learning opportunities. While I have a strong new manager, the learning is sporadic rather than structured. Our well-staffed DE and DevOps teams mean I'm siloed in applied AI work, and we're focused on low-hanging fruit rather than challenging problems due to company priorities.The startup role would give me hands-on MLOps and data engineering experience since I'd be building infrastructure from scratch. The downside is less mentorship and smaller data volumes compared to what I could potentially work with at my current company.**Long-term Goals:** Like many in this field, I'm aiming for Big Tech eventually. I've seen founding engineer experience listed as a plus on some roles (including at OpenAI/Anthropic), but I'm concerned about having enough time to prep for technical interviews at an early-stage startup.**Job Hopping Concerns:** Leaving after 1.5 years feels early, especially since my previous role was just under 2 years. Worried about appearing like a job hopper.**Looking for advice on:** How to weigh these tradeoffs, particularly the loss in TC, the stability/learning balance, and whether the founding engineer experience outweighs the potential downsides.Thanks so much for reading.
