        "content": "TLDR; My company wants to replace our pipelines with some all-in-one “AI agent” platformI’m a lone data engineer in a mid-size retail/logistics company that runs SAP ERP (moving to HANA soon). Historically, every department pulled SAP data into Excel, calculated things manually, and got conflicting numbers. I was hired into a small analytics unit to centralize this. I’ve automated data pulls from SAP exports, APIs, scrapers, and built pipelines into SQL Server. It’s traceable, consistent, and used regularly.Now, our new CEO wants to “centralize everything” and “go AI-driven” by bringing in a no-name platform that offers:\\- Limited source connectors for a basic data lake/warehouse setup\\- A simple SQL interface + visualization tools\\- And the worst of it all: an AI agent PER DEPARTMENTEach department will have its own AI “instance” with manually provided business context. Example: “This is how finance defines tenure,” or “Sales counts revenue like this.” Then managers are supposed to just ask the AI for a metric, and it will generate SQL and return the result. Supposedly, this will replace 95–97% of reporting, instantly (and the CTO/CEO believe it).Obviously, I’m extremely skeptical:\\- Even with perfect prompts and context, if the underlying data is inconsistent (e.g. rehire dates in free text, missing fields, label mismatches), the AI will silently get it wrong.\\- There’s no way to audit mistakes, so if a number looks off, it’s unclear who’s accountable. If a manager believes it, it may go unchallenged.\\- The answer to every flaw from them is: “the context was insufficient” or “you didn’t prompt it right.” That’s not sustainable or realistic\\- Also some people (probs including me) will have to manage and maintain all the departmental context logic, deal with messy results, and take the blame when AI gets it wrong.\\- Meanwhile, we already have a working, auditable, centralized system that could scale better with a real warehouse and a few more hires. They just don't want to hire a team or I have to convince them somehow (bc they think that this is a cheaper, more efficient alternative).I’m still relatively new in this company and I feel like I’m not taken seriously, but I want to push back before we go too far, I'll switch jobs probably soon anyway but I'm actually concerned about my team.How do I convince the management that this is a bad idea?",

One thing that strikes me is the gap in maturity between DE and Web Dev. Here are some examples:1. Most DE literature is pretty recent. For example, the first edition of \"Fundamentals of Data Engineering\" was written in 20222. Lack of opinionated frameworks. Come to think of it, I think DBT is pretty much what we got.3. Lack of well-defined patterns or consensus for practices like testing, schema evolution, version control, etc.Data engineering is much more \"unsolved\" than other software engineering fields. I'm not saying this is a bad thing. On the contrary, I think it is very exciting to work on a field where there is still a lot of room to be creative and be a part of figuring out how things should be done rather than just copy whatever existing pattern is the standard.",

About me: 37 year old senior data engineer of 5 years, senior data analyst of about 10 years, 15 years in total working with data. Been at it since college. I have a bachelors degree in economics and a handful of certs including AWS solutions architect associate. I am married with a 1 year old, planning on having at least one more (I think this family info is relevant bc lifestyle plays into career decisions, like the one I’m trying to make). Live / work in Austin, TX. I love data engineering, and I do want to further my career in the role, but am apprehensive given all the AI f*ckery about. I have basically nailed it down to three options:1. Get a masters in CS or AI. I actually do really like the idea of this. I enjoy math, the theory and science, and having a graduate degree is an accolade I want out of life (at least I think). What holds me back: I will need to take some extra pre-req courses and will need to continue working while studying. I anticipate a 5 year track for this (and about $15-20k). This will also be difficult while raising a family. And more pertinently, does this really protect me from AI? I think it will definitely help in the medium term, but who knows if it’d be worth it ten years from now. 2. Continue pressing on as a data engineer, and try to bump up to Staff and then maybe move into some sort of management role. I definitely want the staff position, but ugh being a manager does not feel like my forte. I’ve done it before as an Analytics Manager and hated it. Granted, I was much younger then, and the team I managed was not the most talented. So my last experience is probably not very representative. 3. Get out of Data Engineering and move into something like Sales Engineering. This is a bit out of left field, but I think something like this is probably the best bet to future proof my tech career without an advanced degree. Personally, I haven’t had a full-on sales role before, but the sales thing is kind of in my blood, as my parents and family were quite successful in sales roles. I do enjoy people, and think I could make a successful tech salesman, given my experience as a data engineer. After reading this, what do you feel might be a good path for me? One or the other, a mix of both? I like the idea of going for the masters in CS and moving into Sales Engineering afterwards. Overall I am eager to learn and advance while also being mindful of the future changes coming to the industry (all industries really). Thank you!",

I'm hoping to get some outside perspective on whether what I'm going through is just 'normal' in consulting, or if I'm somehow attracting all the least desirable projects.I've been working at a tech consulting firm (or 'IT services company,' as I'd call it) for 3 years, supposedly as a Data Engineer. And honestly, my experiences so far have been... peculiar.”My first year was a baptism by fire. I was thrown into a legacy migration project, essentially picking up mid-way after two people suddenly left the company. This meant I spent my days migrating processes from unreadable SQL and Java to PySpark and Python. The code was unmaintainable, full of bad practices, and the PySpark notebooks constantly failed because, obviously, they were written by people with no real Spark expertise. Debugging that was an endless nightmare.Then, a small ray of light appeared: I participated in a project to build a data platform on AWS. I had to learn Terraform on the fly and worked closely with actual cloud architects and infrastructure engineers. I learned a ton about infrastructure as code and, finally, felt like I was building something useful and growing professionally. I was genuinely happy!But the joy didn't last. My boss decided I needed to move to something \"more data-oriented\" (his words). And that's where I am now, feeling completely demoralized.Currently, I'm on a team working with Microsoft Fabric, surrounded by Power BI folks who have very little to no programming experience. Their philosophy is \"low-code for everything,\" with zero automation. They want to build a Medallion architecture and ingest over 100 tables, using one Dataflow Gen2 for EACH table. Yes, you read that right.This translates to:- Monumental development delays.- Cryptic error messages and infernal debugging (if you've ever tried to debug a Dataflow Gen2, you know what I mean).- A strong sense that we're creating massive technical debt from day one.I've tried to explain my vision, pushed for the importance of automation, reducing technical debt, and improving maintainability and monitoring. But it's like talking to a wall. It seems the technical lead, whose background is solely Power BI, doesn't understand the importance of these practices nor has the slightest intention of learning.I feel like, instead of progressing, I'm actually moving backward professionally. I love programming with Python and PySpark, and designing robust, automated solutions. But I keep landing on ETL projects where quality is non-existent, and I see no real value in what we're doing—just \"quick fixes and shoddy work.\"I have the impression that I haven't experienced what true data engineering is yet, and that I'm professionally devaluing myself in these kinds of environments.My main questions are:- Is this just my reality as a Data Engineer in consulting, or is there a path to working on projects with good practices and real automation?- How can I redirect my career to find roles where quality code, automation, and robust design are valued?- Any advice on how to address this situation with my current company (if there's any hope) or what to actively look for in my next role?Any similar experiences, perspectives, or advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated.

Obviously, dbt wouldn’t have changed their license to ELv2 if they weren’t confident that fusion was the strongest SQL-based transformation engine.So this brings me to my question- for the core functionality of understanding SQL, does anyone know the technological/architectural differences between the two? How they differ in approaches? Their limitations? Where one’s implementation is better than the other?",

This time, I already have the title, so expectations are higher from day one.I’d appreciate advice from others who’ve gone through similar transitions. A few points I’m navigating:1. **More coordination, less coding** – I feel responsible when junior/mid-level teammates struggle, but stepping in often requires deep context and isn’t always the best use of my time.2. **Initial pressure to speak up** – In early meetings, I spoke a lot out of fear of being judged. I’ve since shifted to only contributing when others are stuck, letting the team lead conversations.3. **High-stakes communication** – I’m regularly presenting and defending solutions to groups of 5–10 senior stakeholders (including weekly 2-3 min updates to 100+ people). I feel it is it's own skillset and would like tips or recommendations on courses for such situations.4. **Perception concerns** – I’m worried my informal tone and young appearance (I'm 28 but look 24) might make me seem immature for the role.Looking for strategies to succeed as a new senior in a new team.",

Even other teams commonly call us \"devs.\"This has me wondering:Is this just common industry language?Or is it a sign that the data engineering role is being blended into general development work?Do you also feel that your work is viewed more like backend/dev work than a specialized data role?Just curious how others experience this. Would love to hear what your role looks like in practice and how your org views data engineering as a discipline.Thanks!",

The message is encoded based on row order, so the data itself remains unaltered.The payload can be recovered even if some rows are modified or deleted, thanks to a combination of Reed-Solomon and fountain codes. You only need a fraction of the original dataset—regardless of which part—to recover the payload.For example, I managed to hide a 128×128 image in a Parquet file containing 100,000 rows.I believe this could be used to watermark a Parquet file with a signature for authentication and tracking. The payload can still be retrieved even if the file is converted to CSV or SQL.That said, the payload is easy to remove by simply reshuffling all the rows. However, if you maintain the original order using a column such as an ID, the encoding will remain intact.Here’s the package, called Steganodf (like steganography for DataFrames :) )::link: https://github.com/dridk/steganodfLet me know what you think!",

        "content": "Hey folks,I just got laid off from my company after 5 years. I’ve been hitting the job market, but it’s either hypercompetitive or the offers are insultingly low. It’s frustrating.So instead of jumping back into another corporate gig, I’m thinking of pivoting to full-stack data analytics for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). My plan is to help them make sense of their data—ETL, analytics, dashboards, the whole package(using cloud tools ofc).Here is my pricing plan :**for 2 to 3 datasources : $4000/month during pipeline building $2000/month for when pipeline is done and customers would only want new dashboards occasionally, fix bugs or change some logic**for 3 to 5 datasources : $8000 during pipeline building building $4000 maintenance mode**for complex once with more than 5 datasource $8000 - $15000What do you think of this pricing model? Is this reasonablr enough??For those who’ve done something similar, I’d love to hear:•How did you find clients?•What pricing or engagement models worked for you?•Any pitfalls to watch out for?Appreciate any insights or advice you can share!",

I work for a sports team so this data warehouse is really all sports code footage, the files are .JSON I am likely building this in the Azure environment because that’s our current ecosystem but open to hearing about AWS features as well. I’ve done some YouTube and ChatGPT research but would really appreciate any advice. I have 9 months to learn & get it done, so how should I start? Thank so much!Edit: Thanks so far for the responses! As you can see I’m still new to this which is why I didn’t have enough information to provide but …. In a season we have 3TB of video footage hoooweeveerr this is from all games in our league so even the ones we don’t play in. I can prioritize all our games only and that should be 350 GB data (I think) now ofcourse it wouldn’t be uploaded all at once but based off of last years data I have not seen a singular game file over 11.5 GB. I’m unsure how much practice footages we have but I’ll see. Oh also I put our files in ChatGPT and it’s “.SCTimeline , stream.json , video.json and package meta” Chat game me a hopefully this information helps.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I recently finished my degree in Computer Science and worked part-time throughout my studies, including on many personal projects in the data domain. I’m very confident in my technical skills: I can (and have) built large systems and my own SaaS projects. I know all the ins and outs of the basic data-engineering tools, SQL, Python, Pandas, PySpark, and have experience with the entire software-engineering stack (Docker, CI/CD, Kubernetes, even front-end). I also have a solid grasp of statistics.About a year ago, I was hired at a company that had previously outsourced all IT to external firms. I got the job through the CEO of a company where I’d interned previously. He’s now the CTO of this new company and is building the entire IT department from scratch. The reason he was hired is to transform this traditional company, whose industry is being significantly disrupted by tech, into a “tech” company. You can really tell the CEO cares about that: in a little over one year, we’ve grown to 15+ developers, and the culture has changed a lot.I now have the privilege of being trusted with the responsibility of building the entire data infrastructure from scratch. I have total authority over all tech decisions, although I don’t have much experience with how mature data teams operate. Since I’m a total open-source nerd and we’re based in Europe, we want to rely on as few American cloud providers as possible, I’ve set up the current infrastructure like this:* **Airflow** (running in our Kubernetes cluster)* **ClickHouse DWH** (also running in our Kubernetes cluster)* **Spark** (you guessed it, running in our cluster)* **Goose** for SQL migrations in our warehouseSome conceptual decisions I’ve made so far:1. Data ingestion from different sources (Salesforce, multiple products, etc.) runs through Airflow, using simple Pandas scripts to load into the DWH (about 200 k rows per day).2. ClickHouse is our DWH, and Spark connects to ClickHouse so that all analytics runs through Spark against ClickHouse. If you have any tips on how to structure the different data layers (Ingestion/datamart etc), please!What I want to implement next are typical software-engineering practices, dev/prod environments, testing, etc. As I mentioned, I have a lot of experience in classical SWE within corporate environments, so I want to apply as much from that as possible. In my research, I’ve found that you basically just copy the entire environment for dev and prod, which makes sense, but sounds expensive computing wise. We will soon start hiring additional DE/DA/DS.My question is: What technical or organizational decisions do you think are important and valuable? What have you seen work (or not work) in your experience as a data engineer? Are there problems you only discover once your team has grown? I want to get in front of those issues as early as possible. Like I said, I have a lot of experience in how to build SWE projects in a corporate environment. Any things I am not thinking about that will sooner or later come to haunt me in my DE team? Any tips on how to setup my DWH architecture? How does your DWH look conceptually?",

I also read posts on this subreddit, and half the time I've no idea what people are talking about. I'm wondered if anyone has any advice. Are there any recommended courses or learning paths I should perhaps be following? And advice on what I should be focusing on at this point in my career?",

        "author": "jduran9987",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey all,I've been learning Spark/PySpark recently and I'm curious about how production projects are typically structured and organized.My background is in DBT, where each model (table/view) is defined in a SQL file, and DBT builds a DAG automatically using `ref()` calls. For example: -- modelB.sql SELECT colA FROM {{ ref('modelA') }} This ensures `modelA` runs before `modelB`. DBT handles the dependency graph for you, parallelizes independent models for faster builds, and allows for targeted runs using tags. It also supports automated tests defined in YAML files, which run before the associated models.I'm wondering how similar functionality is achieved in Databricks. Is lineage managed manually, or is there a framework to define dependencies and parallelism? How are tests defined and automatically executed? I'd also like to understand how this works in vanilla Spark without Databricks. TLDR - How are Databricks or vanilla Spark projects organized in production. How are things like 100s of tables, lineage/DAGs, orchestration, and tests managed?Thanks!",

Or do you guys only keep a few recent ones and just discard the older ones?Also, since code is the only change 95% of the time, do you guys recommend a Multi-Stage Dockerfile so the git clone of the code is built separately and it reuses the other parts?

I’m ambitious and constantly learning, and I want to grow fast and reach high-impact roles, ideally abroad in the future.Some questions I’m grappling with:•Are certifications (like the Snowflake one) worth it for standing out?•Would a private master’s or MBA from a well-known school help open doors, even if I’m not doing it for the learning itself? If so, which ones are actually respected in the data world?•I’m also working on personal projects (investment tools, dashboards) that I use for myself and publish on GitHub. Is it worth adapting them for the public or making them more portfolio-ready?I’d love to hear from others who were in a similar position: what helped you stand out? What do hiring managers and companies actually value when considering junior profiles?Thanks a lot!",

        "content": "This is not just another post about 'how to transition into Data Engineering'. I want to share a real challenge I’ve been facing, despite being actively learning, practicing, and building projects. Yet, breaking into a DE role has proven harder than I expected.I have around 6 years of experience working as a data analyst, mostly focused on advanced SQL, data modeling, and reporting with Tableau. I even led a short-term ETL project using Tableau Prep, and over the past couple of years, my work has been very close to what an Analytics Engineer does—building robust queries over a data warehouse, transforming data for self-service reporting, and creating scalable models.Along this journey, I’ve been deeply investing in myself. I enrolled in a comprehensive Data Engineering course that’s constantly updated with modern tools, techniques, and cloud workflows. I’ve also built several open-source projects where I apply DE concepts in practice: Python-based pipelines, Docker orchestration, data transformations, and automated workflows.I tend to avoid saying 'I have no experience' because, while I don’t have formal production experience in cloud environments, I do have hands-on experience through personal projects, structured learning, and working with comparable on-prem or SQL-based tools in my previous roles. However, the hiring process doesn’t seem to value that in the same way.The real obstacle comes down to the production cloud experience. Almost every DE job requires AWS, Databricks, Spark, etc.—but not just knowledge, production-level experience. Setting up cloud projects on my own helps me learn, but comes with its own headaches: managing resources carefully to avoid unexpected costs, configuring environments properly, and the limitations of working without a real production load.I’ve tried the 'get in as a Data Analyst and pivot internally' strategy a few times, but it hasn’t worked for me.At this point, it feels like a frustrating loop: companies want production experience, but getting that experience without the job is almost impossible. Despite the learning, the practice, and the commitment, the outcome hasn't been what I hoped for.So my question is—how do people actually break this loop? Is there something I’m not seeing? Or is it simply about being patient until the right opportunity shows up? I’m genuinely curious to hear from those who’ve been through this or from people on the hiring side of things.",

This includes everything from ingestion and transformation patterns, to data governance, metadata, access management, real-time vs. batch workloads, DevOps/CI-CD, observability, and beyond.**Our current state:** We’re a heavily on-prem SQL Server shop with a \\~40 TB relational reporting database . We have a small Azure footprint but aren’t deeply tied to it — so we’re not locked in to a specific cloud or architecture and have some flexibility to choose what best supports scalability, governance, and long-term agility.What I’m hoping to tap into from this community:* “I wish we had done X from the start”* “Avoid Y like the plague”* “One thing that made a huge difference for us was…”* “Nobody talks about Z, but it became a big problem later”* “If I were doing it again today, I would definitely…”We’re evaluating options for lakehouse architectures (e.g., Snowflake, Azure, DuckDB/Parquet, etc.), building out a scalable ingestion and transformation layer, considering dbt and/or other semantic layers, and thinking hard about governance, security, and how we enable analytics and AI down the line.I’m also interested in team/process tips.

How did you handle documentation, ownership, intake, and cross-functional communication in the early days?Appreciate any war stories, hard-won lessons, or even questions you wish someone had asked you when you were just getting started.

I'm by no means an expert and would like to make sure I'm understanding the concept first. Is this article claiming that if I have, say, a dim\\_customers table, that to widen that table with customer attributes like location, sign up date, size, etc. that I will create a brittle architecture? To me this seems like a standard practice, as long as you are maintaining the grain of the table (1 customer per record). I also might use this table to join in all of the ids from various source systems. This makes it easy to investigate issues and increases the tables reusability IMO.Am I misunderstanding the article maybe, or is there a better, more scalable approach than what I'm currently doing in my own work?

For contract roles I am looking at atleast 20% hike as I am in a FTE role now.I guess thats why management doesnt way to pay me extra as they know whats out there but if I were to quit I would get the promotion as they offered one to the last Senior Engineer who quit but he didnt take it and left anyways.I dont like to take counter offers so I am stuck here as I feel like the management is not really appreciating my efforts - I told my direct manager and senior management I want to be compensated in monetary terms.I guess there is nothing I can do but suck it up till I get an offer I like outside.",

        "content": "Running into a tricky issue with incremental models and hoping someone has faced this before.**Setup:*** BigQuery + dbt* Incremental models using `insert_overwrite` strategy* Partitioned by `extracted_at` (timestamp, day granularity)* Filter: `DATE(_extraction_dt) BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 DAY) AND CURRENT_DATE()`* Source tables use latest record pattern: `(ROW_NUMBER() + ORDER BY _extraction_dt DESC)` to get latest version of each record**The Problem:** When I backfill historical data, I get duplicates in my target table even though the source \"last record patrern\" tables handle late-arriving data correctly.**Example scenario:**1. May 15th business data originally extracted on May 15th → goes to May 15th partition2. Backfill more May 15th data on June 1st → goes to June 1st partition3. Incremental run on June 2nd only processes June 1st/2nd partitions4. Result: Duplicate May 15th business dates across different extraction partitions**What I've tried:*** Custom backfill detection logic (complex, had issues)* Changing filter logic (performance problems)**Questions:**1. Is there a clean way to handle this pattern without full refresh?2. Should I be partitioning by business date instead of extraction date?3. Would switching to `merge` strategy be better here?4. Any other approaches to handle backfills gracefully?The latest record pattern works great for the source tables, but the extraction-date partitioning on insights tables creates this blind spot. Backfills are rare so considering just doing full refresh when they happen, but curious if there's a more elegant solution.Thanks in advance!",

        "content": "TL;DR: We have a website and a D365 CRM that we currently keep synchronized through Power Automate, and this is rather terrible. What's a good avenue for better centralising our data for reporting? And what would be a good tool for pulling this data into the central data source?As the title says, we work in procurement for education institutions providing frameworks and the ability to raise tender requests free of charge, while collecting spend from our suppliers.Our development team is rather small with about 2-3 web developers (including our tech lead) and a data analyst. We have good experience in PHP / SQL, and rather limited experience in Python (although I have used it).We have our main website, a Laravel site that serves as the main point of contact for both members and suppliers with a Quote Tool (raising tenders) and Spend Reporter (suppliers tell us their revenue through us). The data for this is currently in a MariaDB / MySQL database. The VM for this is currently hosted within Azure.We then have our CRM, a dynamics 365 / PowerApps Model App(?) that handles Member & Supplier data, contacts, and also contains the framework data same as the site. Of course, this data is kept in Microsoft Data verse.These 2 are kept in sync using an array of Power Automate flows that run whenever a change is made on either end, and attempts to synchronise the two. It uses an API built in Laravel to contact the website data. To keep it realtime, there's an Azure Service bus for the messages sent on either end. A custom connector is used to access the API in Power Automate.We also have some other external data sources such as information from other organisations we pull into Microsoft Dataverse using custom connectors or an array of spreadsheets we get from them.Finally, we also have sources such as SharePoint, accounting software, MailChimp, a couple of S3 buckets, etc, that would be relevant to at least mention.Our reports are generally built in Power BI. These reports are generally built using the MySQL server as a source (although they have to be manually refreshed when connecting through an SSH tunnel) for some, and the Dataverse as the other source.We have licenses to build PowerBI reports that ingest data from any source, as well as most of the power platform suite. However, we don't have a license for Microsoft Fabric at the moment.We also have an old setup of Synapse Analytics alongside an Azure SQL database that as far as I can tell neither of these are really being utilised right now.So, my question from here is: what's our best option moving forward for improving where we store our data and how we keep it synchronised? We've been looking at Snowflake as an option for a data store as well as (maybe?) for ETL/ELT. Alternatively, the option of Microsoft Fabric to try to keep things within Microsoft / Azure, despite my many hangups with trusting it lol.Additionally, a big requirement is moving away from Power Automate for handling real time ETL processes as this causes far too many problems than solutions. Ideally, the 2-way sync would be kept as close to real-time as possible.So, what would be a good option for central data storage? And what would be a good option for then running data synchronisation and preparation for building reports?I think options that have been on the table either from personal discussions or with a vendor are:- including Azure Data Factory alongside Synapse for ETL- Microsoft Fabric - Snowflake- Trying to use FOSS tools to build our own stack, (difficult, we're a small team)- using more Power Query (simple, but only for ingesting data into Dataverse)I can answer questions for any additional context if needed, because I can imagine more will be needed.",

A Kafka Streams-based Java application will consume and process these events.* **Target Systems:** Two downstream SQL Server databases: * **ODS Silver**: Denormalized ingestion with transformations (KTable joins) * **ODS Gold**: Curated materialized views optimized for analytics* **Additional concerns we're addressing:** * Parent-child out-of-order scenarios * Sequencing and buffering of transactions * Event deduplication * Minimal impact on source systems (logical decoding, no outbox pattern)This is a new pattern for our organization, so I’m especially interested in hearing from folks who’ve built or operated similar architectures.**Questions:**1. How did you handle transaction boundaries and ordering across multiple topics?2. Did you use a custom sequencer, or did you rely on Flink/Kafka Streams or another framework?3. Any lessons learned regarding scaling, lag handling, or data consistency?Happy to share more technical details if anyone’s curious.

        "content": "Im looking for suggestions on what infrastructure and techniques to use to achieve these requirements. I want to keep it simple, easy to maintain and understand. I dont need scalability at this time.I have a requirement to design a data warehouse in redshift that supports the ability to query past data states similarly to temporal tables in MS SQL Server. (if an update query is made, I need to be able to query for what the table looked like before the update) this is sometimes called \"time travel query\" or \"point in time architecture\" depending on your background. The data sources do not retain this historical data, and are not in an ideal data warehouse schema, so Ill need to transform the data either before or after loading it, and maintain the historical records. Redshift seems to lack a direct solution for this problem.a second requirement is to ingest the data using streaming technology such as kafka. though the data warehouse does not have to be updated in real time. that is optional.I have looked at redshift's \"history mode\" but its quite new and it looks like all the data would need to go into RDS first, which has tradeoffs. but one of the main data sources is already on RDS, so that seems promising.total data volume is low, no need for cluster computing if we can save some complexity.I would prefer to lean toward python and sql for programming.I would prefer to do things in real-time, but would accept batches if a particularly elegant solution is available.thanks for considering :D",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I'm not here to ask the usual, lazy \"learned programming at 26! how become better programmer! also how get job?\" Because, yeah, I know how to become a better programmer: \"do projects,\" they all say. \"Solve a real world problem that you have.\" But every legitimate programmer out there needs to acknowledge that there's a world of computer general knowledge that's typically necessary for many of these \"projects\" to function. Sure, at my level (<1 year of programming; yes I am self taught, no I did not get a CS degree), I can create a terminal based RPG game or create a terminal based CRUD. But when programmers go out and build a compiler, there's a whole world of knowledge required on how to do that, none of which is probably even concretely understandable - only abstractly understandable. To take another example: if you want to get into web development, it is not enough to know JS, HTML, and CSS - one must also know how requests/get/server/browsers work. So how does one bridge the gap from being a programmer who can only create a terminal CRUD to becoming a programmer that understands how to build something like a compiler? Maybe my question is vague because it lacks an objective. I'm sure many of you will say \"what do you want to DO? What's your goal? That will determine how you learn this under-the-hood stuff.\" And yet in the same breath, I suspect most programmers out there have this under-the-hood knowledge that I seem to lack. Where is this knowledge? YouTube tutorials on \"how to build [complicated thingy],\" by necessity, gloss over the important details behind the inner workings of lines of code, because otherwise the video would rabbit-hole quite quickly.",

        "content": "Hey everyone. Before saying anything I would like to preface that this is my first time posting in a subreddit, so if I did something wrong somehow I apologize in advance (I chose the resource tag because my main question concerns choosing resources to learn).I have currently completed my second year in uni and am in the midst of my 3-month summer break. I want to spend these three months focusing on learning full stack development (which for now is my career goal ig), and specifically web development. I have this obsession with doing online courses and improving my skills to get better, and I'm also really looking to do some solid projects and start building my resume/cv. I scoured the internet and found multiple recommended courses which I've listed below. Unfortunately I have a bad habit of just hoarding work and trying to do everything without a plan and regardless of whether it is redundant or not. Here are the courses I gathered:- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)- [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)- [Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/frontend-path-c0j:toc)- [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn) courses (HTML -> CSS -> JavaScript)- [CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/) -> [CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/)- [Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript and FrontEnd course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/)- [freecodecamp Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/)- The roadmap on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)- [This roadmap](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/vcu5lm/comment/icgeukp/?context=3) by NiagaraThistleI want to know which of these courses would be enough for me to become skilled at web dev and also set me on the path to becoming a full stack dev. I'd like to know if just one of these courses is actually enough, or if a few are enough then in what sequence should I do them. Of course if I had infinite time I would probably do them all but as of now this is overwhelming and would really appreciate if this could be narrowed down to the absolute essentials, stuff I can feasibly do in < 3 months and still get something out of. I'm aware that TOP seems well praised universally so I'm definitely going to do that.To preface I'm fairly adequate in programming and have worked on a few projects, including web-based ones, but I'm really looking to rebuild my skills from scratch if that makes sense.I also understand that the best way to learn is through building projects, I get that but I'd like to supplement that with learning theoreticals and any courses from the above (or if there's some other amazing one I somehow missed) which also involve project building would be best. I'd also like to know where I can find some project ideas (I'm aware roadmap.sh has a few). I'd like to build at least 3 projects within the time I have.Again would really appreciate some help (if I seem rather clueless in this post it's probably because I am, sorry, any guidance is appreciated)",

If you're already good at programming, you might find this tool helpful. But if you're just starting out, I think it's actually a bad idea. It takes away the learning-by-doing aspect of coding.

That would require VERY simple HTML4 and minimal JavaScript if any.The only other requirement is that it needs to be able to do raw TCP/IPv4 sockets which generally isn't a problem.I'm proficient in a few languages, C++, C#, and Python being my usual choices.I started with a C# .NET Framework 4.0 project since that's the latest .NET that supports XP. The development process is not going great. My modern IDEs continually gripe and moan about my target platform. MSVC 2022 won't even load it.I could try writing the application in C++ though I think I'd have to target MSVC 2015 x86. And the development usually goes slower than C#.Python wouldn't be bad, but how far back would I have to go to find an XP-compatible version?Thoughts and suggestions welcome.",

But for the backend I am overwhelmed with choices. I've heard that Vercel doesn't support WebSockets so it's out of the list. After some exploring, I saw a couple of options I can pick from.* Use VPS for the hosting such as Hetzner or DigitalOcean* Cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, GCP* Cloud platforms such as Render, Heroku, RailwayFor a small portfolio/hobby project, which one of these is my best bet? What are the pros and cons? Keep in mind that I am a college student (broke) so free tier is preferred. But if it means getting better services, paying 4 or 5 dollars a month is alright.

But I think I might a get a job offer soon as a PHP developer. I was just wondering if there are people who break into tech rather in AI/ML without a degree. If so that could prove that I could take php developer and work my way up maybe. Otherwise, I'd just have to go back to uni as a 28y/o.",

I’d really appreciate some honest advice.During my first year of college, I got interested in web development because people said it was easy to get into and had a great future. I learned basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.Then someone told me Android development was better, so I started learning Java. Midway, I got attracted to game development and began learning C++ with Unreal Engine. I even built a small game, but things got too complex and my parents weren’t supportive of game dev as a career.So I dropped that and went back to web development… but I had already forgotten a lot, so I had to start over. Now college is over, I’m still stuck at the beginner-to-intermediate level in front-end web dev, and I feel like I’ve wasted time jumping between paths. :disappointed_face:I want to get a job soon, but I don’t know what I should focus on anymore. I’m interested in front-end, but I keep doubting myself.Can someone guide me on:Whether it’s still okay to go with web dev (frontend) as a career path now?How to build my skills the right way from here?If I should consider full-stack or some other path at this point?Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this and responds :folded_hands:",

When I'm working on programming something I can just completely focus and zone in, and straight code for like nine hours, (I haven't tried any longer than that as of now). Next year I plan to go to university and study computer science (Don't worry I only plan on using that degree to get a cybersecurity job as it's the closest thing to a cybersec qualification where I live, also compsci is not oversaturated where I live unlike in America.) Overall I'm quite interested in cybersecurity and programming, and would like to get a career relating to one of those some day. So that's my career plan but right now I'm just wondering what should I learn? I have literally zero idea. I'm already learning C# but would love to learn more, and it would drive me if they had a specific use that I could use, because to be quite frank I don't want to learn a language that'll be useless to me.",

It's been interesting, and I've learned a lot, but from what I've read online, a large portion of being a Software Engineer is continuous learning, even outside of formal schooling.I have no issues with this, I like learning. Ive been trying to do my own research into the field (mostly by googling) to deepen my understanding, but, honestly, I have no idea where to really start. I think I have a reasonable grasp on C++, Java, and Python, and can create programs that typically do what I want in the console, but where do I progress from there? Where do I focus my independent studying next to become an effective engineer? And once I have an area of focus, where do I start? To be more specific, when learning a coding language, typically the classes I've taken start by teaching you different variables, then move on to teaching if-else branches, then loops, etc. How do I figure out what the equivalent would be for learning, say, how to create user interfaces, or accessing databases through code, or other things that go into making a program that I'm not aware of? I hope that makes sense, any advice would be appreciated. Edit: I suppose I should also mention that I HAVE picked up a book, specifically the Pragmatic Programmer, but from what I've read it seems primarily best-practice and mindset oriented, where I'm looking to improve on the technical side as well.",

But I often write the code in a normal .r file first, and then transfer it to an .rmd file once it’s working (though this usually breaks a few things). I do it this was because I can debug/view the variables in the environment easier in a .r file than in a .rmd file. Is there a less clunky way to do this? Where are you actually writing your code that you intend to share?",

For example, breaking down a project into different components and thinking about them *doing* things is difficult. I do much better with in-depth explanations; if I were using a library that abstracted away some task I would be more focused on *how the library works* than just accepting that it does a job and using it. I feel as though this is a big issue with my skills as a programmer. I particularly struggle with OOP and abstracting what I want from a system into various aspects. Concepts as a whole tend to confuse me at first and I need a real concrete understanding before \"getting it\". This leads to me feeling stupid for taking so long whereas others seem more able to understand new concepts, regardless of the topic being taught (although that could just be perceived). What steps can I take to improving this skill and understanding / reasoning with concepts in a way that doesn't require in-depth knowledge? I hope my question comes across clear, but please let me know if other wise and I will try and clear that up.Many thanks",

I have somewhat carved out a path which will be getting myself involved in certifications like comptia/aws/oscp before graduation (eventho thats going to be extremely stressful given the course difficulty haha).

I'm in my first semester of an Associate's Degree in Systems Analysis and Development (ADS), taking a JS/HTML/CSS course, and trying to build a project for my wife's company.ADS Degree: I'm pretty much half-assing this first semester because of the subjects. I just let the lectures play in the background while I do other things, then I take the test and that's it.JS/HTML/CSS Course: I started with a programming logic course and then jumped straight into this one.The Project: I'm building it with the help of Gemini Pro, and I think it's a relatively simple project. It's being developed with several technologies like Node, Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma, and others.What I'd like to get your opinion on is this: I've paused my JS/HTML/CSS course to focus on the project, because everyone keeps saying the best way to learn is to get your hands dirty. Since I have no experience, I ask the AI to give me a step-by-step guide of what we're going to do, followed by the code with a line-by-line explanation of its functionality. I finish by writing the lines myself and questioning some parts (which has led to more work, as I end up making it more robust than the AI's initial version and then have to make changes throughout the project).Do you think I should carry on like this, or should I go back to the course and build smaller projects related to the lessons? And also, should I be doing LeetCode/Codewars, etc.?I really appreciate anyone who read all of this, and even more so anyone who's willing to reply. :)",

I wanted to ask people who are working in the field:Are there any problems or tasks in your team that everyone knows should be handled, but they keep getting postponed or pushed down the priority list?Not because people don’t care, but just because there’s never enough time, budget, or the right person to take it on.Stuff like:Refactoring messy legacy codeWriting proper unit/integration testsPatching known security issuesMigrating to new systems or toolsImproving docs or onboardingAutomating manual tasksBasically anything that’s important but keeps getting delayed because “there’s always something more urgent. ”If you’ve seen things like this in your workplace — even small stuff — I’d really appreciate hearing about it. This is for a research project, and no names or companies will be mentioned anywhere.Thanks in advance to anyone who replies",

So, I now understand their business model: they seem to trap students and make them pay under the pretense of offering an internship certificate.My question is — although ₹99 isn’t a big amount for me, what if I go ahead and accept it (essentially, buy the certificate)? Will it actually help in strengthening my resume?",

Let me just share the question here: People-to-Centre assignmentYou are given two datasets, namely, people.csv and centre.csv. The first dataset consists of 10000 vaccinees’ locations, while the second dataset represents 100 vaccination centers’ locations. All the locations are given by the latitudes and longitudes.Your task is to assign vaccinees to vaccination centers. The assignment criterion is based on the *shortest* distances. Is there any significant difference between the execution times for **2** computers?Write a Python program for the scenario above and compare its execution time using 2 different computers. You need to run the program 50 times on each computer. You must provide the specifications of RAM, hard disk type, and CPU of the computers.

I can't get a job related to my course because my skills aren’t good enough for their qualifications, so I’m currently applying at McDonald's or Mang Inasal.

IT requires more time and focus to develop good skills, and I’m afraid I won’t be able to keep up.I’m scared that if I choose Plan A, it’ll take me much longer to graduate. But if I go with Plan B, I might not be able to focus on my studies, and it could hurt my mental health even more (plan A also).We live with our lola, but our living situation isn’t good (can't share) for me and my siblings. I’m the eldest, and I want to move out with my siblings. We don’t have parents, only our lola, and she’s getting old fast. I can’t depend on her anymore. My aunts and uncles try to help my lola to support our schooling, but they have their own families and responsibilities. My friends advised me to move out alone, study at another school, and stay in a dorm, but I’m worried about leaving my siblings behind.What should I choose?Sorry if this might not related.Thanks in advance!",

        "content": "Background - I'm a senior engineer with 10yrs+ experience that has worked at a few Big Tech companies and startups. I'm not sure why I'm writing this post, but I feel like all the tech \"influencers\" of 2021 glamorized this career to unrealistic expectations, and I need to correct some of the preconceived notions.The last 3 years have been absolutely brutal in terms of declining engineering culture. What's worse is that the toxicity is creating a feedback loops that exacerbates the declining culture.Some of the crazy things I've heard* \"I want to you look at every one of your report and ask yourself, is this person producing enough value to justify their high compensations\" (director to his managers)* \"If that person doesn't have the right skills, get rid of them and we'll find someone that does\" (VP to an entire organization after pivoting technology direction). * I.e. - It's not worth training people anymore, even if they're talented and can learn anything new. It's all sink or swim now* \"If these candidates aren't willing to grind hundreds of leetcode questions, they don't have mental fortitude to handle this job\" (engineers to other engineers) * To be fair, I felt like this was a defense mechanism. The amount of BS that you need to put up with to not get laid off has grown significantly.* \"Working nights and weekends is expected\" (manager to my coworker that was on PIP because he didn't work weekends). * I've always felt this pressure previously. But I've never heard it truly be verbalized until recently. Final thoughts* Software engineering in big tech feels more akin to investment banking now. Most companies expect this to be your life. You truly have to be \"passionate\" about making a bunch of money, or \"passionate\" about the product to survive.* Don't get too excited if your company stock skyrockets. The leaders of the company will continue to pinch every bit of value out of you because they're technically paying you more now (e.g. meta) and they know that the job market is harsh.* Prior to 2022, Amazon was considered the most toxic big tech company. But ironically, their multiple layers of bureaucracy and stagnating stock price likely prevented the the culture from getting too much worse, whereas many other companies have drastically exceeded Amazon in terms of toxicity in 2025. IMO, Amazon is solidly 50th percentile in terms of culture now. If you couldn't handle Amazon culture prior to 2022, then you definitely can't handle the type of culture that exists now.",

Most elite US PhD programs have a majority of Chinese students. If these people were to go back to China, it'd only bolster their already formidable AI industry and be a massive loss for the big US based AI companies.Chinese PhD graduates already face significant hurdles today getting a green card even after qualifying for the extra-ordinary category (EB-1A). This has already caused a significant number of researchers to go back to China with Deepseek and Qwen teams having a large number of ex-FAANG/OpenAI/Anthropic engineers.I don't see how the US maintains its lead in the AI race long term if it revokes visas for Chinese students.",

I learned so much in such little time and picked up so many soft skills, such as how to consult different engineers and compile their knowledge to properly add new features to infra way too big for any 1 dev to have 100% knowledge on.But my manager squeezed and sucked all of that passion out of me. I’ve tried my best to work on our relationship, but he’s spent all year treating me with explicit disdain, not making eye contact, and ignoring whatever I say in team lunches.I buckled down as much as I could to do better, but every 1:1 became a condescending berating session and I never felt like I truly belonged on the team.Whenever features were delayed, the majority of the time it was because of consistently broken infra, incomplete features from sister teams that mine depended on to start, or inaccurate guidance from dev’s I was asked to consult. I accepted the weaknesses within my control and improved them, but no matter what I did, I could never beat the narrative.Anything I did good was sarcastically devalued and whenever anything went wrong, my manager would tell me I should’ve taken X action that I wouldn’t have known to do at the time without privileged knowledge or time travel (hindsight advice).Coworkers and mentor repeatedly told me I was doing fine, but I just had our first performance review, and I’m being offered 2 things:**PIP vs Severance.**This severance side offer is brand new this year and our company has had huge layoffs.The actual meeting was another vague collection of criticisms, in which, when I asked him what I could’ve ideally done differently, he said “I’m not here to give specific edge cases for you to iterate literally off of and am just looking for high level resourcefulness from you”.When he would list specifically delayed features, I would tell him how I did everything in my power, including implementing his advice (which I can prove), only for the infra related reasons to delay it.When I tried to show areas I’ve improved in, he would agree but then re-insist how below the mark I am even though I’m never been sure what a “Meets Expectation” counterpart of me hypothetically looks like all year. His goalpost for me always felt fictional.Now, I feel extremely jaded and demotivated being forced into this job market. I’ve been leetcoding here and there before this review to hedge myself, but I’m struggling to hold onto any confidence in my abilities.Maybe I’ll never find an opportunity as good as this one ever again, and I can’t cope with that. I’m going through the motions, contacting some industry friends, and doing those silly LC problems, but I feel hopeless.",

Master's in Cybersecurity. I can script, I know my way around networks, I've deployed everything from ELK stacks to Kubernetes clusters.But apparently none of that matters because:**\"We need someone with 5+ years experience\"** \\- Dude, I have 4+ years in IT, just not all in the same role. Why does teaching cybersecurity to students not count as experience? Why does implementing security frameworks for actual paying clients not count?**\"You don't have experience with Palo Alto/Fortinet/SonicWall\"** \\- IT'S A FUCKING FIREWALL. Yes, each vendor has their own special snowflake syntax and GUI, but the concepts are the same. Port 443 is port 443 whether it's pfSense or a $50k Palo Alto. Give me a week with the documentation and I'll be configuring rules like I've been doing it for years.**\"We need someone who knows our exact stack\"** \\- Cool, so you want a unicorn who has experience with your specific combination of ancient VMware, that one obscure monitoring tool you bought in 2015, and whatever cloud mess you've accumulated over the years.The worst part? Half these jobs get reposted every month because *surprise* \\- that perfect candidate doesn't exist or doesn't want to work for your lowball salary.**And another thing** \\- why the fuck don't internships count as \"real experience\"? I spent 3 years doing actual work during internships. Not fetching coffee or making copies - I was troubleshooting servers, implementing security policies, managing infrastructure. But apparently that's \"just internship experience\" and doesn't count toward their magical 5-year requirement.Meanwhile, every goddamn article and report keeps screaming about the **\"cybersecurity skills shortage\"** and **\"millions of unfilled IT positions.\"** You know what would solve that? HIRING THE YOUNG PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE EAGER TO LEARN AND PROVE THEMSELVES.Instead, companies want to poach already-established professionals from other companies, creating this stupid musical chairs game where everyone just shuffles around for higher salaries while entry-level candidates get locked out entirely. Then they act shocked when there's a \"talent shortage.\"I've had interviews where I walk them through actual projects I've completed, demonstrate my problem-solving skills, show them my homelab setup, and then get rejected because I haven't used their specific brand of the same damn technology I've been working with for years.And don't get me started on cybersecurity roles. \"Entry level position, 5 years experience required.\" The math doesn't fucking math. How am I supposed to get experience if no one will hire me to get experience?I know some of you have been in similar situations. How did you break through this stupid cycle? I'm starting to think I should just lie on my resume about having used every vendor's gear and hope they don't quiz me on CLI commands during the interview./rant**TL;DR:** Job market is stupid, vendors need to stop making the same technology with different commands, and HR departments need to learn the difference between \"nice to have\" and \"absolutely required.\"",

        "content": "Yes, there are a few downsides. The market is also pretty shitty. BUT.. other fields have it so much worse than us.Why SWE is the best:* Even if your goal is to just be an average SWE, you will still end up making 2x or 3x what most other fields make.* The ability to work from home or have a flexible hybrid schedule is AMAZING. There are so many jobs where you have to show up to work at a very specific time and if you're even 1 minute late, you get reprimanded for it. How cool is it that we can show up to work at 11am and leave whenever we want? How cool is it to tell you manager \"Hey I'll be away this afternoon\" and they are totally fine with it? Not many fields have this luxury.* The work is genuinely interesting. Software runs the world. It's awesome to be able to understand how these big systems work and be able to contribute to them. Through real world work + a Computer Science degree, the 'magic' behind computers vanishes and you really start to acknowledge the beauty behind all the abstractions. It's just such a cool field in general.* There is so much variety in what companies you can work for. Want an extremely prestigious and high paying job? You know what to study to make that happen. Want a chill job? You know where to apply for those. Want to join an exciting start-up and work on something from the ground up while wearing multiple hats? Yeah, there are tons of those jobs too. The possibilities are endless.* Similar to the above, there is tons of variety in what you can do in your career. Since SWE is so intertwined with every other field, the possibilities are near endless. Want to make web-apps for millions of people? DO IT!! Want to work on medical devices to save people's lives? YES QUEEN. How about writing code for satellites that power GPS systems across the world? LETS GO!!! Oh, you want to write code for simulation software so scientists can research the effects of earthquakes? AYYYY BRUH!! Literally the possibilities are endless.* It's an office job. I don't have to be out in the extreme heat or extreme cold breaking my body. People who work in manual labour jobs are completely screwed by the time they hit their mid 30s. Aching backs, wrists, shoulders, neck, you name it. Their body is broken when they get into their prime years. The work is also brutal. Imagine lifting heavy things for 12 hours a day in extreme weather, just to make $50k a year? Meanwhile I'm in the office (or at home in my pajamas) drinking some coffee and working on a cool puzzle.. and getting paid tons of money to do it.* The ability to impact millions of people with your code. Not many fields have access to such a large scale as we do. If you work for a well-known company, then it's likely that the features you build and the code that you push will affect the lives of literally millions of people across the world. It's cool to know that your work is recognized on such a global scale.So yeah. I know times are tough right now. There are some downsides of course too. But overall, I think SWE is still the best field.What do you guys think? Feel free to add your own points as I'm sure I missed a ton of things.",

        "content": "This summer, I’m lucky enough to have an internship at a big tech company for software development. I usually love coding but corporate life has been such a culture shock and it’s so mind numbing. I previously interned at a few small startups (15ish & 30ish people). Life there was great. I talked to my coworkers, team lunch, socials, and we got lots of work done as well. At this big tech job, no one talks to anyone. The office, maybe because it’s only 3 days RTO required, is so quiet. At the end of the day I might have spoken twice in 8 hours. Is this all big tech? My team does have fairly older engineers so maybe that’s a factor? It’s so depressing. The work feels so meaningless compared to at startups. I have to write an entire design doc and have team review meetings and revisions for a feature that would take me a week to do otherwise. There are meetings for so many things that could be done over Slack. It all feels so meaningless. They pay me hella tho…Edit: Added the last part",

What prompted me thinking about this:Our Sr Director just announced she was leaving after 1 year with the company, and another Sr Manager adjacent to mine left recently with 1 year at the company. I checked both their LinkedIn profiles - the director has worked at 10 companies in 15 years, and the manager 12 companies in 20 years. What kind of stability is that? These are folks who have a lot of employees reporting to them, and we rely on them for direction and culture building. Also, why are companies continually OK hiring people like this? That's what I *really* don't get. You think you're the special company where this new hire is going to stick around, after over a decade of ~1-1.5 year tenures? It just seems like an incredible waste of resources.Everywhere I look on LinkedIn, it's the same. 1-2 year tenures at every company. Hell, that's barely enough time to really learn the ropes and build some impact projects. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of these people really don't know what they're doing and their actual job is just \"job hopper.\"Thoughts?",

And this was supposedly a very lean organization, right? Totally lean, definitely no bloat there! /s there was a partner team that did almost the exact same thing as us for a different business unit and mirrored nearly the same management structure. VP down to analysts, and we often took on a lot of the stuff that they were supposed to take but they didn't have enough workers...And the weirdest part is that even though we have shifted hundreds of thousands of jobs over to India in their glorified BS office, we still continue to cut more jobs but none of them are management.

Watched one not even have to submit 100 applications and land a new job in less than a month.When they get a job, they work normal hours, have normal expecations, no on call anything, and no weekends. The thought of on call expectations or weekends would literally be laughed at by not only the workers, but the bosses themselves.I just don't know how to find any peace in this industry. I just want to work a normal job where I have normal working hours, realistic deadlines, and not a literal gauntlet just to land a new job if I want.I just feel frankly lost. On the one hand, I like getting better at this job. But on the other hand, I find that this fields expectations of workers is toxic. Worst off is the workers in this field often just \"put up with it\". Which makes it worse because then if you ever set boundaries, the \"norm\" set makes you look like a complainer.Overall, I'm just tired of this field. Does anyone have any suggestions?",

It definitely boosts efficiency, but at least from my experience, it’s nowhere near replacing engineers.I think companies are laying people off because the tech industry is struggling in general. There are lots of contributing factors, like economic shifts or the new government administration, and I feel like people are overreacting by blaming it all on AI. Did Microsoft really lay off 6,000 employees just because of AI progress? I really don’t think so. I’m kinda tired of people overusing the word “AI”What are your thoughts on this?",

He never told me I was doing well either.For my second internship, there were a few weeks where I put in 50-60 hour weeks to ship features ahead of conference demos and production timelines.

For my fourth internship, I worked on core changes that were actually used at scale (millions only, not billions like Meta).My point is that I think it’s clear that I am willing to put in long hours, I’m able to BS impact, I’ve worked at scale, and I’ve been previously a high-performer elsewhere. I think all of these will be helpful in fast promo and avoiding layoffs.",

        "content": "Hello everyone, I graduated in May of 2024 with a BSCS. I failed to secure an internship in either the summer after sophomore or junior year. Just before graduating, I had applied to about 35 jobs with no response - not even an asynchronous coding test. It was already clear that I was cooked with no internships. Combining this disappointment with some major health issues, I went the next 7 months after graduation without applying to a single job. I started applying again in January 2025 and over the last 5 months, I've applied to 142 jobs through Linkedin, Indeed and rarely some other sites.In all of these jobs, only about 15 were for software engineering, with all of the rest being lesser tech roles, some even barely tech related: Data Analyst I, Junior Business Analyst, Entry Level QA tester, etc. I've received a total of 6 \"next steps\" including 3 in person interviews and 0 offers. During this time, the only experience I've been able to advertise is my senior year Software Engineering project (year long capstone), an online Business Analysis course, and a handful of menial summer jobs. Grinding Leetcode is pointless - like I said, I've never even been granted the opportunity of a coding interview. Leveraging what few family connections I have has led to little more than \"apply online\" or \"send me your resume\" (the one with no real experience on it).I hear all of these stories that say \"Don't give up! I applied to 500 jobs before I landed my first software engineering job\". Nevermind that there's no chance of me landing an SE job as my first role (no internships), I have yet to get a straight answer as to where people are even seeing 500 relevant tech roles LET ALONE entry level. Both Indeed and Linkedin have slowed to a drip of one semi-relevant entry level job for every 15 that are irrelevant, a scam, or 2-4 years experience crap.So that's where I am. I have no idea what to do at this point, short of applying to Revature and seeing where that takes me (literally). Every day that goes by, I can feel the entry level CS jobs dwindling. God forbid yet another class graduates before I land a job. If anyone has succeeded after a similar situation, please let me know.The current iteration of my resume.https://imgur.com/a/HMpuu7m?s=smsI’ve made some minor PII redactions for the post and I’ve also recently removed the few summer jobs from “Experience” as it didn’t seem to be doing me any favors.

Everything On a second note, do you believe AI ruined the market for all or made it better? From my opinion (with no research yet), I believe AI will make all markets and careers worse as the dependency on computers will grow to save companies money. But then again, if that would happen, would it not get to a point where people are unable to give their money to these companies? **EDIT: Someone notified me I need to be more specific about the year, so let’s say between 2014-2019**",

        "author": "LeadBamboozler",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Sharing this as a heads-up for anyone considering interviewing with CoreWeave, especially for security or infrastructure roles. I went through two interview loops with them, several months apart, and was ghosted once and required multiple follow-ups to not be ghosted a second time — despite confirmed positive feedback from interviewers.**Round 1 (~7 months ago)**I interviewed for a Tech Lead role with a near perfect match in domain, stack, ownership, and experience level. Went through five rounds:- Recruiter- Director- Tech Lead (coding round)- Principal Engineer (system design)- Security Analyst (cross-functional)I moved through the interview cycle and after the cross-functional round, the recruiter emailed me thanking me for taking the time to interview and said he’d collate the feedback and be in touch when he had an update. Ghosted after this email despite repeated follow-ups. I connected with the Director on LinkedIn a month or so after this.**Round 2 (3 weeks ago)**The director shared a Staff Engineer posting that looked to be a direct replacement for the Tech Lead role, so I reached out to him on LinkedIn. He apologized for the earlier ghosting, said I got strong feedback, and that the org had new leadership and shifted direction — fewer managers, more senior ICs. He said he’d love to re-engage and that the recruiter would reach out.The recruiter (same one who ghosted me originally) called me a few days later — but instead of the Staff role, he described an Infrastructure Security role that had similar domain requirements. Maybe I should’ve clarified right then, but I assumed it was all part of the same track and the recruiter mentioned that I would be assessed on the same principles that I was assessed on in the previous interview loop - he explicitly said that he had no concerns at all.They scheduled me with a new distinguished engineer who had joined since the original ghosting. We did not cover a single topic that was discussed in the previous interview.While the discussion was somewhat related to my area, there was a focus on some fairly obscure but oddly specific topics. Despite the curveball - I think I reasoned correctly about the nuances while acknowledging that this area was not something I had direct experience in. The discussion was still highly collaborative and flowed naturally and at the end, the DE mentioned he hoped to speak with me again soon.Then: more silence. Followed up with the recruiter. Nothing. Followed up with the Director on LinkedIn. He said, “let me talk to the recruiter.” A few days later I got a templated rejection email. Zero feedback with an explicit note in the template saying they can’t provide feedback.I understand that goals evolve quickly at high-growth companies. But from a candidate’s perspective, this felt like goalposts were shifting between cycles, and maybe even between rounds. There is a total misalignment in what they’re looking for and across what experience levels. Interestingly - one of the questions I asked DE was *what was the hardest problem he was trying to solve at CoreWeave?*His answer? Hiring and building the team.So if you're thinking of interviewing with CoreWeave: proceed with your eyes open. This process burned a lot of my time, and I walked away with zero signal on where I was off target.",

Think San Antonio / Orlando / Phoenix type of MCOL city.The job’s honestly pretty great, super chill WLB (almost never over 40 hours), everyone’s really friendly, and the tech stack is solid (React, Spring Boot, Django) since the project only started in 2020. It’s laid-back enough that I’ve had the freedom to work on finishing my OMSCS degree from Georgia Tech.Now I just got an offer for a new job in Seattle, around $140k, hybrid (2 days in-office) for now but I’ve heard they might go full RTO soon. I used one of those simple cost of living calculators online and it says my current $80k here is equivalent to about $110k in Seattle... So I'm wondering… is being fully remote worth the $30k difference?Would love to hear your thoughts. And just for context—I’m 32M, married (no kids), and had a totally different career for most of my 20s before I got my 2nd degree in CS and switched to tech. My wife (30F) makes around $80k and works in a field where she can find a new job within a week in pretty much any major city, so we’re not worried about her on that front.",

I landed my first software engineering job about 6 months ago after applying to over 750 jobs. The process broke me a bit, but I was so relieved to finally get a foot in the door. This was the only company I made to the final round, so I was going to take it since I was graduating in the next couple months and needed to secure work. It’s a small startup with a team of about 10 engineers. But the environment and expectations are burning me out and I don’t know what to do. Here’s what’s been making this so hard:- Strict micromanagement: My boss tracks and questions every small task. Sometimes asking for 5-6 different changes on the same ticket. When I think something is done, I have to go back and add even more to it, despite it never being asked in the first place. - Zero mentorship or support: I was thrown into the codebase with minimal onboarding and barely any documentation. No code reviews, no senior dev guidance — I’m expected to figure out complex features solo and somehow get everything right. Ive been able to figure things out, but it’s been a very tedious and tiresome process. - Unrealistic expectations: Every ticket is somehow “urgent,” and I always feel behind because the timelines just aren’t realistic. There’s no prioritization since EVERYTHING seems to be high priority. Every month management says they will “replan the month priorities” but they never do and I’m stuck with infinite tickets for the month that just all need to be done. - Long commute: have a 3 hour daily commute (1.5 hours each way). I am yet to ask for remote work, but my peer told me not to expect more than 1 day remote, despite the majority of the team having 2-3 days a week remote. By the time I get home, Im exhausted and barely have time to decompress or do things I like before having to sleep to get my 8 hours. Ultimately, I feel trapped. I was grateful to find work after sending 700+ apps, but this constant grind in this environment is really disrupting my mental health. I don’t want to go back to square one and leave this job since I have a lot of financial pressures, but can’t see my self staying here much longer. Does anyone have any tips or advice on how to manage this? I feel like 1yoe does not mean anything in this market, but Im not sure how much longer I can continue doing this. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!TLDR: 6 months into first SWE role, feeling stressed from work environment, expectations, and commute. What should I do?",

Great team, great manager, chill vibesFor reasons almost entirely out of our control, it’s pretty likely the god programmer of my team, who’s basically built our testing tools from the ground up, won’t be able to stay with us for much longer - 6 months max.I’m the second person with any kind of xp on the codebase they work on and I didn’t want to take on that kind of burden, its high visibility meaning the customer will be bombarding me with support requests and questions for this tool and sure enough boss tells me that if he can’t get any more resources, he’d like me and another guy with even less xp to start gaining as much knowledge from principal engineer as possible. This also means that if I do end up taking it on, I’d have to worry about building up the next gen version of the tool from scratch.I’m not in FANG because I didn’t want to deal with stuff like this, and I’m worried taking this on will end up stressing me out and ruining what is otherwise a good job.

        "content": "Hello fellow Redditors, I am hoping to find some help with respect to job hunting.I have obtained a Bachelor's of Computer Science about 5 years ago but have had absolutely zero luck with job applications. I have sent out what seems to be maybe 200-300 or so applications and got one interview (no further offer, through a connection). It seems that I have spent so much time trying but not getting anywhere. I ended up going back to my previous career because I had bills to pay. I have always been interested in tech and have been a tinkerer forever - taking things apart to see how they work - both hardware, and software. I hate to see the time invested in my new career go to waste (other than the intellectual knowledge), and, I do truly want to work in this industry.For context, I live in Ontario, near the GTA. I would prefer remote or nearby (west of GTA) if it's onsite.For my resume, I used the \"famous sheets\" resume on Reddit. I don't know if it was my resume per se, it looks like a pretty typical graduate resume I would think(?) I had my university review it and have made the suggested modifications to make it look good. I have also further tweaked it a bit with the help of my peers.I do not have a lot of technology experience besides it being a hobby (as I have mentioned), and of course, my education.Any tips / help / where to apply / perhaps using AI to improve my resume?Thanks!Edit 1: Have not been looking for 5 years steadily, I have looked on-and-off due to life. Think of it as \"application blitzes\".",

But it feels like I am wasting my energy, potential and passion for coding. Value of returns feels like non-existent - doesn’t matter how much I push, salary never changes and it’s same tickets grind every single day. I could stop being proactive and do only 50% - but that feels equally wrong and just boring.Sometimes I think I should use all this energy and do my own thing: launch own agency, build SaaS startup, create youtube channel or do any other stuff that could bring more money (yes, salary is not that great in Europe besides Switzerland).What should I do? How not to loose passion? How to use this energy and potential to maximise returns? Every day in job feels like I am limiting my self. And I don’t want to spend my free time on random hobby.

I got a rejection from a job that mentioned something about needing to be able to legally work in the country I reside in. I think it's the rejection for needing an H1B visa. Considering that I'm a US citizen working from the US, I decided to reply, despite thinking my email would go into some inbox or maybe the trash, never to be seen. I got laid off over 2 weeks ago so I really need a job, but also this is a job that I am genuinely excited about and would apply there even if I had a job, so I figured what do I have to lose? To my surprise, I got a reply less than 2 hours later saying that there was an error in the filters they set up and my application was rejected by mistake. They got my application back in the queue. I emailed them back thanking them for investigating and letting me know what happened. They replied saying that I also saved 2 other applications from false rejection. While this may not get me a job, it got me on their radar, restored some of my own faith in humanity, and also saved 2 other people from the same hopelessness. I usually wouldn't pay much attention to a rejection email since they're all usually the same, but I guess don't be scared to take a chance and reach out? It most likely won't go anywhere, but sometimes it does. By the way, I'm not saying to reply to actual rejections, but if something doesn't seem to make sense, speak up, these systems aren't perfect.",

As Blind/Glassdoor indicate that Atlassian is an absolute horror show. Affirm seems like a very chill company & I had a good time interviewing with them. The same goes for Atlassian, as each interview I had was generally chill & the hiring manager I met with was very nice. My gut tells me to take the risk since the comp difference is too much to pass up/this is a potential level up in my career. My main worry is: I've seen various horror stories on Blind & Glassdoor, that make it sound like I'm signing myself for a death march if I end up going with Atlassian. Can anyone who has worked at Atlassian chime in here? I feel like those employed at Atlassian on Blind are very aggressive in telling people to avoid it at all costs, is joining Atlassian a bad career move???What would you all do in my situation? Take Affirm or Atlassian? Previously an L6 at Amazon for 3 years (left due to RTO). So I have some idea of how to navigate a traditional big tech climate.",

        "content": "Some of these may be obvious but I guess it wasn't for me.1.) during coding rounds, verbalize to confirm understanding not to express thinkingI used to think that I should vocalize all my thoughts and avoid any silence. This has proven to be problematic for a few reasons. First, when you're initially reading the question, vocalizing will unnecessarily slow you down. Second, you probably don't sound very smart when you're quickly reading the question like that, you might start looking for ways to condense sentences, skip over certain sentences, etc. It's all unnecessary.The time to vocalize your thoughts is after you've read it and to then confirm your understanding of the question with the interviewer.Then instead of brainstorming out loud the very first thing that comes to mind. I would ask for another minute to think of how you'd approach the question. The problem with saying the very first thing that comes to mind is that if it's obviously wrong then the interviewer may correct you which would be interpreted as giving you a hint which would count against you. After you've wrestled with the idea for a bit only then share your solution out loud with the interviewer.I wouldn't even bother mentioning an obvious brute force solution if you already have a better idea in mind since talking about the brute force will cut into your time.So the TLDR here is to be more strategic about when to vocalize your thought process.2.) during non-coding rounds, wait for your turn to talk, never interrupt the interviewerThis will probably be obvious to most but I used to interrupt the interviewer near the beginning. Not intentionally. If they said something that I thought would make for a really interesting question, then I would ask it right there when there was a natural pause in the conversation.I now realize this is very bad. It's always better to wait till you're sure that they are done speaking or until they ask you if you have any questions. You gain nothing by interrupting them but can easily make a bad impression and decrease the signal you give from your question by asking during a time in which they aren't fully ready to evaluate you since they still need to get through the rest of what they wanted to say. Plus, they might have brought up an even better point later on.3.) during a hiring manager round, to express that you're serious about the role, interview the interviewerYou can't tell the interviewer that you really want the position. That you've deeply thought about staying at the company in the long term. That you are a top candidate.You can only express these things by asking tough questions that make the interviewer think and possibly feel like they're being interviewed. Obviously you don't want to take this too far. You should ask questions that show you've deeply thought about the company's business model and how the role you're being hired for aligns with that. You should ask questions to see how clearly the hiring manager understands what will be needed for the role. It is genuinely a red flag if you're being hired for a role in which the hiring manager is not sure about what you'll be working on. Think about what other things could be red flags as well and ask some pointed (but still polite) questions about those.My current strategy for this is to split my preparation for this part of the interview over 2 days. On day 1 I learn as much as I can from quick online research about the company and do my best to come up with questions of substance. On day 2 I try again and this is when I come up with much higher quality questions.",

My best guess is that it's hip to cheer for the new hot startup rather than a company owned by the company that was so last decade. Or maybe I'm reading too much into it? I ask because I'm actually at one of these places (not DeepMind), and interviewing at the other two, and I want to know if I'm missing anything (and if I'm being honest, public perception matters to me at least a little bit).

        "content": "I graduated from a CS bootcamp in May 2023. Previously I had only worked in retail. I do not have a Bachelor's or even an AA degree (though a decent amount of community college units completed). Right out of the bootcamp I was lucky enough to land an internship at a small government organization via a connection through the bootcamp.I was then converted to full time after the internship. It was a pretty modest junior web developer role that only paid about $50k/yr but the work environment and mentorship were phenomenal. And at least it had some pension and healthcare benefits. Over the last 22 months I've learned a ton and have been given the freedom to make some large and meaningful contributions to the company's flagship products.Sadly we've been hit with some pretty heft budget cutbacks. As the most junior person at the company I'm first on the chopping block and was laid off. As I was being let go, the organization's director offered me a Teaching Assist position at the bootcamp I had graduated. Apparently part of their deal with the bootcamp requires they contribute a certain amount of developer hours towards instruction.She wanted to try something new with a single dev doing the Teaching Assistant thing full time (previously they'd have the more senior devs rotate in every now and then). Currently I work 3 days from home and 2 days in-office. The teaching role would be 4 days a week on-site. I would still be employed by my current organization and keep the title of \"Junior Web Developer\". My compensation would be cut down to $30k/yr AND no benefits.I have a few days to think it over but am tempted to pass on the \"opportunity\". Would that be a mistake? It would be nice to add a third year as a junior developer to my resume along with some teaching experience but I feel like they're really just taking advantage of me.Alternatively I can try to test the waters in this absolutely awful job market. But don't foresee myself getting anywhere. I know tons of people with CS degrees that are having no luck whatsoever. I could also alternatively collect unemployment while working towards an accelerated degree program myself and hope things get better in a year or two.I feel stuck between two kinda terrible options. Any advice is very much appreciated. Thanks!tl;dr Bootcamp grad with no degree but 2 yoe. Currently making $50k/yr with healthcare benefits. Was laid off but offered $30k/yr and no healthcare. Should I take the ~$1900/mo net pay offer just to pad my resume while looking for other jobs? Alternatively I could collect unemployment at $1800/months for 6 months while applying full time and working towards a CS degreeEdit: I spoke to my principal engineer and he was pretty adamant that I do not take that position. He said he couldn’t promise anything but if there was ever an opening for a developer I would be the first person he calls. If I took the teaching job he would be pretty powerless to bring me back on",

I like math and computers, and I'm looking for a degree where the skills can be used for creative projects of some kind, outside of work.Because of health issues, I don't have much work experience for someone my age (I was on disability for a long time). I'm mostly recovered now, and thankfully my partner would be able to support us if I decided to go to school full time.But I would be around 37 when I graduate, so that worries me a bit. I know there are a lot of ageism issues, and that things like internships are important. I also worry that since I already lack a strong work history, spending another 4\\~5 years in school will make for a worse situation with regard to that.I don't have any lofty career aspirations, but obviously I would still like to find a job after (or during) school. The other degree I'm most interested in is visual art, which I think has even worse career prospects lol.Basically looking for some guidance on whether it's reasonable to go for CS factoring in my age, sparse resume, the job market, etc. And is the outlook so bad that I should just say F it and go for an art degree instead?? half kidding haha",

One of the companies I contacted asked about JVM, databases, and made me do LeetCode problems. I got the offer later and accepted it considering the fair salary. But I thought my role was to do Java backend development.However, when I got into the company, I found out that they were using GWT (Google Web Toolkit) to build both frontend and backend, and I was assigned to GWT front end to develop web applications and desktop applications.For your reference, GWT means developing frontend and backend using Java alone. The frontend is trans-compiled into JS code by the GWT compiler from Java code. Google used it to build Google Docs.The technology-GWT is already abandoned by Google, and nobody is using that anymore. I felt very pressured about my current situation but was afraid to jump to other positions because I thought I would not competitive, and jumping too fast would be a stain on my resume as a new graduate. And I also hesitated about the thought of going for a master's degree.And this is a vicious downward spiral. The more I delay finding a real Java backend position, the less valuable I become on the job market.Having stayed at the role for two years, now I did realize my situation, and I think the correct solution is try to jump to other companies as soon as possible. And I think the master's degree solution has more disadvantages in terms of accumulation of savings, so I abandoned it.Still, I feel very anxious about starting finding jobs, because apparently working experience is the most valuable thing on the job market. If I apply for a front-end job (that is what I'm doing with GWT), nobody wants a Java programmer because the market needs React.js and JavaScript programmer. If I apply for a back-end job, my working experience is useless too because I didn't do SpringBoot.I think I am really in a very disadvantageous situation now. I wonder how you view my situation, and I would appreciate it if you have suggestions for me.",

        "content": "I love technology akin to a child who loved going to candy land. That's what made me aspire for the profession. I wanted to be involved in it, specially the software - the coding, testing, studying, whatever else. Basically, I'm a nerd. But reality is harsher and often more disappointing than fantasy. My first job and my current one completely and utterly killed any sort of passion I had for the profession. I was squeezed dry with nothing left to give... and I feel so lost. I've been asking myself the past few months - Where do I go? What should I do?My first job was a software dev in a small 50+ company. They say your first job out of college is always an experience, for good or ill, which I agree. I learned a lot and realized some things about myself. I made great memories with my former colleagues. However, more than a year, I was forced to consider the decision to leave due to several reasons - I love coding as much as the next guy but the company is too disorganized. We had to change tech stack twice in just a few months. I also got somewhat disillusioned at the realization that projects never truly end - I love learning as much as the next guy, but all the endless studying that ends up becoming obsolete too quickly... got to me somewhat. It's weird given why I wanted to become a dev in the first place, but it feels like, in a sense, I developed a depression in futility. It's like none of things I did would matter in the next few months. I would've been fine with it. But it's too quickly in my opinion...My second job was in a corporate bank as an SRE junior officer. I like how organized it is. How much less pressure there is on me. I can safely take a Leave when necessary without the threat of on-call. Odd because this job IS an on-call. High salary. Great benefits. I also thought trying a different job might grant me new perspective. Switching from development to operations. It's not a total career switching, but it's different enough.I was optimistic... and got punished for it. After I got regularized, my workload gradually increased. I can normally handle it but the issue is the way things happened.I currently live in a solo apartment, on-call hybrid setup (just this month, I had to work outside my hours many times, some on weekends). There's so much to learn, so much to do, so much juggle... I *can't*. I can't keep up. I realized a fundamental fact about myself - I'm not a great multitasker. I'm a deep thinker (which is why I aspired to be a dev in the first place). I can multi-task, but not so often and not so fast-paced. It's not sustainable. And now, I'm falling apart.My routine was ruined. I don't eat as much. I have inconsistent sleep hours (too few or too much sleep). I don't even leave my apartment in the weekends because I'm too tired and I have housework to do. The salary is great but I doubt it's worth how disorganized I've become. I've become obsessed with completing my tasks. I don't respond to my parents' calls and messages anymore. It hasn't even been a year and I'm already crushed under pressure.Things became so bad my work performance plummeted - lapses in judgement, slower memory, increasingly \"closed-off\" behavior, breathing problems, headaches, constant exhaustion... I pretty much decided to screw it and go home this weekend. I want to see my family and de-stress. But I know fully well that won't be enough.I don't know what to do. I want to job hop but even THAT is an effort in itself in my current situation. I'm too tired for it. I took Leave once a month, but it's not enough.I made enough savings and my family is not financially struggling. My sister already has a job and graduating in a month or two. I feel guilty for the idea nonetheless because I'll become a burden and is using them to cushion me, but I'm so lost.I also don't know where I want to go, what I want to do. Do I leave IT profession entirely? Or is it a case of having terrible work-life balance and hope the next one would be the golden goose? I'm being pessimistic right now and believe that's just perpetuating the cycle.I'm at a point where I'd probably be happy with a lower paying job with less stress and pressure on studying off-hours like my experiences forced on me.",

Individual sprint tasks also tend to have unknowns which expand the amount of time needed. Tasks rarely take as long as expected.My manager doesn't like us adding in buffer time for unknowns, and has pushed back on me doing this before. So I feel like my only option is to take on a load of work that I *know* won't get finished, and deal with the shittiness of finishing each sprint with leftover work to do.Looking at other members of my team, they also carry items, sometimes for a very long time. Is this the norm in the industry?

I don’t particularly enjoy my current role so I have been trying to advocate for myself within the company and pursue a role change to gear more towards the tools and technologies I enjoy using and want to learn. But this process has been very stressful for me due to a kinda toxic team dynamic and also the company being very unstructured and vague when it comes to role changes and promotions. My problem is that this work stress and politics is driving me insane and I can’t stop thinking about it even in the little time I get to myself outside of work. I want to get better at just shutting off work brain once I leave the office but it feels impossible. The recent anxiety and frustration I have been feeling because of being stuck in a role I don’t enjoy never goes away and only gets worse. I really want to be like one of those people who think of their job as just a job that earns them money and are able to spend their personal time on non work related things. I have hobbies and passion projects I wanna work on but I even find it hard to focus on them or be motivated about them with all the work related tension in my head. If not physically exhausted, I am always too mentally exhausted to spend my time in anything actually fulfilling outside of work. I am already starting to feel the beginnings of a burnout as a result of all this so I want to fix this before things get worse.

Some of the remaining questions were things I just didn’t remember from courses a year or two ago that I knew I’d wanna slap myself for forgetting since once I looked up the answer it was an “OH RIGHT!” moment.The other questions were just something I got really nervous and wasn’t thinking clearly — after I left the interview and thought of it for a couple minutes I got the answer and was pissed.Whats your advice for how to pick yourself up after something like this? I’m really mad at myself, especially since interviews feel so rare so it feels like I fucked up my one good chance",

I recently received an offer from an ai startup <20 people , and I think this could be a good chance for me to take on more responsibility and work. However, there is 5 day RTO, and I imagine that there is an expectation to work long hours at the startup (the commute would be 15-20 mins). On one hand I don't have a problem with the RTO, because I think that working with a team of engineers in office would be a great opportunity, but on the other hand, I'm worried about the drastic work life balance change.In terms of TC, the salary at the startup is about equivalent to my current TC. I figure that in most situations, it would be better to stay at the job with some job stability, but I'm wondering if the tradeoff in personal development is worth it.",

I got put on a project through consulting as the manager thought I had potential to grow, and when I needed help with anything, I got an attitude about it from everyone else and nobody on site to help as the rest of the team was in India, and they released me from the project, but on LinkedIn, I saw the same job posted, but they said must have at least 5 years experience and \\*\\*No consultants or independent recruiters, please\\*\\*. Another project they put on hundreds of people in the United States, only to release me and more than half the rest of us, just because the client changed their minds. I don't get why they keep putting new jobs out there just to say in the end they only wants seniors or offshore people. Didn't they already know that before posting them?",

        "content": "This company sells software the county govts use to files property taxes. It seems pretty solid, and I just had my first day yesterday. Their front end is pretty straightforward, using js, html, css, etc. but they use ancient languages like pick basic for everything else. The reason for this i’m guessing is because of the huge amount of red tape and compliances your software has to have, and the fact that it’s old and works is enough of a reason to not re-vamp the whole thing.The problem is, though, i’m 22. I want to get into development, and while this job offers that, will I get stuck here? My friends are telling me that I am ‘cooked’ but in my mind, even with these old languages, there is still so much practical experience here that can transfer into better development jobs that is much better than just sitting on my ass and getting decline letters for lack of experience. In my mind, this is my experience and even if it’s old, I think that the other skills combined that I will use in this job will make up for everything else.The best things this job offers in my opinion, is their front-end development, and also linux experience. They use a lot of linux, and as of now I am too inexperienced to explain how they use linux, even though I took classes on it in college. I do think that this is great experience though, and hope it is transferrable if I get another opportunity.",

        "content": "TL;DR - Inherited a project right before the birth of my child, have been working since. Project has been stalling, and my health is deteriorating taking care of the newborn and project. How can I request paternity leave in this situation?Hi, TIA.I started at my new company late last year, and did a fair/ok job, so I started inheriting teammates assignments (we code).My senior teammate (didn’t get to spend much time with them due to teammate being OOO for a good portion of Q4) left the bank in Q1, and transferred their a project code body and materials to me.It was around their departure time that I let work know I was expecting a baby at the beginning of Q2. Given that I was relatively new, and our FTE count was down due to this departure, I agreed to help complete their outstanding projects with the expectation of taking time in July (I know, I know…this was a bad idea. Had I known the complexity of this project, if it was further pushed by management, I would have refused or resigned).Baby came at the start of Q2, and the project has experienced setbacks — I learned after the fact that the knowledge transfer wasn’t all that complete, and the block of code i recieved in transition will probably require major rework thru validation. I can easily see this going thru Q2 and into the beginning of Q3.Issue is I’m not sleeping due to the baby schedule, and I have a chronic condition I am managing privately. It’s not an issue usually, but currently I am feeling exhausted and starting to experience burnout. My partner is also starting to wear thin, and is requesting my presence with the newborn and our other children. We are entitled to a large amount of paternity leave at my company, but I feel this would almost be considered abandoning my project. I’m currently stuck between not wanting to fail work/losing employment and being there for my family.Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks again.",
