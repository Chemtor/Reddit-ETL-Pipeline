        "content": "Yesterday morning, all capacity in a Microsoft Fabric production environment was completely drained — and it’s only April. What happened? A long-running pipeline was left active overnight. It was… let’s say, *less than optimal* in design and ended up consuming an absurd amount of resources.Now the entire tenant is locked. No deployments. No pipeline runs. No changes. Nothing.The team is on the $8K/month plan, but since the entire annual quota has been burned through in just a few months, the only option to regain functionality before the next reset (in \\~2 weeks) is upgrading to the $20K/month Enterprise tier.To make things more exciting, the deadline for delivering a production-ready Fabric setup is tomorrow. So yeah — blocked, under pressure, and paying thousands for a frozen environment.Ironically, version control and proper testing processes were proposed weeks ago but were brushed off in favor of moving quickly and keeping things “lightweight.”The dream was Spark magic, ChatGPT-powered pipelines, and effortless deployment. The reality? Burned-out capacity, missed deadlines, and a very expensive cloud paperweight.And now someone’s spending their day untangling this mess — armed with nothing but regret and a silent *“I told you so.”*",

        "content": "Hey I'm doing one of these sankey charts to show visualize my job search this year. I have 5 YOE working at a startup and was looking for a bigger, more stable company focused on a mature product/platform. I tried applying to a bunch of places at the end of last year, but hiring had already slowed down. At the beginning of this year I found a bunch of applications to remote companies on LinkedIn that seemed interesting and applied. I knew it'd be a pretty big longshot to get interviews, yet I felt confident enough having some experience under my belt. I believe I started applying at the end of January and finally landed a role at the end of March.I definitely have been fortunate to not need to submit hundreds of applications here, and I don't really have any specific advice on how to get offers other than being likable and competent (even when doing leetcode-style questions). I guess my one piece of advice is to apply to companies that you feel have you build good conversational rapport with, people that seem nice, and genuinely make you interested. Also say no to 4 hour interviews, those suck and I always bomb them. Often the kind of people you meet in these gauntlets are up to luck too so don't beat yourself up about getting filtered.If anyone has questions I'd be happy to try and answer, but honestly I'm just another data engineer who feels like they got lucky.",

Like in my whole experience I never got the chance to write SQL in detail. Or even if I did I would have failed. I guess that is the reason I am still failing offers. I work in consultancy so the projects I got were mostly just mediocre at best. And it was just labour work with tight deadlines to either fix things or work on the same pattern someone built something. I always got overworked maybe because my communication sucked. And was too tired to learn anything after job.I never even saw a real data warehouse at work. I can still write Python code and write SQL queries but what you can call mediocre. If you told me write some complex pipeline or query I would probably fail.I am not sure how I even got this far. And I still think about removing some of my experience from cv to apply for junior data engineer roles and learn the way it's meant to be. I'm still afraid to apply for Senior roles because I don't think I'll even qualify as Senior, or they might laugh at me for things I should know but I don't. I once got rejected just because they said I overcomplicated stuff when the pipeline should have been short and simple. I still think I should have done it better if I was even slightly better at data engineering. I am just lost. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks",

Income from support and extra features down the road if this is actually useful.---Performance so far:- 1k+ stream queries/sec on an AWS t4g.nano instance (AWS price \\~$3/month)- 800k+ q/sec on an AWS c8g.large instance.

It compresses super well, fast as hell, maintains a schema, and doesn't corrupt data (I'm looking at you Excel & CSV). but...It's impossible to view without some code / CLI. Super annoying, especially if you need to peek at what you're doing before starting some analyse. Or frankly just debugging an output dataset.This has been my biggest pet peeve for the last 6 years of my life. So I've fixed it haha.The image below shows you how you can quick view a parquet file from directly within the operating system. Works across different apps that support previewing, etc. Also, no size limit (because it's a preview obviously) I believe strongly that the data space has been neglected on the UI & continuity front. Something that video, for example, doesn't face.I'm planning on adding other formats commonly used in Data Science / Engineering.Like:\\- Partitioned Directories *( this is pretty tricky )*\\- HDF5\\- Avro\\- ORC\\- Feather\\- JSON Lines\\- DuckDB (.db)\\- SQLLite (.db)\\- Formats above, but directly from S3 / GCS without going to the console. Any other format I should add?Let me know what you think!https://i.redd.it/u7fgrobkzite1.gif",

This version is built on Azure, using Databricks as the datawarehouse and orchestrating the full end-to-end via Databricks jobs. Transformations are done using Pyspark, along with many configuration files for modularity. Pydantic, Pytest and custom built DQ rules were also built into the pipeline.Repo link -> [https://github.com/JonathanEnright/aoe\\_project\\_azure](https://github.com/JonathanEnright/aoe_project_azure)Most importantly, the dashboard is now freely accessible as it is built in Streamlit and hosted on Streamlit cloud.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,I'm looking for some suggestions and ideas around building a data engineering stack for my organization. The goal is to support a variety of teams — data science, analytics, BI, and of course, data engineering — all with different needs and workflows.Our current approach is pretty straightforward: **S3 → DB → Validation → Transformation → BI**We use Apache Airflow for orchestration, and rely heavily on **raw SQL** for both data validation and transformation. The raw data is also consumed by the data science team for their analytics and modeling work.This is **mostly batch processing**, and we don't have much need for real-time or streaming pipelines — at least for now.In terms of **data volume**, we typically deal with datasets ranging from **1GB to 100GB**, but there are occasional use cases that go beyond that. I’m totally fine with having **separate stacks** for smaller and larger projects if that makes things more efficient — lighter stack for <100GB and something more robust for heavier loads.While this setup works, I'm trying to build a more solid, scalable foundation from the ground up. I’d love to know what tools and practices others are using out there. Maybe there’s a simpler or more modern approach we haven’t considered yet.I’m open to alternatives to Apache Airflow and wouldn’t mind using something like **dbt** for transformations — as long as there’s a clear value in doing so.**So my questions are:*** What’s your go-to data stack for cross-functional teams?* Are there tools that helped you simplify or scale better?* If you think our current approach is already good enough, I’d still appreciate any thoughts or confirmation.I lean towards **open-source** tools wherever possible, but I'm not against using **subscription-based solutions** — as long as they provide a clear value-add for our use case and aren’t too expensive.Thanks in advance!",

And aren't there easy solutions to develop locally?My use case is pretty simple and generic. Also, not too speed-intensive. We are just trying to migrate to a horizontally-scalable processing tool to deal with our sporadic larger-than-memory data, not having to impose low data size limits on our application. We have done what we could with Polars for the past two years to keep everything light but our need for a flexible and bullet proof tool is clear now, and it seems we can't keep running from distributed alternatives.Dask seems like a much easier alternative, but we also worry about integration with different languages and technologies, and Dask is pretty tied to Python. Another component of our backend is written in Elixir, which still does not have a Spark API, but there is [a little hope](https://github.com/elixir-explorer/explorer#:~:text=or%20even%20Spark%20dataframes), so Spark seems more democratic.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Greetings, this is my first post here. I've been working in DE for the last 5 years now doing various things with Airflow and Dagster. I have a question regarding design of data flow from APIs to our database.I am using Dagster/Python to perform the API pulls and loads into Snowflake.My team lead insists that we load JSON data into our Snowflake RAW\\_DATA in the following way:ID (should be a surrogate/non-native PK) PAYLOAD (raw JSON payload, either as a VARCHAR or VARIANT type) CREATED\\_DATE (timestamp this row was created in Snowflake) UPDATE\\_DATE (timestamp this row was updated in Snowflake)Flattening of the payload then happens in SQL as a plain View, which we currently autogenerate using Python and manually edit and add to Snowflake.He does not want us (DE team) to use DBT to do any transforming of RAW\\_DATA. DBT is only for the Data Analyst team to use for creating models.The main advantage I see to this approach is flexibility if the JSON schema changes. You can freely append/drop/insert/reorder/rename columns. whereas a normal table you can only drop, append, and rename.On the downside, it is slow and clunky to parse with SQL and access the data as a view. It just seems inefficient to have to recompute the view and parse all those JSON payloads whenever you want to access the table. I'd much rather do the flattening in Python, either manually or using dlt. Some JSON payloads I 'pre-flatten' in Python to make them easier to parse in SQL.Is there a better way, or is this how you all handle this as well?",

        "author": "trianglesteve",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "This is a broader modeling question, but my use case is specifically for Power BI. I've got a Power BI semantic model that I'm trying to minimize the memory impact on the tenant capacity. The company is cheaping out and only wants the bare minimum capacity in PBI and we're already hitting the capacity limits regularly. The model itself is already in star schema format and I've optimized the tables/views on the database side to refresh the dataset quick enough, but the problem comes when users interact with the report and the model is loaded into the limited memory we have available in the tenant. One thing I could do to further optimize for memory in the dataset is chain the 2 main fact tables together, which I know breaks some of Kimball's modeling rules. However, one of them is a naturally related higher grain (think order detail/order header) I could reduce the size of the detail table by relating it directly to the higher grain header table and remove the surrogate keys that could instead be passed down by the header table. In theory this could reduce the memory footprint (I'm estimating by maybe 25-30%) at a potential small cost in terms of calculating some measures at the lowest grain. Does it ever make sense to bend or break the modeling rules? Would this be a good case for it?Edit:There are lots of great ideas here! Sounds like there are times to break the rules when you understand what it’ll mean (if you don’t hear back from me I’m being held against my will by the Kimball secret police). I’ll test it out and see exactly how much memory I can save on the chained fact tables and test visual/measure performance between the two models.I’ll work with the customers and see where there may be opportunities to aggregate and exactly which fields need to be filterable to the lowest grain, and I will see if there’s a chance leadership will budge on their cheap budget, I appreciate all the feedback!",

Usually, logging is done with the idea that you don’t know when you’ll need to look at these… but they’re usually the last resort. Audit access, debug, … mostly adhoc stuff, or compliance stuff. I think it stands to reason that logging is a preventative approach to problem solving (“worst case, we have the logs”). Correct me if I am wrong, but it would also make sense then that we plan ahead by not making it a PITA to work with the data. Not by modeling a database, no, but by spending 10 minutes to build a centralized logging module that accepts parameter used input and produces an effective TSV output (or something similar… it doesn’t need to be TSV). It’s about striking a balance between human readability and machine readability, knowing well enough we’re going to parse it once its millions of lines long.",

Beside, pricing can be high, especially the serverless one.**+ Bigquery + dbt:** full SQL for transformation, use Bigquery compute slot so not sure if it is cheaper than Dataflow/Dataproc. Need to pay extra price for dbt cloud.**+ Bigquery + Dataform:** we came across a solution which everything can be cleaned/transformed inside bigquery but it seems new and hard to maintained.**+ DataFusion:** no-code, BI team and manager likes it but we are convincing them as they are hard to maintain in future :'( Can any expert or experienced GCP data architect advice us the best or most common solution to be used on GCP for our ETL pipeline?Thanks all!!!!",

I think this is fairly \"normal\" stuff (?).We would like be able to send a very small subset of these messages to a lower environment so that we can compare the output of a data pipeline. We need to have some sort of filtering logic, e.g. if the message looks like `{cool: true, machineId: \"abcd\"}`, we want to send all messages where `machineId` == `abcd` to this other environment.I'm guessing there are a million ways we could do this, e.g. we could start this at the Flume level, but in my head it seems like it would be \"nice\" (though I can't exactly put my finger on why) to do this via Kafka, e.g. through Topics.I'm looking for some advice / guidance on an efficient way to do this. One specific technology I'm aware of (but have no experience with!) is MirrorMaker. The problem I have with this (along with pretty much any solution if I'm honest) is that it is difficult for me to easily reason about or test out. So I'm hoping for some guidance before I invest a bunch of time trying to figure out how to actually test / implement something. Looking at the documentation (I can find easily!) I don't see any options for the type of filtering I'm talking about either which requires, at least, basic string matching on the actual contents of the message.Thanks very much for your time!",

Go the dbt freshness route and add an `updated_at` timestamp column to each row in the model. Then find the `MAX` of that in the last 7 days (or just be a little sloppy at get timestamp from newest partition and be OK with unnecessarily reloading a partition now and then.)2. Create a new table that is a **transaction log of the model runs**. Log a start and end timestamp in there and use that very small table to get a last run timestamp.3. Look at `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS` on the incremental model (not the source). Use the `MAX` of that to determine the last time it was run. I'm worried this could be updated in other ways and cause us to skip source data.4. Dig it out of `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS`. Though I'm not sure it would contain what I need.5. Keep loading 7 days on each run but throttle it with a freshness check so it only happens X times per X.Thanks!",

        "content": "Hi! This is Phil - Founder of [GizmoData](https://gizmodata.com). We have a new commercial database engine product called: [GizmoSQL](https://gizmodata.com/gizmosql) \\- built with Apache Arrow Flight SQL (for remote connectivity) and DuckDB (or optionally: SQLite) as a back-end execution engine.This product allows you to run DuckDB or SQLite as a server (remotely) - harnessing the power of computers in the cloud - which typically have more CPUs, more memory, and faster storage (NVMe) than your laptop. In fact, running GizmoSQL on a modern arm64-based VM in Azure, GCP, or AWS allows you to run at terabyte scale - with equivalent (or better) performance - for a fraction of the cost of other popular platforms such as Snowflake, BigQuery, or Databricks SQL.**GizmoSQL** is self-hosted (for now) - with a possible SaaS offering in the near future. It has these features to differentiate it from \"base\" DuckDB:* Run DuckDB or SQLite as a server (remote connectivity)* Concurrency - allows multiple users to work simultaneously - with independent, ACID-compliant sessions* Security * Authentication * TLS for encryption of traffic to/from the database* Static executable with Arrow Flight SQL, DuckDB, SQLite, and JWT-CPP built-in. There are no dependencies to install - just a single executable file to run* Free for use in development, evaluation, and testing* Easily containerized for running in the Cloud - especially in Kubernetes* Easy to talk to - with ADBC, JDBC, and ODBC drivers, and now a Websocket proxy server (created by GizmoData) - so it is easy to use with javascript frameworks * Use it with Tableau, PowerBI, Apache Superset dashboards, and more* Easy to work with in Python - use ADBC, or the new experimental Ibis back-end - details here: [https://github.com/gizmodata/ibis-gizmosql](https://github.com/gizmodata/ibis-gizmosql)Because it is powered by DuckDB - GizmoSQL can work with the popular open-source data formats - such as Iceberg, Delta Lake, Parquet, and more.GizmoSQL performs very well (when running DuckDB as its back-end execution engine) - check out our graph comparing popular SQL engines for TPC-H at scale-factor 1 Terabyte - on the homepage at: [https://gizmodata.com/gizmosql](https://gizmodata.com/gizmosql) \\- there you will find it also costs far less than other options.We would love to get your feedback on the software - it is easy to get started:* Download and self-host GizmoSQL - using our Docker image or executables for Linux and macOS for both x86-64 and arm64 architectures. See our README at: [https://github.com/gizmodata/gizmosql-public](https://github.com/gizmodata/gizmosql-public) for details on how to easily and quickly get started that wayThank you for taking a look at GizmoSQL.

However, it's obviously an awful solution.What should I do to migrate the database to the cloud, inside of the GCP ecosystem? Are there any costs I need to be aware of in terms of storage, reads, and writes? Do they offer both SQL and NoSQL solutions?Any further advice would be greatly appreciated!",

However, I am looking to understand if a lakehouse like Databricks is the right solution for a product that primarily serves as a BI interface with a strict but flexible data security model. The ideal solution is one that:- Is intuitive to use for users who are not technical (assuming technical users can prepopulate dashboards)- Can easily, securely share data across workspaces (for example, consider Customer A and Customer B require isolation but want to share data at some point) - Can scale to accommodate storing and reporting on billions or trillions of relatively small events from something like RabbitMQ (maybe 10 string properties) over an 18 month period. I realize this is very dependent on size of the data, data transformation, and writing well optimized queries- Has flexible reporting and visualization capabilities- Is affordable for a smaller company to operateI've evaluated some popular solutions like Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, and other smaller tools like Metabase. Based on my research, it seems like Databricks is the perfect solution for these use cases, though it could be cost prohibitive. I just wanted to get a gut feel if I'm on the right track from people with much more experience than myself. Anything else I should consider?",

My job is actually kind of weird, it has two sides to it. On one hand, I have a few industrial engineering projects: implementing new equipment to automate/optimize processes. On the other hand: our team manages the Data pipelines, data models and power bis, including power apps, power automates and sap scripts. There are two of us in the team.We use SQL with data from our softwares. We also use azure data explorer (sensors streaming equipment related data (temp, ph, flow rates, etc) Our tables are bloated. We have more than 60 PBIs. Our queries are confusing. Our data models have 50+ connections and 100+ DAX measures. Power queries have 15+ confusing steps. We don’t use data flows, instead each pbi queries the sql tables, and sometimes there’s difference in the queries. We also calculate kpis in different pbis, but because of these slight differences, we get inconsistent data. Also, for some apps we can’t have access to the DB, so we have people manually downloading files and posting them to share point.I have a backlog of 96+ tasks and every one is taking me days, if not weeks. I’m really the only one that knows his way around a PBI, and I consider myself a beginner (like I said, less than a year of experience). I feel like I’m way over my head, just checking if a KPI is ok is taking me hours, and I keep having to interrupt my focus to log more and more tickets.I feel like writing it like this makes this whole situation sound like a shit job. I don’t think it is, maybe a bit, but we’ll, people here are engineers, but they know manufacturing. They don’t know anything about data. They just want to see the amount of boxes made, the % of time lost grouped by reason and etc… I am learning a lot, and I kinda want to master this whole mess, and I kinda like working with data. It makes me think.But I need a better way of work. I want to hear your thoughts, I don’t know anyone that has real experience in Data, especially in manufacturing. Any tips? How can I improve or learn? Manage my tickets? Time expectations? Any ideas on how to better understand my tables, my queries, find data inconsistencies? Make sure I don’t miss anything in my measure? I can probably get them to pay for my learning. Is there a course that I can take to learn more?Also, they are open to hiring an external team to help us with this whole ordeal. Is that a good idea? I feel like it would be super helpful, unless we lost track of some of our infrastructure (although we actually don’t have it well documented either).Anyways, thanks for reading and just tell me anything, everything is helpful",

At first, things worked fine—but as datasets grew, dashboard performance dropped significantly.The biggest bottlenecks were:• Overuse of blended data sources• Direct querying of large GA4 datasets• Too many calculated fields applied in the visualization layerTo fix this, we adjusted our approach on the data engineering side:• Moved most calculations (e.g., conversion rates, ROAS) to the query layer in BigQuery• Created materialized views for campaign-level summaries• Used scheduled queries to pre-aggregate weekly and monthly data• Limited Looker Studio to one direct connector per dashboard and cached data where possibleResult: dashboards now load in \\~3 seconds instead of 15–20, and we can scale them across accounts with minimal changes.Just sharing this in case others are using BI tools on top of large datasets—interested to hear how others here are managing dashboard performance from a data pipeline perspective.",

We have a bespoke customer ordering system with data stored in a MS SQL Server db. We have Customer Contacts (CC) who make orders. Many CCs to one Customer. We would like to track ordering on a CC level, however there is a lot of duplication of CCs in the system, making reporting difficult.There are often many Customer Contact rows for the one person, and we also sometimes have multiple Customer accounts for the one Customer. We are unable to make changes to the system, so this has to remain as-is.Can you suggest the best way this could be handled for the purposes of reporting? For example, building a new Client Contact table that holds a unique Client Contact, and a table linking the new Client Contacts table with the original? Therefore you'd have 1 unique CC which points to many duplicate CCs.The fields the CCs have are name, email, phone and address.Looking for some advice on tools/processes for doing this. Something involving fuzzy matching? It would need to be a task that runs daily to update things. I have experience with SQL and Python.Thanks in advance.",

You can analyze data with natural language, explore schemas, and execute complex SQL queries through AI assistants.# Key Features* :check_mark_button: Connect AI assistants to your Trino clusters* :check_mark_button: Explore catalogs, schemas, and tables conversationally* :check_mark_button: Execute SQL queries through natural language* :check_mark_button: Compatible with Cursor, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, ChatWise, and other MCP clients* :check_mark_button: Supports both STDIO and HTTP transports* :check_mark_button: Docker ready for easy deployment# Example Conversation**You**: \"What customer segments have the highest account balances in database?\"**AI**: *The AI uses MCP tools to:*1. Discover the `tpch` catalog2. Find the `tiny` schema and `customer` table3. Examine the table schema to find the `mktsegment` and `acctbal` columns4. Execute the query: `SELECT mktsegment, AVG(acctbal) as avg_balance FROM tpch.tiny.customer GROUP BY mktsegment ORDER BY avg_balance DESC`5. Return the formatted results# Getting Started1. Download the pre-built binary for your platform from [releases page](https://github.com/tuannvm/mcp-trino/releases)2. Configure it to connect to your Trino server3. Add it to your AI client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)4. Start querying your data through natural language!# Why I Built ThisAs both a Trino user and an AI enthusiast, I wanted to break down the barrier between natural language and data queries. This lets business users leverage Trino's power through AI interfaces without needing to write SQL from scratch.# Looking for ContributorsThis is just the start! I'd love to hear your feedback and welcome contributions. Check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tuannvm/mcp-trino) for more details, examples, and documentation.What data questions would you ask your AI assistant if it could query your Trino clusters?",

He hasn't read anything out of his books in months. He has ChatGPT open at every minute. He doesn't even read questions on assignments - he copies the entire question, pastes it into ChatGPT, plays his phone game while he waits for an answer, then repeats. When he first started using it, I gave him a little grief, encouraged him to not rely on it (looking back, that was nothing compared to now). He didn't take well to my advice and was adamant on ChatGPT being a good tool and encouraged by his professors. However that was when he was actually using it to help him. Now it does every bit of the work for him. I've stopped saying anything because it's his choice. He says he's too behind and will read up later (he never does). He puts off studying all week then crams with ChatGPT all on Sunday (online classes). I can't comprehend paying to study and cheating my way through.

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey everyone, So I’m in my 2nd year of college and recently landed a backend engineering internship. It sounded super exciting at first—cool tech stack like WebRTC, Mediasoup, AWS, Docker, NGINX, etc. The internship is 4 months long, and we were told the first month would be for training. I was really looking forward to learning all this industry-level stuff.Well… that didn’t really happen the way I thought it would.They gave us an AWS “training” on literally day two, but it was just a surface-level overview—stuff like “this is EC2, this is S3,” and then moved on. Then like 4 days in, they dropped us into the actual codebase of their project (which is like a Zoom/Google Meet alternative), gave us access to a bunch of repos, and basically said, “Figure it out.”I was still pumped at this point. I dove into the code, started learning the tools they’re using, and I even told them I’m still learning AWS but I’m 100% willing to put in the effort if someone can guide me a bit. I wasn’t expecting hand-holding, just *some* support.Then came this task: me and another intern were asked to deploy one of their websites on an AWS EC2 instance. Sounds simple, right? Yeah, it wasn’t. It involved changing environment variables, working with existing instances, setting up Docker containers, and doing a sort of “redeployment” on a live setup. And we weren’t even trained for any of this.It’s been three days now, and we’ve been stuck. Trying to figure things out through tutorials, trial and error, asking questions. But the people assigning the task just keep saying “This is a simple task, you should be able to do this.” No real help, no troubleshooting, just passive-aggressive comments about how we’re not capable if we can’t get it done.They say they want us to “learn by doing,” but at this point it doesn’t feel like learning—it feels like being set up to fail. Oh, and they also want us to document the entire experience, like a reflection on what we learned… but how am I supposed to reflect when I’m stuck the entire time and no one’s guiding us?What’s really messing with me is that this wasn’t even part of the actual project work. This was just some side task they threw at us. Meanwhile, my college work is piling up, my sleep schedule’s shot, and honestly, it’s getting hard to stay motivated when it feels like I’m not being given a fair chance to succeed.I’m not afraid of hard work. I *want* to learn. But this whole “sink or swim” approach with no support is just burning me out. And it makes me feel like if I fail at this one task, they’ll label me as someone who doesn’t know AWS—which isn’t even fair because I’m *literally* just starting out.So yeah, I don’t know. Maybe I’m overthinking it. Maybe this is just how things are. But it’s starting to feel more like they care about the results than actually mentoring or helping us grow.Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Is this normal? Or are they actually just mishandling the whole internship thing?",

        "content": "Hey everyone. This is more of a story than a question (though I could really use some advice at the end).I graduated in Civil Engineering because, honestly, I could never find something I truly enjoyed doing—or maybe I just lacked the discipline and drive (lazy, you might say). I got my degree in 2020, worked a bit during the pandemic, but was constantly unhappy.In September 2021, I joined a gym, changed my diet, shifted my mindset, and started studying programming during my lunch breaks at work (and sometimes even during work hours, not gonna lie).By April 2022, I quit my job to study full-time. In September 2022, I joined a 3-month .NET training program offered by a consulting company and got hired afterward. I worked mostly with backend—mostly .NET, some TypeScript/NestJS, and various short-term projects. I constantly felt like I wasn't good enough or like I wasn't on the right path, but I tried not to overthink it. I just kept pushing forward, learning every day.Then in January 2024, a friend invited me to join his startup. I worked both jobs (my full-time and the startup) until October 2024. The tech stack at the startup was Flutter + Python. I learned a lot of new things and used AI extensively to help me. Because of that, I sometimes feel like I didn’t *really* learn, if that makes sense?In August 2024, I was promoted in my full-time job (mid dev, earning \\~BRL 6000). But in January 2025, I felt the need for change and started applying to companies abroad. On March 12, 2025, I was hired by a Canadian company (they have an office here in Brazil), and now I'm earning more than I did with both previous jobs combined—plus way better benefits.Here’s the problem: The company is very process-heavy and bureaucratic. I’ve been here almost a month and haven’t been able to look at code for more than two straight days. I’ve done tiny tweaks here and there, but most of my time is spent trying to find something to do. And this feeling of uselessness, of not doing enough, is driving me crazy.It got so bad that I even considered changing careers again (my therapist thankfully helped me back off that ledge). But I started catastrophizing—thinking I have no future in tech, that I don’t belong, and that I’m a total fraud.So here I am, asking you: Is this feeling normal? Has anyone else gone through something like this?I think my journey has been pretty fast for a self-taught career changer. But maybe *because* I’m self-taught, and I’ve leaned so heavily on AI, I constantly question whether I really know anything—and whether I belong here at all.Thanks for reading this far, if you did. Any advice or words of encouragement would mean the world.",

I didn't want to have to get to this point of writing this post, but I feel like I need some advice from someone who has been through this or someone who can help me.Ever since I've had contact with games/applications, I've always been more fascinated with \"how this was done\" than with \"I'm enjoying playing this\". And that's when I started studying programming around the age of 12-13. Since then I have had brief contacts with programming.I'm currently taking a computer systems management and programming course, in which I get top marks. And I'm almost 100% sure that this is what I want for my life...However, I always had a problem: Starting projects and never finishing them.I think it's because within the programming don't know how to decide which area to choose...What I've already tried: Game Dev (3D and 2D), web development, application development, and nothing...All these projects end because: Patience to create the rest that has nothing to do with programming (3D objects, 2D drawings, etc.), in the case of Web development, I hate HTML and CSS...I recently tried WPF with .NET 8.0, and guess what... The same thing happened...The solution for me would be a project/area that doesn't use anything I don't like... But what would that be? I can't think of anything!Something that is purely code would be really nice! I was thinking about learning OpenGL, DirectX, but they are kind of advanced things.I just don't want to be without programming, I don't want to stand still, I want to create something. I want to learn more and more.What would you do in my place? What projects would you do? I accept all suggestions, I'm losing hope.",

I was always praised for my behavior, bright grades, creativity, and passion. But depression hit hard two years before high school graduation.I barely scraped through (even if i ranked third in my highschool, it wasn't enough nationally). I gave up my dream of becoming a doctor, and pragmatically pivoted to computer science.Somehow I got into a prestigious university. But my mental health collapsed. I took a gap year then failed my second year, not once, not twice but *four freaking* times. I prioritized healing, not grades, andI don’t regret that, even if the lost time still stings a bit..Now I’m finally about to graduate this June, mentally stronger than ever. I am stable, way more confident, optimistic and genuinly happierBut here’s the kicker: I feel like an imposter. I’ve forgotten nearly everything I learned. I’m struggling in my internship; basic coding, algorithms, data structure... it all feels alien. I am now horrible at math and it breaks my freaking heart !I’m still dealing with the \"leftovers\" of depression: horrible memory, poor focus, and difficulty learning. I love programming, but I’m slow, scattered, and unsure where to even begin rebuilding.Looking ahead, I fear technical jobs will be a nightmare. I know *a little bit* of everything, but not enough to hold my own as a software engineer.Everyone around me believe in me, my family, friends, even my uni professors. They keep saying I'am smart and capable of great things, but I feel like a fraud.Should I relearn from scratch? Pursue a master’s with a shaky academic record? Self-study? I just don’t know what to do next. I'm desperate for direction.If you made it so far! Thank you kind stranger.*Ps : I've never been forced to study. My parents have always been incredibly supportive, never judging me for failing a class, or even for failing university. But i still feel like I've let them down! (yeah i guess i have \"Big Sister Sysndrome\")**Ps n°2 :I love computer science. I’m doing this with no pressure—no family expectations, no social obligation. Just me.*",

I am no expert by any means but feel like if I could develop front end as well, it would make my projects that much better.Most of my projects are terminal-based, but I'm keen to start making web apps, tools, and especially incremental/clicker games. I’d love to build things I can actually show people without saying, “Just run this batch file.”I’m torn between doubling down on Python (which I really enjoy), or starting to learn JavaScript/HTML/CSS so I can make proper front ends and eventually hook them up with a Python backend.What do you reckon – is it better to get deeper into Python first, or start learning JavaScript now? I’ve already grabbed some JS books from the library and started reading them to get a little bit of exposure to the language.Any feedback would be much appreciated.",

The game I have in mind that I want to eventually make is a 3D free roam game. Simple design for the environment and characters, so not something very detailed and memory consuming. Is C++ better for this because of the 3D choice, or is Python better because it generally is better for indie games? What do you suggest?",

He’s excited to share it with you all!The Gamey Game v2: [https://www.armaansahni.com/game-v2](https://www.armaansahni.com/game-v2)He’s also written a blog post about how he made this game: [https://www.armaansahni.com/how-i-took-the-gamey-game-to-the-next-level/](https://www.armaansahni.com/how-i-took-the-gamey-game-to-the-next-level/)He originally released v1 of the game a few months ago and got great feedback from this community. A big thank you for the feedback, it led to some great conversations and provided a ton of motivation for him to keep moving forward.v2 was built using HTML, JS, CSS. All written by hand in VSCode. No frameworks, no build steps. He made all the graphics himself and also recorded all the audio.Note that both parents are programmers so he has lots of hints and guidance along the way. He also leverages Google Gemini to answer coding questions (syntax, how to do something, etc), but the LLM isn’t coding for him and it isn’t available to him directly in his editor.For the blog post, we talked about the target audience and came up with an outline.  He then dictated his blog post directly into Google Docs.  Finally, we went through a few rounds of feedback/edits (for more clarity, more words, etc).Other links:v1 Game Link: [https://www.armaansahni.com/game](https://www.armaansahni.com/game-v2)v1 Blog Post: [https://www.armaansahni.com/how-i-coded-a-game-using-ai/](https://www.armaansahni.com/how-i-coded-a-game-using-ai/)v1 Discussion Thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1elfo3q/my\\_son\\_9\\_years\\_old\\_coded\\_a\\_game\\_in\\_plain/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1elfo3q/my_son_9_years_old_coded_a_game_in_plain/)",

I have never done any project like that in terms of the complexity and difficulty.

This got me thinking what would be more difficult than an OS? Is this the hardest it would get? I am just a cyber security student, what do I know of these things.So instead of just asking what could be harder I thought I would make it fun. What do you consider the Four Horsemen of Programming Projects? It can be general or tailored to yourself and what you have experienced in the past. You can add on to mine or make your own one of course. I only have two since I don't at all have much experience here lol.I'll start:\\- OS from scratch(boot loader and kernel etc.)\\- Compiler\\- ???\\- ???",

Now I have the flexibility to use both—and I want to make that switch as smooth as possible.I initially thought about just swapping peripherals between the two, but realistically, I know I won’t keep up with that. I already use Git regularly, so version control is covered. The issue is more with environment-specific stuff—secrets, config/property files, local services, etc.—that I can’t or don’t want to push to GitHub.So for those of you juggling multiple dev environments:* How do you keep things in sync across machines?* Are you using dotfile managers, containerization, rsync, synced volumes, or something else?* How do you deal with sensitive files or machine-specific configs?Would love to hear how others approach this.",

For context, I am not academically gifted, during school I was very naive, prioritising hanging out with friends instead of attending classes etc, and for many other reasons; I didn’t do very well in school and I absolutely suck at maths. I have been a self taught 3D artist for the past three years, and within the last year I found what I wanted a career in, which was VFX (Compositor to be specific), so I’ve been learning a ton from my mentor and online resources. At the moment I work full time as a chef at a local restaurant whilst studying Compositing and recently Python on my free time.I had chosen to learn Python alongside Compositing to hopefully leverage my career in VFX, and Python so far had been quite a lot of fun. Although I’ve found that through learning to code, there are quite a bit of maths. For example, recently I’ve coded a tip calculator (a challenge from the 100 days of code by Angela Yu)On this particular challenge- I didn’t struggle with the coding aspects, but instead with understanding the math formulas to calculate tip and percentage. Which I took it upon myself to learn through the internet. My main question would be, since I am very bad at maths, would it be best for me to re-learn maths on the side also? Or learn the math formulas as I encounter them through the journey of learning to code? Edit: I want to specify that in the end goal, I’d like to write automation systems and tools for the software I use (Nuke by The Foundry), or perhaps dabble into coding shaders within game engines (unity or unreal engine) But ultimately be able to make tools and automations of repetitive actionsEdit2: I really appreciate the inputs!

I want to be good at programming. I really do. But I often quit after just a few tutorials because I don’t understand the material well enough. I also know that I should stop just watching tutorials and actually start *building* things on my own—but I never really get to that part.Lately, I’ve been thinking: maybe I should try building something I actually find fun—like a Minecraft mod in Java. Maybe that would keep me engaged and motivated. I enjoy Minecraft, and I think making something small but real could help me break the cycle.I genuinely want to learn how to code and become proficient, but I’m noticing a pattern: I get demotivated easily, I procrastinate, and I don’t build the discipline to push through. It’s a bit of a contradiction—I *want* to be good, but I don’t manage to get myself to actually *do* the hard parts.I would really appreciate advice or guidance. Here are my specific questions:* How would you approach learning to program properly when tutorials alone don’t work anymore?* How do you build discipline when you often lose motivation or feel stuck early on?* Would you still recommend finishing the last 2 years of a CS bachelor if programming doesn't come naturally to you?* Are there any beginner-friendly project ideas that helped *you* break the tutorial cycle?* Do you think making a Minecraft mod (or something similar I personally enjoy) is a good way to get into coding?* How do you push through when you're in that “I want to learn, but I suck at it” phase?Any personal stories, tough love, or practical tips would really help me out.Thanks in advance!",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Tldr; what is the cost of using unions (C/C++). I am reading through and taking some advice from Game Engine Architecture, 3rd edition. For context, the book talks mostly about making game engines from scratch to support different platforms. The author recommends defining your own basic types so that if/when you try to target a different platform you don't have issues. Cool, not sure why int8_t and alike isn't nessissarly good enough and he even brings those up.. but thats not what's troubling me that all makes sense. Again, for portability, the author brings up endianess and suggests, due to asset making being tedious, to create a methodology for converting things to and from big and little endian. And suggest using a union to convert floats into an int of correct size and flipping the bytes because bytes are bytes. 100% agree. But then a thought came into my head. Im defining my types. Why not define all floats as unions for that conversion from the get go? And I hate that idea. There is no way, that is a good idea. But, now I need to *know* its a bad idea. Like that has got to come at some cost, right? If not, why stop there? Why not make it so all data types are in unions with structures that allow there bytes to be addressed individually? Muhahaha *lightning strike accompanied with thunder*. I have been sesrching for a while now and I have yet to find something that thwarts my evil plan. So besides that being maybe tedious and violating probably a lot of good design principles.. whats a real, tangible reason to *not* do that?",

But sometimes I just don’t understand what exactly he’s trying to teach us.Like, one of his first rules was: never use modulus or division. At first, it kind of made sense. For simple programs like printing even numbers, instead of using %, he made us use basic arithmetic to understand what’s happening under the hood. That part was kinda cool, and I respected it. it forced me to think deeper.But now its getting out of hand. He wants us to write more complex programs without using modulus and division, and its becoming super confusing. I can maybe get around % if I really push, but doing everything without /? My brain starts to melt.Sometimes I wonder if this is actually the \"right\" way to learn C at a deeper level, and I’m just behind the rest of the class. Or maybe it's just an overcomplicated approach for no reason. I don’t know. I just wanted to get this off my chest, because I have no idea who else to talk to about it.",

        "content": "Do we really need to dedicate so much time to learning HTML, CSS, and JS for UI design ? After all, when we move onto React, in most cases, we're not building components from the ground up. With powerful UI libraries like Material UI and ShadCN, it feels like they’ve already done most of the heavy lifting for us. So, is it still crucial to master these basics, or can we skip ahead to more React-focused development?\"I'm not suggesting we skip these fundamentals entirely. What I'm saying is, it's important to understand the syntax and how it works, but we don't need to spend excessive time mastering it since ready-made UI components are already available right? So, is it still worth diving deep into these basics, or can we focus on the React side of things with its libraries? Edit: A lot of people are assuming I’m saying not to master HTML, CSS, and JS. That’s not the case. What I’m specifically referring to is the time spent on component styling and animations, since libraries like Material UI and ShadCN handle much of that for us. I’m not suggesting you skip learning the core concepts or how to program. My point is more about the focus understanding the fundamentals is important, but we might not need to spend excessive time on every detail.",

I got the job because I was already at the company, taught myself the basics of web development, and then expressed interest. The company was a startup. My leadership at the time pushed for me to get on the engineering team, and it eventually happened. No tech interview. No degree.I've been able to handle most tickets assigned to me without issue. With research, LLMs, and some Udemy courses after work, I've managed to get by. But I feel like I'm severely lacking. Since I didn't go to school, and my self-taught journey didn't really touch on the fundamentals of computer science, I feel like I'm grossly underprepared and destined to fail. I feel like I know syntax well for the languages I use, and I understand at a basic level the technologies we use, such as docker, but I don't feel like I'm a good programmer. For example, I don't know data-structures and algorithms at all. I've heard of Big O in passing and that's about it. I haven't really ever had to employ any design patterns, so I haven't learnt about them for the most part. I never had to grind leet code or anything like that. I put together a few simple React applications before this job and that's it. Granted, I've learnt things on the job, such as separating the UI layer from the business logic and data layer, but I just don't know what direction I should go to get better. Should I start learning the basic, fundamental stuff I kind of skipped? Should I start grinding leet code even though I already have a job? I'm planning on getting into a school next year and getting a degree, but what should I be doing in the meantime? Any and all advice would be super appreciated. Thank you!",

I have this weird thing where I say, okay - for my job (as a PM now, but i used to code years ago) it would be valuable to know python well and lets say some DS libraries. Problem is, as soon as I start, I get bogged down in saying.. well how does an interpreter work? How does python deal with executables and interacting with the OS? How exactly does an OS work? Assembly? Should I spend some tike writing assembly and building up from there?I think its a weird of kind of OCD / obsession where, over my life I have idolised people you see out there who are just brilliant. They worked on building operating systems, writing drivers, crazy graphics interfaces, rewriting literal compilers and toolkits themselves. Whenever I start to get productive with high level tools, I feel like a “cop out” because im basically only as smart as a monkey. I can write code in high level languages, but im inferior to those who wrote the very tools to enable to me code. This drives me to spend hours and hours researching the lower level (and dont get me wrong, i do enjoy it) - but at the end of the day it wont help me in my life or career.How does you guys get to a point where you are totally okay blocking out the significant amount of work for these tools below? I cant help but feel everything I pick up, to be “smart” you need to know the “why”. This means even using python libraries i start opening them up trying to figure out how they are made. Any advice or another way to think about it? I just remind myself that all these others arent smarter.. they just worked as part of big full time teams who built this stuff over years and years. Its so abstracted and its the product of slow updates, not geniuses walking up to a pc and building things overnight!",

My plan is to make an open-source library for converting those lossless or lossy to PCM data, then convert to AudioClip of Unity.I coded WAV file converter, and it works! But when I tried to do with MP3 file, I struggled.Problems : 1. MP3 file have frame sync It usually have 12 set bits (FFF) (Or FFE for MPEG 2.5, I want to support it too) But it could be a false sync, so we have a protected bit. Come to problem #2. 2. Protected bit It is the 16th bit of the header, 0 = protected, 1 = not protected if the bit is 1 and it's not a real header OR false header, how to detect it? if the bit is 0, come to problem #3. 3. CRC-16 I don't know how to calculate it, even if I read docs or found GitHub's code. I just don't know what to process and how to process it. 4. Side..... Information??? I read the docs and am very confused, what are scfsi, gr.1, gr.2??? Why expressed as 4 + 4??? 5. The decoding section Yeah, too much Math and variables I don't know. Can say that, all of them that I don't know.Note: This is a project for my self-learning, tho sometimes I need some help, like posting here. If you're saying that, \"just use library\". No, I won't use, not too much people are into this kind of stuffs.

        "content": "I want to define the best method names for building a user interface. Something like JS has `alert` (None output), `prompt` (str), `confirm` (bool). But these three are too limited.Currently, I have: `alert, ask, ask_number, choice, form, is_yes, is_no`Now, to the problems:`alert` – Just to display a text. Might be `msgbox` etc.`ask` – Get an arbitrary str output.`ask_number` – The same but with the number validation.`choice` The first big problem. Choice is a substantive, whereas the other are verbs. Would it be better to call it `select` as in HTML?If so, I to give a name for ① the value and for ② an alias used in situations when this value must be picked of given options.Like, for paths the value name is `PathTag`, for colors, `ColorTag`, for `datetime`, `DatetimeTag`. Now, I have the method `choice`, alias `Choices` and value name is `EnumTag`.`form` Like a HTML form, accepts and returns arbitrary values. I think it is no problem that this is a substantial, as the other methods outputs a single return value, whereas this returns whole form.`is_yes` Buttons Yes/No, it user clicks Yes, it returns True.`is_no` That's the problem. I need a name for method that raises the same dialog as in `is_yes`, the buttons Yes/No, returning True for the Yes button, but with the exception, the initial focus is on the No button. Useful for dialogs like: \"Do you really want to delete the files?\" But the name `is_no` implies, it returns True for the No button which is not my intention. I came up with following substitutes, which one do you prefer?* `not_no` – short but might be counterintuitive it does not starts with the verb as the others* `isnt_no` – Is this convenient?* `is_not_no` – double negation, it seems confusing to me* `is_yes_from_no` – I like that it starts too with `is_yes`. Is this comprehensible?* `is_yes_to_no` – The same, is this comprehensible?* `is_si` – amazing, short, clever, my preferred option – but as an English speaker, would you understand the `si`? Here is the method overview: [https://cz-nic.github.io/mininterface/Mininterface/](https://cz-nic.github.io/mininterface/Mininterface/)Do you think I am missing an important method to a common UI situation?",

Here are a few ideas I'm tossing around, and I’d love to hear what you'd find most valuable (or if there's something else you'd want instead):1. **Resume Feedback** – Get personalized feedback on resumes tailored for SQL/analytics roles.2. **Resume Templates** – Templates specifically designed for data analyst / BI / SQL-heavy positions.3. **Live Query Help** – A chat assistant that can give hints or feedback on your practice queries in real-time.4. **Learning Paths** – Structured courses based on concepts like: working with dates, cleaning data, handling JSON, etc.5. **Business-Style Questions** – Practice problems written like real-world business requests, so you can flex those problem-solving and stakeholder-translation muscles.If you’ve ever used a SQL practice site or are learning/improving your SQL right now — what would *you* want to see?Thanks in advance for any thoughts or feedback :folded_hands:",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I used to think landing a job at a big tech company would be the peak of my career. Everyone made it sound like once you got in, your life was set. Prestige, money, smart people, meaningful work. I bought into the whole thing. I worked my ass off to get there. Leetcode, system design prep, referrals, rejection after rejection. And when I finally got the offer, I remember feeling like I had won the lottery.That feeling didn’t last long.What I stepped into was one of the most toxic, mentally draining environments I’ve ever experienced. It didn’t happen all at once. It crept in. The first few weeks were exciting, but then the cracks started to show. The pressure was insane. The deadlines were borderline delusional. There was this unspoken expectation to be available at all times. Messages late at night. Work bleeding into weekends. No one ever said it out loud, but if you wanted to be seen as serious, as someone who \"got it,\" you had to sacrifice everything else.The culture was a constant performance. I couldn’t just do my job. I had to sell it. Everything I worked on needed a narrative. Every project had to be spun into something that could fit neatly into a promotion packet or a perf review. I wasn’t building software. I was building a case to not be forgotten. Because every quarter, someone got labeled as underperforming. It didn’t always make sense who it was. Sometimes it was the quietest person on the team. Sometimes it was someone who just had the wrong skip manager. Everyone smiled in meetings but no one felt safe.The politics were unbearable. Influence mattered more than clarity. Visibility mattered more than functionality. Everything had to be socialized in just the right way to just the right people. One wrong Slack message or a poorly timed piece of feedback could nuke months of work. And if you didn’t know how to play the game, it didn’t matter how smart or hardworking you were. You were dead in the water.Work-life balance was a joke. I was constantly anxious, constantly behind, constantly checking messages like something was going to blow up if I missed a ping. I stopped sleeping properly. I stopped seeing friends. I stopped caring about things I used to love. My weekends were spent recovering from the week and bracing for the next one. And the whole time I kept telling myself it was temporary. That it would get better. That if I just made it to the next level, it would all be worth it.But it never got better. The pressure just got worse. The bar kept moving. The layoffs started. The reorganizations. The endless leadership changes. Half my team vanished in one cycle. I remember joining a Zoom call one morning and realizing I didn’t even know who my manager reported to anymore. People were disappearing mid-project. Morale was a punchline. Everyone was scared but pretending they weren’t. Everyone was tired but still smiling in team standups. I started to feel like I was losing my grip.When I finally left, I didn’t feel free. I felt broken. It took months before I stopped checking my calendar every morning out of reflex. I still have dreams about unfinished sprints and last-minute roadmap changes. I still flinch when I see a Slack notification.People glamorize these jobs because of the compensation and the brand names. But no one talks about the cost. I gave that place everything and it chewed through me like I was nothing. Just another seat to fill. Just another cog in the machine. I left with more money, sure. But I also left with burnout, insomnia, and a genuine hatred for the industry I used to be passionate about.I don’t know if I’ll go back to big tech. Right now I’m just trying to feel like a human again.",

For my final technical round, I was asked an OOP question, and I finished the implementation within 40-45 minutes. The process was a treadmill style problem, so once I got done with the implementation, I was asked a few follow up questions and was asked to implement the functionalities.I felt that I communicated my thought process well and asked plenty of clarifying questions. I was very confident I got the internship. I received rejection today and I have no idea what I could’ve done better besides code faster. Even at the rate I was working through my solution, I think I was going decently quickly. I guess there must’ve been amazing candidates, or they had already made their selection. There could be a multitude of reasons.You guys are just way too cracked. I’m probably never gonna break into big tech, FAANG, etc. because the level at which you need to be is absolutely insane. I worked hard and studied so many LC and OOP style questions, and I was so prepared.But, as one door closes, another door opens. Luckily I got a decent offer at a SaaS mid sized company for this summer. It took a fraction of the amount of prep work, and it has decent tech stack. I am totally okay with that, and any offer in this tough market is always a blessing. I’m done contributing to the intensive grind culture. It drives you insane to push yourself so hard to just get overlooked by others. It’s a competition, but I can’t hate the players. I can just choose not to play.I am still a bit bummed out that I didn’t get the job offer, but how do you handle rejections like these?",

I went through 2 round of interviews with 2 interviewers, and I got the news that they offered me the role essentially 2 hours after completing the final round.The role wanted someone ASAP, and I knew I had to resign as soon as I could. I asked them multiple times if I was safe to send in my resignation letter to my current job, and 2 agents reassured that there was no issue once I received my onboarding process(which I did).So I resigned, and the next day, they told me the client doesn’t want to continue anymore. I can’t know why since it apparently has to do with some “compliance” issues between the agency and Loblaws Digital. So now, I’m left jobless and they’re saying the process is just left on hold with no definite resolution or answer. I feel Miserable. How can something like this happen?? I’ve never heard of anything like this happening before, going through the whole process and getting the worst outcome in the end. I’m so ashamed to try and return to my job after telling everyone I got a new job and sending my letter in.What am I suppose to do?**EDIT:**Name and shame purposes: Hays agency + Loblaws DigitalA lot has happened since I posted this. I reached back out to my old job, and they actually offered me a raise as an incentive to stay longer. I'll be starting again next week. I no longer care about the agency or loblaws as they said they \"may\" continue. Quite frankly they've lost my trust and it's their loss as I believe I'm a talented frontend engineer.To those saying it's \"common sense\" not to resign early, clearly it's not so obvious. Others have shared similar stories and were able to avoid the same mistake after reading this post, so I'm glad it helped some people.Even though the situation sucked, I feel more confident as a developer. I was capable of passing their interview and very likely handling the role itself. That's good enough for me as a self taught developer with barely 2 years of experience.",

I will never take a job for granted ever again. My heart goes out to everyone hopelessly searching for a job. There is a light at the end of the tunnel!",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I hope this post can help others. I am thrilled and relieved. I have had many periods of hopelessness throughout this process and I hope that sharing my experience can renew some hope for some folks who are in a similar position as I was.Recently, I received multiple remote offers. I went with one paying a 145-160k salary with a Fortune 500 company. I am keeping this post a little vague to hide any identifying details.I was not targeting super elite companies or positions, and nothing FAANG, so this may not be as relevant if you are. I am in the US.Sorry for my nearly stream-of-consciousness bullet points!* I have \\~5 years of experience in a full stack capacity with a popular tech stack, all at the same small and unknown company* No portfolio, side projects, or certs* I was laid off >6 months and <1 year ago.* I started job hunting (besides some half-hearted applications to keep unemployment) 2-3 months ago. Before that, I was going through a very difficult time mentally and had done *nothing* to brush up on my technical skills.* I was \"open to work\" on LinkedIn during this time (without the banner), but scarcely got any recruiter messages (perhaps 1 every 2 months).* For about the first month of job hunting, I sent out cold applications on Indeed, LinkedIn, and company websites. I did get two interviews for hybrid roles in my area, but nothing for remote roles.* I do have a well-formed resume and perform excellently with any kind of behavioral question. * My favorite resource for behavioral interviewing has been Austen McDonald's substack. [This](https://thebehavioral.substack.com/p/using-the-carl-method-to-structure) post was the most helpful for me, but I would recommend checking out the other posts as well!* I do think I do excellent work in a real job setting, but I am pretty bad at leetcode and system design, and get horribly nervous when live-coding in an interview setting!* After the first month of job hunting, I said, \"Fuck it\" and put the obnoxious green #OPENTOWORK banner on my LinkedIn profile photo. I had always heard it makes people look \"desperate\", so I had never tried it. Y'all, **my inbox exploded** the *day* after I did this, and recruiters even mentioned that they were reaching out to me *because* they had noticed it. I'm talking 1 recruiter message per month at best, to 10 the next day, and \\~10-15 per week after that. I did get sent a handful of irrelevant positions, but nothing I couldn't sift through. * I cannot emphasize how much this is worth trying. Maybe it deters some recruiters, but it attracts a lot of worthwhile ones too, at least for the non-elite positions I was targeting.* I updated my LinkedIn headline and bio to have a bunch of keywords. I edited my bio once a week, even just to reword it a little bit. I suspected that this helped keep me higher in recruiter searched results. Not sure if that was true or not, but it didn't hurt.* I had some bites from continuing to cold-apply, and some of them were remote positions too - but these interviews were much harder and the recruiters for these were much flakier and less enthused overall.* I got a ton of traction from the recruiters in my inbox. The offers I later received all stemmed from recruiters in my inbox. There are definitely a lot of companies that rely entirely on recruiters and don't even bother with making job listings.* In the interviews for the companies that then gave me an offer - there was no leetcode and no typical system design. Besides behavioral questions, some of the technical portions involved questions about domain knowledge, OOP, design patterns, \"how would you approach this problem\" kind of questions, and some code reviews. I answered them well, but definitely not perfectly, and had some misses as well. Despite that - I was told by all of my interviewers that they loved me as a candidate!* Most interviewers did not give a single shit about my time off. Some did ask, but totally understood when I said it was a layoff. If they then asked me about the gap, I explained it as being due to grief, and also taking some time to do a non-tech (but cool and unique) project to support a family member. I emphasized that I only began to job hunt seriously in the past 2-3 months. * For those who have been hunting for longer - maybe it's worth considering making the beginning of that gap sound intentional rather than like you've been getting rejected for a long time? YMMV* Having multiple final interviews resulting in multiple offers on the same day felt very serendipitous (and gave me great leverage for negotiating), but the end-of-the-quarter timing probably factored in.Thanks for reading, and good luck!---Edit: copying-and-pasting a comment I left about behavioral/general interviewing tips for more visibility:*Definitely would recommend the substack I mentioned above (*[*here's the top posts*](https://thebehavioral.substack.com/archive?sort=top)*) - honestly such a great and free resource. I have found all of his posts helpful!**Before interviews I do a little meditation with* [*4-7-8 breathing*](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324417) *and it helps calm my nerves. This was a tip from my therapist. Sometimes I will take 100 mg of*[ *l-theanine* ](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1053/theanine)*with my morning coffee too, I find it helps with anxiety without dulling my alertness.**Having the attitude of a good coworker goes a long way - arguably it's even more important than being technically competent. Imagine the kind of person that you would want to work with. Show that you are humble, willing to admit when you don't know something, curious, not afraid to ask questions, proactive, easygoing, focused on the big picture/business impact, and have a growth mindset.**Find a list of common questions, take some notes on how you would plan on answering them, and actually practice answering them out loud to yourself, or even better, to a friend. Practice until it's like muscle memory. There are some software interviewing discords (try the search bar), where I bet you could find some people to practice mock interviews with if you don't have anyone in your personal life. Have a few stories prepared that could apply to multiple questions with a little tweaking.**When answering questions, I try to find little opportunities to show off my knowledge and experience even if doing so isn't the most straightforward way of answering the question - e.g. I will connect the question to a project I did or a problem I have solved before, will mention a relevant case study to show that I keep up with industry trends, will mention a quirk of the domain that shows high-level understanding, etc. Don't go on a huge tangent if it's not directly answering the question, but an offhand sentence or two is okay. I've gotten some great reactions and feedback from interviews from doing this.**I always send a thank-you email after the interview too, with some details specific to what they had shared with me about the position and the company.*---Note: This was originally posted in r/ExperiencedDevs, where the mods removed it for being \"general\" career advice that could apply to any career...lolEdit: I'm paranoid and won't share the company names or my resume, sorry. Feel free to ask some questions about them and the process, but no guarantees that I'll answer",

However, the pay isn't great. The promotion came with a decent 15% bump, but I'm still making less than $100k.I started grinding LeetCode the past few months before I knew I was getting promoted since I felt could be earnning more, now I have 3 interviews lined up in the next few weeks. Each of these positions offers a potential salary increase of over 50%.I feel a bit conflicted because while I appreciate the promotion and my team, (my manager fought for me to get the promotion even though layoffs and reorgs have been happening left and right), the potential salary difference is hard to ignore. This is also my first and only job so I want to have good references.My question is: Would it be a bad look to leave my current company a few weeks after getting promoted?",

        "content": "Hey guys. I just got a job offer as a new grad sde in a bank, it is like decent pay and benefits for my area but nothing exciting. Given the job market (especially in Canada), I can't turn it down. But I'm a little bit sad to have ended up here.I did an internship in this company before and found the atmosphere to be somewhat grim and soulless. Basically, almost everyone here has been working here for 10-25+ years. Many people are not happy with the job but aren't able to leave, so they are stuck. People are anti social because they don't like their job or coworkers and make just enough to get by. I was unhappy there too, it was a corporate environment where no one believed in the work they do and hard work is not rewarded. In contrast, I also did an internship in a big tech company, but it was so different there because people were full of hope. My coworkers eat together every day, and regularly discuss their intended promotions. Many believe their salary will at least double in 5 years. Everyone is just very sociable and happy in general. Many people were young, most have hobbies and pursue things they don't have to do just for fun. They suggest new ideas at work and sometimes work overtime to make it happen, and they have energy to give the intern a few pointers. I didn't get a return offer. Yes it hurts lol. I did my best and finished my project and stretch goal, but many of my fellow interns were absolutely cracked. I'm also not as naturally charismatic as any of them and I think I got on the bad side of my boss. I am afraid I will get stuck at my new job too, just like all my unhappy coworkers. Even over the interview I feel the same grim and bleak mood from all 5 interviewers except the manager. Clearly they don't like the job either, but for some reason they cannot get into the better companies. But I don't understand what makes the difference. I have a theory/a fear that after a certain number of years at a company it no longer adds points but instead makes you unhireable elsewhere. Is this true? Because at the big tech company they hired some people with almost no experience from no name schools, and junior devs from startups, but not any of my bank coworkers with 20 years experience.",

I also was told at the regular amount of time that we were running out of time.I get my results back and as I thought I failed. I contact Disability Accommodations and they say that there was a \"communication error on the recruiters part\" and that they will try not to do it again, but they can't do anything about it. My recruiter has also completely ghosted me.I tried asking about this in a Discord but really only got messages saying that I'd be too difficult to work with in a team, but I'm just waiting to heal so I can have surgery to hear better again.Any advice?

Finally had one posting give me a chance, went through an OA, Behavioral and Technical interviews, that I did really well in. Left the final interview in high hopes thinking my grind has finally ended. Just when I thought I was seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, I get a call from the hiring manager saying they no longer had the funding for the position they were offering. I just don't have the motivation to even apply anymore man, I just feel like I'm completely unhirable at this point. Resume in case anyone wanted to see it https://imgur.com/a/fhAUngI",

I've launched many features on our platform by myself (one of them being building our payment system using Stripe lol) but again, it's basically just build a UI to take user input, spit out some output.I have an interview with Stripe for a Full Stack role and even their entry level salary is miles better than what I'm making now. I'd be completely satisfied getting an entry level position and having to work my way up, I know I can do it.The only issue is the interview. I'd rather get an entry level interview, join the company and work my way up rather than get interviewed for mid level position and bomb it. I'm confident in my skills but I definitely use google a lot on a day to day and I'm not some leetcode god either.So how does this work? Do they bucket me into a certain level and give me that levels interview? Or do they start off the interview and depending on how I do the questions they write me down as Entry, Mid, etc? Is it bad if I straight up tell them \"I'd like to try out for the lowest level please\"?Any advice is appreciated!",

I’m not learning anything new, I don’t feel challenged, and I don’t really care about what I’m doing anymore.

        "content": "Hi folks,I’m wondering if someone with social anxiety disorder can truly thrive as a software developer. I’m currently doing an internship, but I don’t collaborate much. I mostly just ask the questions I need to in order to get my work done or improve it and I rarely contribute to others or jump into conversations.I’ve noticed that other developers seem to work together effortlessly, share ideas, insights, helping each other out, and communicating freely.Meanwhile, I’m mostly silent. I just focus on completing my tasks. During meetings, I barely speak. I mostly just listen.No one seems to mind, as long as I deliver my work. But I can’t help feeling like I’m a worse developer because of this.Should I give up on this career? Am I doomed? Or is there still a place for someone like me in this field?",

I've had amazing jobs, where I was fully engaged, worked really hard, really fought for good results, and had the company's best interests and goals in mind. I felt rewarded for that as well.Fast forward a few years to now, my job, my company, and I feel more and more disengaged with my job. I feel like my influence at work is at a low point, and so is my feeling of belonging in the team and corporation. What's worse is that I don't feel the sparkle to reboot and shine again at my current job. I've been trying hard for the past years to find solutions to problems and to lead solutions towards results, but the red-tape and the politics won. They consumed me, and I don't have this energy right now. I've started sending out a few CVs for jobs which really made me feel excited and happy from reading the job description. To those of you with longer careers, are lows like this... \"normal\"? Can one recover and come out on top? This is my first low, so I have no clue what can be on the other side. Some re-assurance that this is normal and not a sign of no future success would be awesome, if you have any! Cheers!",

But because of financial aspects, living in rural area, lack of decent job opportunities, and the cities nearby is about 20km and 30km from us, I accepted an offer that is not on my list of preferred jobs but still aligned with my degree. I thought it's better than not working and at least I have a little source of income. I stayed for 6 months then moved to a public office that is only 10minutes away which is my current job. But I am never satisfied.I don't like what I am doing currently with my job, I don't feel any improvement since there's not much to do. I mostly just assist users, teach them how to use MS office, very little troubleshooting tasks. Nothing, just doing boring, admin tasks. Add to that the annoying co-workers who only know to talk and joke about their se* life and doing nothing. Then when it's payday, I feel like a failure because I am earning minimum wage despite my degree and achievements back in college. Maybe it has to do with me being used to the academic system vs. how my life without a system and consistency works. Now, I don't have deadlines, nothing to procrastinate about, no one ordering me to get me going, no adrenaline. Just plain cycle of waking up, go to work to do basically nothing, go home, repeat until weekend. I have a hobby too, I practice piano (self-taught) and video games, but I always have this guilt in the back of my mind that instead of doing this, I should be making portfolio, getting certifications and improve my skills in tech. The challenge is I can't get myself to learn without a mentor or someone ordering me, I can't learn on my own but I don't have anyone to teach me. Youtube is not enough because I need someone to discuss my new knowledge with as well as correct what I may be doing wrong. Add to that the many options of software engineering that I don't know what to focus on. I always plan but no actions. My thoughts are now scrambled...",

The responses:>Imagine how annoyed you would be as a hiring manager if every candidate did this. It might actually hurt your chances as you will be seen as anxious and neurotic. No one wants to work with people who can’t just chill a little bit and wait.and>I can confirm that it's annoying as shit & I just ignore itIdk who the first response is by, but the second response was supposedly by an engineering manager. I know each manager is different and may not want to be messaged, but if you’re being messaged, you probably have a contact that people can find. I think it’s fine if the manager ignores such messages, but I don’t know how you can get annoyed by people messaging you if you have a job posting for your team and your contact is up somewhere online. The job market is bad, and people will try to do anything to get a jobBefore someone brings it up, referrals from employees work of course, but it seems like it’s actually effective if you personally know who you’re trying to get a referral fromSo, what’s the consensus here? Is it worth a shot to message recruiters or hiring managers? Which one should you contact if so?",

I'm currently pursuing my B.S. in Software Engineering, with a minor in Environmental Science (I just think it's fun) and I intend to get another minor in Applied Data Science, just to diversify a little bit. I'm not particularly privileged, and I wouldn't be able to afford a degree at this university, but I am an employee there so I get multiple free courses each year and I am definitely using that benefit to the maximum extent I can while I work full time and save money. Outside of work, I do have a very strong interest in electronics, engineering, computer science, etc; I find it fascinating, so as I progress through this degree, I won't have any issue building a portfolio outside of assigned projects. I have plenty of things I would love to do on my own that I just haven't acquired the knowledge for, with one of the main reasons being that I operate best when I have direction. Many of these projects (like setting up a home server with a connection to custom-made voice recognition software; basically building my own Alexa because I don't trust Amazon or Google) are things that I just don't have the toolset to even really get started with teaching myself easily. But smaller things, like refurbishing a boombox from the late 80's and adding a bluetooth remote, are things I have done because that tends to be smaller scale.All of this is just to help show, I don't see this as a \"get rich quick\" scheme, and I'm not pursuing something I hate just to get the benefits; I'm just trying to maximize my return with a field that I have a natural interest in. But, beyond my B.S. and probable M.S., I'm really not sure what my ideal path would look like. Should I start looking for big companies to work for, to build up reputation? Is it enough to continue building a portfolio with private freelance projects, and if so, how would I even start to find those sorts of projects? What general field would be the most likely to work for this goal (full-stack development, network security consulting, etc)? I know looking at all of this less than halfway through my B.S. is maybe a little ambitious, but I would rather get started on the right path sooner rather than later; I don't just want to coast through my degree with no real game plan afterwards, if that makes sense. Thank you for any advice or direction you can give, and I'll try to respond to any questions! (And, for further context, I currently live in the EU, in Germany, so advice specific for here is doubly useful)",

        "content": "Hi! I’m hoping to get some perspective on whether I’m where I should be in my career, and what I should be focusing on over the next year.I graduated in 2022 and joined Microsoft as an L59 new grad. I got placed on a random Azure team doing pretty low-level, super product-specific work. Barely did any coding—most of my time went into looking at logs and tracing through old C++ systems. I wasn’t really building transferable skills, and I didn’t get much experience with C# or .NET either. This was super frustrating but it was what was it was.Late last year I was able to switch teams after getting promoted to L60. My new team works on an internal website and it’s been a WAY better fit. I’ve been doing mostly backend stuff and finally getting to get some exposure to coding in .NET. I’ve picked up a lot—dependency injection, JWTs, RBAC, separation of concerns, etc. I do rely on the VS/VS Code Copilot when I’m stuck or just don’t know how to start, and this frankly does worry me a lot. I try to dig in and understand what I’m doing, and I’ve learned a ton from my teammates, but I do worry about my ability to perform without it. On this team I’ve been able to handle tons of entirely different projects with plenty of success and I’ve ramped up very quickly since joining, and a big part of that has been using Copilot effectively to help me understand what I need to know and to at least provide a skeleton for me to iterate on. It adds to the frustration from the previous team since essentially none of the hard skills i’m using today were things I was exposed to then so in many ways it feels like I’m starting from scratch.That said, my last stock vests in March 2026, and I’m planning to move cities and switch jobs. That’ll be 3.5 years in, and I’d like to be ready for SD2 roles by then. I might get promoted to L61 this fall, but even if I do I’m not confident I’d be able to thrive as an SD2 at a company like Meta or Google.To prep, I’m planning to:•Grind LeetCode consistently•Go through Effective Java and Designing Data-Intensive Applications•Keep learning from my current team and writing as much code as I canBut it does still worry me that I’m behind where I should be and that if I make the switch I’ll be exposed. For anyone who’s made the jump to SD2 or switched companies around the 3-4 year mark—what helped you feel actually ready?Any advice on how I can close the gap in the next year? I get that some of this may be imposter syndrome, and i’ve struggled with that in the past, but I feel like on this team I’ve seen so many concrete examples of things I should know by now but don’t.Appreciate any thoughts.",

If a person already working as a developer for several years, but doesn't have CS degree, would you consider it good or beneficial in nowadays to spend money and time and get that degree?I guess that I would like to return to university, study CS and get the degree, but also I understand that it will cost me a lot of money and time. And most certainly I won't be able to work and study simultaneously, at least at the current pace. And current job market tells me that most of the time working experience is more important than education. So I guess my advice would be \"No\".But I would be happy to hear other points of view on this matter.",

        "content": "Hey everyone, A friend recommended I post here. I recently gave notice at my job after 10 months, and I’m really second-guessing myself even though I *know* it was the right move.I worked at a small startup in a small tech ecosystem. I liked the people a *lot*, but I just never clicked with the product. It started affecting my energy, focus, and general drive—I’d show up late, avoid work, and just felt completely disconnected. That’s really not like me.Today, I gave my 30 days' notice to the CTO. She was disappointed and said I should’ve raised a flag earlier and that 10 months isn’t enough time to evaluate a job. And… maybe she’s right. That part’s really weighing on me. But who want to raise a flag? it's like saying fire me next?To be clear, I wasn’t fired. I left on good terms I found another opportunity at a company I actually care about (coincidentally the one that acquired my old company a while back). They offered me more money and a better fi so logically, things are working out.But emotionally? I feel like crap Really! Like I bailed too early. Like I failed some invisible test. Like I burned a bridge.Has anyone else gone through something like this? How did you move past the guilt and doubt? Is leaving after 10 monthss really that bad in tech anymore?Would love to hear any thoughts.",

But I am wondering, is it worth even learning flutter when the job market seems to mainly prefer React? My original mindset before this project was that Flutter was a niche job market which might make me more valuable as a candidate to employers, however, I’m slowly second guessing that decision and am wondering if after this project I should just make the switch to learning React Native or maybe even an entirely different framework for mobile app development. Any experience with both these frameworks? Any insight would be helpful.",

I’ve been working what feels like 50-60 hours a week lately because I have multiple requests and am asked for unrealistic turn around times (sometimes a day or two). There is a lot of code refactoring involved in my work because I’ve inherited tasks from people who left and have spent so much time simply figuring out how to not just get the job done but write code that’s optimized and easier to follow. The requirements I get frequently are all over the place. Have communicated the issue many times with my boss who seems aware and tries to help in some respect but who also falls under pressure from others and finds ways for me to get something done no matter the circumstances, which generally means time is spent figuring out vague requirements and writing code no matter how not well designed the solution is, opening path to technical debt. I am stuck here for now because I need time to prepare for interviews and build my skills. I’m wondering if others in software/data engineering have demanding roles like this?",
