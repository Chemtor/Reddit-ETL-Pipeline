        "author": "BoredAt",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "This is a long article, so sit down and get some popcorn :slightly_smiling_face:At this point everyone here has already read of the newest merger on the block. I think it's been (at least for me) a bit difficult to get the full story of why and whats going. I’m going to try to give what I suspect is really going on here and why it's happening.*TLDR: Fivetran is getting squeezed on both sides and DBT has hit its peak, so they’re trying to merge to take a chunk off the warehouses and reach Databricks valuation (10b atm -> 100b Databricks/Snowflake)*First, a collect of assumptions from my side:* Fivetran is getting squeezed at the top by warehouses (Databricks, Snowflake) commoditizing EL for their enterprise contracts. Why ask your enterprise IT team to get legal to review another vendor contract (which will take another few 100ks of the budget) when you can do just 1 vendor? With EL at cost (cause the money is in query compute, not EL)?* Fivetran is getting squeezed at the bottom by much cheaper commoditized vendors (Airbyte, DLTHub, Rivery, etc.)* DBT has peaked and isn’t really growing much.For the first, the [proof](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/what-is-open-data-infrastructure) from DBTs article:> As a result, customers became frustrated with the tool-integration challenges and the inability to solve the larger, cross-domain problems. Customers began demanding more integrated solutions—asking their existing vendors to “do more” and leave in-house teams to solve fewer integration challenges themselves. Vendors saw this as an opportunity to grow into new areas and extend their footprints into new categories. This is neither inherently good nor bad. End-to-end solutions can drive cleaner integration, better user experience, and lower cost. But they can also limit user choice, create vendor lock-in, and drive up costs. The devil is in the details.> In particular, the data industry has, during the cloud era, been dominated by five huge players, each with well over $1 billion in annual revenue: Databricks, Snowflake, Google Cloud, AWS, and Microsoft Azure. Each of these five players started out by building an analytical compute engine, storage, and a metadata catalog. But over the last five years as the MDS story has played out, each of their customers has asked them to “do more.” And they have responded. Each of these five players now includes solutions across the entire stack: ingestion, transformation, notebooks and BI, orchestration, and more. They have now effectively become “all-in-one data platforms”—bring data, and do everything within their ecosystem.For the second point, you only need to go to the pricing page of any of the alternatives. Fivetran is expensive, plan and simple. For the third, I don’t really have any formal proof. You can take it as my opinion I suppose.With those 3 facts in mind, it seems like the game for DBTran (I’m using that name from now one :slightly_smiling_face:) is then to try to flip the board on the warehouses. Normally, the data warehouse is where things start, with other tools (think data catalogs, transformation layer, semantic layer, etc.) being an add on that they try to commoditize. This is why snowflake and databricks are worth 100b+. Instead, DBTran is trying to make the warehouse be the commodity. This is namely by using a somewhat new tech. Iceberg (not gonna explain iceberg here, feel free to read that elsewhere).If Iceberg is implemented, then compute and storage are split. The traditional warehouse vendors (bigquery, clickhouse, snowflake, etc.) are simply compute engines on top of the iceberg tables. Merely another component that can be switched out at will. Storage is an s3 bucket. DBTran would then be the rest. It would look a bit like:* Storage - **S3, GCS, etc.** * Compute - **Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.*** Iceberg Catalog - **DBTran*** EL - **DBTran*** Transformation Layer - **DBTran*** Semantic Layer - **DBTran**They could probably add more stuff here. Buy Lightdash maybe and get into BI? But I don’t imagine they would need to (not a big enough market). Rather, I suspect they want to take a chunk off the big guys. So get that sweet, sweet compute enterprise budget by carving them out in half and eating it.So should anyone in this subreddit care? I suppose it depends. If you don’t care about what tool you use, its business as usual. You’ll get something for EL, something for T and so on. Data engineering hasn’t fundamentally changed. If you care about OSS (which I do) then this is worth watching. I’m not sure if this is good or bad. I wouldn’t switch to DBT Fusion anytime soon. But if by any chance DBTran make the semantic layer and the EL OSS (even on an elastic license) then this might actually be a good thing for OSS. Great even.But I wouldn’t bet on that. DBT made Metricsflow proprietary. Fivetran is proprietary. If you want OSS, its best to look elsewhere.",

        "content": "Okay, so recently I’ve been learning and experimenting with Databricks for data projects. I work mainly with AWS, and I’m having some trouble understanding exactly how Databricks improves a pipeline and in what ways it simplifies development.Right now, we’re using Athena + dbt, with MWAA for orchestration. We’ve fully adopted Athena, and one of its best features for us is the federated query capability. We currently use that to access all our on-prem data, we’ve successfully connected to SAP Business One, SQL Server and some APIs, and even went as far as building a custom connector using the SDK to query SAP S/4HANA OData as if it were a simple database table.We’re implementing the bronze, silver, and gold (with iceberg) layers using dbt, and for cataloging we use AWS Glue databases for metadata, combined with Lake Formation for governance.And so for our dev experience is just making sql code all day long, the source does not matter(really) ... If you want to move data from the OnPrem side to Aws you just do \"create table as... Federated (select * from table) and that's it... You moved data from onprem to aws with a simple Sql, it applies to every source So my question is: could you provide clear examples of where Databricks actually makes sense as a framework, and in what scenarios it would bring tangible advantages over our current stack?",

More concretely, there may be one front end developer for marketing/onboarding, another for the customer facing app and maybe another for internal tools.Edit: I’m just using the FE role as an example. In reality, it’s actually a complete team However, the expectation is that one DE is responsible for all of the areas; understanding the data model, owning telemetry/product analytics, ensuring data quality, maintaining data pipelines, building the dw and finally either building charts or partnering with analytics/reporting on the BI. The point being that if one of these teams drops the ball, the blame still falls on the DE. I’ve had this expectation everywhere I’ve been. Some places are better than others in terms of how big the Data team can be and perhaps placing more responsibility on the downstream and upstream teams, but it’s generally never a “you are only responsible for this area”I’m rambling a bit but hopefully you get the idea. Is it only my experience? Is it only a startup thing? I’m curious to hear from others.",

The first 8 years of my career was in a consulting company doing a mixture of analytics and data migration activities as part of SaaS implementations (generally ERP/CRM systems). I guess an important thing to note was I genuinely felt like I knew what I was doing and was critical within the implementation projects. A couple of years ago I switched to a data architecture role at a tech company. Since day 1 I've felt behind my peers who I feel have much stronger skills in data modeling. With my consulting background and lack of formal CS learning, I feel like my knowledge of a traditional development lifecycle are missing and consequently feel like I deliver sub par work, along with other imposter syndrome type effects. Realistically I know the company wanted me for my experience and skills and maybe to be different to existing employees but I can't shake the feeling of unease. Any suggestions to improve here? Stick it out longer and hope things become clearer (they have over time but it's still hard to keep up), or return to the consulting world where I was more comfortable but now armed with a few more technical skills and less corporate bullshit.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Sorry I’m posting from a new account as my main one indicates my full name.I'm a fairly new hire at a fintech company that deals with payment data from a bunch of different banks and clients. I was hired a few months ago as a Data Analyst but the role has become super flexible right now, and I'm basically the only person purely focused on data.I spent the first few months under the Operations team helping with reconciliation (since my manager, who is now gone, wasn't great at it), using Excel/Google Sheets and a few Python scripts to expedite that process. That messy part is thankfully over, and I'm free to do data stuff.The problem is, I'm not experienced enough to lead a data team or even know the best place to start. I'm hoping you all can help me figure out how to shape my role, what to prioritize, and how to set myself up for growth.I’m comfortable with Python and SQL and have some exposure to Power BI, but not advanced. Our stack includes AWS, Metabase via PostgreSQL (for reporting to clients/partners or to expose our data to non technical colleagues e.g. customer support). No Snowflake or Spark that I'm aware of. Any data engineering tasks are currently handled by the software engineers.Note: A software engineer who left some time ago used dbt for a bit and I'm very interested in picking this up, if relevant. I was given a mix of BAU reporting tasks (client growth, churn rate, performance metrics, etc.) but the CTO gave me a 3-month task to investigate our current data practices, suggest improvements, and recommend new tools based on business needs (like Power BI).My ideal plan is to slowly transition into a proper Data Engineering role. I want to take over those tasks from the developers, build a more robust and automated reporting pipeline, and get hands-on with ETL practices and more advanced coding/SQL. I want to add skills to my CV that I'll be proud of and are also in demand.I'd really appreciate any advice on two main areas:1. a. What are the most effective things I can do right now to improve my daily work and start shaping the data?b. How do I use the currently available tools (PostgreSQL, Metabase, Python) to make my life easier when generating reports and client insights? Should I try to resurrect and learn dbt to manage my SQL transformations?c. Given the CTO's task, what kind of \"wrong practices\" should I be looking for in our current data processes?2.a. How do I lay the foundation for a future data engineering role, both in terms of learning and advocating for myself?b. What should I be learning in my spare time to get ready for data engineering tasks (i.e., Python concepts, ETL/ELT, AWS courses)?c. How do I effectively communicate the need for more proper Data Engineering tools/processes to the higher-ups and how do I make it clear I want to be doing that in the future?Sorry for the long post, and I'm aware of any red flags you see as well, but I need to stay in this role for at least a year or two (for my CV to have that fintech experience) so I want to make the best out of it. Thanks!",

What I don't know is if they are common because business analytical requirements dictate it, or if I, as DE, will benefit from it.Also, there's the issue of cost. Using Iceberg (what I would use) on S3 to achieve h.s. must increase costs: on what factor? what does the increase depend on?Edit 1h later: Thanks to all of you for taking the time to reply.Edit 1h later number 2: Conclusions drawn: The a) absence of a clear answer to the question and the presence of b) b.1) references to data modeling, business requirements and other analytical concepts, plus b.2) an unreasonable amount (>0) of avoidable unkind comments to the question, made me c) form this thin layer of new knowledge: There is no reason to think about historical snapshots of data in an environment where it's not required by downstream analytics or business requirements. Storing historical data is not required to maintain data lake-like structures and the ETL pipelines that move data from source to dashboards.",

That makes sense operationally — but it creates a disconnect because business users don’t care about processing time; they care about event time.To complicate things further, it’s also recommended to keep your bronze layer append-only and handle deduplication downstream.So, I have three main questions:1. How would you approach partitioning in the bronze layer under these constraints?2. How would you design an efficient deduplication view on top of the bronze layer, given that it can contain duplicates and the business only cares about the latest record?3. Given that there might be intermediary steps in between, like dbt transformations when going from bronze to gold. How do you partition data in each layer so that your pipeline can scale? Is achieving idempotentcy and deterministic behavior at scale a huge challenge? I would be grateful if there are any resources on it that you can point me towards too?",

        "content": "Hello! Been a reader in this sub for quite some time. I have started a part time job where I am tasked to create a dashboard. No specific software is being required by the client, but I have chosen Looker Studio because the client is using Google as their work environment (sheets + drive). I would love to keep the cost low, or in this case totally free for the client but it's kinda hard working with Looker (I say PBI has better features imo). I am new in this so I don't wanna overcharge the client with my services, thankfully they don't demand much or give a very strict deadline.I have done all my transforms in my own personal work Gmail using Drive + Sheets + Google Apps Script because all of the raw data are just csv files. My dashboard is working and setup as intended, but it's quite hard to do the \"queries\" I need for each visualization -- I just do a single sheet for each \"query\" because star schema and joins does not work for Looker? I feel like I can do this better, but I am stuck.Here are my current concerns:1. If the client asks for more, like automation and additional dashboard features, would you have any suggestions as to how I can properly scale my workflow? I have read about GCP's storage and Bigquery, tried the free trial and I setup it wrong as my credits was depleted in a few days?? I think it's quite costly and overkill for a data that is less than 50k rows according to ChatGPT. 2. Per my title, how can I \"sell\" this project to the client? What I mean is if in case the client wants to end our contract, like if they are completely satisfied with my simple automation, how can I transfer the ownership to them if I am currently using my personal email?*PS. I am* ***not*** *a Data analyst by profession nor working in Tech. I am just a guy who likes to try stuff and thankfully I got the chance to work on a real project after doing random Youtube ETL and dashboard projects. Python is my main language, so doing the above work using GAS(Javascript via ChatGPT lol) is quite a new experience to me.*",

        "content": "Hey looking for some direction on Data factory extraction design patterns. Im new to the Data Engineering world but i come from infrastructure with experience standing Data factories and some simple pipelines. Last month we implemented a Databricks DLT Meta framework that we just scrapped and pivoted to a similar design that doesn't rely on all those onboarding ddl etc files. Now its just dlt pipelines perfoming ingestion based on inputs defined in asset bundle when ingesting. On the data factory side our whole extraction design is dependent on a metadata table in a SQL Server database. This is where i feel like this is a bad design concept to totally depend on a unsecured non version controlled table in a sql server database. That table get deleted or anyone with access doing anything malicious with that table we can't extract data from our sources. Is this a industry standard way of extracting data from sources? This feels very outdated and non scalable to me to have your entire data factory extraction design based on a sql table. We only have 240 tables currently but we are about to scale in December to 2000 and im not confident in that scaling at all. My concerns fall on deaf ears due to my co workers having 15+ years in data but primary using Talend not Data Factory and not using Databricks at all. Can someone please give me some insights on modern techniques if my suspicions are correct?",

In this migration project I am working solo and carrying out planning, BA, business interaction, dev, BI, QA, and data gov & administration and the scope is only getting bigger.Last week there was an ongoing discussion between scrum master trying to highlight it’s already too much for me and that I shouldn’t be engaged as the main developer in other tasks and team lead who said that I am a crucial team member and they need me in other projects as well. I am connecting with both tmw but I wanna seek your advice on how to best manage these escalating situations and not let it affect my life and health over 0 mental or financial compensation.

        "author": "valko2",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "So we're going to have a baby in a few weeks, and I was thinking obviously how can I use my data skills for my baby. I vaguely remembered I saw a video or read an article where someone, somewhere said that they were able to predict their wife's delivery time (with few minutes accuracy) based on accurately measuring contraction start and end times, as contraction lengths tend to be longer and longer as the delivery time approaches. After a quick Google search, I found the video! It was made by [Steve Mould](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7q0Y2W0Rn4) 7 years ago, but somehow I remembered it. If you look at the [chart](https://youtu.be/k7q0Y2W0Rn4?si=vz_S1LCIsLeYs10v&t=275) in the video, the graph and trend lines feel a bit \"exaggerated\", but let's assume it's true.So I found a bunch of apps for timing contractions but nothing that provides predictions of the estimated delivery time. I found a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lbrp5f/oc_attempt_to_duplicate_steve_moulds_graph_for/) created 5 years ago, but the blog post describing the calculations is not available anymore. Anyway, I tried to reproduce a similar logic & graph in Python as a Streamlit app, [available in GitHub](https://github.com/vmatt/predict-my-baby). With my synthetic dataset it looks good, but I'd like to get some real data, so I can adjust the regression fitting on proper data. My ask would be for the community: 1. if you know any datasets that are publicly available, could you share with me? I found an [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201517), but I'm not sure how [can this](https://www.physionet.org/lightwave/) be translated into contraction start and end times. 2. Or if you already have kid, and you logged contraction lengths (start time/end time) with an app from which you can export into CSV/JSON/whatever format, please share that with me! Also sharing the actual delivery time would be needed so I can actually test it. (and any other data that you are willing to share - age, weight, any treatments during the pregnancy)I plan to reimplement the final version with html/js, so we can use it offline.Note: I'm not a data scientist by the way. Just someone who works with data and enjoys these kinds of projects. So I'm sure there are better approaches than simple regression (maybe XGBoost or other ML techniques?), but I'm starting simple. I also know that each pregnancy is unique, contraction lengths and delivery times can vary heavily based on hormones, physique, contractions can stall, speed up randomly, so I have no expectations. But I'd be happy to give it a try, if this can achieve 20-60 minutes of accuracy, I'll be happy.Update: I want to add, that my wife approves this",

        "content": "I realised that using Airflow on GCP Composer for loading json files from Google Cloud Storage to BigQuery and then move these files elsewhere every hour was too expensive.I, then, tried just using BigQuery external tables with dbt for version control over parquet files (with Hive style partitioning in a bucket in GCS), for that I started extracting data and loading it into GCS as parquet files using PyArrow.The problem is that these parquet files are way too small (from \\~25 kb to \\~175 kb each) but at the same time, and for now, it seems to be super convenient, but I will soon be facing performance problems.The solution I thought was launching a DAG that could merge these files into 1 every day at the end of the day (the resulting file would be around 100 MB which I think is almost ideal) , although I was trying to get away from composer as much as possible, but I guess I could also do a Cloud Function for this.Have you ever faced a problem like this? I think Databricks Delta Lake can compress parquet files like this automatically, does something like this exist for GCP? Is my solution a good practice? Could something better be done?",

        "content": "Hello fellow data engineers!I would like to get your point on this subject that I feel many of us have encountered in our career.I work in a company as their single & first data engineer. They have another team of backend engineers with a dozen employees. This allow the company to have backend engineers taking part of an on call in turns (with a financial compensation). However on my side it's impossible to have such thing in place as it would mean I'd be on call all the time (illegal & not desirable).The main pain point is that regularly (2-3 times/month) backend engineers break our data infrastructure on prod with some fix releases they made while on call. I also feel that sometimes they deploy new features as I receive DB schema updates with new tables on the weekend (I don't see many cases where fixing a backend error would imply to create a new table).Sometimes I fix those failures over the weekend on my personal time if I caught the alert notifications but sometimes I just don't check my phone or work laptop. Backend engineers are not responsible for the data infra like me, most of them don't know how it works and they don't have access to it for security reasons.In such situation what would be the best solution?Training the backend engineers on our data infra and give them access so they fix their mess when it happens ?Put myself on call time to time hoping I caught most of the outside working hours errors ?Insist to not deploy new features (schema changes) over the weekend ?For now I am considering asking for time compensation on case I had to work over the weekend to fix things, but not sure if this is viable on long term, especially as it's not on my contract.Thanks for your insight.",

        "author": "lancejpollard",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "General problem I'm been considering in the back of my head, when trying to figure out how to make some sort of interactive web UI for various language texts, and allow text annotation, and text editing (to progressively/slowly clean up the text mistakes over time, etc.). But in a way such a way that, if you or someone edits the text down the road, it won't mess up the annotations and stuff like that?I don't know much about linguistic annotation software (saw [this brief overview of some options](https://www.labellerr.com/blog/text-annotation-labeling-tools/#1-labellerr)), but what I've looked at so far are basically these:- [Perseus Greek Texts](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0227) (click on individual words to lookup)- [Prodigy demo](https://demo.prodi.gy/?=null&view_id=pos_manual) (on of the text annotation tools I could quickly try in basic mode for free)- [Logeion](https://logeion.uchicago.edu/articulus) (double click to visit terms anywhere in the text)But the general problem I'm getting stuck on in my head is what I was saying, here is a brief example to clarify:- Say we are working with the Bible text (bunch of books, divided into chapters, divided into verses)- The data model I'm considering at this point is a tree of JSON basically, `text_section` can be arbitrarily nested (bible -> book -> chapter), and then at the end are `text_span` in the children (verses here).- Say the Bible unicode text is super messy, random artifacts here and there, extra whitespace and punctuation in various spots, overall the text is 90% good quality but could use months or years of fine-tuned polish to clean it up and make it perfect. (Sefaria texts, open-source Hebrew texts, are super-super messy, tons of textual artifacts that could use some love to clean up and stuff eventually over time... for example.).- But say you can also annotate the text at any point, creating probably \"selection_ranges\" of text within or across verses, etc.. Then you can label or do whatever to add metadata to those ranges.Problem is:- Text is being cleaned up over say a couple years, a few minor tweaks every day.- Annotations are being added every day too.Edge-case is basically this:- Annotation is added on some selected text- Text gets edited (maybe user is not even aware of or focused on the annotation UI at this point, but under the hood the metadata is still there).- Editor removes some extra whitespace, and adds a missing word (as they found say by looking at a real manuscript scan).- Say the editor added `Newton` to `Isaac`, so whereas before it said `foo bar Isaac ... baz`, now it says `foo bar Isaac Newton baz`.- Now the annotation sort of changes meaning, and needs to be redone (this is a terrible example, I tried thinking of what my mind's stumbling on, but can't quite pin it down totally yet).- Should say `foo bar Isaac Newton baz` let's say (but the editor never sees anything annotation-wise...)Basically, trying to show that, the annotations can get messed up, and I don't see a systematic way to handle or resolve that if editing the text is also allowed.You can imagine other cases where some annotation marks like a phrase or idiom, but then the editor comes and changes the idiom to be something totally different, or just partially different, whatever. Or splits the annotation somehow, etc..Basically, have apps or anyone figured out generally how to handle this general problem? How to not make it so when you edit, you have to just delete the annotations, but it somehow smart merges, or flags it for double-checking, etc.. Basically there is a lot to think through functionality-wise, and I'm not sure if it's already been done before. It's both a data-modeling problem, and a UI/UX problem. But mainly concerned about the technical data-modeling problem here.",

I do this multiple times until I am through my complete result. I am looking to avoid the limit/offset query route since the dataset is fairly large and limit/offset will just move the issue to DB Server memory.Is there any way to do this in bash itself or it would be better to move to Python/R or some other language?

This is not autogenerated because our ERP doesn't support this. That's why we use XMind as you can see an example in the image above.Is their any software that I can use to automate this process because Xmind is thrash and a hassle to use? If this is not the right subreddit I am sorry. But I hope you guys can give me some pointers. Kind regards",

        "author": "Remote_Impact_8173",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi!Assume I got a huge dataset of crawled internet webpages, and I'd like to transform them page by page doing some kind of filtration, pre-processing, tokenization etc. Let's say that original dataset is stored along some metainformation in form of parquet files in S3.Coming from enterprises, I have some background in Apache ecosystem as well as some older Big Tech MapReduce-kinda data warehouses, so my first idea was to use Spark to define those transformations using some scala/python code and just deal with it in batch processing manner. But before doing it \"classic ETL-style\" way, I decided to check some more modern (trending?) data stacks that are out there.I learned about Modal. They seem to be claiming about revolutionizing data processing, but I am not sure how exactly the practical usecases of data processing are expressed in them. Therefore, a bunch of questions to the community:1. They don't provide a notion of \"dataframes\", nor know anything about my input datasets, thus I must be responsible for somehow partitioning of the input into chunks, right? Like, reading slices of parquet file if needed, or coalescing groups of parquet files together before running an actual distributed computation?2. What about fault-tolerance? Spark has implemented protocols for atomic output commit, how do you expose result of a distributed data processing atomically without producing garbage from restarted jobs when using Modal? Do I, again, implement this manually?3. Is there any kind of long-running data processing operation state snapshotting? (not saying about individual executors, but rather the application master) If I have a CPU intensive computation running for 24 hours and I close my laptop lid, or the initiator host dies some other way, am I automatically screwed?4. Are there tweaks like speculative execution, or at least a way how to control/abort individual function executions? It is always a pity to see how 99% of a job finished with high concurrency and last couple of tasks ended up on some faulty host and take eternity to finish. 5. Since they are a cloud service - do you know about their actual scalability limits? I have a computation CPU cluster of \\~25k CPU cores in my company, do they have some comparable fleet? It would be quite stupid to hit into some limitation like \"no more than 1000 cpu cores per user unless you are an enterprise folk paying $20k/month just for a license\"... 6. Also, them being non-opensource also makes it harder to understand what exactly happens under the hood, are there any open-source competitors to them? Or at least a way how to bring them on-premise to my company's fleet?And a more generic question – has any of you folks ever tried actually processing some huge datasets with them? Right now it looks more like a tool for smaller developer experiments, or for time-slicing GPUs for seconds, but not something that I would use to build a reliable data pipeline over. But maybe I am missing something. PS I was told Ray also became popular recently, and they seem to be open-source as well, so will check them later as well.",

        "author": "wtfzambo",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello,I'm seeking help with a bad situation I have with Synapse + Azure storage (ADLS2).The situation: I'm forced to use Synapse notebooks for certain data processing jobs; a couple of weeks ago I was asked to create a pipeline to download some financial data from a public repository and output it to Azure storage.Said data is very small, a few Megabytes at most. So I first developed the script locally, used Polars for dataframe interface and once I verified everything worked, I put it online.# EditApparently I failed to explain myself since nearly everyone who answered, implicitly thinks I'm an idiot, so while I'm not ruling that option out I'll just simplify:* I have some code that reads data from an online API and writes it somewhere.* The data is a few MBs.* I'm using Polars, not Pyspark* Locally it runs in one minute.* On Synapse it runs in 7 minutes.* Yes, I did account for pool spin up time, it takes 7 minutes after the pool is ready.* Synapse and storage account are in the same region.* I am FORCED to use Synapse notebooks by the organization I'm working for.* I don't have details about networking at the moment as I wasn't involved in the setup, I'd have to collect them.Now I understand that data transfer goes over the network, so it's gotta be slower than writing to disk, but what the fuck? 5 to 10 times slower is insane, for such a small amount of data.This also makes me think that the Spark jobs that run in the same environment would be MUCH faster in a different setup.So this said, the question is, is there anything I can do to speed up this shit?# Edit 2Under suggestion of some of you I then profiled every component of the pipeline, which eventually confirmed the suspicion that the bottleneck is in the I/O part.Here's the relevant profiling results if anyone is interested:### local```_write_parquet: Calls: 1713 Total: 52.5928s Avg: 0.0307s Min: 0.0003s Max: 1.0037s_read_parquet (this is an extra step used for data quality check): Calls: 1672 Total: 11.3558s Avg: 0.0068s Min: 0.0004s Max: 0.1180sdownload_zip_data: Calls: 22 Total: 44.7885s Avg: 2.0358s Min: 1.6840s Max: 2.2794sunzip_data: Calls: 22 Total: 1.7265s Avg: 0.0785s Min: 0.0577s Max: 0.1197sread_csv: Calls: 2074 Total: 17.9278s Avg: 0.0086s Min: 0.0004s Max: 0.0410stransform (includes read_csv time): Calls: 846 Total: 20.2491s Avg: 0.0239s Min: 0.0012s Max: 0.2056s```### synapse```_write_parquet: Calls: 1713 Total: 848.2049s Avg: 0.4952s Min: 0.0428s Max: 15.0655s_read_parquet: Calls: 1672 Total: 346.1599s Avg: 0.2070s Min: 0.0649s Max: 10.2942sdownload_zip_data: Calls: 22 Total: 14.9234s Avg: 0.6783s Min: 0.6343s Max: 0.7172sunzip_data: Calls: 22 Total: 5.8338s Avg: 0.2652s Min: 0.2044s Max: 0.3539sread_csv: Calls: 2074 Total: 70.8785s Avg: 0.0342s Min: 0.0012s Max: 0.2519stransform (includes read_csv time): Calls: 846 Total: 82.3287s Avg: 0.0973s Min: 0.0037s Max: 1.0253s```### context:`_write_parquet`: writes to local storage or adls.`_read_parquet`: reads from local storage or adls.`download_zip_data`: downloads the data from the public source to a local `/tmp/data` directory.

        "author": "ApacheDoris",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "In large-scale data analytics, balancing speed, flexibility, and accuracy is always a challenge. Apache Flink and Apache Doris together provide a strong foundation for real-time analytics pipelines. Flink offers powerful stream processing capabilities, while Doris provides low-latency analytics over large datasets.This post outlines the main integration patterns between the two systems, focusing on the **Flink Doris Connector** and **Flink CDC** for end-to-end real-time ETL.# 1. Overview: Flink + Doris in Real-time Analytics**Apache Flink** is a distributed stream processing engine widely adopted for ingesting and processing data from various sources such as databases, message queues, and event streams.**Apache Doris** is an MPP-based real-time analytical database that supports fast, high-concurrency queries. Its architecture includes:* **FE (Frontend):** request routing, query parsing, metadata, scheduling* **BE (Backend):** query execution and data storageTogether, Flink and Doris form a complete path: **Data Collection → Stream Processing → Real-time Storage → Analytics and Query**https://preview.redd.it/g5xktumi95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=58bff724160508aa3b65d27668013b2451af496c# 2. Flink Doris Connector: Scan, Lookup Join, and Real-time WriteThe **Flink Doris Connector** provides three major functions for building data pipelines.# (1) Scan (Reading from Doris)Instead of using a traditional JDBC connector (which can hit throughput limits), the Doris Source in Flink distributes read requests across Doris backend nodes.* The Flink JobManager requests a query plan from Doris FE.* The plan is distributed to TaskManagers, each reading data directly from assigned Tablets in parallel.This distributed approach significantly increases data read throughput during synchronization or batch analysis.https://preview.redd.it/nm11w5nm95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=7de75abee5e481cc1816edb4f5a794450eaf78e1# (2) Lookup Join (Real-time Stream + Dimension Table Join)Flink supports joining streaming data with dimension tables in Doris.* **Traditional JDBC Lookup** performs synchronous single-record queries, which can easily become a bottleneck under heavy load.* **Flink Doris Connector** introduces **asynchronous batch lookups**: * Incoming events are queued and processed in batches. * Each batch is sent as a single `UNION ALL` query to Doris.This design improves join throughput and reduces latency in stream–dimension table lookups.https://preview.redd.it/g3xrn78p95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a9b83137da211f91dde0ad32c19c003b8acbe03(3) Real-time Write (Sink)For real-time ingestion, the Connector uses Doris’s **Stream Load** mechanism.**Process summary:*** Sink initiates a long-lived Stream Load request.* Data is continuously sent in chunks during Flink checkpoints.* After a checkpoint is completed, the transaction is committed and becomes visible in Doris.https://preview.redd.it/w5d7rmut95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c4c308903f6902c398ebd4b0f152fbcb4aac98aTo ensure **exactly-once semantics**, the connector uses a **two-phase commit**:1. Pre-commit data during checkpoint (not yet visible)2. Commit after checkpoint successhttps://preview.redd.it/m1nwzo2w95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=174fa327670b871eb62744b05a96fc454ef2d2c1**Balancing real-time and exactly-once:** Because commits depend on Flink checkpoints, shorter checkpoint intervals yield lower latency but higher resource use. The Connector adds a **batch caching mechanism**, temporarily buffering records in memory before committing, which improves throughput while maintaining correctness (idempotent writes under Doris primary key model).https://preview.redd.it/lattav7x95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=26943c7358c98e9dc2dcd0076861d23f80083524# 3. Flink CDC: Full and Incremental Synchronization**Flink CDC (Change Data Capture)** supports both initial full synchronization and continuous incremental updates from databases such as MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.# (1) Common challenges in full sync:* Detecting and syncing new tables automatically* Handling metadata and type mapping* Supporting DDL propagation (schema changes)* Low-code setup with minimal configuration# (2) Flink CDC capabilities:* **Incremental snapshot reading** with parallelism and lock-free scanning* **Restartable sync** — if interrupted, the task continues from the last offset* **Broad source support** (MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.)https://preview.redd.it/6564nl0z95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=93dbfd850c5765db605dd97613c1dc9a3f42e64a# (3) One-click integration with DorisWhen combined with the Flink Doris Connector, the system can automatically:* Create downstream Doris tables if they don’t exist* Route multiple tables to different sinks* Manage schema mapping transparentlyThis reduces configuration complexity and speeds up deployment for large-scale data migration and sync jobs.# 4. Schema Evolution with Light Schema ChangeDoris recently added a **Light Schema Change** mechanism that enables millisecond-level schema updates (add/drop columns) without interrupting ingestion or queries.When integrated with Flink CDC:1. The Source captures upstream DDL operations.2. The Doris Sink parses and applies them via Light Schema Change.Compared to traditional methods, schema change latency dropped from over 1 second to a few milliseconds, allowing continuous sync even during frequent schema evolution.# 5. Example: Full MySQL Database SynchronizationA full sync job can be submitted via the Flink client, defining:* Flink configurations (parallelism, checkpoint interval)* Table filtering via regex* Source/Sink connector parametersThis setup allows syncing entire databases to Doris with minimal configuration effort.https://preview.redd.it/8o0fii32a5vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=0960520b54b0432925a13584963929566966db2b# 6. Summary**Key takeaways:*** **Flink Doris Connector** supports parallel reading, async lookup joins, and exactly-once real-time writing.* **Flink CDC** provides lock-free incremental sync, automatic table creation, and DDL propagation.* **Light Schema Change** in Doris enables near-instant schema updates with no downtime.The combination of Flink and Doris offers a practical, open-source approach to real-time data integration and analytics at scale.",

        "author": "echanuda",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I know this isn't a sub specifically for technical questions, but I'm really at a loss here. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.Disclaimer that this problem is with delta-rs (in Python), not Delta Lake with Databricks.The project is simple: We have a Delta table, and we want to update some records.The solution: use the merge functionality. dt = DeltaTable(\"./table\") updates_df = get_updates() dt.merge( updates_df, predicate=( \"target.pk = source.pk\" \"AND target.salt = source.salt\" \"AND target.foo = source.foo\" \"AND target.bar != source.bar\" ), source_alias=\"source\", target_alias=\"target\", ).when_matched_update( updates={\"bar\": \"source.bar\"} ).execute()The above code is essentially a simplified version of what I have, but all the core pieces are there. It's quite simple in general. The delta table in `./table` is very very large, but it is partitioned nicely with around 1M records per partition (salted to get the partitions balanced). Overall there's \\~2B records in there, while `updates_df` has 2M.The problem is that the merge operation balloons memory **massively** for some reason. I was under the impression that working with partitions would drastically decrease the memory consumption, but no. It eventually OOMs, exceeding 380G. This doesn't make sense. Doing a join on the same column between the two tables with duckdb, I find that there would be \\~120k updates across 120 partitions (there are a little over 500 partitions). For one, duckdb can handle the join just fine, and two, it's working with such a small amount of updates. How is it using so much? The partitioned columns are `pk` and `salt`, which I am using in the predicate, so I don't think it has anything to do with lack of pruning.If anyone has any experience with this or the solution is glaringly obvious (never used Delta before), then I'd love to hear your thoughts. Oh and if you're wondering why I don't use a more conventional solution for this - that's not my decision. And even if it were, now I'm just curious at this point.",

It took longer, broke constantly and at one point I almost gave up but when it finally ran I actually understood what was happening this time. That moment felt different. I switched tabs on my laptop, leaned back and played a game on myprize. If you’re stuck in tutorial hell, rebuild something from memory. It’s not easy but it’s the first time coding has felt real to me.",

        "content": "Hi, I 17F is a first year computer science student and I’m currently learning C as my first language in an academic setting. Other languages I have played around with are python, css, html and javascript. I wouldn’t say I have a strong foundation in any of these languages but I’ve dabbled a bit in them. I’m pointing out my coding/programming background to show I barely have any knowledge, when I was learning those languages I barely had any projects except when I was learning html and css in which I posted very beginner like web pages, task bars etc. I really don’t want to get dependent on AI due to the fact on different subreddits I see people say they hire swe’s or software developers and they aren’t able to code at all, I don’t want that to be me, even though AI has been around for a while now I want to act like it’s still 2010s-2020 when people were learning how to code without the use of tools like that, another reason is that my degree is more tailored to practical and applied programming than it is to theory and mathematics, towards my second semester of first year and second year I’ll be doing less of mathematics & computer science theory and more of Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Architecture, Object Oriented programming, Databases. I don’t want to GPT my way through this degree, I want to know why and how things work, I want to be able to actually critically think and problem solve, I’m not saying people who use AI cannot do this, I’ve heard several senior developers implement these tools in their day to day activities, but I’m saying as a beginner with a foundation which is not so sturdy, if I do rely on AI as a tool or teacher, I might get too dependent on it maybe that’s just a skill issue on my end :grinning_face_with_sweat:. I noticed C is a bit different from these languages cause C is more backend language and is used for compiling, I wouldn’t say it’s a hard language to learn but it’s definitely tricky for me, I don’t really want to use AI to learn it, apart from W3Schools and Youtube videos which other resources like books, blogs, websites can I use to learn this language?",

Let me repeat that point, it is impossible to be good at everything.5. To succeed, you need to pick a small section of this vast field and learn enough to at least show some basic understanding of that field. That might be as simple as mastering one of the many programming languages out there. However, if you can't achieve something as simple as that, chances are, you won't be getting that next job offer.6.

        "content": "It's actually very good. I really enjoy how they make programming and computer science seem fun and simple, the professor is very good at explaining concepts no matter how difficult or unfamiliar they are. Things like memory management in C or data structures and algorithms were very easily explained, David Malan (the professor) is a very energetic and enthusiastic teacher but he explains his thoughts very clearly, he does a very good job at explaining these concepts visually and conceptually. Things that I was scared of getting stuck on became very simple once they were explained, David Malan is a very good teacher.I also really enjoyed the problem sets. They were very well made and thought out, they're not too easy like some of the other coding courses that say things like \"print hello world\", \"create a variable and print it\", no with CS50 every problem set is a mini-project(s). It's not too hand-holding like other courses where it feels like you're following instructions instead of building, no you get an explanation, you get a demo of how the final product should look, sometimes you get a short walkthrough or some hints, but at the end of the day it's all about you seeking the answer yourself and working through the problem. Some problem sets are unique and fun like I really enjoyed Fiftyville and Readability.Expanding on the last point, I really like how they focus on the problem solving aspect of programming. As a developer you don't get paid to code but to solve problems. I really enjoyed how they didn't encourage AI to write code or to be the main source of learning, no they really want you to read documentation, research and do rubber duck debugging, they encourage figuring things out yourself and that is such an important skill to learn.Another thing I enjoyed was how easy their tools were to use. Just make a Github account and connect it to the CS50 codespace. They document and explain their tools like submit50 and check50 very well. I think that if tomorrow you start CS50 and it's your first day programming, it would be very straightforward to get started with the CS50 tools.Now, the course isn't particularly easy, simple and easy aren't the same thing. If you have no experience with computer science then CS50 could be a bit difficult at first since they get you up and running QUICK, I mean they start talking about algorithms and memory management by around week 3 and 4 and so yeah this is definitely not a course that I would say is \"easy\", but the professor is very good at explaining concepts and if you just stay consistent and you keep going it'll be worth it. It actually gets easier from week 6 and onwards, in my opinion.Overall, it's a great course. Heck, I wouldn't even be mad if this course costed money. If you're thinking of taking an easy to follow, free, fun course full of learning opportunities then I think CS50 is great, there is not really much of anything that I disliked, everything was super straight forward and simple.",

I'm a teacher and I'm also married (mid-twenties) but I feel like I lack the discipline to learn programming, which saddens me since it's something I'm very passionate about ~~and every day I procrastinate hits me like a rock~~.I'm learning by myself by reading books and writing everything I understood down and explaining to myself what I understood. What I don't understand I ask AI to explain to me in other words, or as if it were to a child *(works like a charm)*. These are very useful for myself since it's how I learn best, but I wanted to know how others learned this skill.So, how did you learn / are learning programming? What do you do to keep disciplined? How has your journey been ever since you started?>!*Non-Important Information: I'm learning C# and just recently got to Methods, Parameters, Return Values, etc. My goal is to understand the basics of programming to only then start actually making a game. I'm also aware of the other parts of Game Dev such as art and sound design, but that's a bridge I'll cross when I get to it.* !< Edit: Thanks for all the replies. It really helped me see things in another perspective! I'll continue learning programming to finally make a game",

I think it has a lot more to do with the economy and business side of things than it does with \"capabilities\".Getting a job has never been about \"yo, i can build advanced and cool software!!\" and yet people put too much emphasis on technologies and what can now be done almost as if the entire tech industry is one giant competition about who can do what the best.So is AI really to blame here? Just seeking clarification. And if my take on the subject does matter, I would say it is important to be more business-oriented so you can understand the value you bring to companies because at the end of the day that is why we get hired. Nobody hires someone so they can have a salary. You just gotta prove to them that you are worth the investment.These are just my thoughts but if I am wrong please do correct me :)",

So far I've invested in the following books hoping to give myself an edge:1. Designing Data-Intensive Applications (to help understand designing for scale)2. The Creative Programmer (to better understand the problem solving process)3. Concurrency in Go4. Learning Go (Go is my favorite language to work in, so I want to learn it deeply)5.

Is that too advanced to start off if I don’t remember DSA?I have the time to dedicate to it daily, and my employer is fine with me taking a couple of my work hours to work on my skills. I also feel very behind. In the last five years I feel like there’s been more changes than ever. None of this AI stuff was as big as when I was in school nor were there so many AI tools and resources. Maybe I can use some of these to my advantage to learn? The golden thing is that my boss is willing to let me use work hours to learn and upskill my career, so I really want to take advantage of this opportunity since it’s a really good thing. We also have software jobs internally I can transfer to, but they require Leetcode even for current employees. Lastly, should I do projects too? How do I balance Leetcode and projects? How many projects? Thank you for any help. I appreciate it.",

I am particularly interested in the `int a = value_giver;` line. The code works proper, but I am unsure (and google isn't giving me solid answers. And I am too lazy to read through the C programming book that I own rn LOL) as to how the assignment actually work. Does it use a pointer and assigns that to the variable a? Does invoking a function simply point to its return value? Am I stupid and there is something entirely different going on?I'd love to hear your answers!",

Each project is deployed on its own subdomain.That setup has worked quite well overall, but it has its pros and cons:* PRs don’t interfere with each other, so I can push some changes to production without affecting other projects.* The shared library isn’t a problem since it doesn’t get updated often.* There’s some repetitive code like interfaces, hooks, and constants.* When the shared library does change, I have to manually bump and update the version in every repo (`event`, `auth`, etc.) to avoid version mismatches — a bit annoying.* Each repo has its own CI/CD pipeline; it’s repetitive but helps ensure that if one build fails, the others still deploy fine.# For this new project, I’m considering a monorepo: apps/ base/ community/ registration/ store/ packages/ ui/ hooks/ interfaces/ utils/Everything in one workspace (using Bun/Turborepo)**My main doubts are:*** My intention is to use a monorepo, but my main questions are:* If only one app or a single change is ready for production, how is that usually managed in a shared repository?* How do you handle CI/CD for multiple apps and the shared core (packages like hooks, ui, etc.)?* Would you recommend a monorepo or a multi-repo setup with a shared npm package?# Stack* Next.js 15 (app router)* TypeScript* React Query / GraphQL / API Rest* Bun / Turborepo* CI/CD with Azure Pipelines",

I'm hoping I can get past things like this but I got so scared that I'm just not smart enough for this.Any advice? **EDIT**This masters course is aimed at people without computer science backgrounds. I've not snuck my way in to a masters I'm not qualified for :face_with_tears_of_joy:",

        "author": "Classic_Stomach3165",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I am trying to make a function that assigns note names to musical scales which are represented by binary numbers. For example, the expected output for a scale 1001011100101 with a root of F would be F Ab Bb B C Eb F (for musical theory reasons).To do this I wrote a recursive function that attempts different scale spellings and returns the one with the lowest cost (e.g. F G# G## Bb Cb C C### F should have a higher cost). However I'm struggling with the recursion as its assigning unexpected costs to certain notes.Specifically at the calculate cost section (line 41). The function returns \\[('F', 0), ('Ab', 0), ('Bb', 0), ('Cb', 0), ('Dbb', 3), ('Eb', 0), ('F', 0)\\]). However I'm not sure why Cb has a cost of 0 and Dbb has a cost of 3. I would like them to be B and C which should have lower costs than Cb and Dbb.The idea behind the helper functions NameScalesEnharmonicRoots and NameScalesKeySignatures are to try different enharmonic roots (e.g. F# and Gb) for a scale and return the one with the lowest cost and to try to fit scales to key signatures to try to be accurate with music theory.Are there any recursion gurus who can help me out?Here is my code: def NameScales(tonic,binary,majorMode): keys = ['C','C#','Db','D','D#','Eb','E','F','F#','Gb','G','G#','Ab','A','A#','Bb','B'] # get the pitches of the scale pitches = [] for i in range(len(binary)): if binary[i]=='1': pitches.append(i) # get the pitches of the major scale if 'b' in tonic: diatonic = [1] elif '#' in tonic: diatonic = [-1] else: diatonic = [0] for i in range(7): if (ord(tonic[0])+i-65)%7+65 == ord('E') or (ord(tonic[0])+i-65)%7+65 == ord('B'): diatonic.append(diatonic[i]+1) else: diatonic.append(diatonic[i]+2) def AssignNotes(pitch, letter, lastNote=''): # base case if pitch == len(pitches): if lastNote and lastNote in keys: return (0,'', []) return (float('inf'), '', []) if (letter > 7): return (float('inf'), '', []) # get the note currentLetterNum = (ord(tonic[0])+letter-65)%7+65 accidentals = pitches[pitch]-diatonic[letter] if accidentals == 0: note = chr(currentLetterNum) elif accidentals < 0: note = chr(currentLetterNum) + 'b'*(-accidentals) elif accidentals > 0: note = chr(currentLetterNum) + '#'*accidentals # calculate cost if note in majorMode: totalCost = 0 else: totalCost = abs(accidentals)+1 totalStr = note totalList = [(note,totalCost)] if pitch == len(pitches)-1: currentLastNote = note else: currentLastNote = lastNote # recursive calls nextCost, nextStr, nextList = AssignNotes(pitch+1,letter+1,currentLastNote) totalCost += nextCost if nextStr != '': totalStr = note + '&ensp;' + nextStr totalList += nextList skipCost, skipStr, skipList = AssignNotes(pitch,letter+1,lastNote) doubleUpCost, doubleUpStr, doubleUpList = AssignNotes(pitch+1,letter,currentLastNote) if doubleUpCost != float('inf'): doubleUpCost += totalCost + abs(accidentals) + 1 if doubleUpStr != '': doubleUpStr = note + '&ensp;' +doubleUpStr doubleUpList = [(note,totalCost)]+doubleUpList # choose the path with the minimum cost minCost = min(totalCost,skipCost,doubleUpCost) if minCost == totalCost: return (totalCost, totalStr,totalList) elif minCost == skipCost: return (skipCost,skipStr,skipList) elif minCost == doubleUpCost: return (doubleUpCost,doubleUpStr,doubleUpList) return AssignNotes(0,0,'') # get the parent mode def NameScalesKeySignatures(tonic,binary): orderOfSharps = ['F#','C#','G#','D#','A#','E#'] orderOfFlats = ['Bb','Eb','Ab','Db','Gb','Cb'] flatKeys = ['C','F','Bb','Eb','Ab','Db','Gb'] sharpKeys = ['C','G','D','A','E','B','F#','C#','G#','D#','A#'] lowestScale = None lowestCost = 9999999999999 for i in range(-5,2): if tonic in sharpKeys: accidentals = sharpKeys.index(tonic)+i elif tonic in flatKeys: accidentals = -flatKeys.index(tonic)+i if accidentals > 0: keySignature = orderOfSharps[:accidentals] elif accidentals < 0: keySignature = orderOfFlats[:abs(accidentals)] else: keySignature = [] # build the notes of the scale by character number and then add sharps and flats to them as they appear in the key signature majorMode = [] for j in range(7): letter = chr((ord(tonic[0])+j-65)%7+65) for k in keySignature: if letter in k: letter = k majorMode.append(letter) currentScale = NameScales(tonic,binary,majorMode) if currentScale[0] < lowestCost: lowestCost = currentScale[0] lowestScale = currentScale print(majorMode) print(lowestScale) return lowestScale # get the tonic def NameScalesEnharmonicRoots(tonic,binary): enharmonics = [['C',''], ['F',''], ['Bb','A#'], ['Eb','D#'], ['Ab','G#'], ['Db','C#'], ['Gb','F#'], ['B',''], ['E',''], ['A',''], ['D',''], ['G','']] print(tonic,binary) scale = NameScalesKeySignatures(tonic,binary) scaleNotes = scale[1] scaleKey = tonic for keys in enharmonics: if tonic in keys: enharmonic = keys[:] enharmonic.remove(tonic) enharmonicTonic = enharmonic[0] if enharmonicTonic: scaleEnharmonic = NameScalesKeySignatures(enharmonicTonic,binary) if scaleEnharmonic[0] < scale[0]: scaleNotes = scaleEnharmonic[1] scaleKey = enharmonicTonic return (scaleKey,scaleNotes) print(NameScalesEnharmonicRoots('F','1001011100101'))",

My father is forcing me to 'learn' programming by assigning complex C++ projects with only a couple days allowed to work on it. I have barely any programming experience and have only done basic Python. But the workload of C++ my father is pushing is constant, he doesn't teach me C++ or even try to work through the assignments, just gives me a due date and a google doc and says to ask ChatGPT if I need help.My code is usually an ugly amalgamation of AI-generated nonsense and my best attempt at C++ that is impossible to get working. He only gives me enough time to make something that vaguely fills the assignment requirements much less works much less I actually understand what I'm writing. I genuinely want to learn to code but I don't have the time for much else on top of school and all the C++ projects. My father doesn't explain pointers or compiling or anything and I'm just very lost but I don't have the time to learn on my own while still completing his assignments. I'm currently doing CS50x from edx but its been difficult to progress on top of everything else.He's a software engineer but doesn't seem to understand that coding doesn't come naturally for some people. The most recent assignment was I was given a week for an advanced C++ ecosystem simulation of different environment regions, predators, prey, random chance, etc all reading from a configuration file; I don't even know how to write a basic calculator in C++ without help.If anyone has learned programming/C++ in a similar manner by 'doing' or has any suggestions for how I can actually learn please comment! I would really appreciate it. Thanks!",

As an example, I'm working on a site for a club I'm in and while the site itself is huge and probably needs most of its pages manually coded in (I'm using React), there's one section in particular where it could easily become a mess to do that. Basically, there's an \"Events\" section which features a bunch of links to Current and Past Events that the club has hosted and clicking on any of them takes you to a dedicated event page. All of the event pages have more or less the same structure. I can't imagine having to create pages for each of them manually and then route them all to individual endpoints; it sounds very backwards. I mean, there's no way the guys at Youtube are hand-crafting pages for each of it's videos on the database and then manually connecting a million routes. So what's the solution here?I heard of something called Static Site Generation, the concept of which I haven't been able to fully understand yet. Could this be the solution to what I'm trying to do?Also, what to do if I wanted to add some unique flair to some of the event pages (but not all) while still maintaining most of the structure? (Say for example, one event page has a different background colour than the rest, or has a few divs here and there that the others don't have) Would I be able to customise without having to break out of the system?",

We don't all know what animals we have in shelter or foster, paper written medication, paper written volunteer logs that get lost etc. I thought I could secretly try and make something that could help (secretly in case I fail).How should I go about this? Any program references? Classes? Im trying to dip my toes back into coding or building an app while also helping a shelter that I think could benefit from this sort of application.",

I grew up with the Sinclair Speccy so have some grounding in (BASIC) coding concepts, and I spent some time learning JS earlier this year, coming at it from a very low knowledge level. I really enjoyed its accessibility and immediacy, but found the best online tuition sites (FreeCodeCamp etc) to be much too web dev focussed to hold my interest (totally appreciate JS is used predominanty for web).I've played a lot with UE4 and UE5 but always got hamstrung in the end with not knowing enough of the fundamentals to progress past a certain point - Blueprints is great, but without understanding what's going on processually, I found I got stuck quite early on with the complexities of the engine. So I want to jump into the deep end, and start learning C++, to get a proper deep level coding knowledge base.However... I want to find a way to learn that will give me some progressively more difficult, game based, coding projects along the way. I found the LearnC++ site which is absolutely awesome, but much too text heavy for me (I have ADHD/dyslexia) so want to find a balance between text and practice based learning.Can anyone point me to any relevant (and free/cheap) resources please, ones that will take me through the concepts progressively like LearnC++ does?

I know of vm and I know podman/docker. I have not used either at this stage. But want some lightweight solution to be able to get a close approximation of real life set up. These were two options that I have found that may be able to provide what I need with some other steps for setting them up. Is there something that exists that achieves this already or should I set up scripts which generate data within a container or vm, I simply don't know if this is the right way to approach it. Thanks for the help. Edit: I have learned that spoofing hardware is what I am aiming to do. Simulate is apparently the wrong word. I will either use vm or potentially my antix usb on my other laptop. And then spoof hardware. With whatever a hypervisor is. So I have more work to do here.This is awesome.",

I completed the introductory “Hello World”, and other starter programs that they suggested however, I started doing extra exercises to attempt to help myself. I know with coding, like any hobby, you need experience and just working out new problems helps. When I’d ask for help or an explanation it feels as if the programmer mentors are frustrated with me because they cannot dumb down the material enough. Luckily I have a friend that’s been helping me explain code verbally and it’s helping more than sitting on scratch for 5 hours ever has but I still feel like I’m missing something. Basic functions are hard to write and I know memorization isn’t really your friend in this subject so how exactly do you know what to code? I feel like I’m constantly copying-pasting and trying new things to get certain examples to work correctly. Is this wrong? Should I be approaching this another way?",

I didn't really mind this but I have been thrown around from project to project without any being completed, I haven't had any resources.My main concerns are the following:* Not a single project has any form of docs whatsoever and this is something I wanted to learn about* I don't have a mentor* I don't even work with a senior* I don't even have my code reviewed* I work with a couple other juniors, whom don't work with the seniors either, and one heavily relies on AI so much that his code is always buggy and he doesn't know how to fix it* The director constantly uses AI to add code and pushes it to the main branch.* We only ever use one stack, which is redwoodjs, for every single project, or react native, expo if it's for mobile. No other tech stacks regardless of what the project is. Example of when this irked me a little, this last week I had to implement AI into one of the projects to read and automate docs. I wanted to use OCR, and felt like having a simple fastAPI server would've been beneficial as there are many great python packages to handle exactly what I needed but I was told to do so with react, of which packages to handle pdfs were hard to come by and many didn't support OCR from pdfs on react. It would also be nice to use other stacks and see where they benefit.I have tried other companies but I don't have a degree and every response I get is that I either need a degree or a few years of professional experience and I honestly don't believe that I'm getting that kind of experience with my internship",

        "content": "Hey everyone!I’m a designer getting back into programming after a few years away, and I’m trying to set realistic expectations for myself.My goal: I would like to be able to code and deploy my own projects from scratch : portfolios, landing pages, dashboards, maybe even small e-commerce sites. I currently use Framer/Webflow, but I want to be more independent and expand both my creative and technical range.My background:* I know HTML/CSS well* I have JavaScript fundamentals (DOM manipulation, functions, event listeners, etc.).* I used to do a bit of PHP (mainly with WordPress).* I’ve done few Python scripts for myself and for my previous job (I completed Angela Yu’s Udemy Python course years ago).What I’ve lost (or never really mastered):* Good coding practices and project structure.* How to set up a proper development environment.* I barely remember Git, also I can’t make sense of most GitHub project architectures right now: there's too many files and code I can't read, how people understand it all?* APIs in Js, modern JavaScript frameworks (React, Next.js), Node.js, and deployment (Vercel, etc.)So my question to you all: How long do you think it would take to become fully operational again and to build complete, production-ready projects solo? I can have 2 hours/day for this. I started The Odin Project few years ago and I stopped at the beginning asynchronous Javascript. And in what order would you suggest I rebuild my skills?I’d really love to hear from people who’ve gone through a similar “designer-to-dev” path.Thanks in advance, any roadmap or personal experience would be super helpful!! :folded_hands:",

Tons of online courses kinda go too fast for audio-only learning, it seems, which is completely fair of course. Are there any videos or classes anywhere that have more of a vocabulary-based guide perhaps? I tend to visualize the spelling of words when spoken to me, so I think it can work. For example I imagine the audio would say something like: if you want to start a new paragraph, then you would type “less than symbol, P, and then greater then symbol” So it would be extremely annoying to learn visually for those of us wanting to learn via typing alongside the teacher. But for those rare few of us who’d like to get the ball rolling during a mind-numbing, dead end job by listening, it could be quite useful.",

I spend so much time at one single thing because it bothers me if I just learn it for the sake of memorizing it, and in turn, I fall into the loop of redoing the courses I already did.

Most of the job postings are in developing AI tools that won't be around a year or two from now when they inevitably flop. I'm sure there are companies out there that aren't buying into the AI hype or are just too small to necessitate them, but they seem few and far between.I'm realizing I have such an appreciation for the critical thinking and problem solving aspects of the career, but as it changes I'm falling out of love with what it is becoming. I feel like I'm on The Truman Show when having to listen to these AI-pilled people. What's your approach to dealing with this? I'd love to hear perspectives from my fellow anti-AI/skeptics. I'm not sure if I'm looking for a \"change my mind\" or \"you're not alone\" but I'd love any reassurance or suggestions.",

I have been preparing for 3 months, have interviewed for a bunch of companies but failed due to very tough calls, and I got a few left now, but interviews just keep getting harder and harder and there is too much variance on what can be asked. I prepare for leetcode, they ask OOP, I prepare for OOP, they ask a leetcode hard, I prepare for that, they ask me a Java FILE I/O question. Just an example of not knowing enough. I have 5 chances left after 4 fails in the past month, and im running out of time and funds, only got 20k left to my name at 28 after paying off all debt. I have the blessing to atleast move back home because I was raised in NY, but it's embarrassing tbh but my parents want me to as they being supportive.

Time flew by, and I got pigeonholed in outdated “dinosaur” companies.Trying to leave my job was incredibly demoralizing. Thousands of job applications and a painfully low callback rate. I was discouraged by this and even more, by my background and lack of modern systems experience. I posted here asking how long it takes to prep for system design interviews from 0.  Many replies were disheartening, like “you need real on-the-job experience.” But it turns out…you don’t—at least not to pass interviews. Here’s what I did while working full-time:LeetCode (6 months): Focused on the top 150 problems, revisiting and practicing each one 4-5 times. (I failed many, many interviews along the way).System Design (1.5 months): Started from almost zero and crammed, studying about 15 systems deeply, mainly through videos and practice.Applications: Sent out over a thousand applications with very low callback. Landed interviews mostly through headhunters. Interviews (6 months): Juggled my full-time job while going through processes with 45 companies (failing most of them early on).It was brutal: endless rejections, self-doubt, and burnout. But I just landed 2 solid offers in AI (around 250k+ TC).If you’re in a similar rut, know that it is absolutely doable with consistent effort. You can break free even without the “right” background.

It made me feel so small, like I was begging for attention or validation when all I wanted was some human decency.I’m still early in my career, just a fresh grad, and this was my first real job. I was one of the top performers on the team too, so getting laid off and then being treated like that felt like a slap in the face.I know I’ll bounce back eventually, but man… this experience gave me a real taste of how cold things can get in the professional world.Has anyone else gone through something similar after being laid off?

        "content": "I’m a junior software engineer (9 months in) at a Series B cybersecurity startup with around 60 people.Honestly, my experience here has been kind of bizarre, and I’m wondering if this is a normal experience.I’m in a small team that reports directly to the CEO: one senior engineer, me, and an intern. The CEO is technically our manager, but he’s basically a ghost. He gives no technical direction or help. When I ask for guidance, he just says, “Ask other engineers,” but they’re in completely different departments and have no idea what I’m working on. So we all just work in isolation on our own little projects. There’s no code review, no real communication, and QA is all manual.The CEO keeps saying that since we’re a small team, we have to be “extra vigilant” and document everything — but that’s about the extent of his input. The funny part is, on the rare occasions when he does try to manage us, he becomes super micromanagey, nitpicking tiny details and trying to control everything. It’s weird because 95% of the time he’s totally absent, and then suddenly he swings to the complete opposite extreme. Some days I literally have nothing to do because he doesn’t assign new tasks.There are times when I get completely blocked because I don’t have the resources or information I need. When I mentioned that to the CEO, he told me that I was “blaming others” and that I should be more proactive. There was also this one time during our monthly progress meeting when our senior engineer fell behind on something because she was waiting for an API from another department. The CEO got frustrated and the two started arguing each other for a good minute or so about it.My biggest concern is this: Most of the projects I’ve done are small — maybe 2,000 to 3,000 lines of code at most. They feel more like college projects than production systems, and I’m not sure if they’re even worth putting on my resume. Sure, I have learned a few things here and there — Docker/K8s, Nginx with PM2, VM provisioning, shell scripting, a bit of frontend deployment but I’m worried that I’m not getting enough solid experience to grow. I’ve been studying 2–3 hours every night and 5 hours on weekends just to make sure I don’t fall behind.Is this kind of situation normal for early-career engineers at startups?",

        "content": "I got an offer for a mid level developer role (same as my current role) via the only way you can find a new job in this market, aka a referral. Passed their tech interview and I got an offer, but the main hangup is the salary. They will likely not offer me any more than I'm already making. So I'm weighing between my current 2 choices, with their own pros and cons. Company A (Current company)- Currently making $115k. They've been decent about raises so far, so I'd expect to reach 120-125 within a year. - Java + spring backend, angular frontend. We're a big company, so we have a lot of structure and systems setup. Docker + kubernetes, deployment pipelines, etc. I prefer this stack since it seems like most companies in my area use java + spring. - I like my current team and manager. No conflicts, we get along well, and my manager is a tech guy so he understands what I do and how to support me. - Benefits are pretty great, huge 401k match and a lot of PTO. - The main downside is it's 5 days in office. Yeah, it sucks. It's a 30 min commute so it's not as bad as some others, but it's not great when we used to be 2 days in office before. This is the reason I'm looking elsewhere. Company B (Who sent the offer)- .NET/C# backend, React frontend, and a lot of SQL (we don't use SQL at company A). Mostly Microsoft based tech stack. - Would probably offer me 115k, but unlikely to see raises afterwards. - 4 days remote, 1 day in office, and the office is 5 minutes away. This is by far the biggest benefit. - The team seems good, but they're super small. They're down to 2 devs, the tech lead and another mid level developer. No indication on if they'll hire more. - They're not a startup, but they're midsized. Not as structured as company A, but also nowhere near the same amount of red tape.

        "content": "Back in the day when I mentioned CS and software dev I would get told how much money it made. After being a full time software dev for a fortune 500 company (not big tech) and making a little shy of 100k (65k take home) i have been struggling with personal finances. My mortgage and housing expenses is 40% of my budget, food is 20%, that doesn't leave much to even get ahead. I have a small 3 bed 1 bath in a poor neighborhood and I'm looking to move for a better school district and my budget is aimed at the worst houses in the market. My wife is disabled and a stay at home mom so I only have 1 income and I'm dealing with health issues myself that makes me not on top of my game.I studied hard 8 months last year for big tech jobs but when I went to apply I put in apps to all big tech companies I only got Amazon responding and I failed their initial screening due to it being a design problem rather than leetcode. Even tried applying to jobs that weren't big tech and don't get a call back.I could do a business or at least a micro saas for income but I have too much idea paralysis before starting. I could make anything with software and I make great full stack software but I don't have a GREAT idea for an undeserved market. I could specialize in a field in CS but I am a .NET/go dev with some full stack experience. I could go to a different field like cyber sec or data engineering but I don't know a good list of ones that pay more than software development. I am regarded as an up and comer in my organization and work well and hard, but I am underutilized and underpaid. They also don't have a lot of promotion cycles so I don't feel I'm getting promoted as quick as my skills. I should hit senior level within a year or so.TLDRJust feeling lost at the moment. I feel starting a business is the only way to get uncapped salary but get stuck with idea paralysis and undeserved markets. I studied hard at a good university and graduated magna cum laude but I just feel stuck like I learned all that for nothing. Not utilizing enough of my skills at work and not getting paid enough and no calls back from jobs. With 60% of my pay going to a small house and food (not to mention medical bills) its tough to get ahead.",

        "content": "It's a tough market out there, and unfortunately it's also one of the easiest places for honest folks to get duped. Honestly, getting a \"noreply\" is better than having your information sold and being contacted for the hundredth time by some random sales associate (usually speaking broken English with a generic pitch).That brings me to the subreddit in question. The first post I came across was this one: [Software Engineer - HTML/CSS/JS @ Apple | $120K–$210K | Paid Relocation](https://www.reddit.com/r/DevJobLeadsOnReddit/comments/1o1dgrx/software_engineer_htmlcssjs_apple_120k210k_paid/)It struck me as incredibly generic and out of touch. I left a comment for future readers because the post felt vague — basic HTML/CSS/JS skills, sky-high compensation, and no real details on location, employment type, or expectations. Most legitimate job postings include more concrete requirements. When they don’t, that’s usually a red flag.Out of curiosity, I reached out to one of the mods, who also claims to be the creator of the sub. While the conversation was polite, almost every question I asked was either dodged or brushed off. From what I could gather, they're scraping job listings from various sources, rewriting them into more digestible formats, and then notifying the companies afterward.When I asked if they had any process to clean up expired or inactive roles, how the employers are notified, or if they could post the sources for these scraped jobs, the conversation was cut short. Shortly after, I received a permanent ban from the subreddit. That, to me, is a bad sign.I wasn’t planning to apply through them anyway. I highly doubt Apple is scanning Reddit for job applicants based on comments and quick pitches. But I do care that people might be getting taken advantage of without realizing it.The job market is already stressful enough. The least we can do is call out shady practices when we see them.**TL;DR:** The subreddit r/DevJobLeadsOnReddit posted a sketchy-looking Apple job with vague requirements and high pay. I asked the mod some basic questions about sourcing and expired listings, got vague answers, and was banned shortly after. Feels like they're scraping jobs and repackaging them with little transparency. Be cautious, this looks more like a traffic funnel than a legit job board adjacent.",

We are both very skeptical of AI in general and both have been developers for almost 20 years each, but after a weekend of working with it he seems to have seen the light to the productivity boost. I have hit or miss experiences with AI, but never used it to vibe code. He spoke to a Microsoft Azure rep and they mentioned that AI is great for vibe coding greenfield stuff, but it doesn't work as well with established code. He is now in the process of using AI to take an existing C# .Net 4.8 MVC application to Blazor using Telerik controls to see the viable of using it to churn out new features faster.From reading this sub and Twitter, there seems to be a period where vibe coding with AI seems like magic where it seems to do everything perfectly the first time until it doesn't. So my question is what are other people's experiences and if and when the tables turned and you settled on using it only when it makes sense? Has anyone had success using it with an established code base where UI is in one project, classes another and then another for services?",

I have experience with java and spring, databases (SQL and non-sql), event systems like rabbitmq/Kafka, rest/graphql, docker, kubernetes, maven/gradle. These are most of the things I do on a day to day basis. Throw in testing (junit, mockito, testcontainers) and observability/tracing tools like kibana/datadog/grafana.But when I apply to positions I am asked all of the above and way more. Most jobs are listed as full stack, so they require experience with angular/react. Then they want cloud experience, which is very vague imo. Do they expect you to set up ec2 instances and manage load balancers? They also want DevOps experience, but that doesn't stop at k8s/docker, throw in some helm, terraform, setup clusters from scratch if possible.At the end of the day most of these positions seem like 3 or 4 people into 1. They want a backend engineer, a frontend one, a DevOps and sometimes even a tester/IT/infra.And I know those are wishlists but while applying and interviewing, I actually get asked about all these things and even get denied if I don't have experience with them. Is this the new normal? Am I just not versatile enough? The project I work on does not allow me to have experience with all these other things things, and I want to know if you would expect someone to know all of these when working.And to specify: I'm not applying to startups where I understand its more expected to be a one man team.",

My new manager was promoted and I was placed under him. My old one is skip manager. I was having lunch with my manager and he laughed when I said I was busy. Eventually in a meeting with him, he snaps at me and tells me to “think!”. I was scared and confused. Keep in mind that I have Autism and severe anxiety. Usually, I get moved to a new project every sprint and have to deliver on time or else. I didn’t really have anyone available to help if I needed them, just a few minutes of explanation on a good day. I was hesitant since I began asking for ADA 6 months prior. I decided to call again and got my ADA approved for 60 days for Autism. I told my manager that I had ASD and would experience memory lapses under enough anxiety. He told me, “you can over come it.” He glanced at the paper explaining my condition and didn’t keep it. 5 days later he puts me on pip and detailing poor code quality. I was shocked. He himself approved those PRs and no one else found issue with it. When I requested pip papers, he gave it to me a month later without the pages of code he showed me. My anxiety skyrocketed to a point where I took extra days off and time to recover from. He never talked to me like the others in the office, and left me out of many team meetings. He puts me on one project where I had to do big data work when my strength was backend. The POC I needed to sign off my work kept changing the solutioning for the data and my ASD brain went into overdrive to make sure I could grasp it. That took 4 weeks. I was struggling with my mental health and updated my mid year a little late. My manager only based my mid year on those 4 weeks only. Shortly after I got very ill and lost a loved one in an accident. My manager told me to compartmentalize. Day 60 into the 90 pip, I ask him for more work since I’ve completed the recent work on time. He told me, “I’m working hard to find you work.” He moved our 1:1 meeting to 4:30. Once I show up to the meeting he said that I showed little improvement and had security escort me out the office. I never saw or heard from HR once. No severance, just out on the street. The ADA expired weeks ago and I was going to reapply once I saw my doctor again. I don’t know what I did wrong. I pushed myself past 100% trying to do as he asked. I compartmentalized and dedicated most of my free time to rest until work the next morning. What did I do wrong? He asked me to quit my black employee resource group, I skipped time with family, and put in an extra few hours on some days to ensure perfect code. I don’t know what I did to disappoint them. My mind would shutdown from exhaustion, but I was on medication to push me past 100%. I’m at home now recovering before I seek my next job. It was my first tech job out of college 2 YOE.",

I have experience as a backend software engineer intern from 2023-24, and for a little over 6 months I've managed to get a part time position at a crappy small networking company that pays a measly $16 an hour, but it's at least good experience to put on a resume, and it's close to my house at least. I completely dropped applying for jobs ever since I got this current position because it genuinely just made me depressed every day, but with full time right around the corner and finding out full time genuinely is just worse in this pay with barely any pay bumps, I want to start looking for better software engineering positions out there. So here's my question: how do I start again? Here's where I am at right now. I already rebuilt my resume, updated my LinkedIn and GitHub to match my current experience, and I have a personal website I already included on my resume and attach on any application. My previous internship had be working on Backend JavaScript most of the time, and my current place utilizes php, python, and CRM development whenever I'm doing programming stuff. I really prefer C# and JavaScript. Admittedly I have not worked on a personal project in a long time, but I intend to work on some C# related projects soon. Where should I be looking for positions? Is it still LinkedIn, or is there a better option? Are there any programming languages that are high in demand right now that I should focus on instead? Should I use a different version of my resume each time I apply for anywhere? I've been out of the game for a while, and I know it's only gotten worse. I'm wondering what my next step should be now that I at least have something worth a damn to put on a resume, or if I should just abandon ship and use my experience for something adjacent. Any help would be appreciated",

Thousands of applications and only a small handful of interviews / calls have gone nowhere so they have amounted to a total waste of time.

I have more personal projects that aren't on my resume but they are not really something that I can put on my resume as they don't generate money, aren't complete projects and have no users and aren't particularly impressive in any way, so in effect I am not doing anything at all every day.[worse resume link](https://imgur.com/a/eUrbC84)Here's a version of my resume where I removed the non programming stuff, the imperfect GPA, the irrelevant degree, the skills not related to positions on the resume as well as the video game projects as they probably don't count as real projects. To me it just looks even worse in every way and there is zero chance I can get hired with it? Does this mean I am unhireable? It looks like I didn't get anything for the past few years and thus I am a terrible employee that nobody should ever hire. There's also way too much white space because there is nothing more to say about each position that isn't just restating the same things over and over or saying extremely basic stuff (like they don't need to know the exact random libraries I used and it probably would look bad on me for talking about those? I also heard that me talking about something as basic as ajax requests is also bad?)[more complete resume link](https://imgur.com/a/iaYDKYg)Even with the more complete resume it still feels very terrible in terms of me competing with other people (I feel like maybe the bar for entry level is having several years of highly relevant non internship experience which I'm never going to get if I don't get a job). Adding in the skills for each position also breaks it when I put it into Workday so I have to get rid of them? It doesn't matter if it looks better to a human recruiter if the system parses it so badly I get trashed immediately so I should remove them?I just don't know at all what I should be doing to get a job? I haven't been working on \"real\" projects because I don't know how to make those (a project isn't real unless it's generating money and/or has a ton of users?). I know there is a definitive thing I should be doing but I don't know what it is? No amount of \"just do it\" is going to help me find that correct answer, I can't \"just make a game\" like my parents want because that is something that requires years of (non programming) work to make something profitable, and even then companies don't even see video game projects as real projects so all that effort would not help me even slightly?",

However, the preferred qualifications say they prefer someone with 3 years in embedded.I don't have hands on experience in embedded so I was wondering if this is the wrong role for me?

Some roles I've been applying to include the usual Software Engineer / Developer roles of all stacks, Data Scientist, Data Analyst and the few database-specific roles that pop up, and even QA, Business Analyst, and various IT roles (that I'm probably woefully unqualified for anyways since I have 0 IT experience).Let's say the absolute worst happens, and no company hires me for any role between now and my graduation this coming May. In that case, I'd be forced to either become a NEET (and maybe even officially register for some form of unemployment), or (slightly less undesirably) end up in some retail or service job - something that doesn't require a CS degree - just to have *some* work.**What's the likelihood I'd end up in this situation? And if I do, what's the likelihood I'd ever be able to escape?**Now obviously, that's a pretty terrible fate to end up in long-term. So I think I'd need some form of \"game plan\". I've already worked some of these before as a student, and some of my older coworkers there have been \"failed\" students in non-CS STEM fields.And since I wouldn't want to work there forever, I'd likely still be applying to \"real\" jobs on the side, and maybe even landing a few interviews if I'm fortunate, but things might not improve, and could even worsen. This current \"employer's market\" might last for a while (I heard for civil engineering it took nearly an entire decade), and unfortunately, it's possible my skills and degree could risk atrophying in the meantime. And this could kill my motivation to do LeetCode / side projects, etc.And what the hell are you even supposed to tell the hiring team if you do get an interview for a tech position? \"I couldn't find work out of college so I had to work at the local grocery store / restaurant\"? How are you going to convince the hiring managers to consider you over some other cracked junior who has *not* needed to resort to menial labor in order to make ends meet or prevent a career gap?At what point should I simply admit defeat? At what point do I seriously consider reskilling into non-tech roles? (I'm already having trouble with even \"adjacent\" roles like DA and BA.) Which non-tech roles, even? I don't think I'd be able to break into law, medicine, nursing, or most trades, and even if I could, I don't think I'd have the requisite interest.For the sake of discussion, my definition of \"winning\" would be to have enough money to move out of my parents' house in the suburbs and rent an apartment somewhere major enough for me to have a satisfactory social and romantic life. Doesn't have to be 6 figs, FAANG, or even a SWE role at all. Don't even have to actually do it, just have to *make enough money to do it*, and if the job is really local I could just spend ~1-2 extra years at home and save the earnings to be frugal.You cannot do this by stocking shelves or flipping burgers for $15/hour. And if I'm forced to care for ailing parents on that salary while their home - the home I grew up in - goes to rot, then oh boy, things are *not* going to be pretty.",

But the last few months have been chaos. Management’s scrambling, people are quitting or quietly transferring, and entire projects are collapsing faster than they can be reassigned.Half the people I used to rely on have left, and now I’m basically maintaining random fragments of systems that no one else touches. There’s no mentorship, no technical challenge, and definitely no direction. Every day feels like “keep the lights on” mode.The thing is — I’m not overworked. I’m **understimulated.** The job’s too easy, the pay’s on the low side, and the feeling of stagnation is eating me alive. I used to love coding — building stuff, solving problems, learning new tech — now I just click through Jira tickets and slowly detach a bit more each week.I’ve thought about quitting a hundred times. I’ve even enrolled in a part-time Master’s starting next year as a soft reset — not because I need the degree, but because I need structure and a sense of progress again.But with Christmas coming up and everything slowing down, part of me thinks, *“just coast through the holidays, collect the chill paycheck, maybe even get a promo before you dip.”*Then another part of me goes, *“why am I still trying to climb a ladder I don’t even want to be on?”*I know a lot of people here are probably going through their own flavor of career existentialism — either can’t find the perfect job, can’t get one at all, or are stuck in something that’s fine on paper but quietly soul-draining. I just want to hear from anyone who’s in this same weird spot.How did you break out of the comfort trap early in your career? Did you quit cold, coast strategically, go back to study, or just wait until the burnout made the choice for you?",

        "content": "I’m from Southeast Asia, but I moved to Germany when I was barely 19 to attend college, and later university, where I studied Computer Science. Over time, maybe because of COVID and everything else in life, my mental health declined a lot.I still love Computer Science, it’s one of the few things that has kept me going. But exams have always been my Achilles’ heel. Now, I have to fly back to my home country without a degree because of my university situation, visa issues, health, and safety from my own mental health.I’m wondering if anyone has any recommendations for what I should do next. I’m interested in web development, but lately I’ve also become more drawn to cybersecurity. I just don’t know where to start once I’m back home. My country is still quite conservative about degrees (I think), and honestly, I’m really scared.Aside from freelancing on Upwork, does anyone have ideas on how to survive, what kind of business or freelance work could actually be sustainable or beneficial? I really want to repay my parents for everything they’ve done for me over the last eight years, but I don’t know how or where to begin.Thank you so much for any advice. Please, only comment if you have something genuinely helpful. I already have enough hate in my own head, thank you.",

I brought these concerns up to my manager and team lead, and they agreed I could work on the product in the meantime. However, the ones leading development refuse to break out work into workable portions and insist on mobbing or working on the code themself. I don't know why they do this, but it leaves me either DM'ing them constantly asking for work to do, or filling my time with random tasks that no one wants to touch.On the bright side, I've learned a lot about containerization, deployment, and CI/CD configurations.I'm feeling disgruntled and feel like I can't take ownership of a piece of the product.

Even though I’m in second year, I feel stuck, behind, and frustrated. Sometimes I feel embarrassed seeing my classmates move ahead while I feel like I can’t keep up.I enjoy programming and creating things, but lately it’s been hard to maintain the pace. I’m receiving psychological and psychiatric treatment, but I don’t want to use that as an excuse. I just feel exhausted.If I continue in my current program, it would probably take me about 2.5 more years if everything goes perfectly, which honestly seems unlikely.If I switch universities, I would likely have to start almost from scratch (3.5 more years).And if I quit completely, I’m afraid of being directionless and feeling even more stuck.What worries me the most is the future:I want to work in technology, grow into leadership or managerial roles, and eventually emigrate. But I don’t know if I absolutely need a university degree for that, or if I could build that path through technical certifications and work experience. However, I have this thought that without a degree I won’t be “anyone.”In summary:•I feel emotionally drained and frustrated.•I don’t want to keep spending money if I’m not making progress.•I also don’t want to give up without thinking it through; I’ve already made too many bad decisions.Has anyone been through something similar?Is it worth continuing the university route, or is it better to try something else?Any honest opinions or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated.Thanks for reading.",

They told me everything is covered from rental to flight to hotel.I am in the middle of booking everything now and should I be worried about spending too much? Right now I'm at like $250 for flight, $126 a night for hotel, and then like $200-$300 for rental. They also said meals would be covered by idk how. I know I don't owe the company but I'm not the only one they're flying out so I also don't want to ruin my chances if I overdo it and I'm seen as too much of a hassle to have come in.Also any tips for things like these? I will be spending an evening with them so are there specific things I should watch out for or remember? Update: Thanks everyone for the help! The best advice was just asking them because I found out that the admin person organizing everything screwed up some details. The only thing I'm even responsible for is flight and apparently they take care of everything else. I should have just asked first but I got nervous trying to get everything in order because my original date for the interview was pushed up sooner. But it's all good now and I feel much more relaxed lol They are taking care of everything",

Some context: at Amazon I’m on an important team, starting to think about promotion, but manager recently moved so that’s been delayed and harder without him. Probably 6-12 months to L5 (what my L6 said) and salary goes up around 20%. Working 10-6, sometimes 7. Pretty chill wlb and good team. Not many perks. Lots of responsibilities and big projects with large impact.I definitely have a short term life goal of moving away from London for a few years while I am young. in a year after my promo I can move to the US on L1 visa, idk how feasible it is to get a good transfer internationally tho.Got an offer from a pretty big startup, it’s remote first but has offices in a few places, spoke to some engineers and they are working 9-7 so about 2 more per day. Salary around 30% more than Zon, take home post tax is 5.1k, vs 4k atm. Even after promo I’ll be only be on about 4.5k. It’s an exciting AI company, very interesting fast paced work.So here’s the decision-making part… I’d make more, moving now, than I would even after a promo here. At the startup, we would report to a tech lead who reports to the CTO; it’s fast-paced and high ownership (so is Amazon, tbf). I think I’ll have a lot of responsibilities, not treated like an L4, and I think it will supercharge my growth.My main concerns: is being a digital nomad at 22 weird? Idk how I feel about it for career growth, but I love travelling, so I’d be excited! But I might be more excited about the USA move (even though it’s two years away, I’d be 24). I’m not sure how easy it is, and I’m not sure if I’d have the same opportunity to move if I was in the startup.What would you guys do? Idk. Anything I’m not considering? The way I’m thinking about is - I’m 22, most of my peers are still unemployed and I am in a very fortunate position. Unsure if I’m rushing into a job switch too fast.",

I told him I would need to think about it and we agreed to talk tomorrow.I make pretty good money already so, obviously even double is a lot of money. However, I'm not a fan of the owners and feel there is little job security there. But, short term I would gain a lot of money quickly. Without lifestyle changes I could easily save/invest an extra £2000 a month.On the other side is the defence company and the stability that brings. I get to work on cool stuff and have a solid engineering company on my cv. It's much more of a long term investment, however, my salary remains the same (with some great benefits) but my rent essentially doubles and cost of living also increases because I have to relocate for it.So, boil it down to big money at a start up that's pretty much run on vibes and feelings or less money at a big corp but a much more solid career track?",

        "author": "LiveMathematician892",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So, I keep getting an excellent feedback about my technical ability, yet, I get shit about my soft skills. The thing is, they won't tell what's the actual problem. All I hear are \"oh, you don't like small talk much\" or \"You're rude and not diplomatic enough\".How I would describe myself:1) I indeed don't like small talk, I know more or less how it works, I just find it annoying and sort of pointless. I know that's how you can create a relationship and such... But I see those guys, at best, 2 times within a year when the team gets of remote, why would anyone care about that? I'm, like all of them, there for the money and thats that... It will read \"machiavelistic\", assholish or something like that but for the last decade give or take the only relationships I built, or tried to build, was with people where I saw something that I could gain from. It was either people who were smarter than me, people with connections or information that I wanted (although sometimes I think there was misjudgement and I was thinking about getting laid, or at best it was connection of both). This kind of worked and let me get my foot in the door, despite many shortcoming on my end at the time. The issue is, these people are out of the picture, atm way too often I do feel like I'm the smartest person in the room, or, at the very least, knowing the smarter person won't get me anywhere, feel like it's just a matter of a workplace. It ain't Google, Microsoft or anything of the kind, its just some run of the mill company pushing out overengineered, slow, unmaintainable code. Wasnt it for the bad market and my decent pay (Ill have hard time finding a job where Ill get a payrise significant enough to risk a job change in this market. These people won't get me anywhere other than up the ladder in the company, but even so, I rarely get to interact with people other than a lead of my project whos a bit of a pushover. I mean, I don't see any other solution to the issue than reprogamming myself (how???) to attempt building relationships with anyone, not just someone I want to bang or where I feel like there is a clear benefit to gain from them. Only person that I feel like I really somewhat connected at the firm is a tester designated to my project who hates and trashtalks it about as much as I do, that made us have something in common...2) I'm the kind of guy that leaves a lot of comments under PRs. I get a cred for it, at the very least from upper management. It's not about the extra spaces or formatting, although at extreme cases I'll point that out, I just hate mess or the \"iterative development\" where lack of code review lets very obvious bugs get to the repo, hinder development and generate more work (more PRs). Most people at my company don't do the review, but were getting back to 1) here - most people at my firm are just bad/very average devs (or at the very least lack ambition or are burned out).3) I tend to be \"judgemental\" or \"rude\". This is coming from me sometimes pointing out someone did a poor job (overengineer a feature, create a poorly worded ticket etc.) without beating around the bush. The thing is, I'm not completely f-ed in the head, I don't do that from day one, the frustation really needs to reach the boiling point where the same thing happens a number of times. But you know what sucks about it, that I give a shit about being \"rude\" or \"judgemental\"? When I tried being nice, giving \"constructive criticism\" at retros, vaguely pointing out things that could be improved... Nothing f happened. You know the routine, theres action point, theres fake action to handle it, then maybe there is a call on what to do, and then somewhat checks the issue as resolved and we move on. Only by expressing my frustation over a longer period, so it was finally escalated to a person that gives a damn, my points that I gave several figureheads finally started to be taken seriously, I made an impact. At the end of the day, the person that matters, sees it as a double edged sword (or something like that) - this dude cares about this project and this company, but hes a douchebag/cant get his point across via diplomatic means.TLDR: I dont know how to force myself to small talk / building relationships that I find \"pointless\" i.e. without easy to spot value and don't know how to communicate issues/suggest improvements (it feels like at my current firm I need to break the chain of command and go the highest person immediately)",

Currently, I'm loving the job, although there's obviously learning curves to overcome each day. I've had positive reviews so far and my responsibilities do continue to grow so I think I'm keeping up with the pace well.That being said, the company I work at is a big global company, so the teams are quite specialized. My team in particular is all-things reliability, but I feel like I need to expand my skillsets. I rarely have the chance to work with k8s, docker, terraform, AWS/GCP, istio, and all those stuff in the DevOps & Infra side of things and part of me feels like I should in order to keep more career options open. My question is, can I do that outside of my actual work? In other words is it possible to get (hire-able) working knowledge & skills of these technologies through independent side projects, self-study & certifications supplemented with only SRE work experience (mainly dealing with observability, load testing, launch readiness testing, DR, etc).On one hand I know I had these exact concerns when I first pivoted, but I feel like having junior level expectations was very different.",

Ever since middle school, I have decided I wanted to pursue computer science and since the ending of last year, I have decided I want to major in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and minor in cybersecurity. However, anytime I tell someone I want to major in computer science I get negative comments such as “that’s unemployment “ or “AI is going to take over that field” and that is just making me overthink and second guess what I want to do. I feel like majority of those people simply don’t know exactly what computer science is though and they have no idea what they are talking about but it still has me concerned. So my question to everyone on here is (if you are taking comp sci right now or particularly those who already have a career in the field) should I still pursue this field? Is it worth it? What exactly do you do? Do I have anything to worry about?",

Going to dev felt like the most natural progession but even in dev you have software devs, devops, qa, data analysts etc.I am so lost on what I should follow and what path to take I went with backend because it just seemed like the most natural development from a cs degree and the most interesting one I could find but I've also realised that actually interesting tech jobs that work with all the things I found interesting in my degree such as algorithms, complex multithreading, data structure, machine learning, memory management etc are not really looking for juniors which I understand but I eventually I would love to actually work in a more interesting project.Do I just have to accept the reality that backend software dev is the most interesting job I will land and just keep at it? Should I stay for sometime until I land something interesting in security for example? Should I switch to devops as soon as I find an opening? I am very lost.",
