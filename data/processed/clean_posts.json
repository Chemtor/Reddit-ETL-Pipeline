Anything with \"Master blah Mgmt\" w/r/t Modern Data ecosystems overall is probably dead just out of sheer organizational malaise, politics, bureaucracy and PMO styles of trying to \"get everyone on board\" with such a concept, at large.3. Even if you bought a tool and did MDM well - on core entities of your firm (customer, product, region, store, etc..) - I doubt IT/business leaders would dedicated the labor discipline to keeping it up. It would become a key-join nightmare at some point.4. Do \"MDM\" at the source. E.g. all customers come from CRM. use the account\\_key and be done with it.

What annoys me are not the posts themselves, but the culture and the companies making believe that all this is necessary. So i feel like people need to manage their expectations. In themselves and in the companies they work for. The following are OPINIONS of mine that help me to check in with myself.1. You are not the company and the company is not you. If they want you to use a new tool, they need to provide PAID time for you to learn the tool.2. Don't do personal projects (unless you REALLY enjoy it). It just takes time you could have spend doing literally anything else. Personal projects will not prepare you for the real thing because the data isn't as messy, the business is not as annoying and you want have to deal with coworkers breaking production pipelines. 3. Nobody cares about certifications. If I have to do a certification, I want to be paid for it and not pay for it.4. Life over work. Always.5. Don't beat yourself up, if you don't know something. It's fine. Try it out and fail. Try again. (During work hours of course)Don't get me wrong, i read stuff in my offtime as well and i am in this reddit. But i only as long I enjoy it.

I recently implemented this type in e6data's query engine and I realized that resources on the implementation details are scarce. The parquet variant spec is great, but it's quite dense and it takes a few reads to build a mental model of variant's binary format.This blog is an attempt to explain why variant is so much faster than JSON strings (Databricks says it's 8x faster on their engine).

        "content": "Hey everyone,I’m a data engineer with about 1 year of experience working in a 7 persons' BI team, and I’m the only data engineer there.Recently I realized I’ve been working extra hours for free. I deployed a local Git server, maintain and own the DB instance that hosts our DWH, re-implemented and redesigned Python dashboards because the old implementation was slow and useless, deployed some infrastructure for data engineering workloads, developed cli frameworks to cut-off manual work and code redundancy, and harmonized inconsistent sources to produce accurate insights (they used to just dump Excel files and DB tables into SSIS, which generated wrong numbers) all locally.Last Thursday, we got a request with a deadline on Sunday, even though Friday and Saturday are our weekend (I’m in Egypt, and my team is currently working from home to deliver it, for free).At first, I didn’t mind because I wanted to deliver and learn, but now I’m getting frustrated. I barely have time to rest, let alone learn new things that could actually help me grow (technically or financially).Unpaid overtime is normalized here, and changing companies locally won’t fix that. So I’ve started thinking about moving to Europe, but I’m not sure I’m ready for such a competitive market since everything we do is on-prem and I’ve never touched cloud platforms.Another issue: I feel like the only technical person in the office. When I talk about software design, abstraction, or maintainability, nobody really gets it. They just think I’m “going fancy,” which leaves me on-call. One time, I recommended loading all our sources into a 3rd normal form schema as a single source of truth, because the same piece of information was scattered across multiple systems and needed tracking, enforcement, and auditing before hitting our Kimball DWH. They looked at me like I was a nerd trying to create extra work.I’m honestly feeling trapped.Should I keep grinding, or start planning my exit to a better environment (like Europe or remote)?Any advice from people who’ve been through this?",

I always wanted to work in a data engineering project and recently i got an opportunity to work on a project which seem to be exciting with GenAI & Python stuff. My role here is to develop python scripts to integrate multiple sources and LLM outputs and package everything into a solution. I designed a config driven ETL code using python and wrote multiple classes to package everything into a single codebase. I used LLM chats to optimise my code. Due to very tight deadlines I had to rush the development without realising the whole thing would turn into a nightmare. I have tried my best to follow the coding standards but the client is very upset about few parts of the design. A couple of days ago, I had a code review meeting with my client team where I had to walk through my code and answer questions inorder to get the approval for QA. The client team had an architect level manager who had already gone through the repository and had a lot of valid questions about the design flaws in the code. I felt very embarrassed during the meeting and it was a very awkward conversation. Everytime he had pointed out something wrong, I had no answers to it and there was silence for about half a minute before I say \" Ok I can implement that\". I know it is my fault that I didn't have enough knowledge about designing data systems but I'm worried more about tarnishing my companies' reputation by providing a low quality deliverable. I just wanted to rant about how disappointed I feel about myself. Have you ever been in a situation like this?",

My friend has a startup and they had a need to display some data so I offered him that I could build something for them.The idea was to use Superset, since that's what one of their analysts has used before. Superset seems to also have at least some kind of support for Ducklake, so I wanted to try that as well.So I set up an EC2 where I pull a git repo and then spin up few docker compose services. First service is postgres that acts as a metadata for both Superset and Ducklake. Then Superset service spins up nginx and gunicorn that run the BI layer.Actual ETL can be done anywhere on the EC2 (or Lambdas if you will) but basically I'm just pulling data from open source API's, doing a bit of transformation and then pushing the data to Ducklake. Storage is S3 and Ducklake handles the parquet files there.Superset has access to the Ducklake metadata DB and therefore is able to access the data on S3.To my surprise, this is working quite nicely. The only issue seems to be how Superset displays the schema of the Ducklake, as it shows all the secrets of the connection URI (:I don't want to publish the git repo as it's not very polished, but I just wanted to maybe raise discussion if anyone else has tried something similar before?This sure was refreshing and different than my day to day job with big data.And if anyone has any questions regarding setting this up, I'm more than happy to help!",

For those managing dev, staging, or analytics environments, how much of your week goes to this stuff vs actual engineering work? And has this got worse with AI projects? Feels like legacy data issues that teams ignored for years are suddenly critical because AI needs properly structured, clean data. Curious what your reality looks like.

From there so far so good.In dbt, our source points only to the latest file.Then we have an incremental model that:Apply business logic , detected updated columns, build history columns (valid from valid to etc)My issue: our history is only inside an incremental model , we can’t do full refresh. The pipeline is not reproducibleMy proposal: add a raw table in between the data lake and dbt But received some pushback form business: 1. We will never do a full refresh 2. If we ever do, we can just restore the db backup 3. You will increase dramatically the storage on the db 4. If we lose the lake or the db, it’s the same thing anyway 5. We already have the data lake to need everything How can I frame my argument to the business ? It’s a huge company with tons of business people watching the project burocracy etc.EDIT: my idea to create another table will be have a “bronze layer” raw layer whatever you want to call it to store all the parquet data, at is a snapshot , add a date column. With this I can reproduce the whole dbt project",

        "author": "Nightwyrm",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "As part of a wider move towards data products as well as building better controls into our pipelines, we’re looking at how we can implement data contracts as code. I’ve done a number of proof of concepts across various options and currently the Open Data Contract Specification alongside datacontract-cli is looking good. However, while I see how it can work well with “frozen” contracts, I start getting lost on how to allow schema evolution. Our typical scenarios for Python-based data ingestion pipelines are all batch-based, consisting of files being pushed to us or our pulling from database tables. Our ingestion pattern is to take the producer dataset, write it to parquet for performant operations, and then validate it with schema and quality checks. The write to parquet (with PyArrow’s ParquetWriter) should include the contract schema to enforce the agreed or known datatypes. However, with dynamic schema evolution, you ideally need to capture the schema of the dataset to be able to compare it to your current contract state to alert for breaking changes etc. Contract-first formats like ODCS take a bit of work to define, plus you may have zero-padded numbers defined as varchar in the source data you want to preserve, so inferring that schema for comparison becomes challenging. I’ve gone down quite a rabbit hole now and am likely overcooking it, but my current thinking is to write all dataset fields to parquet as string, validate the data formats are as expected, and then subsequent pipeline steps can be more flexible with inferred schemas. I think I can even see a way to integrate this with dlt. How do others approach this?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I've been working on a gradient boosting implementation that handles two problems I kept running into with XGBoost/LightGBM in production:1. **Performance collapse on extreme imbalance (under 1% positive class)**2. **Silent degradation when data drifts (sensor drift, behavior changes, etc.)**Key ResultsImbalanced data (Credit Card Fraud - 0.2% positives):**- PKBoost: 87.8% PR-AUC****- LightGBM: 79.3% PR-AUC****- XGBoost: 74.5% PR-AUC**Under realistic drift (gradual covariate shift):\\- PKBoost: 86.2% PR-AUC (−2.0% degradation)\\- XGBoost: 50.8% PR-AUC (−31.8% degradation)\\- LightGBM: 45.6% PR-AUC (−42.5% degradation) **What's Different**The main innovation is using Shannon entropy in the split criterion alongside gradients. Each split maximizes:Gain = GradientGain + λ·InformationGainwhere λ adapts based on class imbalance. This explicitly optimizes for information gain on the minority class instead of just minimizing loss.Combined with:\\- Quantile-based binning (robust to scale shifts)\\- Conservative regularization (prevents overfitting to majority)\\- PR-AUC early stopping (focuses on minority performance)The architecture is inherently more robust to drift without needing online adaptation. Trade-offsThe good:\\- Auto-tunes for your data (no hyperparameter search needed)\\- Works out-of-the-box on extreme imbalance\\- Comparable inference speed to XGBoostThe honest:\\- \\~2-4x slower training (45s vs 12s on 170K samples)\\- Slightly behind on balanced data (use XGBoost there)\\- Built in Rust, so less Python ecosystem integration Why I'm SharingThis started as a learning project (built from scratch in Rust), but the drift resilience results surprised me. I haven't seen many papers addressing this - most focus on online learning or explicit drift detection.Looking for feedback on:\\- Have others seen similar robustness from conservative regularization?\\- Are there existing techniques that achieve this without retraining?\\- Would this be useful for production systems, or is 2-4x slower training a dealbreaker? Links\\- GitHub: [https://github.com/Pushp-Kharat1/pkboost](https://github.com/Pushp-Kharat1/pkboost)\\- Benchmarks include: Credit Card Fraud, Pima Diabetes, Breast Cancer, Ionosphere\\- MIT licensed, \\~4000 lines of RustHappy to answer questions about the implementation or share more detailed results. Also open to PRs if anyone wants to extend it (multi-class support would be great).\\---**Edit**: Built this on a 4-core Ryzen 3 laptop with 8GB RAM, so the benchmarks should be reproducible on any hardware.",

But the issue that I first struck was that the amount of data downloaded was too large and crashed the notebook because my F2 ran out of memory (understandable for 10GB files). Therefore, I want to download the files and store them temporarily, upload them to Google Drive and then remove them.First, I tried to download them to a lakehouse, but I then understood that removing files in Lakehouse is only a soft-delete and that it still stores it for 7 days, and I want to avoid being billed for all those GBs...So, to my question. ChatGPT proposed that I download the files into a folder like \"/tmp/\\*filename.csv\\*\", and supposedly when I do that I use the ephemeral memory created when running the notebook, and then the files will be automatically removed when the notebook is finished running.The solution works and I cannot see the files in my lakehouse, so from my point of view the solution works. BUT, I cannot find any documentation of using this method, so I am curious as to how this really works? Have any of you used this method before? Are the files really deleted after the notebook finishes? Is there any better way of doing this? Thankful for any answers!",

        "author": "Mysterious-Sky5410",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone, I’ve been working at a WITCH company for about a year now, as a Data Engineer. I’ve been in the same project throughout, where I mainly handle support tasks— documentation, debugging, adding columns, updating views, ensuring data flow, and just ensuring everything runs smoothly. Essentially, I’m not involved in any real development work like building pipelines or writing scripts.I’ve seen a lot of posts about people in similar situations, like the one here [Need career advice – Am I a Data Engineer?](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineersindia/comments/1nf3h0u/need_career_advice_am_i_a_data_engineer_how_do_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) , and it feels like I’m in the same boat. The problem is, I’ve been stuck in this role for a year, and I honestly feel like if I stay for another year or two, I won’t learn anything new. I’ve been trying to switch jobs and have been applying for the last 3-4 months, but most of the time, I don’t even make it past the shortlisting stage. I don’t blame the companies, to be honest—I just don’t have anything unique to show in my experience section. I’ve worked on some personal projects, but that’s about it.Another challenge is the 90-day notice period. It’s hard to move quickly when companies need immediate joiners, so I feel stuck in that regard too.I see two possible options right now:Ask to be released from my current project: But this is tricky. I’m not sure if they’ll even let me go (seniors have told that release is not provided easily), and if I do get released, I’m worried the next project might be even worse. Plus, I don’t know how long I’d be able to stay on the bench, and that’s also not ideal.Resign and serve the notice period quietly: This comes with its own set of risks, mainly the uncertainty of not having a job while I keep applying. The idea of not having a stable income while job hunting scares me.So, I guess I’m at a crossroads. Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you navigate it? Any advice on how I should proceed from here? I don't want to be stuck here in this swamp in the early stages of my career as it will also affect my future career path. I have been making few more personal projects to add but I still don't think that will be enough.Appreciate any insights or suggestions!TL/DR : I’ve been working as a Data Engineer in a WITCH company for a year, mostly handling support tasks with no real development experience. I’ve been trying to switch jobs for 3-4 months but keep getting rejected. I’m stuck with a 90-day notice period and feel like I’m not learning anything new. Should I ask to be released from my project (with no guarantee of better work) or resign and serve the notice period while job hunting (despite the risk of unemployment)?",

I am married so I would get benefits through my spouse. Really nice people but don’t love the DE team as much. Business team is great. 2. Big pharma/med device company in chi. This is only 100k but great benefits package. It is also closer to family and would be good for long term family planning. I actually really love the team and they’re going to do a full overhaul and go into cloud and I would love to be part of it from the ground up experience. In a way I am definitely breaking into the industry. My consulting gigs didn’t give me enough experience and I’m shy when I even refer to myself as a DE.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello everyone,I am a beginner data engineer (~1 yoe in DE), we have built a python ingestion framework that does the following:1. Fetches data in chunks from RDS table2. Loads dataframes to Snowflake tables using put stream to SF stage and COPY INTO.Config for each source table in RDS, target table in Snowflake, filters to apply etc are maintained in a snowflake table which is fetched before each Ingestion Job.These ingestion jobs need to run on a schedule, therefore we created cronjobs on an on-prem VM (yes, 1 VM) that triggers the python ingestion script (daily, weekly, monthly for different source tables).We are moving to EKS by containerizing the ingestion code and using Kubernetes Cronjobs to achieve the same behaviour as earlier (cronjobs in VM). There are other options like Glue, Spark etc but client wants EKS, so we went with it. Our team is also pretty new, so we lack experience to say \"Hey, instead of EKS, use this\". The ingestion module is just a bunch of python scripts with some classes and functions. How much can performance be improved if I follow a worker pattern where workers pull from a job queue (AWS SQS?) and do just plain extract and load from rds to snowflake. The workers can be deployed as a kubernetes deployment with scalable replicas of workers. A master pod/deployment can handle orchestration of job queue (adding, removing, tracking ingestion jobs).I beleive this approach can scale well compared to Cronjobs approach where each pod that handles ingestion job can only have access to finite resources enforced by resources.limits.cpu and mem.Please give me your suggestions regarding the current approach and new design idea. Feel free to ridicule, mock, destroy my ideas. As a beginner DE i want to learn best practices when it comes to data ingestion particularly at scale. At what point do i decide to switch from existing to a better pattern?Thanks in advance!!!",

The current day's transactions are transformed through DBT, to generate 12 marts, helping in anomaly detection and system monitoring A Great Expectation + Python layer takes care of data quality and Anomaly detectionFinally for visualization and ease of discussion I'm generating a streamlit dashboard from above 12 marts.Main concerns/questions:1. Since this is just inspired by my current work (I didn’t use real table names/logic, just the concept), should I be worried about IP/overlap ?2. I’ve done a barebones version of this in shell+SQL, so I personally know business and technical requirements and possible issues in this project, it feels really straightforward. Do you think this is a solid enough project to showcase for DE roles at product-based-companies / fintechs (0–3 YOE range)?3. Thoughts on using synthetic data? I’ve tried to make it noisy and realistic, but since I’ll always have control, I feel like I'm missing something critical that only shows up in real-world messy data?Would love any outside perspectiveThis would ideally be the portfolio project, and there's one more planned using spark where I'm just cleaning and merging Spotify datasets from different types (CSV, json, sqlite, parquet etc) from Kaggle, it's just a practice project to showcase spark understanding. **TLDR:** Built a synthetic transaction pipeline (750k+ txns, 3.75M steps, anomaly injection, DBT marts, cold storage). Looking for feedback on:* IP concerns (inspired by work but no copied code/keywords)* Whether it’s a strong enough DE project for Product Based Companies and Fintech. * Pros/cons of using synthetic vs real-world messy data",

The transformation in the pipeline is just as simple as select one huge table, do broadcast joins with a couple small tables (I have made sure all joins are done as \\`BroadcastHashJoin\\`), and then project the DataFrame into multiple output legs.I had a few assumptions that turns out to be plain wrong, and this mistake really f\\*\\*ks up the performance.**Assumption 1:** I thought Spark will scan the table once, and just read it from cache for each of the projections. Turns out, Spark compiles the CTE into inline query and read the table thrice.**Assumption 2**: Because Spark read the table three times, and because Delta doesn't support bucketization, Spark distributes the partition for each projection leg without guarantee that rows that share the same \\`date\\` will end up in the same worker. The consequence of this is a massive shuffling at the end before writing the output to Delta, and this shuffle really kills the performance.I have been thinking about alternative solutions that involve switching stack/tools, e.g. use pySpark for a fine-grained control, or switch to vanilla Parquet to leverage the bucketization feature, but those options are not practical. Do you guys have any idea to satisfy the above two requirements: (a) scan table once, and (b) ensure partitions are distributed consistently to avoid any shuffling.",

As far as how his environment is actually put together and communicating all I know is that he uses zookeeper for his nifi cluster and it’s on the cloud (Azure). There is no one who knows anything more than that. No one in IT. Not his boss. Not his one employee. No one knows and his reason is that he doesn’t trust anyone and they aren’t good enough, not even his employee.The discussion. Have you dealt with such a person? How has your org dealt with people gatekeeping like this? From my perspective this is a massive problem and basically means that this guy is a massive walking pile of technical debt. If he leaves then the clean up and troubleshooting to figure out what he did would be immense. On top of that he now has suggested taking over smaller DE processes from other outside IT as a play to “centralize” data engineering work. He won’t let them migrate their stuff to his environment as again he doesn’t rust them to be good enough and doesn’t want to teach them how to use his environment. So he is just safe guarding his job really and taking away others jobs in my opinion. I also recently got some people in IT to approve me setting up Airflow outside of IT and to do data engineering (which I was already doing but just with cron). He has thrown some shots at me but I ignored him because I’m trying to set something up for other people to use to and document it so that it can be maintained should I leave.TLDR have you dealt with people gatekeeping knowledge and what happened to them?",

        "author": "fabkosta",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Recently I have been contemplating the idea of a \"data ontology\" on top of Apache Iceberg. The idea is that within a domain you can change data schema in any way you intend using default Apache Iceberg functionality. However, when you publish a data product such that it can be consumed by other data domains then the schema of your data product is frozen, and there is some technical enforcement of the data schema such that the upstream provider domain cannot simply break the schema of the data product thus causing trouble for the downstream consumer domain. Whenever a schema change of the data product is required then the upstream provider domain must go through an official change request with version control etc. that must be accepted by the downstream consumer domain.Obviously, building the full product would be highly complicated with all the bells and whistles attached. But building a small PoC to showcase could be achievable in a realistic timeframe.Now, I have been wondering:1. What do you generally think of such an idea? Am I onto something here? Would there be demand for this? Would Apache Iceberg be the right tech for that?2. I could not find this idea implemented anywhere. There are things that come close (like Starburst's data catalogue) but nothing that seems to actually technically enforce schema change for data products. From what I've seen most products seem to either operate at a lower level (e.g. table level or file level), or they seem to not actually enforce data product schemas but just describe their schemas. Am I missing something here?",

        "author": "RevolutionaryOwl2455",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "At work (30-person B2B SaaS), we’re currently debating evolving our data schema. The founders cobbled something together 10 years ago on AWS and through some patching and upgrading, we’ve scaled to 10,000 users, typically sales reps.One challenge we’ve long faced is data analysis. We take raw JSON records from CRMs/VOIPs/etc, filter them using conditions, and turn them into performance records on another table. These “promoted” JSON records are then pushed to RedShift where we can do some deeper analysis (such as connecting companies and contacts together, or tying certain activities back to deals, and then helping clients to answer more complex questions than “how many meetings have my team booked this week?”). Without going much deeper, going from performance records back to JSON records and connecting them to associated records but only those that have associated performance… Yeah, it’s not great. The evolved data schema we’re considering is a star schema making use of our own model that can transform records from various systems into this model’s common format. So “company” records from Salesforce, HubSpot, and half a dozen all CRMs are all represented relatively similarly (maybe a few JSON properties we’d keep in a JSON column for display only). Current tables we’re sat on are dimensions for very common things like users, companies, and contacts. Facts are for activities (calls, emails, meetings, tasks, notes etc) and deals.My worry is that any case of a star schema being used that I’ve come across has been for internal analytics - very rarely a multi-tenant architecture for customer data. We’re prototyping with Tinybird which sits on top of Clickhouse. There’s a lot of stuff for us to consider around data deletion, custom properties per integration and so on, but that’s for another day. Does this overall approach sit ok with you? Anything feel off or set off alarm bells? Appreciate any thoughts or comments!",

Note that it is a multi-tenant application, and I want isolation at the data layer across different customers. My web app is currently running on Vercel, and looking for options for a good cloud data warehouse that integrates well with Vercel. While I am currently using Postgres, my needs are better suited for an OLAP datababase so I am curious if this is still the best option. What are the good options on Vercel for this?I looked at Motherduck and looks like it is a good option, but one challenge I am seeing is that the WASM client would be exposing the tokens to the customer. Given that it is a multi-tenant applications, I would need to create a user per tennant and do that user management myself. If I go with MotherDuck, my alternative is to move my webapp to a proper nodejs deployment where I don't need to depend on WASM client. Its doable but a lot of overhead to manage.This seems like a problem that should already be solved in 2025, AGI is around the corner, this should be easy :D . So curious, what are some other good options out for this?",

        "content": "Some fact tables are fairly straightforward, others can be very complicated. I'm working on a extremely complicated composite metric fact table, the output metric is computed queries/combinations/logic from \\~15 different business process fact tables. From a quality standpoint I am very concerned about transparency and explainability of this final metric. So, in addition to the metric value, I'm also considering writing to the fact the values which were used to create the desired metric, with their vintage and other characteristics. So, for example if the metric M=A+B+C-D-E+F-G+H-I; then I would not only store each value, but also the point in time it was pulled from source \\[some of these values are very volatile and are essentially sub queries with logic/filters\\]. For example: A\\_Value = xx, B\\_Value = yyy, C\\_value = zzzz, A\\_TimeStamp = 10/24/25 3:56AM, B\\_Timestamp = 10/24/25 1:11AM, C\\_Timestamp = 10/24/25 6:47AM.You can see here that M was created using data from very different points of time, and in this case the data can change a lot within a few hours. \\[data is not only being changed by a 24x7 global business, but also by system batch processing on schedule\\] If someone else uses the same formula, but data from later points in time they might get a different result (and yes, we would ideally wish A,B,C... to be from the same point in time). Is this a design pattern being used? Is there a better way? Is there resources I can use to learn more about this? Again, I wouldn't use this in all designs, only those of sufficient complexity to create better visibility as to \"why the value is what it is\" (when others might disagree and argue because they used the same formula with data from different points in time or filters). \\*\\* note: I'm considering techniques to ensure all formula components are from the same \"time\" (aka: using time travel in Snowflake, or similar techniques) - but for this question, I'm only concerned about the data modeling to capture/record artifacts used for data quality / explainability.

Let me give some generic advice: try doing it without AI.In the olden times, it was not uncommon for learners to have a project that did not work, and they could not figure out why. Now, thanks to AI, learners have a project that does work, and they can't figure out why.AI is not always bad or evil, but likewise, it definitely isn't always helpful. Learning requires reading, trying, making mistakes, getting confused, reading more, trying more, and repeating. Start small -- there's a reason \"hello world\" is a common first task -- the actual coding is ridiculously simple, but it proves that your have done all of the necessary work to get your environment properly running. Once you've got that working, you can move on to something more complicated.I've seen a lot of people who, with the help of AI, start with a much bigger project. AI helps them get that bigger project running, but they don't fully understand what was done to reach that point, which means they're not able to successfully make changes or fixes to that project.There's nothing wrong with googling. There's nothing wrong with asking AI a question. But your best bet is to spend some time thinking and trying on your own before using either tool. My advice to anyone learning with AI: don't let AI read or write your code. If you're going to ask AI questions, do so in English. Use AI to help you find the terminology that you don't yet know, and once you've learned the right words, spend some time reading about what they mean.",

This semester, I started taking an entry level Python course required for my major, and honestly, I've never been this confused in a college class before as a junior.It's been about two months, and I still feel completely lost. My professor teaches by using Microsoft Copilot to write all of the code, and then explains to the class what Copilot generated. I've been completing all my assignments using Copilot as well, since that's what the professor expects.However, one day we had a substitute professor who didn't use Copilot. He broke down each function and explained what everything did, and that was the first time I actually understood what was going on.Lately, I've been seriously considering whether this major is the right fit for me. If this is what the rest of the program is like, i'm not sure I'll enjoy or even fully understand what I'm supposed to be learning. I don't want to switch majors just because of one bad experience, but it's starting to make me question if this field is really what I want to pursue longterm.So now I'm wondering is this kind of Al heavy teaching normal for coding classes in 2025, and I'm just behind? Or is the professor not teaching correctly.",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I really need to be honest about something that’s been bothering me.I recently finished my studies as a *state-certified Business Informatics Specialist (Software Development)*. During my time in school, I practiced programming a lot. We had structured exercises, projects, and final exams, and I did well in all of them. On paper, I should feel confident. But when it comes to building something completely on my own, I feel lost.Every time I try to start a project, I end up asking AI for help or copying pieces of code from Google that I barely understand. I’ve vibe-coded my way through several projects that look fine on the outside, but deep down I know I didn’t really build them myself. It feels like I’ve just been stitching things together without truly understanding what’s happening. I feel like a fraud.Back in school it was easier because everything was guided and structured. Now that I’m on my own, I get overwhelmed. Everyone on LinkedIn and GitHub seems so smart and confident, creating amazing projects from scratch, while I can’t even write proper classes or use inheritance without checking examples.I’m motivated and I truly want to learn, but I keep procrastinating. I prepare everything, plan what to do, set up my environment, and then I stop. I tell myself I’ll start tomorrow. I’ve just graduated, I’m looking for a job, but honestly, I don’t know how I’d manage without AI or Google.The good thing is that I’ve started to change how I learn. I’ve told ChatGPT not to give me direct code anymore, only to guide me and help me think through problems. I’m practicing on LeetCode, trying to solve problems on my own, and I also started following the Coding Interview University roadmap. Right now, I’m working on a new project using this approach where ChatGPT only acts as a mentor instead of a code generator. It’s frustrating sometimes, but I finally feel like I’m actually learning something.Has anyone else felt like this after finishing school or a bootcamp? How did you transition from guided learning to being able to code independently? What helped you get through the feeling of being completely lost once the structure was gone?",

        "content": "So, I recently started programming again after like a year and a half of a break and I very vividly remember that every time I had a project idea that I thought was a bit too ambitious I would always put it away and I would think that it's too much for me and that I should do it some other time in the future. It wasn't until recently that I realized that that mindset can be really dumb sometimes and could even hinder your learning.Now, if you're an absolute beginner with weeks or barely 3 months of experience, then yeah start simple and work your way up. But, I'm talking about the beginners who already learned the fundamentals, those who already understand their programming language and can start making projects. Whatever it is you've been planning, just do it.Building projects will keep you in this loop of learning and crazy dopamine hits when you figure out how everything works. For example, right now I'm building an HTTP server with some help from a tutorial and it's something that I've always wanted to do but seemed so complex to me and now that I am doing it I feel so dumb for not starting it before because everything makes sense now, TCP packets are just a stream of bytes in order, almost no different to reading from a file and I've been reading files for months now. I would have never realized this if I had just said \"Nah, I'm not ready.\" Point is, projects only seem impossible or difficult BEFORE you start them. When you do start them and you get through that first obstacle now the project just becomes something new but super fun. So, if you know you have the resources and the fundamental knowledge to start that one project that really interests you, just do it, don't put it off for another 3 months because you think you're not ready. You have endless learning resources, so start the project and build it by solving one problem at a time and you'll be fine.",

So I've looked into C++ and Rust and I think I'll eventually learn both but the second will have to wait a long time (I'm very lazy).So I'm hesitating a lot because they both have strong pros. C++ definitely has a large community and many existing resources. Rust has better memory management but it's still relatively new. They're very similar in terms of performance from what I've heard. I know there's no definitive answer as it's mostly a personal choice but I'd like to hear different opinions to make up my mind. So what are your thoughts about it?",

        "content": "Personally I have a background in theoretical physics and quantum computing. So for me things like logic tables and lookup tables and circuits are quite intuitive now while I still struggle heavily to understand object oriented programming. Assembly is a pain in the ass at the beginning but the structure is nice as it is quite simple in its concepts. Being able to do a lot with less like addition and multiplication is fun.My programming setup usually starts (whatever \"language\" or similar things like LaTeX) with a text editor and two to three terminals open. One for compiling or installing libraries, one for navigating the file system and one for the editor. When I code I often struggle with small syntactic errors all the time but have way less problems with things others consider difficult. Old things like Fortran and TCL are quite intuitive for me. I usually get good results by optimizing the underlying mathematical problem by using some tricks provided by the software or hardware. I usually write very specific solutions for a given scientific problem and optimize a lot by hand first. But understanding concepts that aim to hide complexity is very difficult. I need to use the terminal to install software on Mac as I struggle with the basic pictures showing me to drag the .dmg from one folder to the next. I still have huge issues with VS code because usually the problems I get are related to git or access privileges in the background. If Mac OS was not a full blown Unix I would have been lost at work. And yes, I still write some \"code\" with pen and paper and optimize things by hand from time to time.",

There were no build errors, no merge conflicts, everything looked fine, so I reviewed it and merged the PR.The app is hosted on Vercel, the build went perfectly, no errors at all. But when I checked the website, the new document was not showing. At first, I thought it was just caching, so I refreshed the page, but nothing happened. Then I tried a hard refresh, still nothing. I even cleared cookies and cache manually, but still no result. I gave up for the day.The next day I checked Vercel to see if I had missed something, but the deployment looked fine. I even redeployed the last commit, but the new doc was still not showing. I opened the editor, ran git fetch and pull, started the dev server, and the docs were still not showing there either. I spent the whole day reading through Fumadocs and Next.js documentation, thinking I must have forgotten some step, but I found nothing. Frustrated, I gave up and went to sleep.At midnight, just before falling asleep, my brain suddenly remembered something. In the docs folder there is a meta.json file that maps all the docs. I had completely forgotten to add the new doc there. The next morning, I updated meta.json and, of course, it started showing perfectly.I know it might not add much value, but I just wanted to share this and I find it really funny how I spent an entire day troubleshooting everything except the obvious.",

And, last time I checked, interviews are mostly \"trivia\" tests coupled with some Leetcode or take-home project (whose difficulty is questionable... thanks AI! /sarcasm).So, how do you approach learning? Do you just follow your goals and learn as you work on them? Do you dive into books and memorize stuff that may be asked in an interview like variable/function hoisting, const vs readonly, etc? Or all of the above?Do you just work on whatever you feel like and let things work out?",

        "content": "Over the last few years, I’ve been teaching myself programming. I’m currently 32 and I wouldn’t say I’m “good” at any specific language. During these past few years, I’ve always jumped between multiple languages (C++, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, etc). I have basic knowledge in the languages listed, but I wouldn’t say enough to build something worth while.I do try and stick to one language, but then I’d usually get bored, see a new shiny thing, and jump towards that. Then most of the time, I’ll do a complete 360 and return to the language I initially started with. I’ve been doing this for years and always struggled just to stick to 1 language. And it feels like I’ve shot myself in the foot by not specialising in a single language to become efficient in it. I think the reason why I struggle focusing on a single language, is (in my honest opinion) ADHD. I haven’t been officially diagnosed with it, but a few friends who have it, have said it’s a common thing to hyper focus on something, then jump to something else (they work in tech themselves). And the other reason, is that I do find all languages interesting and want to learn as much as possible (which I know isn’t ideal when starting out).I do believe that my interests change quite a lot too, which is most likely another factor. Whether that’ll be attempting to make a small game, website, desktop app, etc. I’ve found it hard just to pick one language and run with it, ignoring the rest until I’ve built up good knowledge of different algorithms, data structures, design patterns etc.As an example, my current job, they use C#/.NET for the backend services, and now my brain wants to learn C# again. But then I’m telling myself, “what’s the point, as you’d only focus on it for a few weeks/months, then your focus will change when a new shiny thing is discovered, or you get bored.”Has anyone else done the same in the past? If so, how did you combat it? Any advice would be appreciated.",

In the past ive built a very simple 3d simulation using opengl in C++ and while i did get praised a lot like i was some genuis by my proffessor, i dont even fully understand the rendering pipeline or what each and every function call i made does.Basically what im trying to say is: i fully understand the building blocks (ifs, loops, variables, functions, OOP concepts...) but i cant actually connect that to what im doing when making an app that actually does something.Also when i have an idea for an program i wanna make, i find it really hard to break it down into managable subproblems and get overwhelmed.So im stuck where i am right now and dont know how i should go about improving my problem solving skills at all.Sorry for for how badly this post is written, i have a hard time putting the problems i have into words.",

This way, I could showcase my continuous improvement.Or is it only valuable to upload more developed projects to GitHub, like a website created for a bakery, for example, which would serve more as a 'Look what I can do for you' type of project, those more focused on real-world application?\"",

        "content": "Lately, I’ve been realizing something about my journey in university — especially now that I’m in my second year. I’m not struggling with the subjects themselves. I’m struggling with caring about them the way the system expects me to.Every time exams approach, I don’t feel scared, anxious, or even motivated. I just feel… detached. Because my goal isn’t to chase marks — it’s to understand, to learn, to build. What excites me isn’t memorizing for a grade, it’s learning cutting, learning something that actually connects with my future.But the problem is that sometimes, the environment around you drains you before you even start. You see people studying hard to get top marks, while you’re there trying your best to understand — but there’s nothing to truly understand. You try to find meaning in what you study, but most teachers themselves aren’t motivated, and it kills your spark a little every day.Living in Algeria doesn’t make it easier — the system feels heavy, exhausting, and uninspiring. You go to university, follow the hours, come back home drained, and even on your “rest days,” you don’t really rest. You just survive.And sometimes I ask myself: do students in other countries feel the same? Are they also fighting to keep their curiosity alive in a system that wants to turn everyone into the same mold?I’m not saying I hate studying. I actually love learning. I just wish learning wasn’t reduced to chasing numbers on a piece of paper.So yeah, I’m excited to cut — to start my own path, to learn differently, to build something that feels alive. Because if the system can’t teach me what I was born to do, then I’ll teach myself.",

So let's take r/bostonceltics as a potential example.I would like to be able to tell me program to send me a notification if:There is a new post on r/bostonceltics AND that post\\- Has the name \"Derek\" or \"Derek White\" in the title\\- Is a text post without a picture or link\\- Has 2 or fewer comments\\- Does not contain \"Brad\" or \"Brad Stevens\" in description.I would of course also like to be able to change these parameters and have multiple queries at once. To be clear, I don't want to create a bot to respond or create reddit spam--only be notified so I can then check out the post myself.**1. Is this a feasible idea in scope for a beginner to work towards?****2. What are the likely roadblocks?****3. What is the best programming language?**I read the subreddit FAQ and the other subreddit resources, and from what I can tell Python might be a decent choice for this, but I'd like to get some more experienced opinions before I fall down this rabbit hole.Thank you so much for the help.",

Some help with portfolio building would be the most ideal, if the course offers it.Even if its something like a graduate program, or a program that is not web development related but might be tangentially related would be great to know!

I want to be improve my both for job security and also for myself so I can feel more confident. QA is great but it's not my passion life, if the opportunity arose for a good developer position, I would like to be able to grab it if I so desire.That's why I'm looking for a good course or bootcamp program, ideally in Python and optionally in Playwright, but most languages are fine by me.

Is a two only after the semicolon, or before that but the a++ expression returns the old value?What am I missing here? Is this a programming language nuance, or am I still not fully understanding the post increment operator?",

I built out classes for each of these three things, and I want to make rule classes that will take in people, times, and work assignments, and generate the lower level elements to plug into the solver engine.I've done all that and it works, but I'm running into big picture questions:If I have a bunch of existing rules, people, times, work assignments, and I change/delete a person, then how do I ensure consistency in the rules that may reference that deleted person?Should rules contain value or reference links to the people/times/work assignments? Currently I used references (I understand these are pointers under the hood), but all of the reference links made it very hard for me to achieve the next step, which is saving the rules and everything to a file. I think I need to change the references to a key value that can be used to look up the person or whatever, like a GUID or other such key strategy.Is there any name for this or more complex programming in general that I can google to learn more about what I'm doing? I'm finding I'm building complex data structures but I don't really know what I'm doing, and it's a bit beyond a simple TODO app.",

        "content": "I am just starting to learn how to program, and as I am getting deeper and deeper into studying, I noticed that there is a million different syntaxes to learn. Just thinking fast forward to the day I apply and get my first technical interview, how would I remember all the syntaxes I studied? For example, I am currently learning MySQL since I want to focus on Data Engineering. The subject itself is not hard to understand and fairly easy to learn, but remembering the syntax for everything is the most challenging part. For example, after a couple days of moving on to the next topic within the subject, I may forget the little things like needing to create an alias after using a subquery withing the FROM statement. I know that most people who are actually working in the field can use resources, notes, etc. But as someone who is taking the technical interview, will I have access to these materials? Or will I just have to brute force myself into learning every single syntax for the interview?",

I am looking to try and make an app that’s sort of like a data base for merchandise of a specific popular fandom, however my coding knowledge goes nowhere past customizing MySpace and Tumblr pages from when I was younger.This type of app would allow users to create their own profile and add certain pieces of merchandise to their collection. Users would be able to look up merchandise, add it to their collection, wishlist it, and also see who else has it in their collection. The purpose of this app will be to store data to share with other users, show the going market price for different pieces of merchandise, and also let other collectors connect with each other. Users would also be able to mark the condition of the items that they have (like unopened/mint, new, good, etc.).This app would not feature buying and selling features, it is simply for a collector’s purpose to keep track of what they have and other items that they might want.The closest comparison app that I can find to what I want to make is Discogs minus the selling and buying feature of it.I would like to make this app available on both iOS and Android.Thank you to anyone who is able to help me out with this!",

        "author": "Fwellimort",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I have over the past few years tried to help 6 CS students more directly through Discord, etc. All of whom claimed to be grinding, etc and so forth. Here has been my thoughts on what I noticed of college students and new grads.PS: I have over a dozen of students who had DMed for help, etc as well but those have always been casual reddit chats since I don't care anymore.My thoughts on the job market:1. Job market for new grads and interns this year looks significantly better than the past 2 years.2. Offshoring is a reality which cannot be ignored. Companies are growing talent abroad now and a lot of layoffs have had their jobs moved to offshore. Unlike the past, offshore infra and talent is there. Covid 'proved' remote work works and 'offshore' == 'remote work'. Talent does not magically get better or worse depending on where the individual is located. And paying top dollar in Canada means entirely different from paying dollar in US.3. There's just too many CS majors and CS curriculums overall have become easier so schools can make more money. And there's so many CS adjacent majors sprouting left and right on top like Information Science, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction, Computational X, Computer Science + X, Information Systems, Informatics, Software Engineering, Business Information Management, etc.And then there's the fact a lot of Math, Physics, Statistics, Actuarial Science, etc students are minoring in CS as well. And Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, etc students all applying to CS jobs as well.The supply of candidates is essentially infinite relative to demand for new grads.4. Resumes all look similar end of day due to Chatgpt. And honestly, what can you expect out of students. These are students, not working professionals. Truth is, the most differentiating factor is school name on a resume before any work experience. That said, at the same time, the talent and quality of new grads have significantly deteriorated. The median talent is on the floor (if there even is a floor). And a lot of them seems to be due to:1. Schools dumbing down curriculums + grade inflation (easier to graduate).2. Students doing bare minimum in school and just studying for the job interviews. Hence you see students here with 2.0 GPAs showing off the interviews they have gotten.3. CS is now really mainstream unlike in the way past in which programming was thought to be for nerds.4. Modern devices have abstracted away so much that students did not have to grow up having to deal with all sorts of bugs, frustrations, etc on the Internet.5. Chatgpt. It does homework, vibe coding, etc. Why bother spending the hours?6. There is a whole industry to min-maxing CS related job interviews. And the quality is really high as well. And a lot of information which in the past might have needed weeks of research is readily available within minutes now.7. TikTok brainwashing towards the world of instant gratifications. Students just don't want to deal with long frustrating grinds that go nowhere, etc.8. A lot of students going in claim to be 'passionate' in CS but really they are just majoring in it for the money or lifestyle they heard on TikTok, Youtube, etc. Now, I think 'passionate' is cringe but .. these students are all just really doing the bare minimum. \\--------Why am I saying this? Well.. while I do know Youtube is a bait, my direct experience with 6 CS students in this subreddit have largely been the same as the ones I found on Youtube.In fact, I would argue the ones on Youtube look like god talent relative to most of the 6 CS students here in this subreddit I interacted on Discord.What Youtube videos you might ask? This is from Coding Jesus Youtube channel which is extremely baity and really there for him to advertise his own site but...[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0JMSFNGZmc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0JMSFNGZmc)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6GjnVM\\_3yM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6GjnVM_3yM)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s\\_ztBwg7Vls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ztBwg7Vls)Let me just say ... most of the 6 CS students in this subreddit over the years I interacted on Discord... makes those candidates look like top talent.I have come to believe that we seriously need more gatekeeping in this field. Completely agree with Coding Jesus: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrboWpmD1pA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrboWpmD1pA) On the hiring side, most students are flat out garbage. But the problem is **student resumes despite how well done at aggregate will always look similar before actual work experience**. Hence on the company side, the only way to filter is largely by school names at aggregate. And trust me when I say this, most students at \"top schools\" nowadays are flat out garbage as well. The difference being AT LEAST the students at top schools tend to be good at Leetcode. At least that bare minimum is done.The worst part of all this is actual talent cannot be differentiated either from the rest as well. And with so much cheaters everywhere, it's just impossible to tell who is actually good from others. It has been frustrating and a huge waste of time trying to help some students here in this subreddit only to learn that they ddn't even bother to do the bare minimum. I'm sorry but if you cannot do a basic easy-medium Leetcode question and are screaming for how the world is unfair and what not claiming you have been grinding and doing everything... then you are not fit for this field. Get out.It's been a huge waste of my time and a huge eye opening over the years how bad most CS students are lately when it comes to CS. And the best part? Every one of them at the start talked as if they thought differently of themselves. But ya.. just me rambling. Just wanted to share this. Also, good luck college students with the job market. I know it's rough. My only real advice to you is .... well, look into C++ if you are serious about software engineering and want to differentiate yourself from others. Totally agree with this recruiter as well: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1e4zNfyowA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1e4zNfyowA)Note: I still am helping one of them and plan to for the next few years (been helping for two years now).

Take-home assignment via Coderbyte4.) Discussion with CTO, including reviewing my takehome5.) Live leetcoding round - 2 engineers6.) Live system design round - 2 engineers7.) Behavioral interview - 1 QA engineer, 1 implementation engineer, 1 product managerAt this point, I figured I was just about done and was about to receive an offer.No - I then received a message about them wanting me to meet their CEO for a “quick chat” - fine. As I prepare for that, I then receive another message that they just hired a new Head of Engineering and they would like me to meet with them BEFORE the CEO.Insane, right? But the market is the market so I persevere.As I await the meeting with the Head of Engineering today, I get a call from the recruiter informing me that there was a “miscommunication” and that they will not hire in my state, NOR the one I plan to move to in a few weeks! (Florida -> Illinois) I was completely transparent about my location/relocation, with my current location being on my resume and LinkedIn (where they found me). The fact that this was not internally discussed prior to me going through the whole process is extremely inconsiderate of my and other candidates’ time.Extremely frustrating, but hey, maybe I dodged a bullet. If they are this disorganized during interviewing, it would probably be a nightmare to work for. They are also going through a re-org, after being acquired by private equity a few weeks ago.It sucked getting the call - especially after talking to 10 people about the role - but my interview skills now are sharper.

I pushed a bad PR and commits that caused some issues to an important branch. Nothing in prod was affected but a couple engineers had to spend a day or two fixing my mistake and it did end up being a high priority issue that blocked some people. Mostly everyone was nice except a devops engineer who found the issue and was thorough about letting everyone know in every chat that I was the cause of the block. So its pretty well known to everyone that I messed up big-time. I merged a PR to the wrong branch without getting a review because I thought it wasnt required for this branch. I wouldnt usually be worried but we did have layoffs recently and I know an Eng2 who did get laid off during that cycle due to \"performance issues.\" So this has me thinking im on the top of the list for the next lay offs. Maybe its best to get ahead of this now and start interviewing at other companies sooner than later?

I have close to 4 YoE, sent over 400 applications so far, and have only had a handful of interviews that fizzled out.I've cut back on the amount of LC I do everyday since August, but now I just fill the rest of my time applying to jobs, catching up on a lot of sleep debt, watching TV, getting out of the house more (although that's coming to an end soon with how cold it's getting), dealing with job anxiety/depression, etc. Things seem stagnant and it feels like I should be doing something more, but... I'm not sure what I should be doing otherwise.I'm just curious as to how everyone's using this time off work. Are you upskilling, working on personal projects, considering/trying to pursue other career paths, or maybe just enjoying your time off?",

Since almost all H-1Bs come in as bachelors or masters students on F1 -> OPT on F1 -> H-1B, for all practical purposes this almost reverses the 100k fee.

Genuinely excited about the product and the culture. Sent follow ups to two other fully remote roles I finished full loops for last week. End up sending no outbound resumes and withdrawing from 5-7 conversations that required relocation or were too early in the process. Not trying to brag here, just posting this for someone else out there like me (absolutely miserable at a role thinking that market is too shitty to jump).",

Possible (this hurts the most)My first website was a Joomla-Drupal website (PHP/HTML/CSS) back in...2006! I was spending my christmas holidays as CS student trying to fix CSS issues and launch my \"unique idea\" (it kind of was but I had no idea how to monetize or grow at my 22 years).A career came relatively easy in the richer northern EU countries with plenty of corporate, slow paced jobs (cruising/rest and vest) (without really vesting anything - no stocks).Looking back I probably wasted my first 5 years of work with minor skill building in CSS. I did get pretty good in CSS though.Enter JS hype circa 2015. I Suddenly realize I was a pixel pusher / HTML-CSS guy who barely understood how jQuery worked and my JS skills were close to 0. hoisting? closures? MVVM? wtf are you talking about? I can tell you whats the difference of relative/absolute positioning and the box model, but you're not really interested are you?A lack of effort in personal projects, lack of studying the proper material, and a choice of relatively comfortable jobs that did not use Angular/Backbone or React (early days) meant I stayed behind.Around 2017 I realize I need to do something. I start grinding JS problems, non stop interviewing, codewars, and other learning platforms. I get into my first full time VueJS projects after a whiteboard recursion test and a coding challenge. Only problem: I hated the role, the product, and the people. I get into two more gigs in VueJS projects for a period of a total of 6 years in Vue. And that means: I get left out of the ReactJS game. One more thing to play catchup on.I wake up on morning and realize it's been 15 years I am coding professionally. Most of the peers I've worked with are in Lead, Senior Manager, Investor (!!) roles.I'm still doing take home code challenges, leetcode live interviews - to which I suck -, and struggling to get decent Senior SE roles.I keep interviewing, and something lands on my lap: I take over the tech of a startup without engineers. NextJS, Mongo, AWS, the whole shebang. I m getting good at harder concepts. Do a little of AWS, deployments, backend. AI is happening, this helps. But I hate the product, and I'm working for half the salary I was making before. I get a contract at a FinTech which paid double. 3 months later I'm let go because of \"reasons\".the job market shitshow is here. The TRUMP / Putin / War / Interest Rate bullshit all are happening. I'm trying to get jobs and interview but my age is catching up on me. My eyes are more easily tired. So is my lower back.My net worth is decent, but not one to say I can \"FIRE\".

Most of the time this results in me sending a resume to them for a contract job. I’ve had a few seem really promising but then ghost me after I get the resume. This last week I got in touch with a contractor who was looking for a position that just so happened to be with my first team at the tech company. They fast-tracked me into an interview that ran for far longer than it should have, and actually ran over what was supposed to be a second interview. The recruiter told me they would reschedule the second interview but I haven’t heard back from them. The team wants to have someone in the role by the end of this week but now I fear that even they might not be willing to take me back, even though they have my receipts, are probably using my code, and should know what I’m capable of.Any advice?

        "content": "I recently fully vested at the startup I’m at. In the time I’ve been here my shares have gone 10x, and the business is exploding and has become the runaway leader in its sector. A highly profitable IPO looks to be in the cards in the next few years. I have gotten refresher equity over the years, such that my TC is reasonable for 13 YOE. If they were to just 2x again on IPO, I’d be looking at a healthy 8-figure payout after taxes. But of course, that is paper money and is in no way guaranteed (though my insider knowledge has me pretty bullish). The only two major downsides are as follows: I’ve been enduring a brutal 3 hour/day 3 day/week commute with kids at home. And two, I haven’t been able to purchase all my options. Only about 2/3. The pop in valuation coincided with having kids and I just couldn’t justify buying the options at the time, nor was I quite as bullish then. I’d need 3x more than I have in liquid savings to buy out the rest of the options due to taxes, and with every valuation pop that gets harder. I lose these unexercised options if I leave (classic golden handcuffs)I recently interviewed at a smaller, but still unicorn-level startup in the same sector. Its office is only 20 minutes away and has flexible hybrid hours. The offer is to lead a team at a >25% cash bump with a ~10% drop in equity depending on how you math some of the parameters. Overall a >15% TC upgrade at current valuations. It’s a paper career upgrade, but my biggest concern is trading out favorable pre-ISO RSU paper money where I am for paper equity in an as-of-yet less successful startup.There’s a quality of life question that’s near and dear to my heart, but if the trade ends up being multiple 7 figures a couple years from now, I’d kick myself forever. Any of you have some advice here? Would you leave some shares on the table at a slam-dunk startup for a higher risk promotion and some QoL improvements?",

This is something i am the most unsure of but... I feel like e.g. vending machine software is a done deal? Also payment processing? Or video sharing?Additionally from a european/american perspective a lot of SE is outsourced to cheaper wage countriesAnd lastly AI does a lot of coding \"legwork\" just fine and it likely wont get worse at it How will there be more jobs/growing market in CS at any point?",

        "author": "bikinbaebuatcurhat",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So I'm a junior cloud engineer, working for around a year now in my first job straight out of uni. I was hired with another junior, but he has a masters and 2 prior years of work experience so I was hired for my \"potential\" whereas he was actually selected for his skillset too. I have no problem with that, I'm happy to learn and grow as fast as I can. My manager however, seemingly doesn't want me to forget how much better he is than me. Here are some things that have been said during our 1-on-1s, without me ever mentioning him (for the story's sake, we'll call him Tyler).\"You're doing well, you don't need to compare yourself with Tyler.\" I never was.\"You are doing your tasks and learning a lot of things, *it's not super great but that's what we expect from you*. Of course we can't expect for you to be an expert. Tyler is different, he has had experience before\"\"You are real junior here to be honest, if Tyler applied for a mid level role he would've gotten in, we just hired him as a way to get him in the company. So don't worry about him.\"\"You are an early career experiment, we want to see how we can develop people from zero, but Tyler is not really a junior to be honest\"Amongst other things. I don't know if I'm just being sensitive to some very normal or mildly negative feedback, but I just don't understand how I'm supposed to respond to these. I feel like I'm having my inferiority drilled in to me again and again, even when me and Tyler are not working in even remotely similar things. I also find it not productive to have him as an arbitrary benchmark, and spend less time focusing on my performance and growth in isolation. My other coworkers are actually giving me plenty of props and good feedback and think I'm learning super fast, but I feel like I'm not perceived as good as I would've been by my manager if Tyler wasn't working alongside. If I was hired for my potential, then why don't we spend most of our attention maximizing it?Another annoying thing is our objective setting. We've done this process twice now. The first time, I made mine quite compact and Tyler made his more elaborated. Our manager said \"we could make yours a bit more like Tyler's, see how he made his a little clearer?\". Yup, absolutely. That makes sense.But the next cycle, he had his very short. Almost lazy. It was literally just a bullet point of the stacks he wants to learn and get to work with. Whereas I elaborated on mine more specifically. But guess what? \"We can make it similar to Tyler's one just so its easier.\"So what the hell. I get that he's older, more educated, more experienced and most importantly, he's a he. I don't want to link these treatments to me being the only girl in the team and the youngest member by a lot, but I can't help to think those things play a part.Or, alternatively, I could be overthinking and these are perfectly normal parts of a manager's evaluations. In which case Im happy to learn to get used to it and move on with my life.I have recently had a hiring manager reach out to me for a position in a different company. I've cleared a few interview rounds and they've said they're willing to offer me a 20% pay raise, with a sign on bonus and stock which I don't currently get at my company. I don't wanna leave my current place for some other reasons that compensate the lower pay, but if this treatment isn't normal I might just consider leaving. However, that also lets me know that I don't suck, so I'm really not sure of what to think anymore now.",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I really need to be honest about something that’s been bothering me.I recently finished my studies as a *state-certified Business Informatics Specialist (Software Development)*. During my time in school, I practiced programming a lot. We had structured exercises, projects, and final exams, and I did well in all of them. On paper, I should feel confident. But when it comes to building something completely on my own, I feel lost.Every time I try to start a project, I end up asking AI for help or copying pieces of code from Google that I barely understand. I’ve vibe-coded my way through several projects that look fine on the outside, but deep down I know I didn’t really build them myself. It feels like I’ve just been stitching things together without truly understanding what’s happening. I feel like a fraud.Back in school it was easier because everything was guided and structured. Now that I’m on my own, I get overwhelmed. Everyone on LinkedIn and GitHub seems so smart and confident, creating amazing projects from scratch, while I can’t even write proper classes or use inheritance without checking examples.I’m motivated and I truly want to learn, but I keep procrastinating. I prepare everything, plan what to do, set up my environment, and then I stop. I tell myself I’ll start tomorrow. I’ve just graduated, I’m looking for a job, but honestly, I don’t know how I’d manage without AI or Google.The good thing is that I’ve started to change how I learn. I’ve told ChatGPT not to give me direct code anymore, only to guide me and help me think through problems. I’m practicing on LeetCode, trying to solve problems on my own, and I also started following the Coding Interview University roadmap. Right now, I’m working on a new project using this approach where ChatGPT only acts as a mentor instead of a code generator. It’s frustrating sometimes, but I finally feel like I’m actually learning something.Has anyone else felt like this after finishing school or a bootcamp? How did you transition from guided learning to being able to code independently? What helped you get through the feeling of being completely lost once the structure was gone?Thanks for reading. I just needed to share this somewhere where people might understand.",

        "content": "Nothing new I guess, this is starting to get a toll on me. Despair is setting in. Career choices, life choices, and all this affects the people around me.I'm a decent engineer. I've built stuff, I've solved problems. I know my FE shit.Since end of August I've participated in several processes, both startups and non startups. I am not in the US/UK ecosystem (S.Europe here) so I am trying to be relatively picky with my choices (I am getting less picky as we go of course).I recently was rejected after delivering a coding assignment - following two very nice (good vibes) calls with the two founders of a startup.Here is the weird part. I am pretty confident on my delivery. The assignment had a lot business detail, one had to think of what it actually needed - but thanks to AI - I delivered. Finishing touches mine, and I was prepared to answer any questions about the code. We even had a follow-up call planned to talk about the challenge.24 hours later, I receive the most generic rejection message ever - nothing about the challenge , and a cancellation of the follow-up call. I've messaged the guy who I was in touch with - and he wrote something super abstract like \"we wanted to see how you would approach the problem\" and \"we didnt see the depth we were looking for\". (honestly I dont buy it)I accidentally noticed that one of their engineers was stalking my Linkedin Profile a few hours before the rejection mail arrived. I was generally vocal about the \"AI Bubble\" and I am wondering if the fact that their business was AI-driven had something to do with it?The other thing I am thinking is that the guy who visited my profile only did so after I spoke with the two founders so he decided for one or the other reason I am not a good fit - so they had nothing to say about the code by itself.Needless to say this is a brutal market, and I have never seen so challenging interview processes, so lengthy filtering mechanisms. I happen to also be in a relatively small market so this might have to do with it. Remote gigs are harder to find these days.What the heck should I do? I am not a top 10% coder but I'm good enough for most normal businesses. I don't grind Leetcode, and I do suffer from live coding brain freeze which I am trying to battle by doing a lot of live coding interviews. But it is \\_very\\_ easy for an interviewer to find reasons to reject you.I have excellent soft skill presentation, most recruiters / HR folk are super happy with me, I present myself in an excellent manner.The other day I was prepared to answer a specific live coding challenge following tips from the recruiter. I did it async before the call, almost memorized it.During live coding it, I froze because the API wasnt returning the response I was thinking it would. It took me like 5' to solve the bug.Rejected",

I love my co-workers, I dont slack. I get along with them and pair program with them often. I eventually got a PIP and desptie going beyond expectations. I dont think Ill make it as it got extended. I survived many layoffs here, but I guess this is how I go.I think the positive of PIP is that it pushes you to be aware of your flaws and focus on perfecitonism, but at the same time its burning me out lol and perfectionism is not sustainable as we are all humans.

I understand the market used to be they'd take anybody with a pulse. I'm definitely a solid junior dev maybe a bit above junior? But...how long do people like me have to wait out this market? How many more years?In some sense it's like...I'm just gonna keep coding and learning and I figure at some point when this market turns around I'll have some job to fall back on even if its not the exorbitant salaries that previously marked the industry. For me, when I'm in the mood for it, doing leetcode is just sudoku, and any time I get an idea that excites me I typically go build it, but only if the idea excites me. It's stuff like this that makes me know I'm a \"real dev\" - even if I am new.So I guess my question is just like how long do you guys perceive this market being this way?",

But even after that, I still can’t seem to land stable employment. Being unemployed has been tough for me and my family, and I’m honestly not sure what to do next.Should I take on more student loans and pursue a master’s degree?

        "content": "For context, I’m a 22M recent grad (graduated May 2025) and am working at a F500 insurance company making ~80,000 as a software engineer. I interned at this company during my senior year, and pretty much joined full time right after graduation (I had maybe a week off).The company is amazing. The work life balance is great, my coworkers and boss are great, and the pay isn’t bad (especially considering I still live with my parents in a low cost of living area). I’m nearby most of my friends and have a very healthy life outside of work with multiple hobbies.Yet I can’t help but feel like something feels missing. My job is right next to my house where I grew up (10 min commute) and I went to school in state only 30 ish minutes away. I feel like I haven’t seen or done anything and am missing out. I know I’m in a situation some would envy, but I just feel… bored?I’ve always been interested in the idea of joining the military, but have obviously heard horror stories about it too (hence why I never joined). But just today I was having a casual conversation with the lead engineer and he told me about his experiences in the Navy. All of the fun he had, all of the minor trouble he got into, the places he’s been, etc… It honestly sounded like a fun adventure and he said he hasn’t regretted a second of it. And obviously it didn’t impact his career negatively as he’s the lead engineer in our team.So I guess the TL:DR is, am I crazy for considering leaving my current job to join as an Officer in the Navy/Air Force? What tech skills will I learn and how will it impact me in the future? Obviously I had my lead engineer as a resource, but I want to get a broader set of opinions too that may not be biased by previous experiences.",

I’ve already been through this once — Omnishore also didn’t hire me after promising there was a chance.

        "content": "I was recently laid off and have applied to hundreds of jobs in the last couple of weeks. I have gotten very few responses, just a couple of local short-term contract jobs with no PTO (got ghosted for those roles too). I'm super early in my job search, so I know it might just take time to hear back from some companies.When I was laid off, I was trying to conceive with my husband for a couple of months, so this was a really bad time for me to lose my job. I have 3.5 years of experience working with mostly Vue and TypeScript. I did learn React at bootcamp and have been diving back into studying it since I know it's in higher demand. The thing is, I don't think I can mentally handle the grind in this field. When I first started out, I was hungry, driven, ambitious, and excited to code. I was extremely lucky to land a job 2 months after graduating from bootcamp, and tech was a lot easier to break into. Now I'm in my 30s, I want kids, and I don't have as much motivation to hustle.As much as I love coding, I don't love the concept of having to grind constantly when I want to focus on family building and family life. Just the process of getting through dev interviews feels insane right now. Grinding leetcode, memorizing a ton of system design questions, doing tons of projects to practice different technologies, going through several rounds of interviews, only to possibly get rejected at the last stage? And then maybe having to do it ALL over again if you get laid off a year or 2 later? I've been studying my ass off the past few weeks and it got me thinking, if I'm finding this super exhausting now with no kids, how the hell am I gonna do this again if I were to get laid off again with a toddler or 2? Yes I would of course have support from my husband, but I don't know if it's realistic for me personally to constantly be trying to hustle at work, hustle while being laid off, and be a parent to young children. I keep seeing posts from people who have been laid off multiple times in a year and the idea of having to go through the interview process more than once in a year sounds horrible. Plus, I SUCK at leetcode. I'm a great dev, but leetcode has always been a weakness of mine.Does anyone have any ideas of where I could pivot in tech? I want to learn more about roles that don't require such stressful interview processes. Thank you in advance.",

And I expect it'll take 4, 5 years for me to make that much if I stay here. They could not give me any solid financial growth plan, just vague promises which may or may not be fulfilled. Anyway, the only reason I'm a bit hesitant is because the new company is a bit toxic. They've had sudden layoffs in the past. Their upper management can be rude at times and insult you. The work load is high (especially now with AI). Their expectations are high. (Makes sense because they pay way above the market)At my current place I'm respected among my peers.But I feel like I'm at a position in my career (5 years exp, software engineer) that I should take a risk and do the difficult thing and it will teach me way more than staying in a slower more stable place right?

        "content": "Hey everyone, I'm a Senior Frontend Developer with 8 years of experience currently feeling stuck and worried about my career trajectory. I'd appreciate any strategic advice, especially concerning the current job market.My Current SituationI lead a small team as a Tech Lead/Senior Frontend Developer. The problem is, I’m the only truly experienced frontend person here. My team members, while good people, are generally junior or mid-level, and honestly, they often just want to get tasks done with minimal effort. * Code Quality: The code I review is frequently poor—written just to pass the ticket, not to be clean or maintainable. * Stagnation Fear: When I do code reviews, I often worry that I'm not just failing to grow, but actually regressing. I have no one more experienced than me in frontend to learn from, which makes me feel professionally trapped. * The Dilemma: My role is to mentor them (which I try to do through detailed code reviews and discussions), but constantly dealing with low-quality code makes me paranoid that I'm absorbing bad habits myself.The ChallengeI need advice on how to combat this feeling of stagnation and ensure I keep growing my skills (especially technical ones like architecture and modern patterns).Crucially, I have very little time outside of work for side projects or intense studying. I need strategies to develop myself during work hours within the confines of my current role and project.My Questions for the Community * In-Job Development: What are the most effective ways for a senior/lead to force their own growth technically when surrounded by less-experienced developers, especially when time after work is scarce? (e.g., specific code review tactics, using project architecture as a growth tool, etc.) * Market Strategy: Given the competitive nature of the current tech job market (layoffs, high competition for senior roles): * When is the right time to leave? Should I wait until I can find a role that guarantees working with better talent? * How do I best position my current leadership role (leading a small team, improving code quality) for interviews at top-tier companies that value deep technical expertise? * Mindset: How do you mentally cope with being the \"only source of truth\" and avoid the burnout/frustration that comes from constantly correcting fundamental issues?Thanks in advance for any insights on maintaining momentum and making a strategic career move!",

        "content": "SDE2 of 7 YoE. I've been reorg'd to my current team 1.5 years ago, and it's been a nightmare. I'm not interested in my team's product, state of engineering wants to pull your hair out, and my manager is borderline toxic. WLB is great and I love my people (outside of my manager), but I've felt incredibly stagnant in my career for awhile and feel miserable. I've been on a burnout for months that's been gradually increasing, and I know that things won't significantly improve anytime soon. I've originally planned to find a position within the company to transfer internally, and it's been 3 months since I started browsing around. Now, it feels like I might be better off to take a full plunge and prep for interviewing other companies for few reasons:1. I've been having golden handcuff, but my salary is tanking hard in less than a year once my 4 year RSU runs out. At that point, I'm only losing a modest amount of salary to jump ship to other company's SDE2 position (according to levels.fyi). That's not even considering a slim chance that I make the hiring bar for senior in some companies. There is no path for promotion within my current company for awhile, anyways. I've saved enough to last for awhile.2. Due to the company policy, it's practically impossible for me to transfer internally for another half a year without painting myself a target. Honestly unsure if my mental health will remain sane until then.3. I've been on GC process for a bit (completed I-140 w/ EB3 using TN). Given the state of current administration, it's very unlikely that mine will be processed in a reasonable time. Might as well keep the priority date and resume as EB-2 at another company.4. Tied to GC process above, I can only internally transfer to positions within my city. I'm on a branch office away from HQ, and the options are pretty small. I don't have much things to bind me to the city outside of GC process, and am honestly okay relocating.5. I've been border locked for the entire year, and will continue to be so until GC is approved - immigration attorney strongly advises not to travel internationally. Not only does changing company mostly address that risk (since I'll have to restart with PERM), it gives me an option to get a sizeable amount of vacation in-between jobs. I've been dying to travel abroad again, albeit this is not a big reason to sabotage anything on my job. I'm leaving the team in the earliest opportunity for sure. I just need to choose between finding an internal position within my current city and company, or fully commit to searching outside. I've heard many anecdotes of how terrible the job market is now, how insane the hiring bars are. The uncertainty with recession also adds a risk of layoffs, which tends to target less contributing employees including new hires.Am I crazy to consider jumping ship in this market?",

Short version:* Changed role accepting a pay reduction of 7% in new company.* 5 months in I got a 2,27% raise.* I got my MSc in CS.* 1year+2months later I accepted to talk about a role in new company just to get an assessment of what could my value be in the marketplace.* Without even trying hard I got an offer that comes with an increase in seniority and 25% in compensation.* It is too good to pass but I am feeling bad about leaving my team, it is not their fault. Longer version:* I quit last July due to conflicts with new tech lead manager in team. I didn't want to be a bad employee so I left. He didn't even care. * Got an offer in 2 weeks for a total of 7% less yearly compensation of my previous role and NOTE for a fintech company.* I was expecting a 2-times per year salary re-negotiation but policy changed.* I got a 2,26% salary increase last January.* I was promised a better raise this year.* I worked my ass off to evolve more. Almost finished my MSc in CS.* I accepted to talk about a new offer ONCE and without even trying they accessed my skill was worth a 25% increase in salary and a seniority role - I get to mentor entry/juniors.* It is 100% better choice for me to leave, but feeling remorse cause my current team which are great people will get destroyed. Some more notes for the company:1. Year closed with 50% profit increase.2. New offices in new city3. New AI team and hired like 20 ( I am assuming expensive ) AI engineers over they year.4. Developer left team in January, I got his workload - no salary increase, never got a replacement.5. Team got 3 new projects in September.6. Core developer was owed 200 hours of overtime and eventually instead of paying they gave him a 4 day work week for the next few months..... SAD?SUMMARY; Τo me it feels like in this company my worth is less and it gets depicted in salary. Company will try to match offer only because they are in dire position. I don't think this much of a raise would be ever considered. This means they don't value me as they should or my worth is less here and I will be better of switching anyway. The new company is purely software development oriented vs current FINTECH.",

On top of that it's been so long that I can't remember enough detail about my work or team interactions when an interviewer drills down on a project/topic (in retrospect I should have kept a work diary for reference). I end up having to improvise, which always goes poorly and I feel like I'm coming off as a fraud. What should I do for behavioral interviews going forward? Should I just admit to interviewers that I haven't gotten to do much and want a chance to prove myself? Make up embellishments to my experience? Find a new career? I've been unemployed searching for over a year to no avail so any advice on this would be appreciated.",

        "content": "Hey,I graduated from an OK university in Europe with a 3.1 GPA, so not good but not bad either. However, as I have started applying for jobs and from reading discussions on CS related forums (such as here), I have started feeling like a complete fraud. I feel like I know a little bit about a lot, but when I read posts on here I'm seeing terms I have never in my life seen before, and they are thrown around as if it were common knowledge.I feel like my lack of real skills is making it impossible for me to find a junior position; recruiters look at my CV and just discard it because there is nothing about it that stands out in any positive ways.But I do *love* CS and programming, so I'm committed to making this work somehow. I think I need to seriously improve on my core CS skills, but also programming skills, probably by going deep on some specific stack or framework.But man, I have *no clue* where to begin. It feels as if there is an ocean of things that I need to learn before I can even be considered as a serious junior candidate. I dont even know where to begin. I'm currently learning more about infrastructure (self-hosting really) by developing some fairly basic LLM wrappers to make job searching and application easier, and so I'm learning about hosting apps via Docker on remote servers, as well as setting up proper CI/CD pipelines. But even then, this is a miniscule thing and—I dont think—of any interest to any employers. There's also the AI BS, making it feel mega inefficient to do anything by hand (and actually trying to learn), as opposed to just vibing some slop out.I dont know, what do I even do? I'm thinking of doing my masters in CS come next year if I cant find anything, but I dont really have any particular interest in CS research and it would just amount to kicking the can down the road. I'm also fine like really doubling down on trying to improve core CS skills if that is what's missing to get a job, but I dont think an employer gives a damn about me knowing my DS&As.What do I do?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Before I explain what's going on let me start by saying my brother is probably the least greedy, most trustworthy person on this planet. So I'm not worried that he'll try to screw me over, its that I don't have any idea what would be a fair way to charge for something of this nature since it'll basically be entirely my creation from the ground up that is using the data he is supplying. So general advice on books to read or websites to go for advice on the best practices for deciding the monetary value of certain work or current industry practices for different types of work would also be welcome.# So here's what's happening:My brother has an idea for a service he wants to offer to the clients in his day job. Basically its a really confusing field and he wants to charge subscription access to his clients for a website that basically presents all this data for the client in plain English. This is a big deal because there are TONS of these JSON collections of rules and trust me, trying to figure it out from badly named JSON files with confusingly named key : value pairs is insanity. Presumably this info must have existed at one point, but that's kind of the thing: the whole system is so big and convoluted and there's no easily accessible source of info about it.The reason he contacted me is cuz he wants a program that can take these complicated collections of rules and make sense of them then put them on the internet somewhere so people can access a plain English description of the interactions and uses of them. # What's the issue?The issue is that I have a crazy amount of extremely varied experience I have that is allowing me to work on this solo and make something that will actually be a decent software. I've been so interested in data science and ML that I went back for my second bachelor's degree because of it I was certified in TensorFlow years ago, and have been using ChatGPT since before it was the the all-accessible great-god-genie that it is today. You used to have to apply for it by submitting how you planned to use it back when it was still in its infant stages.Anyway its a ton of school,, internship, job, and hobby work that I've done that's put me in a position where I know I can solo build this entire thing for sure. I've already created a model that \"seems\" to be able to pull this off. (I have no idea if its correct cuz its not my field, but my bro says the ones I showed him appear to be mostly correct. Obviously its gonna take a good bit of fine tuning, but I'm not worried in the least that this is going to work out.)So basically I'm going to be 100% making all the decisions of how to design and code and use the models, code and organize all the data collection and storage on the backend, and code all the website design, and do the hosting, testing, CI/CD etc. Every bit of the software that powers this whole endeavor is going to be made by me.# So what the F'ing F is fair for me to ask for as compensation?I don't like the idea of just charging an hourly wage and having to give up something that is all my work. But also I have no intentions or desire to screw my brother on this either. I'm only getting this opportunity cuz he knows me and has the insight to know this is something that his clients would be very happy to have.Also the amount of hours I'll put in is not equal to the amount of work that I'm getting done. A lot of the work is going to be done in the background as my software goes through all this data and creates useful output that's then organized in a way that it can all be dumped in a database and easily retrieved through a site made with Django.Oh and there's multiple clients each with their own sets of rules and things so finding a way to make my database schema universal (or as close to universal as possible) between clients is going to go a long way to prevent me from having to hardcode all of these for each client by hand. The idea is if he picks up another client, we can just dump the data to my system and it will parse it, decode it, and add it all to the database (and through the magic of Django, create a whole bunch of webpages using that data that don't have to be coded by hand).So please, if you have experience working on anything like this or working for a company deciding what to charge clients or know any ways I could learn about that I could really use the info.I've always worked for someone else at an hourly wage, so I have no idea how what to do otherwise. I just don't feel like being paid an hourly wage to work on this is fair. And I'd have no idea how to even figure out how much of a percentage to ask for if I want to split the profits from the subscription sales.",

Some of these definitely annoyed or upset me on the day, but I don’t think about them on a regular basis. The point is— should I have been upset or annoyed at all?There’s been a few instances over the past 5 years where I stayed up at night thinking of people’s actions and comments. I feel like nearly all of the comments and actions were justified, so I think I’m just too emotional and sensitive. I shared some of these with friends, and they all say I’m not being too sensitive, but I also almost never hear them complaining about anything like this (their complaints are usually of the shape “my managers putting me on a dead end project” or “my manager is not acknowledging my contributions”)Curious how people would react in any of the circumstances:* When I was a junior with 2 yoe, I wrote a cl and sent it to someone I’ve been working with, and he scheduled a 1:1 to talk about it. During the meeting, he gave some helpful (but maybe controversial? My tl didn’t agree with the final shape of the cl) advice, but at the same time he was laughing at my code and asking why I did this, and that Im surely smarter than him because I graduated from Caltech. I think I didn’t have a good reason beside it made sense to me. * I switched companies after just over 2.5 years. After about 10 months , my manager told me that my growth trajectory isn’t as good as , and that I’d benefit from more local mentorship (the brain of the project is in hongkong, as was my manager. I’m based in the us)* A manager some levels above me mentioned that he’d rather work with smart assholes than people who are nice but slightly incompetent. (Though to be clear, we’re not hiring either)* My manager is also an IC (he only manages me), and he was the main reviewer for a cl I worked on. Another coworker left a comment and I tried to talk to my manager about these comments first. He cut me off both times. The first time was me saying oh “triggers are a good idea”, and he replied. “Yeah yeah, I saw his comment”. The second time was “are you available at 2:30? I…” “I have a meeting then”. I ask dumb questions so it’s pretty normal to get cut off, but what really annoyed me was securing our 1:1 the next day, he ask what triggers are.(I told this interaction to another younger coworker, and his response was I shouldn’t be emotional at work and that I should talk to my manager, which I did do weeks ago.)",

        "author": "shade_blade",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I've kind of been feeling very demotivated and stuck, I got a few calls recently but they didn't go anywhere (said \"you'll hear by the end of the week\" and then got nothing). It's better than getting nothing like before but it still is effectively nothing. It just doesn't feel like I have anything \"compelling\" to say about any of my experience and I don't know how to get that good experience. I've been spending all day every day doing \"nothing\" (working on projects that are still unpresentable, sending applications that mostly go nowhere), I don't know what I should be doing at all. Everything I do feels like the wrong answer no matter what. Working on the projects I already have feels useless as they are not presentable (they visually look bad, they are not profitable at this moment, and have absolutely no real technical challenges to them at all)I don't feel like I have any \"difficult\" or \"interesting\" projects to show people, like I don't have anything difficult to show how I struggled because everything I did always felt \"easy\" or it always becomes \"easy\" in hindsight. Even if something took a long time to fix or figure out, in hindsight it is always easy so hiring people will see it as being easy too so I can't really talk about them being struggles. It looks badly on me if I talk about how I figured out how to find the assembly code that touches some struct value for a game mod, because any IDE nowadays would have that same functionality just 2 clicks away. And it's not really impressive for me to build a menu or web page or a web server because those are standard basic level things. It's also not impressive for me to implement some algorithm or use some API because applying some algorithm someone else already wrote is not applying my own thinking and using some API is just using someone else's code which is not impressive to do. Making my own variant chess engine isn't impressive because it's just me following a preset list of things to do to make the engine (and the new stuff is not technically difficult to do as it's more of the same techniques that I am not a pioneer of) So in any case everything I've done is not impressive, any half competent developer could do anything I've done and they would probably do it faster and better in every way.Interview / call wise I don't really know how to improve, I always feel like I give short answers but I don't know how to make them longer without rambling about useless things? (Like I can't tell them about every individual class I took in response to \"tell me about yourself\"). I don't know the way to \"fluff up\" my answers to impress them, it feels like if I try too hard it just backfires on me (like if I hype up some web page up as the best thing ever but in reality it looks like the default CSS styling (Graphic design is not my passion) it makes me look stupid). I don't even have real answers for some of the questions they have, like I can't talk about any conflicts I had with others (internships were basically me working alone on projects, class projects never had any big blowups that I was the one fixing everything completely) or talk about something I had difficulty learning about to build a project (it looks bad on me if I talk about learning something \"basic\" but I don't know anything too \"advanced\"?)Maybe I'm just not cut out for this field as the standards have gotten so much higher nowadays? Looking at another recent post about how bad current CS grads are there are questions that other people failed that I don't know the complete answer to without looking up the exact specifics. I don't memorize the exact programming language / package versions I use (and I'm not exactly using cutting edge features or the most esoteric library functions either). (I know it's just like project settings or looking at compiler settings but it isn't something I have memorized which I'm supposed to be doing?). I also don't have memorized exactly how the programming languages are implemented (like where exactly a method in a class is stored in python? I know it probably ends up in code memory and internally there is some data structure corresponding to that class and some kind of data structure for the references to the methods of the class, but I don't know the exact specifics like which specific implementation of methods and classes it is using internally)",

However, in the past I have also seen times where staffing firms had clients claim they were wanting to add a lot of new developers only to say that the roles didn't materialize. That happened to me in one project where a couple months in the client needed to cut labor costs and what they planned to be four main hubs in North American for in office work, they cut more than half and it became nearly all remote and offshore developers. Part of me wants to be more motivated with the positive news that I'm seeing all these new jobs being posted without ridiculous requirements, but the other part is very skeptical and thinking they're just stacking up potential candidates that they are banking on possibly needing if the financial outlook of the industry improves before the end of the year. I was hired for a project at the beginning of November last year, and by mid-January most of our team was not only done with user stories, but backlog stories, and a lot of our time was watching Udemy videos and playing pickleball until they told us our team wasn't needed like they projected as we had seven people working on a few user stories per day that only needed one person on each.",

        "content": "Some back story:A few years ago I started working for a company that was pretty small. The people were nice, I was well taken care of, owners and management were generous. We landed big clients and the company was eventually bought out for a good sum of money (at least 2 million). The owners generously gave us a big bonus for the buyout and even negotiated that we keep our jobs for at least 2 years with the new company. After the period we were eventually let go and found new jobs elsewhere.Yesterday I got a message from my old boss asking if id be interested in working on something on the side. I said id be interested in thinking about it, but my life is busy right now. They said theyd work around my schedule. I'm interested in hearing them out, but im wondering what i should ask for compensation. Development could possibly be split by another dev. And i would only be providing dev work. I'm not hurting for money, but im certainly not going to turn it down lol. Im sure they will probably offer me a wage or lump sum when we hit MVP, but Im more so wondering if i should ask for a share of profits. And if so how much? I should probably hear about the idea first before i decide, but they're smart people, so I have a feeling this idea could be profitable as well.",

The constant stress at work has drained me to the point where I feel like I have no motivation left.I’m leading a project right now, and it’s been rough. The environment is cutthroat, deadlines are unrealistic, and the infrastructure we depend on is poor. My manager is honestly quite incompetent there’s no real support or guidance. Most of the people I’m working with have been struggling too, and aside from a couple of reliable teammates, I’ve had to pick up the slack for others just to keep the project moving.I’ve been fighting to unblock issues every single day, often taking on extra work to make sure we don’t fall behind. But now we’ve hit a problem , I missed some edge cases earlier in the design, and we might need to pivot to a new design for a small part of the project just a week before launch. I fully accept my mistake, but I can’t stop worrying about how this will reflect on me. With deadlines approaching, I’m terrified this will affect my performance review or even put me on a PIP.What’s making it worse is the exhaustion. I’ve spent so much energy fixing things that were never really my fault in the first place, finding workarounds, reviewers nitpicking and getting alignments, and now that I’m facing my own blocker, I just don’t have the will to deal with it. It feels like I’ve been holding this project together while slowly falling apart myself.I’m not sure what to do at this point, part of me wants to keep pushing, but another part just wants to stop caring altogether. Has anyone else gone through something like this? How did you handle it when you were stuck between burnout, guilt, and fear of being penalized?",
