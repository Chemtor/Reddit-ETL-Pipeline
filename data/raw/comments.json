My husband mentioned he seemed to be of Asian descent, but it was hard to say for sure. Weirdly enough, the guy still managed to answer some pretty tough Java questions and even spotted issues in code with no problem.\n\nA few days later, we randomly saw a video showing AI tech that can fake someone‚Äôs face during a video call ‚Äî the example showed a low-res, vaguely Asian-looking face... and it looked a lot like the guy from the interview. ü´†",

Pandas and MySQL aren't going to allow your machine to run at their full capacity on a project like this. You *can* do it, but it just isn't what they were designed for.\n\nInstead, I recommend using tools like Polars and/or DuckDB.  Armed with those, you can run analyses on data this size (and bigger) with a laptop, stream through terabytes of data, and imagine what you're going to do with all the money you just saved on cloud spend. \n\nHappy coding!",

First gig was moving a company from solely paper to Microsoft Access.  Things have changed in the intervening years and while ‚Äúselect * from <table_name>‚Äù still works, my SQL is rusty as hell - so feels like starting over from scratch.\n\nAnyhow, I am going through a lot of free resources, but I need to be more disciplined with the learning and actually finishing projects/courses.  Bad ADHD keeps me starting or reading about new tech, but not actually fully understanding them before I move on to the next shiny.  The tech environment is festooned with tons of shiny stuff that actually gets in the way of finishing a project.\n\nSo, been doing the DE ZoomCamp free course.  It‚Äôs a bit janky, the instructors vary in quality (although I really like Alexei) and not everything is straightforward, but I think it‚Äôs a pretty realistic way to learn DE.  Real life is not going to be laid out well either and projects will develop their own idiosyncrasies that have to be navigated.  \n\nAlso taking Joe Reis‚Äôs Data Engineering course on Coursera.  It‚Äôs very AWS focused, but I think I‚Äôll be able to sit for the AWS Data Engineering Associate Cert with some extra study time.  I‚Äôm not a certificate enthusiast but the job market seems to like them, so why not help our your resume.  It‚Äôs very streamlined and I am only in course 2 but he does talk about the non-tech skills DEs need to have to do their job.  That‚Äôs been helpful.\n\nAlso looked at Joseph Machado‚Äôs StartDataEngineering newsletter.  That‚Äôs been informative and has exposed me to some new ideas.  Since it is a free news letter, it doesn‚Äôt hurt.  I also joined a couple of groups that SeattleDataGuy has running over LinkedIn, but haven‚Äôt really done much with them at the moment.  \n\nThere is a LOT of noise in the DE space, with ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù pushing a ton of crap on hopeful DEs, so being skeptical of some of the recommendations is wise.  My LinkedIn is flooded with them since I put a data engineering focus to my profile.  \n\nI have a couple of ideas for some projects I‚Äôve been mulling over.  I have one in mind to grab all the publicly available BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics) data/projections and then see how they‚Äôve revised them in the following months.  I am curious to see how (in)accurate they have been since they‚Äôve started.  \n\nGood luck and feel free to DM if you want to bounce ideas around.",

At least in my experience, the key thing to remember is that you get charged for the time the warehouse is turned on with a minimum unit of one minute. That is, assuming that you set your warehouse to auto suspend after 60 seconds. If you didn't do that, I would definitely suggest starting right there.\n\nTo that end, the more you can get queries to execute in batches together the better. If you've got something waking your warehouse up to run a two second query every minute, it's just going to keep the thing on all the time.",

That'll make a significant cost decrease. \n* Dont stack tables on top of each other in layers if you dont really need to. e.g if your table is almost 1:1 from your staging to your gold layer make bronze and silver views then gold a table -- Conversely if some of your long running queries have a lot of joins on heavy views then make those incremental tables \n* Last one - heavy filters on CTEs where possible",

IMO that's not a basic tech stack, a cron pulling some data directly into powerbi is basic, that's a tech stack powered by three separate vendors that can get very expensive.\n\nThe first question is: are you part of the product the company is making or is it a cost center?  I assume you've priced out what it would cost and what you expect it to cost in a year, in addition to how long you think it would take to move to that stack?  So that's the first place you can sell it, that it will return you more money as part of a better/more robust product feature or that it will be cheaper overall than paying devs to maintain these scripts.\n\nThe second question is: what does it give you that you don't already have?  A very reasonable question you might receive is 'yes it's a hack but it's working for us, is rewriting it the most important thing to be pursuing at this time?'  Like if all the data is there and I just want to see a report about how many frobnozzles we foobricked and or how much uptake my great new feature is getting and you're like 'first we should rewrite the entire tech stack' you need to be able to articulate the value of it beyond 'these JS scripts offend my aesthetic sensibilities'\n\nThe third question I would ask is what are the long-term expectations of you in this role because IMO startups don't actually need DEs, but since titles in this industry are relatively meaningless, it's possible that what they really want right now is a 'data analyst' (often code for 'pbi monkey'), so the third question to me are everyones expectations aligned here?

Would it have been easier if they'd done a DW from the outset, long before I joined? Yes, but then adoption of Power BI might not have taken off and the whole initiative could have been binned.\n\nMuch better to provide business value quickly, in a way that's horrible behind the scenes, and then sort it out incrementally while adding more business value steadily.

Or god forbid, in the case of business logic mistakes, let your end users find and report the issue? No, you write code using LSP so you see syntax errors before your compiler does, you write unit tests so your business logic is verifiably correct, you write integration tests to make sure your unit works in correspondence with a larger system - these are all ways that we shift the problem discovery / fix left in the development cycle as much as possible.",

With that said, I feel qualified to speak on it as a data engineer given I've devoted the past ~3 years to this problem and I'm writing an O'Reilly book on the subject.\n\nFirst and foremost, \"shift left\" pulls from already established paradigms in security and DevOps; and applying that to data. The core problem in those two spaces was disparate and high volume changes that downstream teams could no longer manage, and thus responsibility needed to \"shift left\" to upstream software engineers to manage such requirements.\n\nKey to this is not just shifting responsibility, but making it as easy as possible for these upstream engineers to engage in the desired practices within their existing dev workflows. Thus \"shift left\" isn't respective to where you are in the data lifecycle (e.g. upstream vs downstream), it's clearly looking at application code if we are following the same patterns it was established in other domains mentioned earlier.\n\nThus, \"shift left\" in data revolves around prevention at \"design time\" as compared to \"run time\" like observability (both are valuable). This is why data contracts are core to the shift left narrative in data, as it validates if changes meet expectations within the CI/CD process.\n\nHere are some great resources if you want to learn more:\n\n1.

I really want to emphasize that before my next comments, as you did ask for a roast =). Also really appreciate you showing your limitations and where you asked for help in this. \n\nNow for the actual roast part...\n\nWhile I have no issue with the whole ETL as a tech process and completely agree with it, I wonder if going for a full analytics/column-based solution as your destination was the right call here. From what I understood, you want the users of your product to be able to look up the weather for their next climb. Meaning your back will probably have to serve data a couple of rows at a time, at most. Look up a crag, get the weather, yeah no it's bad, look up next crag, and so on. But no aggregation on the average yearly temperature at 6pm every day on all the crags in Cumbria. The first example is a row based workload, or transactional; the second is columnar, analytical. Parquet and duckdb are really good at the latter, no so much at the former.\n\nI understand you tried using PostgreSQL then failed and went to duckdb in order to make some progress, that's good. Going forward I really think you should give PostgreSQL another try, it's way better suited to what you want to do. Also it has a great extension (postgis) to deal with geodata, which you will need to. For the same reason I think you would benefit from reconsidering your data model, as I think a fact/dim approach is going to be deserving you. Your model feels like you had to forcefully bend it in order to fit in. Sure, it works, but there's a lot of tension between your data and the model. Don't know how to express it otherwise.\n\nHope it helps, don't hesitate if you have questions, I'd be happy to provide further guidance if needed.",

I would say Python is a quick and easy language that is the most broadly used in data. So learn it.\n \nOrchestrate: airflow has been around a long time and is very good. Some people tend to say it‚Äôs way harder to get setup than the ‚Äúnew‚Äù stuff. Usually they used an old version were a lot of things needed to be managed for the system to run correctly. Then you have ‚Äúnew‚Äù orchestrator in the market which try to make it easy like Dagster, prefect, mage.\n\nClean and transformation : you have the python frameworks (pandas, polars), you have your sql engine (DBT, trino, presto), you have spark, you have your DuckDB.\n\nMost compagnie would be fine with an up to date version of Postgres. But they usually run old 2010 version of sqlserver that run REAL slow, so they think they have a lot of data and switch to an OLAP system when they migrate. If you heard something like I have a LOT of data to transform. 1 million rows, 10 million rows, 100 millions rows you can assume that the company DOESN‚ÄôT have a lot of data at all. And that any db would work. If it‚Äôs 100 millions rows every hour that‚Äôs another thing but usually people talk about their global table size unless they have really a lot of data and usually when they do they already know the solution because they already hit issues so many times with their systems.\n\nFor OLAP (managed) you have snowflake, Databricks BigQuery, Redshift.\nOLAP (OSS) Pinot, clickhouse\n\nThere‚Äôs a lot more but that cover most scenarios or ‚Äúnew‚Äù company\n\n\nAccess : you have a bunch of tools here but like tableau, power bi, sigma if you are 100% snowflake, metabase for small company, superset for bigger. And a bunch more.\n\nSo no real definitive stack but you have those.\n\nIf I was to start fresh in a new company that has received funding and that I know there‚Äôs going to be A LOT of data (multiple terabytes at least) I would probably do Dagster, DBT, snowflake, sigma, python ingestion in Dagster.\nWhy? Because if they have investors and the company is pretty small they want to delivers new things fast even if it cost them more. If the couple of new things works or fail fast then it‚Äôs good for the business, they‚Äôll hire more and continue growing the business. And the stack is pretty much all managed so you pay for maintenance and upgrades and everything you don‚Äôt have to do those things, and you can focus on business requirement.\n\nIf it was a small company that expect a lot of data with no funding, I‚Äôll go the datalake approach. Because snowflake will be expensive no matter what.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt have a lot of data Postgres Dagster python, DBT might be a good fit.\n\nThere no real stack but those are nice.\n\nPersonally I would always go with a sql framework for transformation at start not because it‚Äôs better just because sql is easy enough that mostly anyone can understand and build some stuff while python transformation can get confusing when you chain a bunch of stuff together and it require programming knowledge which not everyone has.\n\nGood luck",

It'll save you time when you decide to scale Airflow workers. E.g. use shared object storage or database to exchange the data between tasks. \n\nMake tasks granular enough for ease of retry and debugging.\n\nUse idempotency for complex data pipelines to its fullest.

Use airflow for orchestrating not for data processing, while that is not a hard and fast rule, I see a lot of failures when workers run out of memory because their pandas ingested too much data. Worst part of that is, you loose all your logs, so it‚Äôs hard to work out what went wrong.  What to do? Track the size of data you are processing and compare them to the memory you have. If you see a trend that tells you you are headed for OOM situations, export the data processing function into a serverless option, be it a k8s pod or any other option.\n2. When you download files to a worker, make sure you clean it up reliably, to avoid running out of disk space eventually. Use the tempfiles module appropriately.\n3. Avoid large xcoms. It stresses the meta data db and impacts overall processing. If you have large data to pass between tasks, consider using external storage.\n4. Avoid dags that run more frequently than once every 10 minutes. The round robin nature of the scheduler means for a non trivial setup can exceed  several minutes and you may not be able to keep up.  \n5. Avoid dags that watch for file changes and do that every few minutes (as above). See if you can have an external file watcher trigger the day instead. Alternatively space it so it checks every 30 minutes.\n6. Review the day code for expensive functions at module level. The dag gets executed every few minutes and everything at module level gets run every few minutes. So variable.get uses your database, why stress it with hundreds and thousands of such calls. Move these into your python functions.\n7. Use logging but use it judiciously, your logs can end up in your metadata base, or at least in your file system. \n8. Monitor and manage the size of your metadata base. If it‚Äôs too big you can‚Äôt run snapshots/backups.",

Distributed systems SWEs might approach things with a more modular mindset, but I haven‚Äôt seen it often. \n\n2.

But that here would mean making a useful website, and probably adding more data because if its just weather, people already know what sites are near them and its easy to just check the weather for those sites.\n\nThe other path is just going full on tinkering. I would suggest maybe getting some free cloud resources and use one of the big data warehouses in one of the clouds. Create tables there with DBT. Maybe your extra data can be weather history. Maybe there is a thermometer at some sites and you can check foretasted weather vs real weather.\n\n  \nOptimization is really not needed most of the time.

Good work! You can, for example, always add more or better data validation but what's point in that since your data source is relatively static and error in data isn't critical. Or make more efficient database schema for few thousand lines of data which is extremely little and databases handle that with ease, same goes for changing from DuckDB to PostgreSQL.

You copy from Prod data into UAT and test there to see if anything breaks, or, build in UAT pre-determined data with SQL scripts, so that results from any process / pipeline can be tested.\n\nSo test for missing columns, null data, business rules. This is also work-intensive, this approach, but DE-person agnostic. Have each DE that does a change, in JIRA, write some conditions for success. Have a person dedicated for the DevOps / UAT testing phase.\n\nA great place I worked at, every sprint rotation cycle, a different person was assigned the DevOps/UAT, so that we all gained the experience. Over time the code base improved.\n\nI've seen many companies not even have a DEV environment, only one, that is prod. Ideal is 3 environments, Dev, UAT, Prod. Since it's for dashboards / reporting, if something breaks, not an issue, we will fix today and tomorrow you'll have your data (maybe). So usually the VP that controls $$$$ says No Way, no multiple environments, we are not XYZ company.\n\nThen, you get to end-of-month, end-of-quarter, and a very angry VP (usually the same VP-Ahole) asking why he doesn't have his numbers at 8am for his afternoon presentation.\n\nIt's unfortunate - but remember this old & great Murphy's Law annectdote.\n\nIf architects built buildings the same way programmers built systems, the first woodpecker to come along would utterly destroy civilization. \n\nGreat reading, on The Register website, read the BOFH.

If you have like 3 tables about the same thing and it make sense to just have 1 table you join them.¬†\n\n\nThe second layer is where you test your data extensively. At this point there was no business rules applied or anything. Just renaming, retyping, null value handling at most. Your tests will return errors present in the system you extract.¬†\n\n\nThird layer is where you add your business rules. I like to make one model for each business rule as dbt with duckdb takes like 1-2 seconds for 200k rows. Having multiple transformations together is exhausting to debug, and not really more efficient.¬†\n\n\nForth layer is where I make my Kimball modeling. One fact for each thing I look at. Dimensions all around. Junk dimensions are build using a SELECT DISTINCT to only have values that happens.¬†\n\n\nJust remember to generate surrogate keys with dbt so you can joins dimensions and facts using a single column. And never join facts together, it's not how a star model work. Having multiple facts inside a single powerbi dashboard works well if you keep it classy. Also remember for each dimensions to have a default value for missing keys. Like adding a \"missing customer\" to your customer dimension.\n\n\nLastly with dbt and surrogate keys you do not need to join fact and dimensions during the ETL phase as you do not need to use the foreign keys to retrieve the surrogate keys. It's weird to not have integers as surrogate keys but trust the process.",

It maintains offsets so if it goes down it can come back up at the correct location in the log guaranteeing you wont' miss data.\n\nDebezium can publish the message directly to kafka.\n\nDebezium provides an industry standard way to stream data from postgres -> kafka.\n\nonce the data is in kafka, you can use whatever mechanism makes the most sense to consume the events, (even multiple consumers each with their own function).",

You can make them more like every 15 minutes, or every 60 seconds. It is a tradeoff between object count and maximum latency to write to S3.\n\nIf you *need* to have the data in S3 within seconds, then Firehose isn't the tool for that. You would just be writing individual objects directly. I am struggling to think why you would need low latency S3 objects -- that's what Mongo would be for.

It is big enough that sustainability and ecotox is a very big deal given the scale and there is obviously external pressure being such a big company. Small changes to supply chain or ingredients can have big implications on the environment (and communities). There is a big push internally for eco-labelling our products in the way ingredients are.\n\nThere are lots of data challenges when selling in ~200 countries with tens of thousands of products. Being able to estimate say, greenhouse gas emissions and life cycle assessment for a product portfolio right down to biodegradability of packaging types, or even how well recycling centres can detect plastics etc. isn‚Äôt easy. Tools like https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/ exist but they need very granular data right down to global sales.\n\nI‚Äôm more on the human safety side so don‚Äôt personally get all that close to it but PM me any questions if you think I can help.

        "body": "I would understand if you‚Äôre hesitant given the current political climate, but have you considered looking into the national lab complex (DOE) ? Some labs have pretty narrow research focuses, but most do work on more fields than you‚Äôd initially think, and likely have groups/divisions dedicated to what you‚Äôre interested in. \n\nThis is especially true for teams in the computational science sector, and having practical experience in data engineering and knowledge of the subject matter you‚Äôre into is very valuable. \n\nOn the upside: Pay tends to be a little better than other non-profits, though certainly less than industry. Also, while national labs are partially funded through and ultimately report back to DOE, most are actually run by contractors (Battelle being one of the big ones). This means that we‚Äôre usually treated similarly to government employees by everyone but the actual government, so we don‚Äôt (always) have to deal with the same BS federal employees are going through right now. This can also make it more straightforward to get access to certain data that wouldn‚Äôt otherwise be available. \n\nOn the downside: Most funds that come into the labs still come from other government offices like NIH, DOT, DOE, etc. So there is still susceptibility to political trade winds, especially for environmental stuff. Fortunately most research staff are pretty savvy at making subtle/small changes to existing projects to fly under the radar and appease their sponsors, as it were. \n\nAlso, in my experience (YMMV) labs tend to be insular, so it can be hard to get in, but it‚Äôs easier to move around (even between labs) once you‚Äôre in and making connections. My advice would be to make connections with staff whose research you‚Äôd be interested in assisting with. Some will be more open than others, but if they like you and need your skill set, they may be able to create a new DE position with you in mind, or at least point you to another group that might need you.\n\nETA: I ended up in renewable-adjacent work with a background in mechanical engineering and experience with machine learning. I‚Äôve learned everything I know about DE on the job, and I‚Äôm not the only person I know who‚Äôs done that. I will also admit I knew someone (outside of research) at a lab who was able to pass my resume around more directly. So I mean it when I advise making connections with existing staff. It only got me to the interview stage, but sometimes that‚Äôs enough.",

Clickhouse has data skipping indexes called bloom filters that are used in scenarios like these to filter out what data is NOT there. \n\nThere already also projection indexes that you could add to help with the processing.  You could extract specific keys from the JSON string you are trying to scan and index off that. \n\n I‚Äôm on mobile so I can‚Äôt test this in Clickhouse but a quick query of Claude gives a few examples on l indexing on the key value of the JSON string. \n\nIf those don‚Äôt work and you are running into issues, it may be time to consider a different processing engine. Spark is excellent at processing large data with distributed processing. If it needs to be in Clickhouse, you may consider re architecting the schema you need in Clickhouse and transforming the data with spark and then reloading.",

Books and official documentation are the best for that.\n- Also, most (modern) documentations (if you go to their actual websites) are very beginner friendly, offering tutorials and even (practice) projects.\n\nSo, to sum it up. Online courses/videos are in my opinion to basic and don't cover topics deeply enough. This results in flawed or missing knowledge. Therefore, I recommend books or official documentations.",

In my opinion, the three main things are the following:\n\n* Connect with people in the field. Reach out to them. Ask questions. But most importantly, bring something to the table. Share what you‚Äôre working on or what you‚Äôve learned.\n* Set learning objectives, always with a clear goal in mind. What do you want to achieve? Learning just for the sake of it can be a huge mistake.\n* Explore training programs or curriculums that interest you. Even if you don‚Äôt enroll, look into what they cover. Are you sure you have all the necessary background? One of the biggest challenges for self-learners is dealing with knowledge gaps.\n\nThe ability to self-learn is, in my opinion, one of the strongest signs of both soft and hard skills. **Don‚Äôt doubt your abilities** mate, keep pushing and show the world what you can do. Best of luck :)",

For which you need this thing called 'skill' which can be cultivated over time. Your main bottlenecked & scarce resource, however, is time. If you were going into the industry, OR if you had 40+ hours a week to spend on this, then this wouldn't be an issue.\n\nSo, you'll have to choose a very specific niche. A combination of subgenre, programming language, framework, and deployment target should do the trick. Each of these will have entire books written on them... so they're all vast fields.... but if you niche down, you'll be able to get good relatively quickly.\n\nFor example, you could just build puzzle games in javascript, using Phaser.js, for the web.\n\nHere are some more ideas.\n\n| # | Subgenre | Language | Framework | Deployment Target |\n| - | --------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| 1 | Puzzle Games | JavaScript | Phaser.js | Web browser (Netlify, GitHub) |\n| 2 | Note-taking Apps | TypeScript | Electron + React | Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux) |\n| 3 | Generative Art | Python | Processing (py) | Web gallery / local renders |\n| 4 | Pixel Art Platformers | Lua | L√ñVE2D | Desktop executable |\n| 5 | Mobile Business Apps | Dart | Flutter | Mobile (Android & iOS) |\n| 6 | Markdown Formatter CLI Tool | Rust | Clap | CLI via Homebrew / Cargo |\n\nThe worst thing you can do is dilute yourself into many different fields.\n\nIf you were going to enter the industry, I'd tell you to diversify. But you explicitly don't, so don't diversify ----- put all of your limited time into one specific combo.",

You need to research/evaluate these trade-offs and decide, which side your projects want to be on.\n\nTraditional databases are on the left side and provide a lot of \"safety\" and strict reliability for clean data.\n\nNoSQL databases typically fall on the right side. They sacrifice a lot of \"guarantees\" for scalability. If you choose one of these you have to consider issues that might occur from \"eventual consistency\" and not being able to really rely on the data structure returned by your database.\n\nRelational databases offer quite flexible queriing. Need to now which `Product`s a `Customer` has added to their shopping basket? SQL can query that! Later, need to now which `Customer`s have bought a certain `Product` (reverse)? That's just another SQL query! You don't have to change your database structure to support that.\n\nNoSQL often are not that flexible. If you structure your database to efficiently support the first query, it won't be as efficient to support the second query. Worst case, you'll have to completely restructure your DB to support the use case.\n\nParadoxically, NoSQL makes it very simple to store/retrieve an object structure, without much upfront-thinking about how your data looks like. But as soon as you do more complex queries you need to know **exactly** how you're going to access your data.",

But just because hammering a screw doesn't work doesn't mean that hammer is a bad tool.\n\n**edit:** Reading the rest of your text, you are very much bad at OOP. No, a player isn't an enemy, wtf were you thinking? You already had a common base class, use that. Besides, an \"enemy\" isn't even a class in itself, nor should player be. They are just specific characters used for specific purposes. You're trying to inherit roles or behaviour, which is bad. Create one character class that supports \"can be controlled\", then player is just an instance that's controlled with mouse/keyboard while enemies are instances that are controlled automatically.\n\nSame thing with your archer/mage example. Being an archer is a playstyle, a role, or a behavior. It's still a character, use composition to indicate its roles and/or weapons that it uses. One useful tip is to think of \"can this change at runtime?\" If the answer is yes then use composition. Can a character become a building in the middle of the game? Uh, no. Can an enemy become an ally? Yes, people change their mind => use composition.\n\nAlso I have no idea what your issue with the Button is. Yes, use composition. Is checkbox something you can press? Then inherit from button. Or just use button as-is, and disable its \"lift automatically\" property so that it stays down (\"checked\"). You don't even need two separate classes, just one button.",

You *should* of course think about the relationships between different objects, and you *should* prefer interfaces/protocols and containment over inheritance. But at the end of the day, what you really need to do is to be willing to aggressively refactor as needed. And that has little to do with OOP specifically... you're bound to make some mistakes as you write code in any paradigm, and you have to be willing to reconsider past decisions and change course.\n\n>Your object can't be two things at one.\n\nOf course it can. That's practically the definition of *polymorphism* \\-- \"many forms.\"\n\n>Let's say you have fighters, archers and mages in your game - three classes. At some point, you want the player to be both an archer and a mage. How do you do that without complex or ugly workarounds like creating another class named FighterAndMage ?\n\nWell, you *don't* do it with an inheritance graph like Object->Character->Player->\\[Fighter|Mage|Archer\\]. Instead, you could give the class that represents a player an attribute, like \\`role\\` and a corresponding \\`Role\\` type that sets the expectations for what a Role is. Fighter, Mage, and Archer *could* be derived from Role, or they could just be instances of Role -- i.e. all exactly the same type of object, but with different data. For example, it might be that any role can hit an adversary, and any role can cast spells, but a Fighter might just hit harder, and a Mage might have a higher probability of success with magic. If a player can have more than one role at a time, then the \\`role\\` attribute should really be \\`roles\\` and refer to some kind of collection or combination of the roles.\n\n>Encapsulation is a useful trait for OOP to make code more secure but getts and setters can add a lot of boilerplate.\n\nThat depends on the language. For example, in Swift you don't have to write any accessors -- you just use whatever attributes an object has. But there are implicit accessors there, and if you later want to modify them you can do so at any time.\n\n>With ECS you have a relation of \"IT HAS\" instead of \"IT IS\".\n\nWith OOP you have both types of relationships. Your concern about careful planning of the inheritance graph suggests that you've been prioritizing \"it is\" over \"it has\" when in fact you should usually do the opposite.",

I use OOP for polymorphism, abstraction and encapsulation.\n\nModelling problem domains like you describe, with a Player class and an Enemy class deriving from Character or Triangle deriving from Shape is very rare in practice in my experience. It works when your domain is more or less fixed, and you can draft the entire type hierarchy from the start. But if there's enough uncertainty and you need to add new types to the domain over time it's just too hard to get right. This is where something like an ECS shines because it's designed to give you maximum flexibility when defining types and assigning properties to them.\n\nI also don't think that DOD necessarily conflicts with OOP. DOD just tells you to design your classes around the data and how it's mutated instead of modeling your domain in code.",

Joe Armstrong, the inventory of Erlang (a functional/actor language) once said that he thought Kay would disagree, but he considered Erlang more \"object-oriented\" than almost any other language, and Kay agreed.\n\nNow, that's a bit of a minority opinion, but it just goes to show how widely the definition of \"OOP\" can vary.\n\nIOW, I think your view of OOP is frankly very incomplete.

Or you can specialize and go all the way in a few things in your life, being able to solve the 20% percent left. \n\nEverything is okay as long as it fits you.",

For that you just have to force yourself to read it line by line and then summarise each paragraph to yourself to help cement the information in that paragraph. \n\nI especially struggle with pushing myself to learn more, but because I‚Äôm aware of it, I can now push myself to work on correcting it. It sounds like you probably know what your weaknesses are, your best way to fix it is to find a way to build your confidence in those skills. You very likely know more than you realise and just need to find a way to change your mindset. It‚Äôs pretty common to struggle with this but if you‚Äôre looking to specialise in something focus on what you enjoy and just branch out from there. \n\nGood luck!

In order to understand why code is slow, you can look at it from an algorithmic standpoint, like for instance noticing a double for loop, meaning a potential N\\^2 algorithm, which could maybe be redone in some clever way to become O(N) or NlogN, OR you can look at it from a systems standpoint, for instance you are only using 1 thread/1 cpu core but your machine as 128 cores available, or you should be doing CPU work and IO at the same time, etc. to maximize utilization of the resources.\n\n4. I don't really think it's realistic to be able to write thing fast and efficient \"in the first draft\" as you say, it sort of goes against everything else I wrote here. That being said, depending on what kind of code you are writing, if you have a general understanding of basic algorithms like sorting and searching and so on, along with time complexity, maybe you can build some muscle for doing this just at a basic level. But I would not encourage you to try to optimize things at the system level in the first draft because usually it's more trouble than it's worth.",

Highly recommended so that you're not guessing at the impact of different options re: performance.\n\nThere's different types of programming and obviously there's areas where speed is priority but I personally don't worry that much about the speed of my code on the first draft. I'm more focused on the quality of the interfaces/organization of the code units and how the mental model is reflected in the code, etc. Not focusing on speed first helps me to only compromise the design in areas where it's truly necessary due to identified performance issues.\n\nUsually when I do wind up fixing performance issues in my code, it usually comes in the form of caching. Has its tradeoffs. Sometimes I'm also able to change things to avoid garbage collection running as often or at inopportune moments. Rarely, I'll have to do something like replacing recursion with a loop. Rarely, I need to change data structures or the way data is fetched (this matters but I just rarely make mistakes with this on the first draft.)",

Develop a good intuition for complexity (as in Big O) so you can make snap judgements about how catastrophic performance will be in a loop or whatever. Use that judgement to trend toward low complexity, so that if/when you get to an optimization pass the basics are already sane. \n\n2. Pay close to attention to your intended throughput. Think about how fast this needs to go and how often and how much data it's working on so that you're aware of how much you need to be thinking about #1. Like sometimes my brain has some complaint about a n\\^2+ array operation, but I also realize the array is only every like 10 items and it doesn't matter, readability dominates the considerations.

You'll hit a snag and realize you should have thought ahead. You'll get annoyed that you have to go back and change things. But that's how you learn. Then you'll know next time what's important and what isn't. You're a beginner so you aren't going to carefully think your way to a perfect development process.\n\nIt gets at a bigger issue with tutorials, lessons, and seeing other people's code in general. You only see the final polished product. You don't see the whole writing/refactoring/repeat process that went into it.\n\nMost of us don't write anything perfect on the first try. In a professional engineering environment there will be a lot of careful planning upfront, but you don't have to worry about that right now. Put a little thought into it but then pick something and start working.",

To take a house-building analogy, sometimes you're just the brick layer.  Sometimes you're just assembling pre-fab kits.  Sometimes you're the lead architect who does the design (UX) but also the main drawings and materials selection.  Sometimes you're the consulting engineer who does the stress analysis.\n\nNo, most programmers don't need to know much math, unless the programs you're writing *DO* math.  And even then, usually they'll pair you with a mathematician.  In the same way that the people who make medical software don't know surgery, and the people who make flight software don't fly planes.\n\nThere are times when you have to be ***BOTH*** a domain expert and a programmer.  But, often, in those cases, one or the other suffers.  Trust me; I know guys who work at Lockheed Martin who are one but not the other, and sometimes people who aren't either.  And these are the people making weapons systems designed to kill people.\n\nTL;DR - most programming does not require domain knowledge.  And, the domain is rarely doing math--or even applied math.  And when it does, it's better to work with someone who **IS** a domain expert, and learn to communicate and collaborate.\n\nThere are *MAYBE* a handful of jobs that you'll be given as a new programmer that will involve math.

If you want the \"thorough\" treatment of C, then King's C Programming: A Modern Approach is better.\n\nBeej's Guide to C is OK-ish, but I don't think it's as good as his Guide to Network Programming. I would recommend a different book if you are a beginner to C. Beej's Guide is useful if you want to see explanations of new C features like #embed or #include <threads.h>, but a major weaknesses for new learners are that there are no \"student exercises\". I suppose you could invent some on your own, but it's a sign of a good book that good, well-thought-out exercises are given at each stage that help you \"level up\" at each chapter, to help you slowly build up your \"rpgramming muscles\" as it were. \n\nBoth K&R's book and King's book do that very effectively. In fact for the classic K&R book there is also a separate book called The C Answer Book where solutions are given. But in order to get the most out of such exercises, you should first try your own solutions yourself before reading another answer.\n\nAlso, I noticed you have no book which specifically mentions assembly language. If you want to learn low level, then you need at least a passing familiarity with Assembly, in my opinion, e.g. x86, x86\\_64, ARM, or all of them. If you learn one architecture, then learning another is not as hard.",

I would focus heavily on trying to understand math on a more conceptual level or at least get enough practice to be prepared for theoretical computer science, but I consistently failed when implementing algorithms for projects. \n\nAlgorithms typically employ a type of math called discrete math, and understanding it is crucial to understanding algorithms; but you also need to understand programming principles. A lot of discrete math is, unlike the higher-level continuous math in a CS curriculum, much more intuitive. It is much more logical and ‚Äúcommon sensical‚Äù than, say, divergence of a series. Sorting a list or traversing a tree, for instance, often just makes sense without delving too deeply into the underlying mathematics. You should be focusing more on the data structures themselves than deep diving into the theory at this point. There are many clever tricks used in DSA problems (I‚Äôve always liked the sliding window problem), but this is more about creative problem-solving than applying mathematical foundations. Having a theoretical understanding of DSAs will not get you far there. Mathematical *reasoning* is much more important here. Outside of a few fields such as data science, the most math you‚Äôll use is probably basic statistics and algebra, and perhaps discrete math such as bit-wise logic and graph theory. \n\nIdeally, however, if you‚Äôre struggling with simple syntax and concepts, you shouldn‚Äôt be too focused on *any* of the math yet. If you‚Äôre not understanding conditionals, loops, logic, and native data structures, you shouldn‚Äôt skip to DSAs, since the foundation of data structures and algorithms lies within those rudimentary concepts. You should be able to solve basic to intermediate problems before DSAs. If you can‚Äôt write a program to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit or find the factorial of an integer, then you need to revisit the fundamentals.",

You have this problem, you're here, and you got this error. Ask it to help you step through the code to identify where the error happens. Ask it to help identify few different possible avenues that may cause an error that you should look to check, and how to prove if that is or isn't where the problem is.\n\nNext I would take on studying big O. You want to understand how optimized your code is. If you rewrote the same code using a hashmap or array, which would be better? why? In all scenarios? Big O helps you understand efficiency.\n\nOnce you understand that, then DSA comes into play. A lot of DSA is purely conceptual.

        "body": "> mainly copying the code line by line and aimlessly googling every keyword in the documentation while being confused by the meaning of the syntax and still unable to make anything by myself\n\nThis is an indication that you did not get enough practice.\n\nAs you can clearly see, copying the code line by line does not actually teach you anything. Even if the teacher is explaining things, and you feel like you kind of get it in the moment, that's never enough. You managed to complete your assignments before the DS&A class, so you've obviously written some code that solves problems based off the learning material and your ability to google the rest, but what you should have been doing is spending some extra time with each assignment after you finished it making sure you understand the code you've written. This could involve things like messing with the code and seeing what happens, or coming up with your own slight variation on the problem and solving that. It could involve asking other students about how they solved the problem (after it's been submitted, and without seeing their code), or discussing things with them (again, without sharing code) while working on it. If there is time to ask questions during class, make sure you ask them when you're unsure about something. If your teacher has office hours, make use of that. You don't have to learn entirely on your own, but you do have to be willing to recognize when you're not getting something and take the initiative.\n\nWhat you need for DS&A above all else is a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of programming. What I mean is understanding how things like loops, conditionals, variables, and functions combine together to create specific behavior in your program. And I don't mean at a conceptual level, I mean understanding it deeply enough that you can actually write programs that solve problems on your own (this does not mean without looking up functions or syntax, but it does mean knowing roughly what you're looking for). Without that, you are woefully unprepared for DS&A.\n\neven a solid understanding of discrete mathematics alone would not get you through a DS&A class, because in the end your assignments will be primarily implementing specific data structures or algorithms, and while that math certainly helps, it doesn't magically make you able to write code on your own. It only helps you understand what you're writing.\n\nThe only way you develop this knowledge is through practice. You need to sit down, and actually try to solve problems with code enough that you actually develop a feel for how to use the tools you've been taught.\n\nHere's an analogy. Let's compare learning to program with learning woodworking. Following along line by line is like the teacher explaining each tool, giving you a complete blueprint, and then telling you *exactly* how to make that specific thing out of your wood. Sure, you came out the end with something that more or less resembles what the teacher showed you how to make. But that alone is not going to teach you the nuance about how to actually get a nice straight cut, what steps to take to go from a block of wood to the piece you need, what order to take those steps, or any of the nuance involved with using each tool. Those are all things you develop through experience actually using the tools.\n\nCollege expects you to be smart enough to recognize when you are not actually understanding things. It also expects you to be willing and able to learn on your own.\n\nI want to be clear, I'm not trying to say you're completely screwed. What I'm saying is that what you've been doing up until now is simply not enough. You need to devote more time and effort into actually learning the material properly. If you are in a position where you absolutely cannot Devore the necessary time and effort into learning the material, them maybe you need to take some time off, self learn during that time, and come back later to finish things.\n\nConsider this: can you write a basic text based program that plays rock paper scissors against the user? If you think you can, go write it. Try the same with tic tac toe. Writing the code to check if someone has won a game of tic tac toe is an algorithm, albeit one with a single very specific application.\n\nIf you don't think you are capable of writing those, then you need to sit down and figure out how. You have at least learned all the necessary building blocks to put together to make those programs by now. It's up to you to spend the time playing with those blocks and finding out what ways you can put them together that makes those programs.\n\nIf you don't even know where to start, don't think about code at all. Think about the steps a program would have to go through, and write them down in plain English, or in pseudocode. Once you have the basic structure of what that looks like, think about how you might convert each step into code. If a step seems too complex, try breaking it up into smaller steps, then try to convert each of those.\n\nThe idea here is that before you actually write code, you should understand at a conceptual level what your program should roughly look like. Not the fine details, just a rough outline. Once you've come up with a rough idea of what your program looks like, then you know enough to actually try to write it. If you just jump in and try to write code without some idea of what your program should look like, chances are you'll have no clue where to even begin, or you'll just flail about trying to randomly slap different ideas together until you get something that works.",

What you need to do is learn to write a function that takes inputs, aka parameters. The basic idea is that you write the code once using the functions parameters, and then you can call the function any number of times with whatever values you want. You can use parameters for anything that you want to be adjustable in the function. If you write a function that draws an enemy, you can use parameters to specify the location of the enemy, but also what color(s) to use, how many legs or teeth the enemy has, and anything else that could change from one enemy to the next.\n\nOnce you‚Äôve got a function that draws the enemy, you can create a list of sets of parameters. Then, you can use a loop to iterate over the list and call the `enemy` function with each set of parameters, and the function will draw all the enemies in the list one at a time.\n\nThis is one of the fundamental ideas in programming. Computers work largely by repeating simple sets of instructions, very very quickly, with different data.",

        "body": "You need to start managing this project by capturing the business requirements and tracking how long it takes you to deliver them.\n\nThe temptation is to just work on features as quickly as you can, to the best of your ability, and try to hit the deadlines set by your manager.  *Don't do this: it's a recipe for burn-out and failure*.\n\nInstead, you need to plan your work up front, calculate how long it will take, and manage the business's expectations accordingly.  You're a junior, and your working alone, so you need to give yourself time to do the necessary research and to correct the inevitable mistakes you'll make along the way.\n\nBusinesses like *certainty*.  They are less concerned with *how long* things take; they want to know *when* they will be ready so that they can plan accordingly.  Your job is to give yourself enough time to deliver your work to an acceptable standard, to tell your manager *when* things will be complete, and to warn your manager *when* they will be late *as soon as you are able to*.\n\nBelow is an outline of how to do this effectively: \n\nYou have some high-level requirements already.  Break those requirements down into units of work that deliver business value.  We'll call those units features.  The features need to be as small as they can be, such that completing one delivers some value to the business, even if it isn't usable in isolation.\n\nAs an example, imagine you need to implement user accounts so that people can log onto the system and use it.  The complete set of features that make a complete working implementation might be the following:\n\n- Registration\n- Login\n- Reset password\n- Update credentials\n\nAll of these can be delivered as separate features.  Even though registration is useless without login (and vice versa), they can be developed independently and each add business value independent of the other, so they count as separate features.\n\nThe reason we try to make features small in this way is that it makes them closer to each other in size; therefore the time it takes to complete any of them will be of a similar magnitude.  This will be important later.\n\nOnce you have a collection of such features, you can begin working on them.  As you work on them, you want to set aside some time in your week to plan the next set of requirements while you deliver the first.\n\nIt's up to you to find the right balance between planning and delivery.  Basically you want to be delivering as much as possible, but doing enough planning that you always have something in the backlog to work on.  You want to make sure you capture all the requirements in the planning phase.\n\nYou should have a nice predictable cadence to your work.  You begin a task and you work on it until it is done.  If you have to stop half way through a task because you failed to capture a business requirement, or failed to predict a technical problem, this is an indication that you didn't do enough prep work.  We call these issues *blockers*.  They happen to everyone - even experienced devs - but they will become rare if you are able to identify and fix their cause.\n\nYou should keep a record of the features you're working on somewhere.  It could be a Trello board, a GitHub project, a spreadsheet, a list in your diary, post-it notes - it doesn't matter where it lives.  What matters is that you move features from the backlog to *in-progress* while you're working on them, and then into *done*, when you complete them; *and crucially*, you need to record *when* you completed them.  Tools like Trello do this automatically for you.\n\nOnce you have completed some features, you will have some real knowledge of how long it takes to complete a feature.  Let's say you complete 5 features over a 2 week period.  That means you have a velocity of *2 days per feature*.  *Now* you can predict how long it will take you to complete the remaining features.  As you complete more features, your velocity will become more accurate.  Maybe by the end of the month, it turns out that it takes 2.5 days to complete a feature.  Feed that back into your predictions.\n\nIf you break your features down into small units of business value, like I outlined above, you will reduce the margin of error in the prediction.  Realistically, some features will be completed sooner than others, but it all averages out over time.\n\nYou can also use your velocity to make long-term predictions.  If you count the average number of features that make up a high-level requirement (let's call it an \"epic\") then you can get a rough estimate of how long it will take to deliver an epic.\n\nDon't *guess* how long a feature will take to complete.  You'll just get it wrong, but you'll still be obligated to achieve the deadline you set for yourself just the same.  Use the velocity to *predict* how long it will take to complete your features, and keep updating that velocity.  It's a good idea to put a couple of days on the end of the prediction in any case, to give yourself some wiggle room if anything goes wrong.\n\nInitially, you won't have a velocity.  Tell your manager that you'll give him an estimate just as soon as you've completed a few features.  If he really needs an estimate now, give him your best estimate, but update it as soon as you have a velocity, and update it again every time that velocity changes.\n\nSometimes businesses actually do have deadlines they need to meet.  Once you're tracking your progress effectively, you have the means to tell your manager if those deadlines are realistic.  If you can see that you aren't going to deliver all the features required for a deadline, you and your manager need to negotiate what you're going to do about it.  You're likely to have one of 5 options:\n\n1. Move the deadline;\n2. Remove features;\n3. Hire another developer;\n4. Work overtime;\n5. Cut some corners.\n\n4 and 5 are real options, but they are riskier, and they need to be managed carefully.  If you're going to work overtime, you ought to be getting paid overtime, and you'll also need to take a holiday afterwards to recover your energy.  There is also the issue of whether or not you *want* to be the one making all the sacrifices, and whether or not your company is taking advantage of you.\n\nIf you're going to cut corners, you need to fix-up your work as soon after the deadline as possible.  Time needs to be set aside for this and future deadlines may need to be delayed.  This is called *paying back your technical debt* and failing to do so can ultimately sink a project.\n\nAlong with features, you're also going to have to perform other tasks, such as bug fixes, refactors, meetings, and so on.  You only need to track product facing tasks (i.e. features and bugs), but you can track other things as well if it helps you organise and manage your workload.\n\nBugs are an important dimension to measure.  Together with velocity, they give you a real measure of the success of your project, and some actual quantitative data to share with you manager. (Managers love data.)\n\nYou can track bugs on the same board, but track them separately, and *don't include them in the velocity*; that's for features only.  More bugs will usually coincide with a reduction in velocity, and both trends mean that you need to fix some underlying issue with your code.  Maybe it needs refactoring, better linting, or more unit tests.  Maybe it's outgrown its architecture.  They're an indication that you're either delivering too quickly and neglecting the quality of your code, or have some limitation in your architecture that you need to overcome.\n\nYou need to pay attention to what is causing these issues because it will help you inform decision you make about the project going forward.  E.g. have you finally outgrown those Google Sheets?  Or, are you spending enough time keeping your code tidy.\n\nAgain, all of this is intended to help you make room for yourself to improve the parts of your project your manager won't see and ultimately doesn't care about unless they produce a failure (which they will if they go unchecked) while providing the velocity that shows predictable progress.  You need to give yourself room to try unit testing, or some library that you need, or whatever it is you think the project needs.\n\nDon't hide these kinds of data for fear of being criticised.  You can use them to demonstrate why you need the things that you know you need.",

(which technologies get you past those early filters? that is location dependent as you've already intuited - the only way to know for you area is to check local job boards)\n\nAnother early filter is \"do they have a 4 year degree in CS?\" You don't *need* one but, again, if a company is flooded with applicants you can toss all the resumes without a 4 year degree in the trash and still have plenty of choice. If you don't, you're going to need some networking (as in leveraging and building your network of personal contacts, not TCP/IP!) skills, so work on building those up.\n\nBut the really important things are - can you *think for yourself?* Can you *solve problems?* A lot of young programmers have never really solved problems by themselves, they've either just been following tutorials or, worse, using AI for everything. Once you get past the HR filters, getting through the interview is going to be show that you've got the interpersonal skills every job needs (can you take direction? work as a team? self-motivate?), and then your problem solving and thinking skills.\n\nNot every interview is going to have a \"whiteboard coding\" problem, but all of them are going to try to do something to capture how much skill you have versus just how much you've memorized.",

        "body": "Hey! Recruiter in the tech space (building a tech talent community to upskill + place talent) here, and I work with a lot of junior devs trying to break into the job market.   \n  \nEntry levels are really competitive because of a combination of a couple things: 1) AI is replacing a lot of aspects of a junior role, 2) as a result of the AI influence, companies seemingly want more specialists vs generalists in the market rn (this is my opinion though from speaking with companies and seeing their sentiment), and 3) in general, less companies are looking to spend the time mentoring + training junior talent when they know they can use AI for a certain amount of tasks + hire intermediate/senior talent to come in and hit the ground running right away.\n\nWhat I'd recommend: build your projects and experience in a way that shows your adaptability to pick up new technologies/skills as fast as possible. Show that your insight, productivity, and understanding of how to solve a problem is there, something that AI cannot show! \n\nSome things you can do: build an awesome portfolio website to showcase your projects and present them in a case study like format (showcase your thinking and process), align your resume to the very specific skillset that the company is looking for and if you have some dream roles/companies, building projects very specifically towards that, and most importantly: build up your network. Reach out to people on LinkedIn/reddit/conferences/forums etc and build connections to learn and connect with them. You never know where a connection can lead to - I've had people that I met 6 years ago offer me a great job when I needed it most! \n\nAnd finally, as I always do, you can always check out our talent community where we help you upskill on exactly this and find directly recruited jobs for you (but ofc, you're welcome to apply outside of our community too). If you're interested, here's our website: [https://acetalent.io/join-like-a-monad](https://acetalent.io/join-like-a-monad)\n\nI hope this helps & feel free to ask any more questions!",

Know the most common attack vectors and how to mitigate them. Don't settle for \"just use library X\". Understand the principle what the issue is and how it can be exploited. Then use the library.\n\n3. Can I fix performance bottlenecks. Learn profiling techniques and caching for starters.\n\nNow you've hit the milestone that you can deliver usable software. It might not be pretty but it works and is secured against most common attack vectors.\n\n4. Can I deliver fast? Time is money and to be competive you must learn to deliver quicker. Tooling, frameworks ai come into play here. Optimize your workflow for quicker results\n\n5. Can the software adapt to changes quickly? The main goal of software maintainability is to be able to adapt to changing requirements. New market oppertunities, chaning legel requirements. Compitive software can be changed quickly. Learn common patterns and practices. Learn about software architecture for differnt levels of scale.\n\nAt this point your technical skills are what I would expect of a senior developer.\n\nNow I just ask myself the question. Can I make X?\nIf the answer is no I follow these 5 steps and expand my knowledge for each step where needed.\n \nIt looks like you are expanding your skills in step 1 and you have dabbled a bit in the others. Good. Now look at your work from the perspective of the other points. Detect issues, find and assess the solutions.

Learn about caching and some basic database optimization.\n\nStep 4. I believe that editor/ide configuration is highly personal. Try different stuff and do what is right for you. Optimize whats slows you down.\n\nStep 5. Is best if you have a solid fundation on step 1. Read up on design patterns, soft architecture patterns. At this point you should have buily enough stuff to understand where you could use that stuff effectively.",

First, you need to learn the \"alphabet\" of programming such as variables, loops, functions, algorithms and other basic concepts that are applicable to any programming language. Then you need to learn idioms for the programming language of choice, e.g., object-oriented programming for C++ or trait-oriented programming for Rust, as well as the standard library for that programming language with basic string operations and so on. Then, finally, you need to learn the chosen problem domain, such as blockchain API and smart contract API.\n\nThat's a lot of material and that's why a proper Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science takes 4 years. I rarely see a programmer who writes maintainable, usable code with less than 2 - 3 years of experience. Five years of experience is the minimum to be able to build serious, larger systems without constant supervision.\n\nMy advice: don't waste too much time on passive, video-based courses. If you want to get good at something, learn by doing. Learn a topic and start solving specific exercises for that topic using a specific programming language, hands-on.",

I think deliberate practice is a pretty undervalued method of learning in this field, and I would recommend that you apply it to your learning process. \n\nOther than that focus on learning and understanding the concepts and tools deeply. If you know what concept you need to apply to get some problem solved, you can always look up the syntax how to do so.\n\nFor example; \nYou want to parse json data from the API\n\nYou would need to use \"encoding/json\" for converting that json data to a \"programmable format\" called parsing. To do that you need to know concepts like parsing, json unmarshalling/marshalling, learning what even API means etc. \n\nYou don't need a deep understanding of these concepts first and I think they can be learned by doing projects and then asking chatGPT or fellow humans for assistance when you hit a roadblock or need further explanation. When you do project based learning you will encounter many points, in which you have to dive deep into the inner workings of a computer to get past something or after you are done building for the day, you can further your understanding on some new concepts that you encountered/applied. \n\nBasics can be drilled by practicing for loops, if statements, variable declarations, playing around with data structures like looping over them, learning some basic searching and sorting algorithms and then diving deeper into paradigms and how to identify some of the key patterns found in some of the problems.",

That's what happened to me: I was tasked with just data entry, but I saw the need for an extensive database of all companies in the NYC tri-state area for the data entry personnel, so I purchased a then CD-ROM -based business directory with appropriate data, wrote a custom utility in C++ to convert over a million records into a flat-file database format used by the company, converted all the data on my home PC and handed that huge chunk of data to my boss.

Maybe something that connects to work you‚Äôd actually do on the job.\n\nAn example for swe is developing a website or app to help companies solve a common issue or task. Then you can try shipping the website and getting users to make it more impressive. Might be a good idea to implement buzzwords like AI, popular tech stacks, etc into it too.\n\nFor data science, something like building your own ML model based on a domain-related data set comes to my mind. You can show skills like data wrangling and cleaning as well as feature engineering and model training.\n\nJust make sure you document it well. In your portfolio give a really good description of WHY you did the project and what is the value of it. If you do ship your project be sure to include stats and numbers that show impact. Companies value people who can identify and solve problems more than simply good coders.\n\nAlso ngl asking what good projects look like might be a good talking point in a coffee chat.",

You listen to a bunch of tennis teachers on YouTube explaining how to hit a forehand. Maybe you choose to imitate Roger Federer's forehand. You watch how he hits in slow motion. You shadow stroke it.\n\nThen, you go on the court, and you don't hit anything like him. What happened? There are subtleties about his game you can't see if you just watch video. Maybe you focus just on his hand, but ignore the rest of his body: his torso, his legs. Maybe you don't fully understand how he gets acceleration. \n\nYou observe things, but they still don't fully capture what's really happening because you make assumptions.\n\nOK, maybe this didn't happen to you, but it did happen to me. It made me realize looking at someone do something doesn't teach *me* how to do it. I lack a lot of information despite paying attention.\n\nI think the same may happen to you. Yes, you'll learn some things looking at projects, and yes, programming isn't tennis. Programming is more quantifiable. But, like watching a pro tennis player, looking at a completed project may not be enough to understand it.\n\nEven when the person who programmed it explains it, they're likely to skip all the beginner stuff and assume the person listening is not a beginner. If I built a website using Python and Django and you didn't know how a loop works in Python, then I'd spend forever going over the basics of Python just so you could understand it.\n\nInstead, I'd assume you know Python, you had some idea of how Django works, and then I'd go into the specifics. You'd miss out on the details of the Python language or a big picture view of how Django works.\n\nBut give it a try and see what you learn. Some of your problems with learning are likely linked to getting bored easily, but if diving in helps, then great. You can ask ChatGPT (or similar) to explain code to you, but they do have token limitations, which means you may not get much explained before you run out for the day.",

One piece of advice I can think of though that I didn't stumble into myself was that an engineer once said they view passing self/this to a method/function to be a smell. I hadn't considered that and I don't even really know why it's true if it is. Maybe it's true because it reveals a potentially unnecessary bi-directional dependency/coupling. Sometimes I can't figure out a way to prevent this where the pros outweigh the cons but sometimes I can and in those cases it seems to result in a much better design.\n\n2) Not advice per se, but, If I go back, as in really really far back to before I programmed professionally, I saw somebody diagram a program top-down before implementing it. This indirectly resulted in organizing the procedures by level of abstraction and exposed a mental model of the program to latch onto while implementing it. Thinking of things that way (or bottom-up works, too) felt like it unblocked me to create much more complex programs before drowning in my own mess.\n\n3) Some advice I got but debatably not \"software engineering\" advice, I would say it was actually a soft-skills thing. A product manager mentioned to me after a meeting that instead of saying things like \"we can't do that\" it would be more helpful/productive to say things like \"Do you think X would be a problem if we do that?\"\n\nIn other words, it really matters how people feel as a result of technical back-and-forth. I think this can be overlooked if you only interact with engineers. Seems obvious in retrospect but this helped me be more effective when communicating with non-engineers which actually made me a more effective technical lead as well.\n\nI think in certain types of software projects cross-team communication of technical mental models around the problem solution is crucial. So this was a breakthrough for me and arguably made me a better software engineer than any technical advice I'd ever received.\n\nSo I would say to your \"but I wonder if there's more\", YMMV but I would advise to focus on people stuff and notice that people problems are actually more likely to kill certain projects than technical decisions are. And also along those lines I think for certain projects the value is actually more in the understanding of the problem/proposed solution and effective communication around it than the implementation itself is.",

A gazillion people, many non technical, but also other devs, will want you to include something, make something happen. And then again, and again, and again, until finally something snaps.\n\n*\"Just one more feature man! Just one more! Please man! One more, then I'll stop, promise! I need just one more feature!\"*\n\nNo. Fuck that. Not gonna happen. Too many projects, industry and FOSS, die because of feature creep, because codebases bloat- and then blow-up.\n\nAnd people don't prevent it, because a yes-man seems to have an easier time getting ahead in his career than someone saying no, because coporate shills and useless consultants have poisoned modern corporate culture portraying saying \"No\" as something evil.\n\n----\n\n*\"Any methodology becomes useless when it becomes an ideology.\"*\n\nThis is true for everything, but by far the worst offenders of this in programming, are OOP, TDD, FP, and early optimization. The fetishization of \"memory safety\" that some acolytes of a certain language that shall remain unnamed are carrying before them like a holy relic, is a close runner up.\n\nAll of these are useful. All of these have their place. All of these absolutely have the ability to kill productivity, burn out teams, and crash entire projects when driven to extremes.\n\nSo when someone says \"Write the test before the code\" or \"We should really rewrite this in oxidized iron\", ask them why, and if their answer smells like something a missionary would say to trick people into coming to church, its better not to listen.",

If you can get through that, you can probably figure out non-game programming.\n\nC# is going to do fine at making music players or file browsers, especially in Windows. Maybe stick with that.",

Drag and drop components into the GUI, edit them right there and it changes it automatically in the code. \n\nI found it so annoying to use 2 separate programs for UI and coding when I changed from Java first.

When you need to develop something you can ask a researcher on the better technology to do that with pro and cons, and it provides even resources linked that you can check to its responses.\n\nThen you need of courses to made experience.\n\nFor me this is another windows on the knowledge.\n\nBack in 2000 one ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù feature to write in PHP was write the pagination function on blog/forum/stuff with multiple page.

They are generally tailored to specific tech stacks anyway.\n\nPutting something like that together in a couple weeks is very doable.

Designers also often expect people to behave predictably, and there always those ppl who don‚Äôt. \n\nI happen to have degrees in both engineering and graphic design and can tell you: if you enjoy coding , FE will be your cozy niche.

You must correctly escape *outputs* when you embed them in anything that's going to be parsed: an SQL statement, an HTML document, etc. (For that reason, I think that having HTML escaping in an \"input validation\" library is pretty nonsensical.)\n\nEscaping is essential for the parsing on the other end to work correctly, even leaving aside the dangers of XSS.\n\nWhen you're running JS code in the browser, and you set a property with `textContent`, you don't need to do any escaping because the string you're providing is not going to be parsed as HTML. It's just being directly passed into the DOM. On the other hand, if you assign to `innerHTML`, then the string you assign will be parsed as HTML. So if you have text that should be interpreted as text rather than HTML, it must be escaped.\n\nIf you are using EJS to generate HTML code, then HTML escaping is likewise necessary. But EJS already handles this escaping for you. (But it's very important to read the documentation to ensure you understand when and where this happens!) You can use \"View Source\" in your browser to see the escaped output for yourself.\n\n> However, is there still a risk of an attacker manipulating the code on the back-end if I don't escape the input?\n\nThe whole point of escaping *outputs* is that no matter what string the attacker puts into your database, if you escape it correctly, the recipient of your output will interpret it as that same string of text, rather than as HTML tags.\n\nReddit does not prevent me from typing `<script>alert(1);</script>` in a comment, nor should it. Me causing that string to be saved in Reddit's database is not \"manipulation\", it's just normal usage. But that's why it's crucial that Reddit correctly escapes the string when generating pages.\n\n> Finally, I know I should use parameterization for Postgresql queries. Will this alone protect my database from SQL injection (I'm use node-postgres for queries)?\n\nAs long as you always use parameterized queries, and never build queries with string concatenation, then yes. (And as long as you don't do other silly things that would enable *indirect* SQL injection, like reading a value from the DB and then executing it as a query.)",

Next time your AI code gives you an error,  try to understand why it occurred rather than just yelling at it to fix it.\n\nTimes are changing and some people have no interest in learning all that, and that's cool,  but I would point out to those people that the more they understand about what the code is doing,  why it's doing what it does,  and how... the more powerful and capable their AI output will be become.",

It depends entirely on what I'm doing. If I'm using a library and need a refresher on how something works, I'll look up its documentation. How long and how often depends on so  many factors, it's impossible to even give a guess answer. Some days it's an hour or more (if I'm learning a complex framework), sometimes I don't need to at all (if I'm doing simple stuff).\n 2. Mainly what's changed is I'm able to find information much faster. I still read docs a lot, but the amount of time it takes me to find the information I need is less.\n 3. That depends entirely on how good the docs are, and how complex the thing I'm looking up is. If the docs are good, it may take me less than a minute. If the docs are bad, I may need to find the source code of the thing I'm wondering about and figure it out myself. In that case, it may take 5-10 minutes if the source is complex.\n 4. AI is barely even a substitution for docs, especially in the beginning. You should not be using it as a replacement for docs until you're experienced enough to know when it's feeding you nonsense.",

WebGL has multiple versions and a bunch of extensions, and shares GLSL with other graphics APIs (Vulkan and OpenGL), each with their own versions - which ends up creating a mine field for LLMs.\n\nTrying to build something outside of your current abilities is a good way to grow though, it'll show you real quick where the gaps in your knowledge are and give you something to work on!

I work on systems far older than I, some as old as 50 years old.  There's programs we support written in the 70s that are 140,000 lines long and none of us have any idea what it does - but it runs every night without fail, so we just leave it alone haha.\n\nWill this put you in a \"hole\" for COBOL only?  Somewhat - the experience you gain on the mainframe is not directly relatable to other tech stacks like the cloud.  On the other hand the mainframe tech stack is much more stable than the cloud and thus your job is too and I always see mainframe roles open online for banks, insurance, government, financial companies, and larger/older retailers.\n\nI've done Mainframe Dev for a decade.  I've seen 4 migration attempts to the magical land of \"cloud\", with all kinds of unicorn farts and rainbows promised with it.  I've seen all 4 fail.\n\nWhen I was getting into it all my Computer Science class, even the professors were saying \"What the heck are you doing COBOL for?  That's ancient, it's going away, it's useless\".  Meanwhile I interned at a shop (mainframe companies are called \"shops\") over the summer and was offered a job in my Sophomore year once I graduate.  I literally had a job lined up 2 years before graduation.\n\nIn my experience coding will be 25% of your time.\n\nAn additional 25% is people that aren't mainframers (business folks, other coders) asking you \"Why did the mainframe spit out this value?\"\n\nThe remaining 50% of the time is using Intertest and your brain to step through decades old business logic and in the process learn both the program and the actual business you support.\n\nThis \"business knowledge\" will make you a critical to their business to the point they can't afford to lose you.\n\nI still play some in the distributed sandbox, debugging C# program error, updating Java classes for mandatory upgrades, and small at-home Node projects.\n\nGiven how my life turned out, I would give it a shot.",

        "body": "I keep hearing and seeing this question everywhere and want to answer this once and for all.\n\n1. The United States is a much wealthier country than most of the developed world. Look at [this link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income) of disposable income after transfers - the US is literally 50% ahead of even many wealthy European countries, and nearly double that of South Korea. So part of the reason why American wages are higher than that of Canada is the same reason why American wages are higher than that of Nigeria or Pakistan.\n2. Silicon Valley emerged as the global tech capital due to unique historical timing. While Europe and Asia were rebuilding from WW2, the US had intact infrastructure and universities pumping out engineers. Stanford, Berkeley, and the defense industry created this perfect storm in the Bay Area thanks to much looser non-compete agreement laws in California (read the story of the [Traitorous eight.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traitorous_eight) Basically a bunch of elite engineers who left some batshit crazy micromanager's firm realized they could only create their own startups by staying in California due to them not enforcing non-competes, and ended up founding Intel and Kleiner Perkins - which funded Amazon, Google, Sun Microsystems, and basically jumpstarted the modern VC scene). By the time other countries caught up industrially in the 70s-80s, Silicon Valley had already established itself as THE place for tech innovation.\n3. This created a self-reinforcing cycle that‚Äôs nearly impossible to break. Top talent moved to Silicon Valley ‚Üí venture capitalists followed the talent ‚Üí successful companies emerged ‚Üí created more high-paying jobs ‚Üí attracted more top talent. Repeat for 50 years. Now you have the densest concentration of tech talent, capital, and successful companies on Earth all competing for the same workers.\n4. The US has a massive advantage other countries can‚Äôt replicate: 340 million people in a single market with one language, one currency, and one set of regulations. A startup in San Francisco can instantly sell to someone in Florida. Meanwhile, a startup in France has to deal with 27 different EU regulations, multiple languages, and a much smaller domestic market. Canadian startups have to follow separate securities regulation for every province dramatically limiting scaling. This scale creates far more valuable companies that can afford to pay more. This effect also explains why sky high pay is available for elite engineers when adjusting for COL in India and China.\n5. The regulatory environment in the US is far more favorable than other countries. European bankruptcy laws until very recently would destroy you personally, while Chapter 11 bankruptcies were very lax. At-will employment means companies can hire aggressively knowing they can pivot if needed. This risk-friendly environment creates more unicorns, which drives up wages for everyone as they compete for talent.\n\nAll of these factors combined together supercharge American wages across all sectors of the economy compared to other even developed nations.",

US salaries seemed to go poof past the great recession while salaries in western Europe seemed depressed due to the humongous growth in eastern Europe (our technical center in Poland had a few dozen engineers in 2000, Germany and Sweden a few hundred, and USA a few thousand. In 15 years Sweden and Germany stayed stable and it would not be a lie to say that virtually all jobs from the USA ended up in Poland. \n\nOnce Polish salaries started going up they started having layoffs and jobs moving to lower cost sites within the EU (Portugal mostly). \n\nFrance is a lost cause salary wise.

That's not to say that you shouldn't document and do proper design, but balance and know when to prioritize a less perfect solution that solves the problem.\n\nAlso FAANG tries to build everything from the ground up. Need a pipeline to load data from X place? Cool, let's build it. Orchestration? Sure, maybe we get an open source tool that requires some time to set up. Or build our own taking a quarter to do so. Or use the in-house solution that does not rely on external libraries and no one else outside of the company knows.\n\nStartups are messy and sometimes cannot wait for that clean code that only uses internal libraries, passes compliance and security requirements in all known legislations including countries where they don't even have customers and optimize for the best design and algorithmic solution at the cost of spending more time planning.\n\nLastly if nothing works it is totally okey to change companies or to leave the startup world to go a regular employer where the pace is the right for you. Even if you don't get a fancy stock package (that might be worth 0...), your mental health is important.\n\nPS: some startups would rather hire from other other startup than FAANG precisely because FAANG tend to house in-house tools and focus on building from the ground up instead of just using a vendor.\n\nPS 2: IMO, 2.5 years at a FAANG probes you are a capable engineer. So focus on your weak areas.",

That's like... Principal SWE at least, and those roles aren't frequently hired externally. They may even be more of a fit for a Senior PM or an EM role.\n\nBut a regular run of the mill Senior SWE role? They're not gonna want to touch somebody like that with a 10 foot pole. They're too expensive. That person's shooting way below their belt if they're just looking for a \"senior dev\" job that isn't extremely specialized and niche to actually *utilize* their background.\n\nIf I had that experience, and I were trying to apply to \"regular\" jobs, I'd be fudging my resume to make myself look like the type of candidate that gets hired into those \"regular\" jobs.

Their 10 years as an AI/ML scientiest may or may not be relevant either. So that would leave them with... 13 years of SWE?

I'm just making assumptions here though\n\nI have 12 YOE, and I apply to Senior SWE roles and get them just fine. Even in the market of 2024, which is when I last job hopped. When I can do the job just fine... why would they try to hire someone with 38 YOE that's probably asking double or triple my salary?\n\nIf I had 38 YOE, I don't think I'd be targetting the same roles I'm targetting today.

Not saying this guy couldn't learn or like pick things up, but if you have people with the exact experience you're looking for in the exact tech stack within the last 5 years, you'd probably go for that guy right?\n\nEspecially with a work history that long, he's gonna have to tailor his CV to every job he applies for to make it fit. I'd have cut all the project/program management stuff, the thought leader stuff etc and try and make relevant experience fit into a two pager, but depending on the order and timeline of his experience he might be screwed anyway. More is not always better.",

But then COVID hit and a bunch of tech jobs moved here, and it made the housing market go completely batshit crazy - and it was largely because a bunch of people with a bunch of money flooded the market.\n\nAt the same time, that drove salaries up - because to afford working in Austin, you need to afford living in Austin. The issue was that salaries didn't increase in every sector - so teachers and government workers got completely fucked. But us in tech? Doing great.\n\nNow, Silicon Valley and NYC are a different story - those are cities where that cycle of salaries -> people -> housing has been going on for decades now. Now things are someone shifting because jobs are moving out of Silicon Valley to lower cost areas, and that implications of that are going to be complicated.\n\nNow, offshoring - yes, it's 100% tied to cost of living differences. Not just housing - it's also food, services, healthcare, etc. But the same issue above at a city level also happens at a country level - countries with great quality of life and resources can offer better pay to attract more talented people who then have more money to spend on goods and services, etc.\n\nI do agree that the US has a ton of opportunities to lower cost of living - and I think you're right that housing is a big one (with healthcare being the other one).\n\nAnd I think you're also right that the nimby movement is extremely damaging to our ability to deliver affordable housing.

How cheap do you actually think good offshore devs really are? Latin Americans are now being paid almost as much as Western Europeans nowadays. Talented senior devs in India are making six figures. The truth is that offshore salaries have increased a lot in the past few years because as more work gets offshored the costs go up since there are only so many quality devs out there. Also, an effect of that is that the cost of living in places like Latin America, Eastern Europe, India, etc. is increasing because now that they have more money to spend, realtors can now increase the prices of rent and houses over there. So the cost of living in different countries compared to the US is not a static thing, and I think that there is good reason to believe that the cost of living abroad is going to catch up.",

You just need to find something that is remotely close to writing software (even if it‚Äôs embedded and you want to do web, for example). If you get a job, work there and build your resume until the market improves. Then go find a job you actually want. \n\nAlso, reach out to recruiters in your area. Friend every recruiter you meet on LinkedIn and ask about openings. They can help you set up more interviews. Make sure you emphasize that you‚Äôre a quick learner and are excited about a company, even though it might seem boring to you.\n\nThe worst jobs to apply to are the ones posted on job sites that allow remote work. They will get thousands of applicants. Find the ones that no one is applying to, if possible. Also, go to meetups in your area that are relevant to your industry (the MeetUp app I think is still around for this.)\n\nWorst case, get a job at a software company as a QA person, support person, or a sales engineer. Then after working there awhile, express your interest in moving to a dev position. It‚Äôs way easier to move inside a company than to be hired from the outside.",

Sometimes you just need better work-life balance and actual teammates instead of being a one-person army.\n\nMy advice: don't make any big decisions while you're burned out. Maybe take some time off if you can, then think about what kind of environment would actually work for you. The skills are there, it's just about finding the right fit.",

I would use whatever PTO time you may have to take a break in the short term. Do something you like, something that will completely take you away from work. In the long term I would seriously consider switching jobs. I understand that it's easier said than done in the current market but at least with a current job it might make it easier and if you can pull it off it will be worthwhile in the long term. If you're getting burned out this early in your career, then that's a sign that something is really badly wrong as burn out rarely goes away on its own without major changes. So make the necessary change before you completely burn out.",

Everyone has already gotten new jobs; typically within a few months and typically for more money.\n\nAs another anecdote, I've also job-hopped recently and got multiple offers ranging from smaller companies to FAANG+ at 3 YoE. I\"ve also noticed an inveease in recruiter contacts since late lasy year.\n\nAlso anecdotally, we've been trying to fill a position in a major tech hub and we're really struggling to find qualified candidates. Almost 20 candidates have made it to the final loop and nobody was good enough to hire. We're not even asking for a lot; just some typical Leetcode medium/OOP/system design/behaviorals.\n\nNot sure why this sub's experiences tend to be negative. But imo, if you have several YoE, then the market is pretty decent - nowhere near the absurd covid period; but not bad either.\n\nNew grads do have it kinda rough; especially those without internships or networks to help them stand out. We have sent out job postings at a new grad level thay recieved thousands of applications within a day (though the vast majority were unqualified due to visa, no degree, etc).",

You don't want to be in a situation where your employer's expectations exceed your abilities. It's a great way to lose your job. Take the big tech gig for experience and let them teach you how to be a TL. Then revisit the the startup scene in 3-5 years.\n\n\nEdit: I've been reading over your replies to other comments. You're making a lot of incorrect assumptions that will damage your career. I won't enumerate them again, as others already have done. Don't take the startup role. It's high risk/no reward.",

Do what you can to prepare for a layoff. Start looking for other jobs. If you can get interviews, do the interviews. Try to get a financial buffer. You may not have a long time to accumulate savings, but cut back on whatever spending you can, if your financial buffer is small. Maybe have some thoughts about long term investments you can sell if you run short on money.\n\n3. Don't worry. When worry can be turned into practical action to mitigate risks, take those actions.

A little closer to home, think about Kubernetes and Docker - again, *absolutely world-shattering* for the industries it affects, a market of somewhere in the $200B range, that replaced entire teams of inefficient human labor... but it's just part of our tools today, and it had a net positive effect on jobs.\n\nI think it's not going to live up to its promise, my guess is we'll see a \"crash\" more like we saw with cloud tech 20-odd years ago. The 10% of useful tools will stick around, and the 90% of AI cash grabs / unsustainable businesses will die off.\n\nAlso, most forms of gen AI are **currently** *wildly* unprofitable - the market is currently operating under the assumption that costs will fall dramatically, and/or benefits will continue to improve.

        "body": "You might need to think about if you hate this specific job, or if you hate \"working\".\n\nDaily standups, time tracking, etc are all pretty standard in the industry. If those things are draining to you... even if you take a year off to refresh, you're just going to immediately get drained again once you start working again after the break.\n\nThat's why I always recommend *against* people wondering if they should go for the nuclear option of taking a year off in order to combat burnout. Taking a year off will feel amazing, you'll be super happy during that year, but you're going to just burnout again the moment you get back. Taking a year off will not be a magic fix. You need to try and actually fix the root cause of your issue. Taking a year off is treating the short-term symptoms, not the long-term root cause.\n\nI hate working. I only work so that I can afford to live my actual life. I have a very clear separation between my work life and my personal life. I don't like daily standups, I don't like time tracking, I don't like pointless meetings, I don't like having to be available 9-5 M-F. I don't think anybody does. But we all do it with the understanding that yeah, some of it sucks, but we do those things because we get a deposit into our bank account every other week that lets us afford the things we actually like doing.\n\nAs for where you're in your career, it's also not a smart move. You have a year of experience. That puts you firmly into the \"entry level\" category, which is objectively the most difficult category to be job searching in. When you're that early into your career, everything is very fragile. Taking a year long break now, versus taking a year long break when you have 5 YOE are completely different. When you're mid-level, you have a lot more stability, and your re-entry into the industry will be *significantly* easier.\n\nAll that said, it's also not a smart move financially. Early in your life is when the money you save is most important. The money you put into a mutual fund today is going to be worth *a ton* when you're older. The more money we have stashed away, the more money we make. The rich get richer. When you intentionally nuke your entire life savings to do a big year long trip, that's a decision that extends far beyond the immediate impact. Sure, immediately you lose $X. But you also are losing a very significant amount of unrealized income that would've made if you had kept that money invested.\n\nEven setting aside the income aspect, money you have saved is supposed to be your emergency fund. Sure you can afford to live for a year without income... but what if something unexpected happens, as often happens in life? What if god forbid you get into a car crash? Now you need to buy a new car, and you have 5-6 figures of medical bills. What if your sister has a destination wedding? Now you get to decide if you want to miss your sisters wedding, or shorten your vacation to be 8 months instead of 12. What if a million other things pop up? Financial planning isn't about the \"happy path\".\n\nI'm all for taking a year off, traveling, living your life, etc. But I think you need to do it for the right reasons, and you need to understand all the costs and risks associated with it. Personally, I would wait until I had at least 5+ YOE before even considering something like that. If my job sucks, I'll find another job, not take a year off. Anecdotally I have enough money saved up to live for over *a decade* without income. But I still understand it'd be a massive financial decision to actually go voluntarily unemployed. Having the money to do that, doesn't mean you *should* do that.",

My earliest resume that is not really polished and kinda embarrassing got the attention of a FAANG company, another FAANG-adjacent company, and a mid-tier but large multinational company. They are interested even though they would need to do visa sponsorship (non-US).\n\n2. I failed a lot in my initial interviews at multiple companies (including the only FAANG) since I'm really rusty with interviewing. I was so burned out by the experience, I try to not be such a tryhard anymore. I go into interviews thinking I wouldn't be able to clear it anyway, but at least I'll get free mock interviews with the best engineers in the industry. I faced a lot of unfamiliar tech questions, but I try to do bruteforce and optimize based on patterns that I know. I answered behavioral questions as transparent as possible even though it wouldn't put me in the best light. After the interviews, the recruiter will give me great feedback especially on the behavioral questions, which I thought I obviously bombed. Coding interviews and system designs are also mostly positive, only I bombed the FAANG-adjacent one due to communication issues I think.\n\nJust like you, I think luck does play a major factor in my process. I didn't get into FAANG (or adjacent), but got a few decent offers. I'll keep grinding for the future opportunities. Whoever is reading this, don't give up, I hope things will be better for you.",

Even at big tech companies with rubrics and strict criteria for assessments, the human factor is still the dominant component. The overwhelming bias is to hire who we want to work with.. Now, a corporation could never admit it, but that's the basic truth: sales skills matter tremendously. People who come across as easy to get along with, humble, and earnestly interested in the companies problem carry a massive advantage.\n\nWhat I see in a lot of junior engineers is good tech skills, but not great public speaking or sales skills. If you want to distinguish yourself, figure out how to speak in a compelling way, and learn the basics of how to make a sale. You don't need to become an expert, but just avoiding mistakes means a huge difference.",

You've got the problem solving skills down which honestly matters more than most people think :D\n\nFew things that'll serve you well though:\n\nFirst day, don't overthink it. Be curious, ask questions about the codebase, understand the product you're building. Most people forget new devs need context on why they're building something, not just what.\n\nThe \"work your ass off\" mentality is good but be smart about it. Focus on delivering quality over quantity. I'd rather have someone ship one solid feature than rush through three buggy ones. \n\nOof, and the biggest pitfall? Not asking for help when you're stuck. Senior devs expect you to get stuck, they just want to see you've tried to figure it out first. Give yourself 30-45 mins on a problem, then ask.\n\nAlso, document everything you learn about their systems. You'll thank yourself later and it shows you're thinking beyond just your immediate tasks.\n\nResearch background is actually an advantage in startups. You know how to dig deep into problems and you're used to figuring things out independently. That's valuable.\n\nOne last thing. build relationships with your teammates. Grab coffee, understand what they're working on. Technical skills get you hired but relationships help you grow.\n\nYou got this :)",

The tender requires they have x number of employees, that they have been in business for n number of years, and that they exceed a revenue level. They also require they charge no more than some ridiculously lowball rate like 250 euros a day. \n\nOnce the three vendors have been selected, an independent contractor \\*must\\* go through one of them. Even that is hard because many of the big clients demand that the ESN's only send them employees of their firm. They do that so contractors can't just up and quit without giving 3 months of notice. \n\nSo, even if you're the best in your field, the guru; you'll never be able to get a decent rate because even the ESNs' hands are tied by their contractual obligation to only charge the agreed upon amount.",

And of course, the biggest issue: there's no way of verifying almost anything people say. I'm not saying that people always lie, there's a lot of frank and honest discussion that happens. I'm saying that you can't tell when people are lying, because you don't know who they are, can't really verify anything, and there are zero downsides to lying.\n\nI would also not call it representative.

But I did apply to 7 PhD ML comp bio programs (6/7 rejections and only Columbia downgraded me to masters with a \"priority track\" to PhD but at 80k I couldn't justify taking that much debt).\n\nAfter realizing that I wasn't getting in anywhere I panic applied to a bunch of MSc Math programs at home, albeit I think I botched the applications without contacting any potential supervisors since they're all funded, but a supervisor at Waterloo was like you have a strong background so I will vouch for you to the adcomm and you should get in. Quite frankly after the clusterfuck of my PhD applications, I'm quite skeptical of what he said as all the potential supervisors said the same when I was applying for PhDs.\n\nTbh 6 months later I've realized I couldn't mentally get myself to spend another 5 years as a broke (PhD) student and im a bit glad i got rejected.\n\nBut you are correct, in that I need a thicker skin. The whole reason why I've managed to come this far was because I was overselling myself (I started my first ML research internship knowing zilch of ML) which has exacerbated my inferiority complex over the years.\n\nI am just not used to applying for hundreds of applications and going through multiple rounds for industry positions.",

It's still¬† fundamentally a software engineering job. You will get more ROI by learning Docker than reading the latest reinforcement learning paper.\n\n\nThere's definitely training of models but that's not all.

So yes super maths heavy, its not just training the model, they build the model.\n\n3) Other roles are more applied, but you still need a lot of maths, you need a solid understanding of the models and the statistics behind them. You usually focus on finding solutions for business problems. For example, the current models might not work well on the specific use case that your company need. Perhaps you can fix this by transforming the data, maybe you need another model, or maybe a call with that PhD guy who wrote his thesis on that corner case\n\n4) You are also often expected to know about back-end and cloud stuff; again to make sure your models are brining value\n\n\nSome love their job, but for me its just been exhausting - its fun to have a fast pace for a bit‚Ä¶ but now it just doesn‚Äôt stop.

It's probably a lot of math from the perspective of someone asking if something is a lot of math. It tends to be some fairly basic probability and statistics. (Let's put it this way... I have a math PhD. You have quite possibly taken more probability or stats than I have. I do, however, have the ability to catch up fast when I need to.)\n- What do I do? Designing models, training models, analyzing experiments, building data pipelines, integrating the model with the service that uses it. I'm honestly not sure the last time I called an API in the webdev sense. That said, the backend work isn't all that different from webdev, though it's not a CRUD application (but then neither is all webdev).

During my time in university a lot of people mistook me for a CE or EE major; I had more interviews aligned with hardware work.  Most of my CE & EE friends could only find web related roles.\n\nIt's not as glamorous as other areas in tech, but IMO it feels more secure.  The shortest I've been unemployed was 1 week.  The longest was 3 months.  Average has been 6 weeks.  Oh, and I get to charge a premium for my age because the pool of talent skews older.  Currently I'm the youngest on the team by 20 years.  Chances of working in big tech are a bit lower (I have), but so is the stress much lower IMO.\n\nTo put this in better perspective, while there might be 1000 web dev jobs in an area and have 1000000 people applying for them, there's probably only a measly 50 hardware jobs, but only 200 people applying to them.\n\nEDIT: want to throw some extra flavor into the mix?

The mental health stuff is no joke and honestly sounds like you went through something really intense with that whole family situation realization.\n\nLook, the 3 year gap thing... yeah it's gonna come up in interviews but it's not the career killer you think it is. I've seen people with way bigger gaps get hired, especially in tech. The key is how you frame it. You don't need to go into all the personal details. Just say you took some time to deal with family issues and explore entrepreneurship, then pivot quickly to what you learned and why you're ready now.\n\nThe fact that you were getting recruiter calls right after graduation tells me your technical foundation is solid. CS First Class from a good uni + those A-levels? That doesn't just disappear. But yeah, 3 years is long enough that you'll probably need to refresh some skills.\n\nThis might be controversial but have you considered doing a bootcamp to get back up to speed quickly? I've heard Metana actually get a fair number of people who already have CS degrees that wants to update their skills or switch to a different stack. It's way faster than trying to self-study everything and the structure might help given what you've been through mentally.\n\nThe business thing with your friend though even if it didn't work out, you learned something about building products and working with customers. That's actually valuable experience, don't discount it.\n\nFor the immediate job hunt, maybe start with some contract work or shorter term projects? Less scrutiny on the gap, gets you back in the game, and you can build up recent references. Once you have 6-12 months of recent work under your belt the gap becomes way less of an issue.\n\nYour technical skills are still there, just need some polish. The mental health journey you went through actually shows resilience even if it doesn't feel like it right now.",

If you think you will struggle to become motivated to succeed in school after the gap, then maybe it isn't a good idea.\n\n> I got pretty deep into math and cs competitions, and I feel like I would forgot most of what I‚Äôve learned after the gap year\n\nI was once told by a professor of mine that learning something is not about retaining that knowledge, but how quickly you can *re-learn* it. Everybody forgets over time, but if you know something, it will come back to you quickly after being exposed to it again. That rings true, in my experience. If you feel confident now, you'll be fine later. You'll be taking university classes, not doing calculations for the moon landing. There is plenty of time to ramp back up in first-year courses.\n\n>  I‚Äôm kind of afraid that this would ruin my career\n\nIt absolutely, and I cannot stress this enough, *will not*. I know more kids who burned out after college from the endless grind throughout their whole student life than I do those who \"ruined their career\" before it even began. I actually don't know any of the latter, but a lot of the former.\n\n> Some people also told me that I can take a gap year anytime, so I should spend my most meaningful years at school with friends.\n\nI can get behind the friends part, but both a gap year and going to school with your friends are very valuable things to spend your \"meaningful years\" on, though I disagree that meaningful years as as limited as that sentiment implies. Also, you'll make a ton of new friends at university, and being a year older won't change much there. 5-10 years, maybe, but you're still a peer to everybody after only 1 year away. That opportunity won't change.\n\nTaking your gap year *after* university is way more likely to effect your career, however. You'll hopefully make some connections at school, and having those connections be fresh as you look for jobs is a big deal. Applying to jobs or grad school while you're in your last year is much easier, especially if you're interning somewhere that may want to hire you.\n\nThis is absolutely the *best* time to take a gap year, but if you do take it you should know what you want from it, even if that is just time away from the stress of the student grind.",

Bonus is that manager didn't last very long after I left, I think his lead dev leaving like that might've put a stain on his record.\n\nThat really is the most realistic option, to find another job. There's a reason there's a cliche that people leave managers, not companies.\n\nTrying to transfer internally is always an option if the company is big enough.... but the manager that hates you probably isn't going to say very good things if another hiring manager asks them about you. Worth a shot though. Have you discussed with your manager about transferring internally? Depending on how much they hate you, that might actually be a *good* thing in their eyes, they finally get to get rid of you. But if they're super petty they might want to see you fail more than they want to get rid of you.\n\nSide note: Unless this manager came in after you joined which is pretty common, or there was some major culture shift, you should take this as a lesson to reverse interview more thoroughly to gauge if it's a good culture fit with the team. Every team I join I join with pretty high confidence I'm going to mesh well with the team, and especially my hiring manager. I ask a ton of questions during the reverse interview. The times I get gotcha'd are when managers are changed after I've joined.",

I was a math major turned cs double major (right at the end) but with no internships because most of my coursework and summers were concentrated on math.¬†Here is my anecdotal experience + experience from friends:\n\nIf you have published papers or extensive research you could try going to Quant/ML/AI directly. All of my smartest friends were able to do this w/o previous internships but that‚Äôs because they had much better research experience than your average good student.\n\nIf not (like me) and you just had some casual experience, I would just shotgun companies. FAANG is pretty hard (I got someee interviews at these¬†even w/o experience) but there are plenty of amazing companies out there that aren‚Äôt FAANG, many of which may be impressed by your background. I myself had little coding work experience and barely knew the tech stack but you will be surprised on how far math experience can go.\n\nIn general, if you have taken grad level math courses and have some decent projects, I wouldn‚Äôt be too nervous. There are plenty of other math individuals who would find this interesting and take a shot, it just might not be as straightforward as the dude next to you with 2 meta summer internships.\n\nGL!¬†",

So I decided to make an ATS-friendly resume just to be safe. I used both Claude and ChatGPT to create it, and according to those tools, I got a near-perfect ATS score.\n\nBut then I ran the same resume through sites like Rezi, ResumeWorded, Teal, and Simplify, and suddenly the score dropped to less than half. Each of them then suggested fixes, but only if I paid for a subscription, which is usually around $40 a month. That feels kind of ridiculous when you're actively job hunting and not even working yet.\n\nI know Rezi is well-liked on this subreddit. Teal gets a lot of praise on LinkedIn. ResumeWorded pops up in a few other places too. Honestly, it feels like some subreddits are just being run by the dev teams of these resume sites.\n\nOut of all of them, I actually like Simplify the most for autofilling job applications. It does about 80 to 90 percent of the work, which is great. But again, the \"pro\" features cost $40 a month.\n\nSo here's my question:  \n**Is there a good resume tool that actually helps with both autofilling job apps and making your resume ATS-friendly without charging a crazy monthly fee?**  \nI'm not too concerned about the resume template itself. Mine is already clean, has no columns, and is pretty much done.\n\nWould love to hear what tools are actually working for people here.",

I am looking for embedded engineering jobs and I am not sure if I should include my management title on my resume. \n\nSituation: \nI have been working for this company for 5 years. 3 years ago my manager left and they decided not to back fill the position. But with that I stepped into more of a leadership role on the team. I went on for about a year and half until I finally discussed it with my boss and he agreed that  I had been leading the team better than the previous manager. \n\nFor the next year I would be dragged along saying my promotion is still with HR and I would follow up ever 2 weeks. Finally at my review in the beginning of the year it went through, but there was no pay increase, just my normal merit increases which I was pissed about because I have been doing the job of a team lead for the past 3 years with no additional compensation. \n\nAnyway the promotion was from embedded software engineer to software development manager. But it's more of a team lead / supervisor / product manager role. And I am still performing development tasks.\n\nShould I put the software development manager on my resume if I am looking for a developer role? Or should I keep embedded software engineer and just include my leadership responsibilities under that job title?",
