Ideally data-science should help create new product that creates the income that pays for the data-platform. If that isn't happening in your company, then either your team, or your company, isn't executing well.\n\nTo give a view of how it can go wrong from the other side -- as a software-engineer turned data-scientist -- I've found myself in more than one company where the data-engineering team have been so absorbed their need to write code as fast as possible to write data as fast as possible that they've created an effectively write-only database.\n\n90% of my time in such places was just trying to do joins between Kibana, MySQL and some file in an S3 bucket no-one quite remembers (\"ask Tony, he wrote that one...\") in order to excavate a dataset.\n\nI've been able to manage this, but I've also hired people primarily for their skills in mathematics or statistics for whom this is a ridiculously large ask.",

Calling people gods. Unit tests bad! My language only language, other languages dumb. Then you have the younger generation thinking that is how it should be.\n\nYour goal shouldn't be built the next AI model myself or the next social media app myself. It shouldn't be leetcode hard. It should be being part of a team who can work well with others, learn good practices, and be productive. Then if your side project spawns the next tiktok then good on you. And then when you make it maybe you won't be such an insufferable tech bro CEO.\n\nAlso, think about insisting you talk to lower managers and tech level people when gathering requirements and during development and testing. Instead of being buddy buddy with upper management and product managers. Shit is more likely to work right when you actually talk to the people who have to use it and give them some ownership in the development process.\n\nThank you for coming to my deranged rant",

Even if you’re not using it day to day in a DE role, you’re likely to encounter something of a systems design interview with at least some of the companies that you’ll interact with where you’ll be asked to describe the system you would have implemented and how you’ll go about scaling it. If anything, having the ability to do this will give you a significant leg up on other candidates.\n\nAnyway… I was previously in similar shoes as yours, and the way I went about prepping for interviews \n\n- picked up a few Raspberry Pi devices, installed Ubuntu \n- installed k3s as a lightweight kubernetes distribution\n- used helm to install Kafka, debezium, spark, minio, Postgres\n- went through some tutorials to wire up a basic data pipeline \n- built out a CDC pipeline from Postgres to debezium, to Kafka which was batch ETL’d via Spark to Hudi tables hosted on minio block storage \n- then hammered the hell out of it with test datasets from Kaggle and similar sources to flex and stress the pipeline, lathered, rinsed, repeated\n\nCould be an unpopular opinion ^^ but food for thought ;)",

If you’re constantly moving things from multiple platforms onto the same platform that would make sense. Or if you’re doing proof of concepts across other platforms it could make sense. But typically you pick a platform (AWS + Snowflake or GCP + BigQuery, etc) and stick to it.\n\nData vendors with unique formats:\n- outside of a few industries like specific things are standardized for interoperability(healthcare, logistics, banking), it’s pretty common for each vendor even for the same “flavor” of data to do it their own unique way.\n- Ex. I work largely with POS (point of sale) data and literally every POS provider implements things differently and we have to standardize how order discounts, line item discounts, taxes, refunds and partial refunds are handled per system. They also come in all different formats - JSON via API, CSV via S3, TXT via SFTP and we have to have a pipeline per vendor.\n\nTribal knowledge:\n- Yup, pretty common. Most teams suck at documentation. We have started hiring dedicated business analysts into our DE team so that they can document sources for our teams of analysts.\n- 4 years into a role I still find out some new random fact about how data is handled in our company. Same for a coworker that’s been here 15 years\n\nAs-hoc ingestion:\n- Fortunately we have a roadmap of priority sources to ingest. But if a big enough client or a VP in the business starts getting loud about needing something then ultimately their new source gets prioritized. And we almost never have analysts or subject matter experts on the data we’re ingesting. So it’s usually ingest  it and then see what complaints we get. Sucks lol",

My final role as a software engineer was a team lead in an insurance company. We had legacy C# desktop stuff, legacy web stuff (ASP.NET/PHP/ColdFusion), and more modern web stuff for the time (ASP.NET + Angular). I still used to write a lot of data engineering-like tasks in this job - financial services, so tons of integrating with SFTP servers and writing/ingesting XML everywhere. Heavy SQL Server stuff underpinned all of this, which is how I ended up in data.  \n  \nMy track in data was BI developer -> data engineer in wealth mgmt (Python/BigQuery/dbt) -> data consultant (Azure/Databricks/Synapse) -> tech lead in retail (Python/BigQuery/dbt) -> senior engineer in security for retail org (Python/BigQuery/dbt for analytics, Splunk for SIEM + security automation).  \n  \nI am a very code-heavy data engineer. Everything I do is in code except for dashboards, which I wish I could change. Regardless - and I get downvoted into oblivion here a lot for saying this - I don't view data engineering as anything close to software engineering. The needs, requirements, and use cases are all entirely different. Your average software engineer will fail even the most basic data modelling task these days. Most don't know SQL or even touch a database directly. Your average data engineer will struggle with anything beyond a basic CRUD app. They are different specialties and the code for data pipelines is simpler by many orders of magnitude. I have watched this time and time again with data engineers thinking they can just switch between the two. I even think if I tried to go back to my old ways in the C# ecosystem I would have a really hard time (forgetting that I'm about 10 years older now...)  \n  \nAny pivot is possible, but keep in mind it will take a long time. It took me something like five years to fully move to data engineering after a complete reskill, and that was still with my prior SQL history. I was just lucky that I had all the soft skills in my back pocket so I could get promoted easily. re: stakeholder stuff, I've always had to do things and figure out requirements on my own, so I think you need to develop that part of your brain a bit.",

In that meaning I think that data engineering is a subset of a software engineer, you need to know which SWE tools you should focus to solve your specific problem. That is the same for any engineer such as a front-end, back-end, computer graphics or embedded devices.\n\nPersonally having experience as both for me makes me able to talk with any kind of engineer to understand how data is generated and how it can be integrated in any part of a system (from internal data generation until front-end). \n\nOf course each company has a different concept of the same role.

This part has a lot of SWE potential if not low code especially if your company has its own ingestion framework.\n- transformations - depends how and data is transformed, if by some declarative way like sql then the role feels like analytic engineering more. If transformed in python, then also depends how custom is the transformation framework. The more custom the more SWE. Here also a lot of data analytics and modeling.\n- Serving data’s - same as ingestion\n- infra - more dev ops\n- security …\n\nSo to sum it up: data engineering is very broad discipline.

But for old projects being migrated it's a very time-consuming transition.\n\nA score-based linter (like pylint) instead simply gives you a score.  And it's up to you, and your automation to determine what the minimum score needs to be to merge into prod.  \n\nWhen I had to migrate a 110,000 lines of dbt that was (of course) a nightmare, we set up a process that would automatically reject any PRs using a number of rules.  Basically, the worse your code was the more you had to improve it.  The PR was appended with linter failure info, and the developer had a lot of flexibility - the decisions were made at the PR level, not the file level, so the developer could have a nasty file that was hard to fix and so decided to make improvements to other files instead.  We didn't care.\n\nThis process allowed us to force the codebase clean up to have gradually, so it didn't cause much hardship.  Just had to be patient and wait.",

Or it is because the Hash table will still remain so big after only selecting the needed keys that it will through a OOM?",

I work in mobile gaming, unfortunately going full Google stack is the pragmatic choice. They take 30%+ of your revenue on the store, admob takes an indisclosed % of ad inventory and for marketing ads your also having to trust their pricing algorithms - oh and pay for search ads, which is a straight up mafia style extortion :P Add to that the tooling, we are going Google in the order of millions- 10s millions a year. For that wonderful cost, you get broken products and some incredibly sub-par support - as a company they are so segmented that none of their business facing staff actually know anything with any practical depth. The only way they could be worse was if they were ironsource or Apple.\n\nAWS on the other hand are a dream.\n\nI'm starting to think the migration to cloud was a mistake. The idea 20 odd years ago was less code to manage and simple environments to deploy, with more reliable backend. Most cloud suites are a bloated mess, with skill and time requirements slowly creeping up to just having a dedicated backend team. Also, the nature of being a black box with slow response to business issue, they are becoming unreliable at scale.\n\nGranted, when it all works my life is a dream.

Not much to talk about there, so I'm going to assume that you do have a job that you are hesitant on leaving because of stability concerns in RL.\n\nIMO, there are three main factors for you to consider about stability. \n\nThe first is the stability in the role itself. This depends almost entirely on what org the role is hiring for. Roles supporting, say, the RL games catalog/shop might not be as stable as roles supporting login or service stability. Even the most recent round of layoffs within RL only affected those within Oculus Studios (at least, as far as we know).\n\nThe second is the overall trend of RL. Lots of people online seem to have a negative view on RL's trajectory since it's been a massive money-sink for Meta, but I personally would be surprised to see real mass layoffs across RL anytime soon.\n\nThe third is the stability of Meta as a whole. From what I can tell, people within Meta feel very insecure about their jobs, especially after the Feb layoffs this year. I got to witness both the Nov 2022 and this years layoffs, and from what I can tell, moral is at an all-time low right now, even compared to Nov 2022, which was almost 3x as big a layoff. Several of my coworkers across multiple teams were already on the verge of burnout before Feb, but now, people are worried about this year's layoffs happening every year. \n\nEven though everyone that I worked with at Meta seemed like genuinely good people, many voiced concerns about others stealing their work, overtaking their scope, and whatever else they need to do to get great yearly rating, because apparently even just a good yearly rating isn't good enough to secure your position, and every year, the bar raises. Given the current market and that people's livelihoods are at stake, it's definitely a reasonable concern.\n\nWithout more context about your current situation, like your current TC, financial responsibilities, or personal and/or professional priorities, I can't confidently give any solid pointers, but despite all of the doom I just posted, if given the opportunity, I would advise most people in most situations to take the job. Meta rewards you very handsomely for the shit they put you through and are not afraid to promote you in just 1-2 years if you can perform. I've heard of senior engineers breaking 7 figures because of stock bonuses and the stock's performance in the market. That kind of compensation is usually reserved for staff+, and if you can achieve even just half of that for one year, the amount you earn can be life-changing. Also, as others have mentioned, having Meta on your resume is incredibly valuable.\n\nIf I were you, I'd definitely at least try to get an offer. In the meantime, you can weigh the different factors in your life that you care about. You won't even have to actually make a decision until you get an offer, and even if you decide to not accept the offer, you can at least try to leverage that offer at your current job for a raise.\n\nGood luck!",

It's a big commitment for someone to move jobs regardless of skill level. \n\nHowever I completely agree that coding platforms can dehumanise the process and be over emphasised/ jumping through hoops.\n\nWhat I've done hiring for my teams is set up a 60 min call,  mentioning in advance we'll be talking through some SQL queries for the first half.\nDuring the call I'll have a google doc with ever increasing questions that I'd ask to solve via SQL and ask them to roughly write it down. The difficulty depends on level- for juniors you'd start with simple DML- select, where, group by, then having, then progress on to DDL. \n\nThe point of it being a google doc is that as others have noted, syntax does not matter, but you can see live the thought process and talk over.\n\nFor seniors I'd start at a higher level, and if mentioned on resume add some python/ language specific questions.\n\nIt's great to figure out where more junior people are at and what development may be needed, and most seniors breeze through and it sets them up well/ opens up discussion for the rest of the interview where I ask general probing questions about previous roles & projects.\n\nHowever I've also interviewed a ridiculous number of tech leads with 10+ year 'experience' that couldn't understand when to use a group by or explain what it does, even with forewarning.",

It is a unified programming model for distributed computing. Once we write a data transformation using Beam, we are supposed to be able to execute it on top of Spark, Flink, GCP Dataflow, and other engines.\n\nIt looks convenient, but in reality, I hardly see production use of Beam outside of GCP. Since this domain evolved very quickly, people were more interested in directly using the native API to leverage the latest backend enhancements.\n\nI have the same impression of Narwhals. Instead of using a wrapper that provides a subset of the Polars API, I prefer directly using Polars. Polars is not a thin wrapper of PyArrow. Its investment in performance improvement, stability and support of various file formats and cloud platforms is exceptional.\n\n**Choice of the API**  \nEven if a wrapper providing a universal dataframe API makes sense, I am not sure the Polars API is the best choice.\n\nI would be more excited if Narwhals adopted the PySpark API. There is a lot of code written using the PySpark API, and we have many data scientists using PySpark for their daily work. But thanks to Moore's law, more and more use cases are falling into the scale where a single node processing is most efficient.\n\nPolars nicely fits this area as a replacement for Spark's local mode. The only problem is that its dataframe API is well-designed, but new and different from the PySpark dataframe API. If Narwhals offered a PySpark-like API for Polars, like Duckdb or Snowflake, it could be a game changer for me to encourage trying Polars in small—to mid-size use cases.",

I will say this, after we got everything set up it worked well and operated like most modern data stacks.  We transformed all of our data using dbt-core and landed our data using data load tool (dlt) on our data lake using git self-hosted runners kicked off using synapse pipelines, data was not huge and all of the complexity was in the dbt project.

        "body": "Adding this to echo some other answers with my experience:  \n  \nI worked for a healthcare company a few years ago. They also tended to go with every new Microsoft product and had 0 idea of how to implement it. The non-technical directors/vp's/c-suite people would generally get sold on a product, then everyone else would follow suit or risk future promotions at best or being fired at worst. IMHO it created an environment where the politics of a given tech stack started to outweigh it's technical importance. There were tons of inter-departmental clashes between those who adopted new tech and those who held on to legacy tooling/processes. I felt the only people who stayed at that job were either ruthless ladder climbers or coasters who valued job stability over anything else. Definitely a \"our department vs. theirs\" mindset. There were exceptions but that was the general rule.\n\nYou'll find that at any job, but in healthcare (I've worked in a variety of sectors) I found this to be the most prominent and the fact that the full time role is healthcare and they use Fabric makes me think you'll run into the same things. I've not used Fabric and have no idea of it's quality outside of things I've heard second hand, but I would look at it more as a signal of what the company will be like then purely a technical issue as you presented.",

It’s definitely a tradeoff between technical satisfaction and making a broader impact (while also getting some much-needed stability). It’s something I haven’t fully thought through yet as I enjoy the day-to-day of coding to solve problems. \n\nAlso, really solid advice about being transparent with my current employer and keeping the door open.

To be transparent, I’m the primary source of financial support for me and my wife currently. Additionally, any financial support from my family will be limited to say the least. So stability and benefits are weighing heavily in my decision. It’s not an easy call, but I’m trying to balance long-term growth with near-term security.\n\nYour question about whether working with less exciting tools is worth the peace of mind is something I’m still working through. With that in mind, what enterprise tools are you using day to day, and what kinds of frustrations are you running into with them? Always helpful to hear how others are navigating similar challenges.",

Imagine a less technical team wanting to only write YAML while your core platform team wants to write Python, you can do that now.\n\nI will say a lot of the benefits of Dagster will come in a hosted version.

A trivial example, would be like a \"word count\"... I don't really see anything wrong with adding a \"word count\" column alongside the original raw data, especially if downstream datasets will also benefit from it.\n\nIf the prediction outputs are something that is totally separate from the original records, and/or if you plan to expand your ML platform to cover more models and different kinds of predictions, then it probably makes more sense to aim for an independent architecture, use things like MLFlow for tracking/registering instead of the existing DWH governance. \n\nBut there's no absolute right or wrong here, it all depends on what direction the team is going in, what kinds of skills or resources are available, etc. There's no point pursuing a \"pure\" ML architecture that is too big for you, if you are a single solo MLE and can't support it well.

To add the ML/LLM outputs to reporting layer, you just need a separate object in your reporting layer for the final consumption. \n\nOur ML/LLM versioning is handled outside of the warehouse (through an app we built) and ingested into the warehouse. We have a generic section of our warehouse dedicated to modeling the ML/LLM workflow that includes entities like document (text/data evaluated), the prompt (type 2 generated from app data that version controls the prompts) and the ML/LLM outputs of each version of the prompt that was used against the given 'document'.

The point is that is raw data, totally new. Take away the ML/LLM model used to create that data, you can't regenerate that data using SQL with the data you already had in your warehouse.

The outputs are mostly used for reporting right now and even in the case of a recommender system, ML outputs would just be stored on a feature store and repurposed for the system or other models. \n\nA first question would be, what do you mean with an ML output being closely tied to the record and how do you measure it? In a sense, all ML predictions based on articles used for reporting a related to the article itself, but how that requires funneling them again to the raw layer I don’t get yet. \n\nAnother question would be tracking lineage, output versioning and handling re-edited articles. The team uses dbt for ETL and lineage tracking, I don’t know if this would influence what integration to use. Moreover, if we were to track prediction versions, this could be handled in a feature store. But the real challenge is handling re-edited articles that must be repredicted and what integration would facilitate triggering repredictions and updates into our DWH.\n\nSo far the options have been funneling to raw layer or an independent architecture sourcing from the analytics core, processing predictions in an independents architecture, and the piping predictions back into the later reporting layer. Only draw back is looking the dbt-integrated lineaging creating a kinda black box effect. But then again, this could be tracked from the ML side. \n\nWhat do you think?",

Your suggestion is that ML models would be based on the aggregated data in later layers, be processed in an independents architecture outside the DWH, and then piped into the DWH as an additional source of raw data. Correct?\n\nSince predictions of this type would be tied to a uuid (here an article id), I’m guessing it wouldn’t matter if the ML predictions table have the schema of the aggregated tables (i.e. not a product wise schema, where each product comes in as a separate source), because the predictions table could be rejoined by uuid in the aggregated tables or even earlier, while still passing through the whole generic model.

The most trivial way when you just give SQL DB schema and ask for complex SQL that should give nice result for data visualization - this really can work with an inappropriate accuracy. This task might need highly refined prompt with many instructions (and  RAG) + good (large) thinking model that can give correct results.\n\nAt the same time, results may be much better if context is not SQL database but data model inside BI tool and output is not SQL but rather simple report configuration (JSON), generating this kind of structured output is much easier task for LLM (even small models you can self-host with ollama!) which doesn't require thinking, in fact users can get a relevant report in seconds.\n\nFrom BI end-users perspective, another useful application of LLM can be assistance with report's analysis: imagine that user opens a report, and simply chooses from menu \"Get Insights\", \"Find Anomalies\", \"Analyze trends\", \"Generate summary\" and this report's data context is passed to LLM with an appropriate fine-tuned prompt. This kind of unobtrusive AI-assistance can be especially useful for users that don't have any data analysis skills.\n\nThis is how AI can be really helpful from BI tool perspective - in fact we're implementing these things in our product. I have another ideas too which are more complex to implement - like \"chat with data\" (so user can ask & get exact answers, not just reports, using all reports/data models available in the BI tool).",

Interviewers often ask you to walk through your thought process, discussing trade-offs and explaining your choices.\n\nTo prepare, I'd recommend studying popular architectures like Lambda and Kappa, familiarizing yourself with cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure), and understanding concepts like data partitioning, replication, and consistency. Practice drawing system diagrams and explaining your design decisions. Real-world experience is invaluable, so reflect on your past projects and be ready to discuss challenges you've faced and how you've solved them. If you're looking for extra practice with tricky interview questions, use [interview helper AI](http://interviews.chat) to prepare.

Mainly because that means I do it and nobody else feels the pain lol.\n\nIf you were going from azure sql to azure sql and just wanted to handle the data copy/replication side of things so you could work in dbt from thereafter, is there a favored tool or approach you'd use if you had \\~50 databases each with \\~200 tables?  All of which are *mostly* identical in schema, but not totally?   Our group is pretty good in dbt and managing CI/CD with it.    \n  \nBut handling the replication is what's slowing me down on this project, and all these expensive tools do a lot more than replication, so in a way we don't really need all that functionality if we are cool with dbt (or maybe eventually sqlmesh but IMO it's not quite mature enough yet to where I want to use it at large scale, but maybe that's being overly conservative).  \n\nWhere I've landed for teh \"built it\" version is a data factory pipeline where we try to parameterize as much as we can so it can be deployed.  But I'm also kind of attracted to standing up open source airbyte, building out the replication for one database, exporting to json, then parameterizing that and using a github action to deploy wider.

It has a [native SQL Server connector](https://estuary.dev/source/sqlserver/) that many of our customers use exactly for use cases like yours. In addition to the no-code dashboard, you can declaratively define all pipelines in YAML so it shouldn't be an issue to manage all your resources.\n\nEven if you decide to go with a different tool, you'd want to look for CDC to extract the data from the dbs. Airbyte would very likely choke on that scale, so you'd be left with something like Kafka + Debeziu, which is a great combo, but needs a lof of operational work.\n\nIf your team is good at modeling stuff in dbt, your time is probably better spent there actually providing business value as opposed to building a data ingestion pipeline.",

Why something like MinIO instead of just straight into something like S3?  \n2. Why a Postgres database instead of a proper data warehouse like Snowflake or BigQuery?\n\nOne hurdle that you might face is that some of your ideas, as well as some of those I'm implying in my questions above, cost money. If the volume of data that you're dealing with is small (which it sounds like it is) you might explore more of a lightweight solution like using DuckDB in concert with dbt-core.

What I understood from this is that he hadn't considered keeping me around after my student/apprentice contract is up. In his mind, he can bring another student with Python knowledge to maintain the work I did and improve on it depending on future needs while he maintains control over the work and doesn't get left behind (I didn't write a single piece of code or even control the work I had done, what's important to him is that the exports I generate align with data from other systems, meaning that our work isn't wrong and that the data I generate is correct).\n\nI had already worked on a project employing the stack I mentioned in my post and so I suggested showing him a demo. We'll see how it goes from there but do you have any advice on how I could convince him to adopt this proposition or a more refined solution without him feeling like he will get left behind ?

Also, licensing is a big thing in my company so using open source technologies is prefered.\n\nAgain, I suggested PostgreSQL because it's what I've used so far in my career, it can easily be used as an Relational OLAP Data Warehouse. More so, as stated above, the company generally doesn't use Cloud Storage and everything is stored on-prem.\n\nWhen it comes to volume, the exports from SAP BO stated in my post are done monthly (For now). When I say this, I mean that the data fetched is monthly data and should only be fetched once a month when it is available. However, in cases where our business scope changes, we can for example fetch other information that wasn't necessarily captured during a previous export (by choice or otherwise). Our SAP BO queries are scoped to our business needs which can evolve on stakeholders' demands.\n\nDo these clarifications change your input on the matter ?\n\n  \nThanks a lot, I appreciate the time you've spent to guide me through this situation !",

These tables usually have all attributes in a json object\n- raw table: using DBT, I define a raw table per source table, for the purpose of inserting every change per primary key, while keeping the table attributes in that json object column for now. I add metadata columns like load time and table key+current time+attributes to give a sort of historical key that's unique over time. The insert only approach compares the last state in the dw vs the incoming state to check for any difference, and to capture deletes.\n- flattened view: using DBT, I copy the metadata from the raw table, then expand out the attributes object into columns.\n- curated view: basically select star of the above, but with descriptions, added privacy tags (for tag-based masking), etc. this is what analysts see.\n\n\nWhy I use this approach:\n- it's dead simple to maintain because even if the source attributes change, the raw layer still bundles them into the object column\n- new columns getting captured can just be added at any time from the view, ie object:new_column\n- keeping the full history is auditable and allows analysts to see what they \"knew\" at a given point in time, which can be very valuable in some circumstances, e.g. seeing how long it took for user status to change.\n\n\nThe above is a rough description so lmk if you need me to elaborate",

Combine this with[ Dagster's IO managers](https://docs.dagster.io/guides/build/io-managers), you could implement a custom IOManager that uses the [Azure SDK for Python ](https://pypi.org/project/azure-storage-blob/)and delta-rs to handle the storage operations, making the process asset aware and tracked in your Dagster environment.\n\n[Windsor.ai](http://Windsor.ai) could streamline part of your data pipeline by handling the extraction steps before writing to Delta format. Their platform specializes in data integration with connectors that can extract data from various sources, feeding your Dagster pipeline.\n\nIf you're encountering authentication challenges with ADLS, the simplest approach is using Azure's [DefaultAzureCredential](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-dotnet) in your Dagster code. Consider exploring [PyArrow](https://pypi.org/project/pyarrow/) with the Azure Storage SDK, this allows you to create Delta tables locally and then upload them, avoiding mounting storage in containerized Dagster environments.",

OOP works great with huge, complex programs.\n\nYet, there are even smaller programs that can greatly benefit from OOP - provided, you have the right use case.\n\nFor me, a prime example are card games. Here OOP can really play its strengths in simple, fairly small projects.\n\nThink about what you need for card games: you need cards (obviously), you need a deck, you need players (also obviously), players have hands (the card hands, not their physical ones), and there could be much more.\n\nExactly the nouns above: Card, Deck, Player, Hand translate very well to Classes in OOP.\n\n+ A *Card* is a class modeling a single playing card. It has a suit, a rank, potentially a numeric value, potentially, a front and a back, and it is either face up or face down. It can be flipped (toggle face up/face down), can report its suit and rank, and value *provided* it is face up, otherwise it should not reveal its values.\n+ A *Deck* is a collection of cards. It can be initialized, can report its size, can be shuffled, can deal 1 or more cards.\n+ A *Player* models a human player with a name, potentially some money, a hand (the cards they are holding), a bet, etc. Of course, it can report all that.\n+ A *Hand* is basically similar to a deck of cards, but always directly related to a player.\n\nWhen you have this fundamental classes above and add a Game class where you define the rules of the game and how the game rounds run, you can quickly whip up any card game.\n\nEven better, by just changing the game class you can make Blackjack, Poker, and many more games by reusing the other classes you have previously made.\n\nSure, you could just as well do all that without OOP (and it has been done plenty times already), but overall the OOP code will be much cleaner, much more modular, much easier to maintain and reuse, much shorter in total than its non-OOP counterpart.\n\nReuse is one of the advantages of OOP. Another is *encapsulation*. The outside, the program that uses your classes does not need to know anything how the inside works, how it stores its data (state). The outside always \"communicates\"/\"interacts\" with the class/object through well defined and limited channels, pretty much in the form of a dialogue. The program asks the class/object for something and the class responds.",

An object contains data about itself, and methods to manipulate that data, so other objects can \"communicate\" directly with it, without having to know anything about how it is built.\n\nThe example you supplied is just a single method that does some procedural work on some separate data, so you don't get any benefit from doing it more object oriented.\n\nBut imagine a game, where different players have different health and shield-status, different inventory, equipped weapons and so on. Every item in the game is an object, so that when one player hits another with their weapon, you don't have some central code that does all the calculation, but the Player1 object sends a message to the Player2 object, that they hit it with WeaponA - Player2 then calculates the damage delivered by WeaponA, subtracts its own shield, and adjusts their own health-level. Maybe even deciding to hit Player1 back.\n\nThat is all done by code inside the Player-object, making it seem more like the objects are \"communicating\" than running a procedure.\n\nSince many processes - in games and business - can be modelled as entities communicating, OOP lends itself very well to that way of thinking, and it is \"easy\" to transfer an abstract model of a system to independent objects, than to a huge procedural program.\n\n  \nSmaller procedures, like parsing a text, calculating shortest distances or sorting data, usually don't benefit from using OOP.",

Encapsulation is what makes object polymorphism possible, and it’s the core thing that distinguishes OOP from procedural and most functional programming.\n\nThe point of encapsulation is that it limits how much of the system you have to keep in your head at one time. At its best, you can focus on the responsibilities of a single object and trust that other objects are doing what they’re supposed to do. This is in especially important when you’re on a team where someone else is writing those other objects.\n\nOne place where the rubber really hits the road with object-oriented encapsulation is in the enforcement of invariants. An encapsulated object can make more guarantees about its behavior than a publicly mutable struct. To understand whether a struct is in a valid state you might have to look at every place that has mutated it, whereas to understand if a mutable object is in a valid state you should (ideally) only have to verify that its constructor and setters properly maintain its validity. You can think locally rather than globally.\n\nThe other place where OOP has a leg up is extensibility. When you encapsulate your objects by writing to an interface rather than a concrete implementation you gain the ability to add new implementations of your interfaces which will interoperate with existing code, without having to modify the existing code. This is also very important as the project increases in scale.\n\nI’ve written a basic [blog post](https://jnkr.tech/blog/abstract-data-types-and-objects) on the tradeoffs involved in choosing between proper objects and imperative abstract data types which you might find interesting. ",

They usually try to introduce it with some flimsy metaphors of cats and dogs and bicycles and wheels and then have you memorize the four tenets: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, without really giving a good reason for why OOP embodies these tenets better than any other paradigm. To their credit, it’s difficult to see the benefits until you are seasoned enough to start working on larger scale coding projects.\n\nFirst, let’s get this out of the way: OOP is not strictly superior to procedural programming. Different paradigms are good for different things. We also don’t choose one paradigm over another because of performance reasons, or really anything involving the computer. Paradigms are solely concerned with how we, the humans, conceptualize the code we’re writing. At the end of the day, every program is in an imperative paradigm once it gets compiled down to machine code.\n\nProcedural programming is great if what you’re coding is best conceptualized as a procedure; AKA a series of instructions. If you’re writing a python script to run some preprocessing tasks on your ML model then it makes total sense to take a procedural approach.\n\nHowever, let’s take the most stereotypical application of coding, software development. Say you’re developing an app like Microsoft Word. Is Microsoft Word better described as series of instructions, or as an object? In this case, OOP makes much more sense because you are developing a *thing*, and that thing is composed of many smaller things like buttons and menus and widgets. It makes it much easier for our brains to decompose the task of coding Microsoft Word into manageable subtasks in a way that effectively reduces complexity.\n\nIn reality, most languages these days include elements of many different programming paradigms, there are very few languages that are purely one paradigm. This is nice because you don’t have to commit completely to one paradigm if there are little parts of your project that would be better done in another. JavaScript mixes OOP concepts with functional programming which works well for web developers since functional programming is great for dealing with network protocols.",

As a tool in the toolbox it's sometimes useful, but as a default I think it works far more poorly than procedural or functional paradigms for most problems. Done cleanly it can certainly work, but it's rarely done properly and often results in much more complication than is really required.\n\nAs a learning pattern it is something that really seems to \"click\" with people in theory, but implementing in practice it brings in more natural bias about how things \"really exist\" even if that doens't make sense for the actually requirements for the code.\n\nYou can frequently see this with beginners who want to do something like write a game, the first thing they will is start listing out object types and quickly realize that half the time \"Enemy\" should be a \"Unit\", but other times it should be a \"Targetable\" or something and often end up with inheritance trees that look like spider webs.\n\nWith practice you can learn to manage this better, but it never fundamentally changes the fact that model isn't actually that great in the first place.\n\nI think a lot of people have spent so much time hearing the supposed benefits of OOP that they have never seriously questioned that fact.",

Management tells you to add a feature so buyers can be enticed to buy a new version, and the more you look at what has to change to make the feature work, the more impossible it seems.\n\n\nObject-oriented code is a way to manage complexity, and make it possible to add to the code without having to understand all of it. It does that by encapsulating data definitios together with the code for the operations that can be done on that data, and helping separate one object's data and code from another's.",

For example, stl containers like std::vector fit the bill. They're much easier to manage mindlessly than any alternative you could write in C.\n\nYour examples don't even make sense, since you're using std::map and std::string, which is pure OOP. At least write your procedural example in C, not C++. You're comparing OOP to OOP. It doesn't stop being OOP just because you use raw functions that themselves utilize class objects.

Github is just one of many tools that harness the power of Git. You can practice using Git directly on your own machine without using any other tool (and without even using code) if you want. You can just use a text file and practice committing and merging changes to the text via git.\n\nThe basics are, essentially: You have a code base. You want to make one or many changes to that code base, but you want to keep the current state intact so you dont lose your functionality. You create a branch, which is an exact copy of that same code base. You make your changes to the branch. You test the branch. If it's a failure, it doesn't matter because the \"main\" branch hasn't been modified yet. When you get it to work properly, you merge your branch into the main branch. Now your main branch reflects the changes you've made. Repeat. \n\nIt gets a little more complicated when you've got many people working on many branches at a time, which is when the pull requests and reviews come into play. That stuff exists so that someone who is familiar with the code base can be a second set of eyes, check your work, make sure there aren't conflicts with other people's work, etc. The whole construct exists so there is an easy way to do parallel development work on the same code base without actually changing the working code before the changes have been tested and reviewed.",

        "body": "I think when trying to learn it often ends up sounding more confusing than it actually is as a concept. Obviously there are layers and layers of complexity but at first I would try to understand at its core what it is. \n\nImagine there’s a massive library of handwritten books and your team need to make various amendments to different ones. Someone has written a list of requirements for you. \n\nYour team divides up the tasks. Your first task is to remove any mentions of parrots from “My Life as a Hamster (1974)” - don’t ask why. Better not to ask too many questions in this team. \n\nTo do that, you check out the single book (My life  as a hamster) from the library and tell everyone else you’re doing it for transparency. \n\nYou do your stuff. \n\nNow you could just go and pop the book back on the shelf as you’ve finished but what if you’ve made a mistake? Instead you put it in a little box for “review” and your other team mates can have a look and check they’re happy with your work. Once they are, it goes back in to the library. Yours is now the correct version for that book. \n\nOf course you don’t want to shut down the entire library while you do your job which is why this strategy of checking one book out, making changes, getting it reviewed and putting it back in works well. \n\nEveryone can be doing different tasks at the same time. The library itself remains central and “pure” - hopefully with your robust review box, no mistakes are getting in. The library is a single point of truth - everything in there has been approved and checked and is correct. Any mistakes are picked up in review. \n\nNow instead of a library, as a developer, what you’re working on is digital. \n\nIt means that people are working on all different books (files). Sometimes people might even be working on the same book but doing a different task. While you’re doing your hamster task, someone else is updating page numbers in all rodent books including your hamster one. \n\nSometimes this can cause a bit of confusion if you make changes to the same page but luckily Git gives you a nice simple (ish) way to fix these and decide which changes to keep when there’s  such a conflict.\n\nMost importantly, to reiterate, despite all these complicated changes all happening at once, the library itself is pure and “correct” - because people cannot make changes and put the book back. They need check out books, make changes, then put it into the review box (make a pull request) and others in the team must approve it before it goes back in (gets merged in) to the library. \n\nIt may help, moving away from the library analogy, to imagine the alternative. Imagine word documents named version1, version2 etc. imagine everyone trying to change it at once. Everyone saves their own local copy. But someone else has changed the same bit you were going to. Whose bit goes in? Soon nobody has any idea which version is the right one. People are no longer copying the original. - they  are copying version 17. But oh wait, while you were doing something, version 18 became available and now all those changes aren’t in yours.",

Even with just the basic libraries and a couple of headers.\n\nI ran the preprocessor (clang++ -E) to check how many header files the compile opened and parsed as part of the compilation of the code above (which has only two #include directives); it processed 1,420 header files. Both of the header files I included referenced others, that referenced still others, and so on. Ultimately, the compiler is doing A LOT during the compilation stage even on trivially simple code.

It is only my opinion but here we go.\n\nEmployers won’t except you to know everything, but they’ll expect you to know the basics very well.  The tech industry is built on tons of abstraction. In our ‘modern times’, new, complex, shiny technologies are abstracted away to a point where using them is very easy. This makes it more and more common for underlying concepts to go overlooked.\n\nAn example is the frontend web development world today. We constantly see new shiny web frameworks that make the development precess so much easier, and alongside them, the big frameworks trying to catch up. And as a result we see teenagers ‘vibe coding’ SaaS apps with minimal understanding.\n\nThis is a slippery slide that makes you feel productive and confident in your programming abilities. Makes you think you can definitely land a job already.\n\nIn reality, most employers don’t need people who can use new tools. They need engineers who can solve difficult problems. To become an engineer you need to have a very deep understanding of the fundamentals before going into the advanced stuff. Frankly, the fundamentals are not even about one’s ability to code or use different technologies, but rather theory that you learn by reading and practicing with pen and paper.\n\nIn my opinion, the best way to land a job is by mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (that means reading books and studying them, not solving random LeetCode problems), Networking, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems and Unix, Databases and RDBMSs, OOP, and the cherries on top - a low level language (C or C++ - understanding explicit memory management and having the need to implement everything on your own is very good for practice), and a high level language (Java, C#, Go, Python, JavaScript, etc - pick your poison).\n\nOf course ’mastering’ these concepts is subjective. There is no right answer as to at which stage of that exactly, one will be able to land a job. However, learning about all of these concepts to a decent extent is the fastest way to land a good job in the field.",

However you've probably already done this in school, even without knowing! \n(Learn other principles depending on the role, front end roles might require some specific front end framework knowledge for example)\n\n\nMost job interviews required a technical round where they want you to create a simple app, like a small CRUD app. Dont overcomplicate it, use local/ram storage and a framework you know well enough to do this in. I'd say most jobs will just use a coding platform like leetcode for some simple problems though!\n\n\nYou don't have to know everything off by heart, the first couple months at your job you'll learn a lot of things. Feel free to feel \"dumb\" or imposter syndrome. Just ask a lot of questions when you start, even if they're basic. Even 3 years in I ask some basic questions about new things I'm learning!\n\n\nIt might seem daunting but with the skills you've listed I think you're better off than many other people.

The language was optimized for being easy to create compilers, which led to all sorts of weird compromises. Some of those choices, like requiring all variable declarations to be at the top of the function, have been fixed, but quite a few oddities remain.\n\nAlso, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and C# all adopted a fairly similar basic style. Their function declarations, for instance, can look quite similar. But that doesn't mean that the style is \"simpler;\" other languages just choose different conventions. They're languages, after all. Different languages make different choices. Go's not really much more complicated than C; it's just that its functions look a little different. You get used to it pretty quickly, and then it's just as readable. Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of Go's style decisions, but I wouldn't call it \"complicated\" in comparison to something like JavaScript.",

Long commands that we use once likely require consulting a reference and iterating a few attempts, same as programming in general.\n\nCode organization is a separate topic. Experience on larger projects helps. Some frameworks nail it down for you and have strong conventions around where things go. Often we're working in a legacy codebase, and we use the organization that's already there, or we might rework it to make it better organized. There are methodologies for how to organize a codebase and some work better than others. Use of packages and modules are widespread for larger projects, but single-file apps exist. Layers are overrated. Verticals are better. Functional core, imperative shell. Try to avoid dependency cycles among modules. Some codebases have a single main that everything flows into, while others have multiple entry points. Culture varies with ecosystem. Python thinks flat is better than nested, but Java likes to nest a lot more.",

Back then our knowledge had to be deep or we couldn’t get anything done.\n\nNow, it’s completely different, and much much better. The IDEs have language assistance. The number of external packages we can use is really large. So, now success in the trade comes from having broad knowledge of what is available and how it fits together. The ability to pick up a package and rapidly figure out how to use it is helpful. None of that relies on syntax memory.\n\nTeaching techniques take a while to catch up to reality.\n\nThat being said, I still struggle a bit with syntax when my work requires me to switch languages.",

For example they enable you to POST data to databases in single calls or in bulk, form webhooks to execute an API call with a method (e.g., POST, GET, POST_JSON, etc.) to a specific endpoint based on a trigger, specify configurations on an application (e.g., single API call to enable/disable setting, specifying version and dependencies in a webpage hosting application, etc.), and so much more.\n\nThe syntax in my opinion is really straightforward. Data is contained in curly brackets, structured in key/value pairs, separated by commas, and evaluates to JavaScript objects.",

I will share withou you what situation I found myself in to better illustrate this.\n\nI am building a dashboard that will show some data like system usage, uptime monitoring and some other things. I have a Raspberry Pi with a display set up for this and it will live on my desk so I can quickly reference it if needed.\n\nI needed to get the usage data from my PC to the Raspberry Pi and the solution I found was quite simpler than I initially expected: I made a Windows client that just sends data to an API and I configured a webserver on the Pi.\n\nI still needed some data from the Windows client to see if any relevant events occur, like loosing connection, getting an error or anything that should happen at runtime I would like to be notified about, maybe a few simple configurations. So I decided to make the application run headless, but having a tray icon. This helped me have a few settings in the tray menu, simple toggles, on and off. For the messages that communicate my client application’s state I chose to use notifications. So like this I have settings and feedback from the application without any actual UI.\n\nOf course it is more of a particular case creating a dedicated web server, but I eanted to ilustrate to you that there are some (maybe non-conventional) solutions, other than doing the interface in Python. \n\nI have also thought about implementing some logic on the webserver so it could send some data as a response that would trogger some change in the client’s behavios behavior. That would basically move the configuration from the tray menu to the thouchscreen display of the Pi. There are solutions, just think of what is best for your use-case!\n\nAs for my reasoning, I think Python is more of a backend oriented language. Even though it is possible to do interfaces in Python, I think it is far from ideal.",

If you can't handle that delay after having typed in a command, of course you should go with the faster version ...\n\nAnyways, never believe anyone talking about how some constructs in the programming language are faster or slower than others - usually they are wrong, and perpetuate myths started by 1970s assembly-programmers.\n\n  \nAnd a note to those, who think that a string comparison takes additional time - it doesn't. In all modern languages, strings are immutable and handled by the runtime, which means that comparing one string to another is as simple as comparing two addresses - it is as fast as comparing any other value!",

The idea of fixing a slow program because you believe long if statements make it slow is often termed as premature optimization (not the specific reason, but any reason you think a program is slow).\n\nIt's often more important that a program be readable if it's fast enough, and likely, it's going to be fast enough. \n\nIf you have evidence it's running slow, then you can look at *profiling* a program. This means using a program called a *profiler*. Many beginners still choose to optimize without a profiler because it's just one more tool they need to learn, and they'd rather guess what's slow.\n\nIf you insist, you can create a HashMap (or whatever C# has) that maps the command string to a something that implements a Command interface. You can pass the command line and the args. \n\n    interface Command {\n         void runCommand(String command, SomeType lineArgs);\n    }\n\nReplace `SomeType` with the actual type.\n\nYou would create this map in an initialization phase (static constructor, say).

Don't worry until you have a reason to worry. Why are you thinking about this now? What does the loop do? Do you have a hard time constraint you are trying to stay within? Don't optimize prematurely. That doesn't mean you should write fast and shitty code, just that you need to learn the optimal amount of \"should I consider this now\" vs \"note this as a place to consider if execution time becomes and issue\".\n\nI am a firm believer in not putting off refactor if you see problems, but beyond keeping good, clean, defensive coding practices, overthinking problems that haven't even presented themselves yet will just drive you fucking crazy.\n\nB: You have decided to listen to random people give you \"this is how it is\" advice instead of exploring and learning about how if/else and switch might differ in the resulting assembly. Stop letting other people answer your questions with other things you don't understand. The internet is full of fucking nonsense, and I read TONS of it being given as confident \"this is how it is\" programming advice when the reality is ALWAYS more complicated and nuanced. Get curious. The answer to your question is out there and well explained by someone who actually knows what they are talking about.\n\nAnyway, what you are doing is fine. Using a switch might make it look a little cleaner if it gets longer. I would also look up using function pointers and a dispatch table, more as a thought experiment. Function pointers seem outlandish at first but are an amazing tool to be comfortable with. If you want to DM me at any point, I do light tutoring for free and I think this is a cool problem to talk about a few interesting design patterns.\n\nedit: I dropped the term \"function pointer\" in this without thinking language. Deep in my C work right now. Dispatch table/pattern is still a great idea, but ignore my usage of the term function pointer.",

        "body": "You not only need to \"learn programming\". Learning a programming language is like 1% of what you need to learn. The most important aspect you have to acquire is thinking like a dev. Problem solving skills above all else. Languages are the easy part, especially these days where like 70% of the main languages follow the same syntax and if you're able to use one, you'll get used to another one in a few days (OOP related). Besides that, most jobs not only ask for a language, but a specific set of technologies such as Docker + Kubernetes + GCP + Java + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL. Learning development isn't learning a language, it's learning to solve problems. How you solve those and which tools you use is another topic and most of the time you can choose between multiple tools to solve the same task. Another - in my opinion - important aspect is that you need to be able to explain complex tech heavy topics as simple as possible without using the word \"code\" once. Many companies work in agile environment with different products, roles and departments and you'll have a lot of meetings where you have to explain what you did in simple terms so that every PO understands it. In your case, you should first find out what you're lacking the most, which will probably be problem solving skills as it is for most devs. If you have not even build a single private project yourself once,  it's very unlikely that you're ready to work in a professional development environment in a year. Developing a private project and developing a b2b project as an example are totally different worlds. \nBut thats just my take. Ask 10 devs and all 10 will have different opinions and approaches. The most important question right now which you should ask yourself is \"what exactly do I want to achieve?\".",

This is often why you saw a new programmer on a project rewrite the code. They couldn't understand the existing code. What these programmers didn't realize is they were writing code others couldn't follow, for the same reason. We know what we meant to do in our own code. There's a lot of code out there with little documentation, so it can be a pain to figure out what the code does unless it's very clean code.\n\nUnless you write horrible code, you're always going to prefer your code over others. Maybe if you wrote spaghetti code and someone is writing super clean code, you'd prefer reading, but I'd say that's uncommon.\n\nIt's a necessary task.\n\nOh yes, sometimes working with other people's code leads a person into rewriting vast parts because they didn't like how that person coded it up. Depending on the situation, that could be considered a waste of time.\n\nI had to work on legacy code where there were Java methods 2000 lines long, where the Java class was 20,000 lines long.  *One class!*. It was a bunch of copy/paste and spaghetti code.  But it would have been insane to rewrite it. First of all, it was hard to tell what the program was *supposed* to do. Second, it was so large that it would have taken a long time and been challenging to test.\n\nIndeed, we often asked our customers (non-programmers) to test manually (use the web applications). They wouldn't have time to do a good test (often hastily done and incomplete) because, guess what, they had other work to do.\n\nSo, we had to live with not changing the code, or changing it in minimal ways. It would have taken years to just reproduce the code in a nice way.",

You want everything right now and without effort. You probably spent more time searching for an effortless solution than just doing simple exercises.\n\n\n\n\n## How do you use FP\n\nThe answer is simple: if you want to \"edit something\", you create a copie with the new values you want.\n\n\nImaging doubling the elements in a list. In procedural programming, like C, you would do: \n```C\nfor(int i = 0; i < myarray.size(); ++i) {\n    myarray[i] = 2 * myarray[i]\n}\n```\nhere you are modifying the content of `myarray` in place.\nIf you use a comprehension, then you create a copy of the list\n```python\ndoubledarray = [2 * x for x in myarray]\n```\n\n## Why FP ?\n\nFP isn't as popular as procedural/OOP, which is a shame IMO.\nFP has a lot of benefits, for example, the non-mutability helps the compilers to optimize, you also remove the need for synchronization primitives.\n\nBut that's all there is to it. FP is also less prone to poorly written code.\n\nIn procedural, people (not just juniors sadly..) wll just start to code without further thinking and will put `if` here, a `loop` there, now they get the data from the database, .. it becomes a mess hard to follow. This is because they declare \"how\" to do the changes: \"take this value here, change it, reassign it, ..)\n\n(Of course, there are coding guidelines like \"short-circuiting\" or \"input-data-output\" flow, but people don't know/respecr them all the time.)\n\nInstead of telling the computer \"how\" to do it, just tell it what you want: \"double the values in the list\".\n\nI always make the junior do a bit of FP when they start, this helps them take good habits",

In the most basic way your functions would have a type like this \n\n\n    doSomethingWithState::  BoardState -> (BoardState, a)\n\nThis means, I took the old state of the app, then I generated a new state with the modifications I want, and a value related to whatever this function did.  \n\nIf all your functions have a type like that (accepting a state and retrieving one state with modifications) then all what you have to do to \"update\" a state, is to propagate to the functions the new state. \n\n\nIf you think about it imperatively, you may get the sensation that they are wasting a lot of memory cloning the state. The truth is that a compiler would try to optimize this to mutate in place. What? Think about it, the compiler may see (in this imperative pseudo python code) \n\n    def something(state):\n      (newState, value1)= doSomething1(state)\n      (newNewState, value2) = doSomething2(newState)\n       return newNewState\n\nAs long as value1 doesnt refer to something inside newState, the compiler can see that you used the `newState` only to pass as argument and is never refer again. So it can generate code that performs updates on newState to generate newState2. \n\nThe compiler may choose to do this optimization or not. That's what it means that is declarative. You stated your desire to transmit the state of the app, the compiler chooses if it would remain inmutable, or not. You stated what the final effect is and the compiler filled the details. \n\n\nOne example where mutability is nice: \n\nIf you are parsing a string s, you want to try to parse something and restore the state if it fails, without immutability you need to explicitly clone the state before trying and restore it manually it after. With immutability you only need to use the old state that is still available. \n\nAbout nested loops, you use recursive function, you need to capture all the variables you are regularly mutating in your imperative loop. You put all of them in a state and that's what you pass around in your recursive calls, a state modified by your recursive function.\n\n    def loop(state):\n      (s2,a) = something(state)\n      print(a)\n      return loop(s2)\n\n    def main():\n      state = makeInitialState()\n      (endState,a)=loop(state)\n      return a\n\n\nA more concrete example:\n\n    def sumToNImperative(n):\n         acc =0\n         for j in range(n):\n           acc+=j\n         return acc\n\n    def sumToNPure(n):\n        return sumToNPureAux(n,0)\n\n    def sumToNPureAux(n,acc):\n        if n>0:\n          return sumToNPureAux(n-1, acc+1)\n        else:\n          return acc\n \nThe nice thing is that with TCO the pure version can be compiled to the equivalent for loop. Again, the optimization can or cannot happen. That depends on the compiler chooses.",

Than figure out what you want this SaaS to be and start somewhere. \n\nYou know Python? Great, Django seems like a good option. Don't focus on \"I need to learn backend\" or \"I need to learn frontend\", focus on rather, I have idea **A**, which needs features X, Y and Z, and I need to figure out how to build them.  Pick the right tutorial's, blogs and lessons that will help you implement the features you want. \n\nSoon or later it will all come together and you will naturally fill in the knowledge gaps when building something you actually want. Plus it's fun. \n\nFundamental's are important don't overlook them. But have fun, break problems down to their core, figure out how to solve them and what knowledge you need to get them done. I believe learning something for the sake of learning is often, a huge waste of time. You need to (if you can) have clear intentions and set clear goals, that way a solution to \"you feeling lost\" is just a simple to-do list of the things you need to get done. \n\nGood luck!",

Do i need frontend?\"\n\nIf your real goal is to work in AI, then picking up Django or diving into backend/frontend development might not be the right first move unless you're doing it just to get a job quickly. \nLet's try to untangle one of the most common knots. Stack accumulation is not directly related to CS learning process. So learning Django doesn't teach you software engineering, and \"learning backend\" doesn't automatically make you good at building systems or understanding how AI works. It just makes you... someone who knows Django.\n\nStack accumulation is something needed AFTER you formed yourself, understood what you need and you're asking yourself \"what are the best, most common, tools we can use toward this?\"\nOr if you want to become job ready on a specific path, pretty fast.\n\nBut If you're serious about AI, you'd get way more value starting from the actual foundations: data, computation, algorithms, programming principles. Learn how software works, not just how to wire things together. Then, when you build something related to AI, you’ll know how and why it works. And how to improve it.\n\nTLDR, before picking stacks, pick a direction that teaches you how to think like a builder, not just how to glue tools together. Because 6 months of python... well.... you're not quite there yet. I'm not trying to deny the effort or saying it doesn't count, it does. I'm trying to say you just started your path, do not rush if rushing isn't needed.",

I give it the plan and just have it fill in some of the details.\n\nBut even then, I have to check it very carefully. It quite often gets something wrong, especially the longer the code gets. Like, it might have two functions that both look right if you look at them separately, but if you look at the program overall you realize that one is interpreting a certain parameter exactly the opposite as the other one is.\n\n* How do you *stay intentional* while working with AI tools?\n\nI often add things to my prompt like: don't give me all of the code, just discuss the approaches. Or: before coding this, think of lots of clarifying questions and keep asking me them until you're confident that the spec is unambiguous.\n\nI like to help get the AI started, I define the class names, method names, and variable names as a starting point. It's really good at taking my lead and following a similar pattern. That way things are written the way I want, and mistakes jump out more than if it's not my style.\n\n* Do you treat AI output as a first draft, or as something to deeply understand and improve?\n\nAgain, if I don't fully understand it, I don't trust it. That means my homework is to research what I don't know first.\n\nWhen I do understand it, I often ask AI for several modifications, then take it as a draft and modify it to my own style.",

Anything beyond that and you have to be very skeptical with what it's giving you. It will confidently tell you exactly how to fix a problem, even if the solution isn't remotely correct. \n\nIt's also an excellent rubber duck and sanity checker. Ask it small simple questions about syntax or common paradigms to refresh yourself. Always keep in mind it can be wrong, even on simple things, even when it sounds very confident, and think critically about its responses, don't trust it blindly. \n\nThe thing about \"coding\" is that it's the easiest part of the job that is software development. AI can and often will write functional and efficient code for common problems, but your job as a developer is to figure out how solutions to common problems can come together to be a useful application/tool/interface. So use it to help speed you up on things you want to write, when you already know what you need to write, but don't rely on it to just magically know that right way to wire up a class to do something specific in a way that works with your application. \n\nOne tip: I'm a big fan of asking AI to review the \"intent\" of my code. I'll ask it to examine a section of code and give me its impression of what it believes the developer who wrote the code was intending for it to do, and how they likely intended to use it.  I do this to fact check myself, and make sure I didn't just spend a half hour writing nonsense that doesn't do anything remotely close to what I thought I wanted it to do. Again, always keep in mind it can be wrong, but use its response to figure out if an external viewer might see your code differently than how you do. It should be noted, comments and variable names can heavily skew the output sometimes. It's often not worth the effort, but I have occasionally deliberately obfuscated my code before asking it to review it, to make sure its impression isn't being colored by the hints in the naming or comments. The flip side of that is that sometimes you can ask it to identify when naming or comments are confusing in light of what the code is actually doing.",

You should be doing something *every* summer, whether that be gaining new skills or doing an internship.\n\nWith the current tech industry right now, if you can create a full-stack project and implement GenAI in there, your resume and experience will be **golden (especially as a 3rd year CS major)**. You have HTML and CSS locked in, JavaScript is definitely the next step.\n\nHere is a full-stack course that will teach you full-stack development from day one: [https://fullstackopen.com/en/about](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about) . This course is definitely doable in 3 months with about 2-4 hours a day.\n\nIf you are more into low-level coding/embedded systems and would prefer not to step into full-stack engineering, work on some of these low-level coding projects: [https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x)\n\nIf data-science and machine learning are your thing, here is another reference/guide on Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1g6d4cz/roadmap\\_to\\_becoming\\_an\\_ai\\_engineer\\_in\\_8\\_to\\_12/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1g6d4cz/roadmap_to_becoming_an_ai_engineer_in_8_to_12/) . Also check out Kaggle.\n\nAnd since your algorithms skills are weak, brush up on DSA with LeetCode. Trust me, it's not as scary once you practice. All computer science really takes is practice. Make sure to lock in on a specialty during the summer so you aren't bouncing around half-learning a lot of things (my major pitfall). Do at least one problem a day to start.\n\nBeyond this, your 3rd-4th year transition summer is crucial to get an internship. And doing these projects will for sure help you land one.\n\n  \nEdit: typos",

In the first case, you probably have a list of ideas that you never get to work in while you’re busy in school. And in the second case, you need to show that you can get a project done. A break of three months is your time to use some of what you’ve learned so far. Build something fun. You’ll learn as much or more working through a project from beginning to end than in any class, and getting some experience will provide context for your 3rd and 4th years. And if you succeed you’ll have at least one thing that you can point to as a project that you completed.",

The answer is \"Yes, it's possible, because people play in the NBA\", but it is nearly impossible for almost everyone.\n\nThe odds that you can become a front-end developer are far greater than being in the NBA, which means it's hard to guess whether you can or can't. That's the risk you take. You have to be willing to spend time to get good regardless of whether you make it or not. There are hundreds of thousands of people that want to play in the NBA, and they try really hard. Fortunately, many can play at a much lower level (for fun, at a high school, in college, etc) and so they can gain some satisfaction in doing that even if they can't earn millions of dollars. They want to believe they can make it, which is why they try. You have to delude yourself that you can, until enough evidence presents itself that you can't (or you lose interest).\n\nA potential problem with your dream is why you haven't started it. If you are second-guessing yourself (\"Should I do it or shouldn't I do it? What are the odds I will succeed?\"), then you can run into trouble. Either you have to convince yourself that you are good enough to do it, or you have to say you're going to give it all you've got and not worry whether you're good enough or not because those kinds of worries just stop you from making progress.\n\nAnd really, that's the danger. Once you have doubts, and they start to impact whether you'll learn enough, that can stop you. If you had other goals like \"I want to write a small program to play checkers or a simpler game\" then those goals are more achievable right now.\n\nI would consider picking a smaller, reachable goal right no, such as, I'm going to spend 3 months taking some online programming course, and see how I feel. If I am still motivated, I'll continue to work on it, rather than make that decision now before you even start.",

Back then I was able to follow just enough breadcrumbs in terms of learning, resume building, and job hunting to keep me motivated and learning and improving and focused. I think if I tried today, I would have actually \"improved\" faster by using AI tools and stuff, but then it would have backfired because I'd have quickly started looking at the job market, which is much worse and more competitive than it was back then, and I'd probably decide it's just too much for me and nothing I had learned in that short time was actually valuable to anyone.",

Do not listen to people saying straight out \"no\", or \"not possible\", or \"not in current market\", they are **fucking idiots**. They are sheep, and you shouldn't concern yourself with their opinion. I mean for real, ask yourself this: \"If i spent 16 hours daily learning, and live & breath programming every day, including weekends and holidays, then would I be able to catch-up and get a job?\". If you frame it like this, then obviously the answer is yes. It's the same concept when people ask you: \"What are the chances that you make 1m$ this year?\" And majority people respond \"1%, 2%\". Then shift the perspective - \"What are the chances you make 1m$ this year, or else your entire family dies?\" Suddenly everyone answers 100%. It's not the goal or timeframe, it's the perspective. My point is, anyone that is so closed minded to give you a definitive answer to a question that is so open-ended, is a dumbass.\n\nI am completely self-taught in everything I have done in my life. I dropped out at age of 16 from high school to pursue business, and when my peers were getting their bachelors, I was buying a new apartment. While that sounds great, it took 16 hours daily for years, my health declined hard, and it frankly, wasn't worth it. I wanted more stability in life, where I still make great money, but not at cost of all my time and health. So I started learning programming to transition, and mind you I started in 2024. In a shitty market, filled with the same comments you see on this thread saying you can't do it, CS is dead, there's no jobs etc.\n\nFast forward to today, and with zero YoE on the job, I am interviewing for Mid positions at various companies and tomorrow I have another job interview with F100 company. Was it easy to get to here? No. In the last 365 days, I probably spent 330 or so coding and learning every day for 8-10 hours. Is it doable though? Absolutely. Fucking. Yes.\n\nI was like you though, posting threads on reddit asking if there's future. Until I realized that there is future, but only for people who put in the work, and don't spend their time worrying on reddit. Every hour you spend on a real project of yours, is an hour you get ahead others writing posts on reddit. Which reminds me, it's time for me to prep for the interview. Good luck though, believe in yourself and don't give in to haters.",

If you have to really stop and read it, or read it a few times to understand what it does, then your code is not readable.\n* If you would read it in about a year of not touching this code, would you understand easily what it does? It's easy to read it when you know all the context and all the considerations that are part of it, but you will eventually forget it. What happens then?\n* Is it easy to understand *why* something a code does something? For example, you do an if check for a specific value. Is the *reason* why we do this value clear? If it's not clear, then a comment should explain it.\n* Is the code efficient? No need to over-optimize, but we can at least not repeat things that don't need to be repeated. For example, if you need to fetch something that doesn't change during your flow, fetch it once and use it for all relevant operations, rather than fetching it over and over. Same can be said for complex calculations.\n* Is the code going to external APIs too often? Most APIs are rate limited, and you don't want to overdo it in order to prevent being blocked. Even if a single flow works, what happens if the flow is invoked a few times by multiple users? Some APIs also charge you for each API use, so you want to keep costs down.\n* Is the context of a flow clear? For example, say a user updates their details and clicks \"Save\". Is it easy to know what user triggered this flow, when, and how? How do you know you're not accidentally saving over the wrong user's data?\n* Logs and tests: this is for the real world rather for academic tests, but good to keep in mind. Are there useful logs placed in strategic locations in the code to make it easy to follow along a log trail if something goes wrong? Are there tests to make sure that your flow works?\n\nFollowing those points will make sure your code is in at least in a pretty good condition. Of course, the above questions are subjective, but you should be able to answer them for yourself.",

Technically I started with BASIC but I would say that Java was the first language I learned to code in at a professional level.\n\nIf you have a particularly good reason, like somebody being able to support you, like you have described, then there is no real reason not to start there.\n\nThat said, in isolation, I would say no. The language designers at Oracle have done a reasonable job of bringing the language up to modern expectations but there is a lot of history there and backwards compatibility to maintain and I think that has resulted in some less than optimal things.\n\nThe Java platform (distinct from the language) is great, there is a huge ecosystem, lots of libraries and the JVM has some of the most clever engineering that you'll find anywhere. It's a nice platform, but if a person I knew was starting today, and wanted to learn Java platform development I would probably suggest Kotlin over Java. You can still use all of those tools and libraries and run on the JVM but I think it is a nicer way to express yourself and has some really useful features.\n\nIndependent of even the JVM, i'd probably say that Python is perhaps the best absolute beginner choice. At the risk of upsetting some Python people, I think Python is the closest modern, widely used language to the BASIC that I started with. Obviously people use it for insanely complex stuff (ML in particular) but the syntax is pretty simple and the much maligned, 'meaningful whitespace' feature is actually not bad when it comes to instructing people on writing readable code. The people who complain about Python's indentation semantics are typically indenting their non-Python code in the same way, or their IDE is doing it for them. It's not a big deal.",

You start from basics and progress from there. Maybe the a-ha moment is understanding how a program runs or making your first algorithm, but it isn't a single a-ha moment, and it doesn't mean one day you don't know how to program, and the next day you're churning out code.\n\nThere's always new stuff to learn (whether you choose to or not) and it's done in steps. Have you ever seen people who draw really well. Sometimes they post their drawings over the years from stuff just better than stick figures. Sure, maybe there's a year it starts to take a big leap forward, but there's often more progress after that.\n\nWe all want shortcuts, but they aren't always there.\n\nFor a recommendation, try (web search: `MOOC Java`). This is a free course in Java. You can do it in C# instead, but if you do it in Java, there's automated grading. The key is to do all the programming exercises, and not just read.

JQuery is really for modifying the DOM (styling and what you see on a webpage) so you can tangibly see your changes happen 'live'.\n\nWhen you boil it right down, JavaScript is really just:\n\n * Variables (var, let, const) - places to store bit of data\n * Arrays and Objects (arrayName[data], objectName{dataKey: data}) - places to store many bits of data that are related to each other\n * Conditionals (if, else if, else) - ways to run different pieces of code depending on something, usually the value of a variable\n * Loops (for, while, do while) - ways to run the same piece of code over and over again\n * Functions (someFunction(someArgument)) - ways to reuse a piece of code in many places without having to re-write it.\n\nThere are a lot of complicated terms to describe many variations of the same ideas. There can be confusing, but they still really just boil down to these core ideas. Eg \"ternaries\" are just short-hand conditionals. \"Iterations\" are just another work for loops.\n\nThe problem with Boot Camps is they go so fast.

Python dominates the market at the moment despite slow af, just because it's simple enough and there are many libraries. \n\n\nMy suggestion is to look at Clojure/Clojurescript, as they would give the most benefits for someone without any experience right now. The reason being Clojure is a Lisp that runs on the JVM. \n\n\nThis way, you have the best of many worlds in one, you would have all the libraries of the Java ecosystem helping you. You then can use Clojure, which is a Lisp and is excellent for functional and meta programming, and Clojurescript compiled down to Javascript so you'll be able to leverage the webs too. (Without the need to master Javascript or Typescript, besides Clojure is much more flexible and powerful than both Javascript and Typescript)\n\n\nAnother perk is that Clojure compiled down to Java also, so if you want to target the mobile phone too, it'll be a nice perk. \n\n\nClojure's flexibility, capability and expressiveness will amaze you and ruin your taste for clunky languages.",

        "body": "The general direction I’d suggest, especially if you’re in 12th grade and thinking long-term about building a startup, is to build a strong foundation across three types of programming tools, each opens up a different way of thinking and building: \n\n# A. A systems-level language (C, C++, or Rust)\n\nThese aren’t beginner-friendly, but even a little exposure helps you understand how computers *really* work, memory, runtime, compilation. Rust is a good modern choice, safe, powerful, and increasingly relevant.\n\n# B. A general-purpose language with a rich ecosystem\n\nThis is where you’ll probably spend the most time. **Python** is a great choice here, simple syntax, huge ecosystem, and good for scripting, data, and automation. \n\nAlternatively, **JavaScript/TypeScript** is indispensable if you want to build anything for the web. \n\n# C. A language that stretches your thinking\n\nIf you’re feeling curious, try a functional language like **Clojure**, **Scheme**, or **Haskell** later on. They’ll stretch your brain in all the right ways, especially around immutability and design. \n\n# On the tech startup side\n\nIf you're dreaming of launching a product, the key thing is to **learn by building**. Tutorials are fine, but try to solve your own problems. Build a notes app. Build a tiny CMS. Build a budget tracker for your classmates.\n\nYou’ll learn programming, but also:\n\n* What users care about (hint: not your code),  \n* How to debug weird production issues,  \n* What \"simple\" really means when you’re maintaining something alone.  \n\nAnd along the way, don’t ignore the command line, basic Git, and Linux tooling. Those aren't trendy, but they’ll save you countless hours.\n\nWhen I started working on what eventually became my own startup, the early tech choices weren’t dictated by popularity or benchmarks; they were guided by how fast I could test ideas and how well I understood the tools I was using. In hindsight, it was less about choosing the \"right stack\" and more about building the muscle to iterate quickly, keep things maintainable, and stay curious.",

It can probably be done with just some really snarky batch file, depending on what exactly you have and what exactly you need to do beyond the stated stuff.  I highly recommend looking into this idea.  The learning curve is very low, just poweruser stuff instead of full on software engineering level. \n\nthat said, a windows .exe file is generated by turning a programming language (the stuff YOU write) into machine code (the .exe file), which is done by the tools (compiler and linker for example in C++) for that programming language.  Some languages are 'interpreted' and do not make an executable program, but instead run directly from the source code.  That may also be ok for your needs, but any computer using the program would require the tools to run it, which are not default installed on windows.   A windows program that makes actual windows (the GUI) take more know-how, as you have to learn the tools to make the windows and widgets on them.  This can be little more than glorified drag and drop to build, but even so, there is some learning curve to it. If you don't do those things, the program will be a 'command line program' and work under the cmd shell (dos shell) that you may or may not use (its part of windows).  Such programs just accept typed text and print out response text to the shell, 1980s style.  Even when you make a windows exe, the target computer may need something you used -- its often a shocker to beginners that other computers lack the debug libraries so debug mode executables won't usually run on other machines.   Be sure to run the program on the target machine and that it works properly there.",

[Here's the download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3133/). Download and install it. It will come with a tool called IDLE you can use to write code in. People may prefer other code editors like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that can make writing code easier, so you can look into them but may not see benefit yet. It's worth adding the code interpreter won't create an executable file, but will run your code files. \n\nThen pick up a guide for learning Python. There are tons of YouTube tutorials and Udemy courses. Id recommend [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) because it covers everything you want to do.",

(Properly, it’s a POSIX operating environment.)\n\nMinGW comes with some of the same gunk, even forked from Cygwin, but gives you a much thinner shim around WinAPI, which ranges from irritating to miserable for beginners. (E.g., the Windows environment of the NT kernel—now the sole one AFAIK—has two separate subsystems, console and graphical, and they expose slightly different APIs and behaviors. Cygwin matches other Unixes in model and behavior, which means you can follow Unix tutorials, and if you’re careful with `LONG` vs. `long` you can probably follow some Windows ones too.)\n\nWSL2 is another option, but it’s stood off from Windows itself by a hypervisor, which means you don’t get good access to things inside the Linux domain from outside or vice versa.\n\nOtherwise, chances are you’re already on Unix. Apple’s Darwin (incl. OS/X→macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, etc. ad ridiculam) is in the FreeBSD family, which derives from Jolix which is a clean-room BSD/Net2 Unix. Linux wasn’t forked from anything, but its kernel tends more towards the AT\\&T family of Unixes culminating in System V, rev 4 (SVr4). Android is a variant of Linux using Bionic as libc and very little in the way of shell environment; desktop Linuxes tend to use the GNU libc and environment, of which Bash and GCC are also constituents.\n\nOn Android, you can install F-Droid and thereby Termux and Programmer’s Keyboard; immediately run `pkg update && pkg upgrade`, then you can install your preferred packages. Termux layers GNU onto Android, giving you a rough, subordinated desktop Linux environment.\n\nFor desktop Linux, I use Neon, which is an Ubuntu variant for KDE, which is my preferred windowing environment; Ubuntu is a vast family of Debian-based distributions, so pretty much anything major will do—Mint is supposed to be reasonably good, but you do you. Konsole (part of KDE, but runs anyway) is imo the best terminal available on Linux (also works for Cygwin and Win-per-se); open it up, start a [shell tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview), and you’re good.  If shit ever breaks, Ctrl+Alt+Fkey will usually drop you to a lower-level terminal, so monkeying is never far away.\n\nMost Unixes uses Bash for their interactive shell nowadays, though POSIX mandates certain characteristics for the baseline shell environment, and older systems tend to have their own, quirky Bourne shells. IIRC modern Linux tends to use Ash or Dash for POSIX and startup scripts via /bin/sh—Bash used to be used everywhere.\n\nFor editing, Kate (also KDE) is a very good GUI (MDI) editor for getting started with, but I strongly recommend you at least install Vim and start learning the basics, whether or not you use it for day-to-day work. It comes with a built-in tutorial, and it’s pretty straightforward to pick up. Very useful when you’re three ssh forwards deep, trying to resurrect a very custom, in-flight supercompute batch job, for example.\n\nSo that’s 1½ languages to start with, Bash and Vim.\n\nI’d probably start in on a C tutorial, also—prefer GCC or Clang; under no circumstances should you use MSVC for C or C++ unless you’re being paid to or have no choice in the matter. Also, I’d recommend staying away from full IDEs in general for just now, since you don’t need all the extra trappings. Build directly from command line, and try to engage directly with the terminal where it’s not counterpurpose. Get a feel for imperativeness.\n\nIIRC for Apple, you get a Clang-in-GNU’s clothing with XCode, but I don’t do their nonsense so that may have changed. XCode itself is a …fine editor, but probably overkill for your purposes—syntax highlighting will often not line up with what the compiler actually sees or does.\n\nOn Linux and Cygwin, you go through the usual package management tools for compilers, or build them yourself if feeling adventurous. `pkg install gcc` for Termux, `pkcon install gcc` for Neon, `apt-get install gcc` for Ubuntu, `yum install gcc` for RedHat, and Arch has its own, fancy mess.\n\nIf you install all the goodies—sometimes from separate foo-doc packages accompanying foo—you should have Bash `help` built-in command, a `man` command to acess manual pages (e.g., `man man` for man’s manpage), `whatis` and `apropos` to search for manpages, and `info` to browse the info manuals. (E.g., `man gcc` tells you how to run the `gcc` command, and `info gcc` tells you how to use it. /usr/share/doc may also have some goodies.)\n\nI recommend installing the POSIX manpages alongside native, where available, and bookmarking or downloading the 2001–2004, 2008–2018, and 2024 editions of the [POSIX standards](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/), which is what you aim for if you want your code to be portable to other OSes in the Unix family. (Links to prior versions at bottom of that index page—only 2001/12, 2008/09, and 2024/05 editions are recognizable from within the C-language build environment. You can also find 1988 and 1990 versions as FIPS-151-1 and FIPS-151-2, FWTW and FTTB.)\n\nIf you learn C, K\\&R’s *The C Programming Language,* 2ed (1988—not 1ed from 1978) is the usual approach vector, and you can easily find free copies to work from. It’s a bit out of date, but so is most C software, and you can push forwards from C89 pretty easily using the draft standards, or backwards using XPG, TCPL/1ed, and compiler manuals.\n\n[ISO WG14](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/projects.html) is presently in charge of the language (qua ISO/IEC 9899), so they produce standards docs that form the backbone of the language. The final drafts are effectively equivalent text for free, so they form the most portable layer undergirding the language, and then dialect extensions (e.g., GNU, MS), POSIX and X/Open, and other environmental stuff layers atop that. If you want to know whether something ought to be “legal” or not, start at the standard for your language version and then look at your compiler and ABI manuals for how the blanks are filled in.\n\nGood luck! I’d probably run through to pointers, then take a dip into assembly and come back, but delve however you like. Most of the system software is in C or C++, and if you’re on Linux, the source code is readily available to explore and play with, so you can reconstruct pretty much everything to your choosing.",

To give you an overview of some other choices, read this (from the Kotlin programming language): \n\nhttps://kotlinlang.org/docs/async-programming.html \n\nAnyway, while we're talking about other choices, the Go programming language offers Goroutines. I think the Kotlin programming language also offers some sort of Coroutine type functionality. The Scala programming language offers The Actor Model in the form of Akka (you can search for \"Scala Akka\" or \"actor programming model\" for more information). Akka can also be used with recent versions of the Java programming language even though it was written in Scala (both Java and Scala run on the JVM). Microsoft and C# ported Akka over to their platform with Akka.NET . The Erlang programming language has its own implementation of the actor model which I assume is sort of similar to Akka. \n\nAlso, a lot of programming languages (like Kotlin, Scala, and Haskell) offer some sort of parallel immutable data structures with built-in automatic multithreading. \n\nOh, and in a lot of cases programming languages uses async callbacks/promises, like JavaScript. C# has its own async keyword and await keyword for that purpose. The Scala programming language has its own implementation of Futures, which facilitates multithreading and asynchronous programming and is sort of like JavaScript callbacks/promises. Kotlin has a suspend keyword and libraries for working with that sort of asynchronous stuff.\n\nBut yeah, in real world software, low-level multithreading should be your last resort, not your first.",

This is different in Rust, where suddenly changing to a multithreaded implementation will simply result in the compiler refusing to build the code until you fix everything, and this is also one of the reasons why I wonder why people are still choosing to start new projects in C++ these days.\n\nRegarding your specific problem, if you decide to listen to my advice and reimplement everything from scratch, I recommend looking up the Entity Component System architecture, which would greatly benefit your project, minimize potential threading problems (or completely eliminate them in the case of Rust), and maximize both CPU cache efficiency and thread parallelization. In Rust there's a project called Bevy which is a highly modular game engine implementing the aforementioned architecture, however I do not recommend relying on frameworks and libraries while learning.",

Cloud concepts (like deployment, containers, CI/CD) come more naturally once you’ve built apps. And security becomes much more relevant when you’re managing users, data, and infrastructure.\n\nYou can definitely explore it all, just treat it like a layered roadmap, each step gives more context for the next.",

        "body": "Start out with basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript. These are going to form the fundamental understanding you need to move forward. Don't focus on frameworks like React for now.  You should be able to create small, functional webpages that do different things, kinda like the Coding Train challenges on YouTube. It's also worth keeping in mind browser compatibility with stuff like this. \n\nWhen you feel comfortable with how to lay out a webpage, use Javascript on the back end using Node. This will let you run Javascript code on your computer separate from what you do in a webpage. A common use is a server that handles your databases or other heavy computation in the back end, then sending this data back to the front end using a library like Express to make APIs and then the Fetch API in the browser. \n\nYou should also familiarise yourself with databases and SQL as a language for querying your databases. SQLite is a small, lightweight database you can use as you learn. A good capstone project here is a CRUD app. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete, which are all things you do with a database. You'll have an HTML/CSS front end, imagine for an online store the user can log into, and a database on the backend full of products, their prices, etc. The user using the store will click things, add to basket, whatever. That then interacts with an Express API on the back end that fetches or updates the data in the database. If you can do that, you'll understand quite a lot. \n\nThen go back to the front end and look at different frameworks like React, Angular or Vue. They are ways of organising your HTML and Javascript to make development way easier and more organised. New frameworks pop up everywhere all the time, so knowing how to compare and contrast them is valuable. Or just learn the one that's going to get you a job. \n\nOther areas of programming, like systems stuff, will use different languages that have their strengths and weaknesses. If you've gotten this far you should already have the skills to do this yourself and learn new languages quickly and form your own opinions. You'll understand enough that learning isn't hard and you can build your own roadmaps.",

One for email lookups, one for phone number lookups. Don't force yourself into going through hoops to solve something that has a simple solution in a different way just for the sake of doing it\n\n With your current system, how would you go about adding another field?

Whether or not it is a *good* solution is beside the point: the idea is to gain practice using *reasoning and problem solving skills,* so that it feels familiar and not foreign when you encounter a problem you *can't* easily Google.\n\nHaving said all of that... Set a time limit for how long you'll work on your own, versus looking up common solutions.  Something like 2 hours seems like a good ballpark, but feel free to adjust that based on your own experience.\n\nIt's good to get in the *habit* of thinking about the problem more deeply before mindlessly reaching or Google, but as you've *also* probably realized, there's often a super simple intended solution to most basic software engineering problems like this one.  I would say that learning to reason about software is a *more important* aspect than just rote memorization of common strategies / patterns... But they all really build off of and re-enforce each other.  If you learn the common patterns, you can move on to solving *bigger, more complicated problems,* rather than trying to re-invent the wheel from scratch every time.\n\nTl;Dr - Give yourself some time to *practice* thinking about how to solve a problem, but also set a time limit after which you'll \"just Google it\".  There's real value is practicing reasoning about code, but you also don't want to get stuck too deeply on \"solving\" trivial problems that have already been solved.",

Because the email and phone are two independent pieces of information about the same person.

There's a lag while the data is being fetched and then the page updates.  During that lag, there's nothing to indicate that anything's happening.\n\nThe low-grade way to fix this is to put a spinner or loading bar on page while you wait for the content to be fetched.  The much better way of doing this is to render the page on the server.  Modern frameworks allow you to do both without much difficulty, especially if you're using Node or Deno to serve your website, and you can also progressively load content over XHR now.\n\nI noticed that when I resized the window from a mobile width back to desktop width, the layout was odd.  This implies that you're building the page with JS rather than relying on CSS media queries to lay the page out at different screen widths.  Ah, `determineLayout` confirms it!  You can do a lot more with CSS than you might realise.\n\nI see your firebase keys are in your JS config.  I guess that means I can use your database at your expense?  These should be on the server.  At the very least, stick them inside a JWT.\n\nYour JS is nice and clean.  The way you're populating the DOM is satisfactory for a site this small, but even here, you should be able to reuse components.  For example, you have lots of functions that build back buttons (\"back to categories\", back to foobar\", etc).  Try and make a single function for that.  See if there are other opportunities for code reuse.\n\nAlso think about using the CSS `:hover`pseudo-selector to make it clear to the user what elements are interactive.  I notice you can't `tab` into those back buttons either.",

People almost never click the github repo, and they rarely even open your portfolio website itself, not to mention each individual project on your portfolio. They mostly check if you have a portfolio link in your CV, if you have a custom/bought well named, professional domain URL, and in some rare cases some people open it and only check the screenshots and presentation of your individual projects.\n\nAs far as applying to jobs goes, you don't need to revolutionize the world with your pet projects, you can easily have the typical ecommerce / social media clones and be perfectly alright, it's all about their UI design and how you present them. Most people don't even have a portfolio, and those that do are mostly people with no work experience that coded along a few apps from youtube and threw them there.\n\nPortfolios in CVs are more of a tickbox than anything else, and most companies don't even care. What's important is your college degree (if you have one, and how well-known it is), how good your CV looks and reads (this is huge, the more polished, the more chances), and preparing specifically for technical interviews (which test from an entirely different skillset than the job itself)",

If the business wants something done, it’s because it provides value—but that value only matters if the costs (like time and effort) don’t outweigh the benefits.\n\nIf your manager brought this up, I hope they were direct about it. There should be no mystery here. Understanding the \"why\" behind the feedback is important: it's often about balancing quality with efficiency.\n\nHere’s how you can tackle it:\n\n1. **Improve your estimating skills.** Be realistic about how long tasks will take, and speak up if the deadline is too tight.\n2. **Include contingency in your estimates.** Plans rarely go perfectly—account for interruptions, unexpected challenges, and even just bad days.\n3. **Prioritize effectively.** Focus on the essentials first—what absolutely needs to get done. That way, if setbacks happen, you can adjust without missing the core requirements.\n4. **Apply the 80/20 rule.** Recognize that 20% of the work usually delivers 80% of the value. Tackle that first, and you’ll find the rest often falls into place more easily.\n\nFinally, self-assess and seek guidance. Understand your manager’s expectations, find a mentor for candid feedback, and always keep sharpening your skills—not just new ones, but fundamentals too.\n\nThe goal isn’t just to avoid criticism; it’s to become more effective and confident in your work.\n\n**Addendum:**  \nBefore I get waves of criticism—yes, I did use AI to help generate this response. But let me be clear: every thought and idea here is my own.\n\nI’m mentioning this because, fittingly enough, I often struggle with being too slow and too detailed when writing responses. To address that, I use GPT by giving it an outline my points, tell it my preferred tone, and have it draft a response efficiently. I’ve given it instructions on how I like to communicate and trained it to match my general style.\n\nSome might be offended by that, but the reality is: this technology is here. I’m using Reddit as a learning ground—not just for discussions but for honing my ability to work with emerging tools. If we don’t learn how to use it effectively, someone else will. Personally, I’d rather be ahead of that curve.\n\nThis is the same technology that is being integrated into software development tools and can be a great factor in increasing productivity--and increasing performance expectations. The challenge is to ensure the quality matches and exceeds the productivity gains.\n\nAdapt or get left behind—that's how I see it.",

Linux uses .elf, MacOS uses Mach-O, Windows uses PE ( I might be referencing old info here ).\n\nAn executable and linkable format usually contains 3 possible forms:\n\n1. An end executable, which is an object file that has been linked, and it holds several things, like .code section, .data section, can also hold dynamic data if it links against a dynamic lib.\n2. An archive or static library, which is an agglomerate of object files, that are solely meant to be used as files to be linked against during compile time.\n3. A dynamic library, which is an object file, with a special format, that allows it to be placed on some part of the memory, and allows any program to link against it during load time.\n\nHow does the overall loading process occur? Well it's actually quite expensive and full of things. It contains things like creating a new process for the executable, then mapping the correct memory for that executable, placing MMU restrictions, linking against a dynamic library if the executable requires it, and many other things. I've never actually worked directly with loaders, so can't tell you for sure, but I am 100% sure it's doing all of these things, and probably even more.",

I know plenty of good things that have failed and plenty of crappy things succeed(Home Advisor). There's the old quote from Ford, \"If I asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.\"\n\nI am getting constant negative feedback on my BIG personal project and that only gives me more commitment to the cause and it will take years to complete. I can see the Matrix and I know they're wrong. 100% wrong in every way. They just don't see what I see. And my idea isn't unique just very rare and I've seen it in action. The businessman I'm taking it from has made five $100,000,000 businesses from it, and one of them trades on the NYSE.\n\nMy few month projects are to fill in gaps I see in the SMB space. Like an inventory app. Inventory is relatively easy. There are very few platforms that do JUST inventory. Usually its bundled with with custom scanners and printers and a POS system, or an MRP/ERP, or some other PM suite. Excel is a half measure here. Or a PTO tracker, which is ALWAYS bundled with an HR suite. Payroll drives so much of SMB software decisions and every system is missing something.\n\n>How many businesses are you dealing with? With my first and only B2B, the first contract took weeks to negotiate. It was arduous and I had to get lawyers involved. The whole thing was so much more intense than I was imagining. Key man clauses and such.\n\nRight now 1 active client, but that is intentional. I'm working through a 2-3 year project with an open ended contract. And they aren't involved in the project I mentioned above. Always use lawyers because they will.\n\n>But you're talking about B2B, not trivial nonsense. I would love to know more about how you sell confidence to businesses. I found that to be the hardest thing. They loved the product, but were worried about it being a small operation.\n\nBusinesses spend more money on trivial shit than people do by a LOT. I was able to save the current business I'm working with about $175k annually over the last year and half by pruning their trivial shit. They were paying an MSP to \"manage\" their cable modem. $500 a month for 10 years. The MSP came out 3 times in 10 years to watch a cable tech swap out the modem for $500 a month.\n\nI can say the first thing you shouldn't do is say to the customer that they are your first. You can't show the emotion you might not realize you're showing. You have to show them you're willing and able to walk out of the meeting at any time.\n\n\"I don't discuss my existing client business with others. But, let's just say that I was provided the opportunity to explore this entrepreneurial endeavor with some assurances and I'm not concerned at all about the solvency of my business in the short or long term.\n\nIf you have concerns about bandwidth, I have existing and on-going business relationships with several established firms and individuals that exist inside and outside this country. Due to the range of unique requests I get from my clients that require specialized expertise the expense of a subcontractor is no different than the cost of burden to staff my own business. With my approach I get to leverage the different expertise of each firm rather than to be locked into a few skillsets. In addition to all of that, my business structure gives me the ability to scale based on project requirements without having to resort to end of project layoffs.\n\nOf course I am continuing to internally contract a few very qualified persons for a premium, but I am fortunate enough to have the luxury to take my time and cherry pick the right people. Typically these are not customer facing engineers unless the project requirements demand face-to-face or on-site time. I will be your point of contact, and available to contact 24/7. I'm not looking to be the next Facebook, I'm looking to establish a few quality business relationships that will last for years, ideally until I retire and pass the business on to my successor.\n\nI understand if this dynamic doesn't appeal to you. Not every contractor is for every client, and the last thing I want is to enter a business relationship where one side is unhappy. This is an interview for me as well as an interview for you.\"\n\nTake that and make it yours. Make it the first time...every time!",

But it's not really necessary to know that a certain pattern has some agreed upon name, as long as you see the code and understand what it does.\n\n\nIf your coleague come to you and starts namedropping various design pattens, they have most likely just finished reading a wikipedia article about them, and now they're blowing smoke up your ass.\n\n\n.....\n\n\n\n\nIf you're talking about general OOP principles, object is essentially a struct or hashmap which contains both data and functions.\n\n\nClasses are just a templating system for generating those objects.\n\n\nMost of the rest is highly language specific and tends to be a pile of QoL features that are often nice, but not necessary.",

It's purpose is to build one object of a certain type. One reason to use the Singleton pattern is X.\n\n> To implement, we need to prevent the language from generating more than one object of the Singleton type. We do so by making the constructor private, then creating a static method that generates one instance of the Singleton.\n\n> Here is an example. blah blah\n\nThen, ask a quiz question at the end.

Starting out you might use keyboard input but later you might import data from a csv or json or spread sheet file and later you might even implement a proper database. \n\n\nYou also have to think about how you're going to manipulate data once it's in your program's memory.

The reason this is beneficial is you already know all the things to build when a lot of times ppl try and build stuff but never have a set of requirements.\n\nThe whole \"build something you are interested in\" are to make sure the person keeps on building it so while I agree it's not helpful in giving you an actual \"thing\" to build it's usually beneficial because ppl quit projects they lose interest in.\n\nSo the TLDR; you aren't building this to be the next tech bro and get super rich so if you don't wanna pick something that involves your interests pick something that already exists and then you have a list of reqs to build and then build it.  And hell maybe there is something in that tool/thing you like that is missing and you can add that.",

Instead make two, say one that focuses on whatever your strengths are(if your internships were more backend or data whatever) and the other more general jack of all trades. \n\nTry your best to schedule out your job searches. Meaning, you spent x hours applying then stop. You're already burning yourself out and it isn't working. Spend the rest of the time upskilling and working on projects.

They both hated it. And two others who have been at Amazon for the past 5 years, and are still there.\n\nAlso for Uber: tell them about your competing offers, and get a sign-on bonus.

The recruiter is a real piece of shit and is putting their thumb on the scale by pushing you to $180k so that they can tell the hiring manager you are expensive, making the candidate that the *recruiter* favors more likely to get the job.\n2. The recruiter is looking out for your best interest and doing you a favor - even if you don't get an offer. Sometimes the recruiter knows that salary will not be a factor in the final hiring decision. When I've hired, whenever there were high quality interviews, salary was the last thing I or anyone in the process cared about. Getting the call right on picking a high performer was all that mattered. Salary was only a factor when all of the candidates were meh and you didn't think getting a high performer was a likely outcome.\n\nThe reason for the dynamic in point 2 is simple. If you are a manager and hire a high performer, it makes what you deliver look good to your boss. In this scenario the boss will almost never care if the high performer's salary is high for the organization's salary bands or the salary is above market. It's the opposite. They will worry about retention if the salary is low. If you hire a mediocre performer, the boss will have questions. Being able to say that the person's salary is below market and you can't replace them without paying more can be satisfactory.",

Some people try to get around it via job hopping, but I've done hundreds of interviews for L3-L6 and it's incredibly uncommon to see serial L+1 hops, let alone within short intervals, especially after L5, because impact at higher levels simply doesn't materialize that quickly.",

If everyone is an overachiever then there will be no overachiever. If everyone sends over 1000 apps then you would have to send over 2000 apps. We interviewed 12 candidates out of 500 for internship this year so it's really irrelevant if we get 1000 or 200 or 3000 apps, result is the same. The number of interviews or roles available doesn't scale with applicant effort. There's always going to be winners and losers but the market will dictate how many winners vs losers there are.\n\nThere are going to be those who gets ahead while doing less than those who do more. Posts like this might aim to motivate, but they often verge on blame. Not everyone has the same starting point, resources, or guidance. If the market is going to get worse then it's better to adapt to a changing world then just keep doing the same thing and expecting different result.",

I used documentations, internet and AI to complete the task. \n\nAfter that submission got cleared and a follow up was arranged I had near 2 hours with 2 engineers going over all details of my submission. Ran the project locally and they asked me key performance and functionality questions. We discussed the shortcomings of my submission and what I could have done better… totally open conversation with many back and forth exchanges. Impossible to fake if you haven’t done the work or used AI without understanding. This is where they actually verify it all. \n\nHaving done these interviews I always left with the confidence that these guys know what they’re doing, and that I was respected as an adult. Not surprisingly, working with them has been a similar experience. \n\nI spend more time finding these companies than actual interviews. It’s not easy to come across such companies which also have great compensation and interesting projects so I have very specific set of questions to narrow down at the initial interview.

I ended up getting a pretty good TC (220k TC: 155k cash, 30k bonus, 35k stock). I think I posted my resume before, so you can take a look at my previous experience. \n\nIn general for a new grad, the bands are pretty tight (I could only get 10k higher even with another job offer as leverage). The big disparity in pay comes from the differences in companies. You shouldn’t be asking if your experience gets you $X, but rather if your resume (and interview skills) can get you into a FAANG-level company. Given the job market, this means you need something that makes you stand out on paper and in person. \n\nAlso, I would recommend not doing a PhD unless you’re really, really passionate. It’s not really a “pass the time” or “get more money” thing. Especially due to the DoE budget cuts, full funding may be unstable in many places over the next few years. This means you need to be competitive in your lab/department to retain funding if anything gets impacted.\n\nAlso, maybe it’s an anecdotal experience, but all the professors I’ve talked to said it’s a slight red flag to do a PhD at the same undergraduate school since you want to diversify your research and education.",

If you want to aim broad, that’s your prerogative but employers typically are looking for relatively narrow ranges of specialization with some level of depth. So you’d want to, at a minimum, have different resumes that cater more closely to the respective classes of job descriptions, and get more in depth than surface level keywords (e.g. anyone can name drop programming languages, but what about frameworks, ecosystem, etc)\n\nAlternatively go deep on one thing by hustling the crap out of that thing.

AKA, they are asking you to do too much than your capacity is actually at. \n\nYou have two choices, and one of them is the incorrect choice. The wrong choice is work extra hours to meet these expectations. This is the wrong choice because all this will do is set this as the new norm expectation and will also give them permission to push you further when crunch time happens. You will never benefit from this choice and will pay the price later on for it when you don't meet expectations when the expectations go up.\n\nChoice two is you clearly communicate in sprint planning that the stories being provided to you and your team is too high. You communicate that clearly as a team to the manager. If the manager doesn't care, cool. Then don't meet the goals and clearly communicate in retro why that wasn't done. Also, document in email writing somewhere so you have proof this was communicated to the manager. Not in a adversarial way. Just a way so they can't come back and claim no one told them.\n\nThen let manager deal with fallout of not meeting plans. As that is there job, not yours. Your job is just to do the tasks you are assigned and clearly communicate to the manager when expectations are being set are not realistic.\n\nIf this is a problem for your manager, then you need to look for a new employer.

Thankfully one of them realy wanted me and I got a job wihtin 3 months but Id still be jobless if it wasnt for that one job as most places I havent heard back from yet.\n\nI dont mean to scare you, I dont think it's impossible but you will have to be patient and do extra work to get callbacks. My adivce, apply everywhere. The job I got I had applied in december and didnt hear from them until april. So really if something pops up, apply and dont give up because you didnt hear back from them. Use linkedin and indeed (and other 3rd party sites) as search engines only. I would find positions and immedately apply through the company site. I dont know if this is true but Ive heard company sites will not look at 3rd party applications if they get enough from their main site. Use AI as a proofreader for your resume. You should write your own resume and then put it in AI. Dont copy-paste everything they say, more like use some phrases and mixi it inwith your resume to make it sound like a human made it.",

The one and only way to know how the market is going to treat *you* is by applying yourself. The market does not treat everyone equally. For example, I job searched in 2024 with 11 YOE, and didn't struggle at all to find a job. And yet I see countless stories of people with the same YOE as me, or more, post on this subreddit (in 2024, and now) complaining how they can't even get a single interview.\n\nIt can be hard to believe if your one and only source of information is this subreddit, but there are plenty of people with 2 YOE out there that aren't struggling at all to find a job. There's also plenty of new grads lining up just fine as well. They just aren't posting on an advice subreddit, because they *don't need advice*.\n\nNot only all that, but the market was *also* bad in 2023. Yet look at you! You got a job with 0 YOE! You must be doing something right. Something that a lot of other people in 2023 weren't doing, because there were tons of people struggling back then as well. So presumably youl'l be doing that same thing right today.\n\nYou're worrying before even trying. Come back to us in a few months if you can't find a job.",

It is your responsibility as the senior reviewing PRs to provide feedback to the person making the pull request that enables them to address your concerns with their code.\n\nOP, your issue here is that Mr.Newbie isn't pulling from your developer branch to merge the latest set of already merged code into their code, assuming your org is using *proper* version control guidelines of developers having personal branches per story, the team having a dev branch for every sprint and PRing work from the stories to the dev branch, then the dev branch to the main demo branch, then the demo branch to the production branch for use by the users. If your org is managing branches properly, the issue here is that Mr.Newbie wasn't pulling from the developer branch before PR'ing their branch to the dev branch. These conflicts tend to happen when multiple people are working on the same file. If anything, your frustration at this common inconvenience is itself indicative of a relative lack of experience working with version control in a group setting. **Try to be understanding of what it is like to be inexperienced with unfamiliar tools and a good mentor for the newhire.** Everyone is new to these tools at some point in their career, even you.\n\nOnce you are both pulling from dev before PRing to dev, you'll have to *intelligently handle any merging conflicts on your local build***, so be sure to push your changes before pulling to ensure you don't lose any work if you make a mistake.** Try to become a mentor for the newhire and retain a positive attitude about the team expanding. You should make an effort to find ways to gain visibility for your mentorship and beat the drum of how much progress you've made with training the newhire to resolve these issues during your scrums so that you get credit for the effort.\n\n  \nTbh, just showing up to work being able to explain that fairly basic solution to your org's problem and pitch the answer to it to your team ought to resolve the issue and make yourself seem rather knowledgeable in your next meeting.

You can read the code it outputs, but trust me - you can't understand it. Learning programming up to professional level is all about hitting those walls for weeks at time before it all ,,clicks''. You're saying that it would take 4x as long to learn - I'm saying that it's probably 20-30x longer - and that's the process that you consider ,,skipping'' now.\n\nConsider this: If OpenAI has a week long outage can you be productive or do you take that week off because it's like someone turned your brain off?\n\nTo work in this industry, you **need** to be able to code, brainstorm and reason about the flow of logic in a big complex project. If you don't do it, you're maybe 20% better than a rando of a street after 2 weeks of crash course on vibe coding because you have algo/ds classes over him. You're still not getting a job from me.\n\nI'm a Principal SWE at a big company with over 10 years of experience and when we interview we would never hire a person that cannot code without AI assistance.

That is when a team has decided to create a job to make a career move for an employee (maybe a promotion, maybe a diagonal move), and in order to create that new role - even if they intend to hire internally - they need to (by law) post the job publicly and have that posting up for at least some amount of time before hiring.\n\nEDIT: u/ImSuperHelpful is correct - it's not by law, but it seems to be a very popular policy at a lot of companies to prevent nepotism/encourage diversity. It's been the case at every large company I have worked at. I also wonder if it helps to prevent potential lawsuits for discrimination.\n\nThe idea of having posts out there that the company does not intend to hire for generally doesn't fly at most companies because the entire process of creating a job posting starts with actually getting a real job approved first.\n\nIt's also why recruiters can't just create a job posting to look busy - again, it would be the hiring manager (i..e, the person who owns the team where the new employee would work) that would need to get the job itself approved by his leadership before HR and recruiters get involved.\n\nNow, I don't doubt that there are some companies that do that - I think that might be true for super mega large companies like Meta, Microsoft - and that is to have a generic job posting meant to attract candidates for a large swath of jobs, but without necessarily having a job opening right this moment. But I think that's a minority of companies that do that.\n\nI think as someone else said, the other source of issues might be 3rd party recruiters posting fake jobs to farm resumes - but those should be easy to spot because they wouldn't actually tie to a real company's job posting.\n\nI think the reality is that a lot of this job postings are real - there's just so many applicants (including internal ones), that it probably feels like they're fake.",

No matter how skilled you are, it doesnt matter because there are so many good candidates with degrees struggling. Why would a company do the effort to evaluate you, when they can spend that effort interviewing people with a CS degree. \n\nMaybe in the future, something like this and bootcamps will be viable again. But I don't see that happening anytime soon. If you want to work in this field, you need a degree at the bare minimum. Something like WGU would at least get you past the automated resume checker. This pathway would not. Following something like this, if you were lucky and skilled, might lead to a job where you are underpaid and overworked to get your foot in the door at best. Most likely you won't even get a single interview. I'm sorry it's this way, and this situation brings me no pleasure, but this is the simple truth.",

It's not really about being able to talk about math topics relevant to CS like groups, rings, fields, graphs, combinatorics, etc. but it's more like the ability to think about how your code logically \"guarantees\" certain outputs given certain inputs.",

People do get lucky, and I mean lucky, and get jobs without degrees, but it’s few and far between currently. To note, I am only talking about post 2022 to present. Before 2022, the need for junior level developers was a lot higher, but with outsourcing and AI, junior level tasks no longer need an associate to complete. Not to mention during Covid, overhiring was ramped and some companies are still trimming the fat with layoffs.\n\nAs a graduate you are expected to have atleast one internship under your belt, with a year of experience, and a deep understanding of CS. CsMajors who lack a portfolio or skills will not make it through technical interviews but will beat out ATS filtering because of the degree. I would say also, the notion the average CS major can’t code is relatively false on average, an average CS graduate is relatively capable, but there is roughly bottom 20% who are completely lost. \n\nNow keep in mind there are fewer jobs in SWE then their used to be, and more CS graduates both in Bachelors and Masters programs then ever before. Most good companies will receive 100s of applicants and have only 2 jobs available. From a business perspective, why not filter by degrees and get an academically strong candidate with experience and a portfolio. To beat this out you will likely need a strong open source portfolio, with live production level applications and very good networking, I can not emphasize this enough, without a degree you will need to be well networked. It’s possible but it is an uphill battle often as you don’t have the resources of college students or a piece of paper saying you know what you know. Again I’m not saying you shouldn’t try, but I am trying to warn you, switching into tech rn, might not be as easy as it was once advertised. \n\nBest of luck, I really do not envy people looking to get into tech today.\n\nAs for my creds… I was a college TA and tutor for CS classes, currently a SWE and I conduct interviews at my current company.

I would say, you should ask yourself what is something YOU would want to build, and try to find resources online that tell you how to build it. It doesn’t have to be anything crazy, maybe a small tip calculator project or something. If it’s something you can figure out, and you find that you enjoy doing it, then there’s a good chance that you’ll enjoy a career in CS and could potentially figure it out in time. If you find that it’s too confusing to do even a small simple project or that you absolutely hated doing it, then this is probably not the career for you. Most engineers would tell you, the reason they enjoy CS is that feeling you get when you spent hours trying to figure out how to do that one thing and FINALLY figure it out. There is no better feeling. The reason I got into programming was because I liked making mods for games.\n\n3. Explore IT a bit too, look into networking, security, hardware, etc. I’m not in IT, so I can’t give you as much advice on it. But before you decide on a major, be sure it’s something you could see yourself doing everyday. You don’t want to waste time and money on a major that you hate.",

The field of CS is all about answering those questions.\n\n\nTo answer those questions you'll need to learn the language of computers, which is a field on its own. Just like math is necessary for understanding physics, programming is necessary for understanding computer science. But physics is not math, and computer science is not programming.",

I've made the transition from startups and mid-sized, low-billions-valuation companies to FANG. It wasn't hard for me to get interviews, as this was many years ago when FANG recruiters would reach out on LinkedIn and such. It was harder to get offers (there's more luck involved than anyone tells you), but I managed to do it by Leetcoding and really trying to understand the algorithms and patterns instead of memorizing solutions. There has been Leetcode escalation since my time there, but I don't have enough interview experience these days to tell you how much.\n\nI think if you're just in it for the TC and/or life experience to be at a FANG/Fortune 5 company first hand, then definitely at least try it so you don't feel like you missed something. I'm glad I did just so I knew what it was like.\n\nI would recommend against it if you are expecting to seriously level up your dev game. If you're already a highly productive dev at your company and you deliver things faster than your peers and understand all of the tradeoffs of your tech, then you probably won't learn as much as you might think. You'll probably just learn how to use their old, custom tools that solve the same problems you've already solved at your startup but with more popular, open-source tools. Some of what you hear about crazy WLB is because at one point (and maybe still, I don't know) FANG was hiring a ton of new grads who didn't know anything and then were dropped in the deep end. I wasn't at FANG very long, but I still saw many interns and new grad hires cycle through my team and it seemed like a lot of what they didn't like were just things they didn't know because they had no other work experience.\n\nI can't say it was the right move career wise because I'm personally of the belief that FANG doesn't have the reputation it once had and could be off-putting to some in this hyper-polarized society we live in now. Many of my teammates at a local company would actively trash FANG and viewed people who worked there as being active and willing participants in hurting society (not joking). At the very least, I suspect saying you worked at FANG today will be kind of like hearing another dev tell you about how they worked at Yahoo in the '90s. Maybe a cool story but won't really open any doors. But I have no regrets!\n\nBest of luck to you!",

        "body": "How much applying did you do in 2021-2022 specifically?\n\nThat was the golden age of this industry. It was what created the bootcamp/self-teaching craze, where anyone could drop some money on a 1-month bootcamp and land a 6-figure job without a degree. Demand greatly outpaced supply. New grads were easily breaking in, experienced devs were job hopping for insane salary increases... it was chaos.\n\nI ask because this is a very different conversation if most of your applying happened in 2020 (bad market from covid), and 2023-2025 (bad market thanks to 2021-2022), versus if you were trying in the golden era.\n\nIf you were trying in the golden era with a CS degere and weren't getting interviews... something's very wrong. I have some complaints about your resume (that might be more relevant in todays market), but none that would warrant 0 responses in the golden era, it's not *that* bad. One thing I would definitely do is remove your Civil Engineering degree. Generally you only want to list *relevant* skills/qualifications on your resume. While getting that degree is an impressive feat, it's not relevant if you want to be a SWE. I'd give the same advice about your sales experience, you can keep that there, but you should be leaning into the soft-skills side of it to tie it back to something employers value in a SWE. Exceeding sales targets is not relevant to being a SWE. But I bet you picked up some really strong communication skills from that role, talk about *that.* Try reading through your whole resume with that in mind: \"What am I trying to communicate to the reader here? Is this relevant to SWE?\".\n\nWhat kinds of roles were you applying to? Were you just applying to roles grossly outside your qualifications? What kinds of companies? Large F500 companies are much more likely to hire new grads than small companies for example., if your search was focused on small companies in your local town that could be a problem. Are you willing to relocate? Relocation is the norm for your first job out of college, even in good markets. That could be an issue if you're not. Are you applying just in the \"sexy\" cities, or are you branching out to cities that people aren't dying to move to? Are you trying to immigrate to the US or something?\n\nThe issue is if you're not getting calls, there's not really that much that *could* be wrong. It's pretty much either your resume, or the companies/roles/locations you're applying for. Even in this market, despite what this subreddit may lead you to believe, there are plenty of new grads getting jobs lined up out of college so just putting all the blame on the market is not productive.",

        "body": "If you work at a company that is expected to be online 24/7, there will always be 24/7 on call. So if the on call by itself is your issue, you'd need to look for teams whose products are only used during business hours. They're definitely out there, but not super common.\n\nFrom a rotation/frequency standpoint what you're describing is pretty standard. I've been on call at every company I've worked for, the rotations have always lasted 2 weeks, and the frequency of rotation obviously depended on how large the team was.\n\nThe issue to me personally would be the amount of calls you're getting after hours. The word \"normal\" isn't a useful term to use for things like this, because being called super frequently absolutely *is* normal at a lot of companies. But it's not normal at others. There isn't an industry-wide normality you can refer to, there's a lot of variety.\n\nOne thing I make it a point to do when I'm reverse-interviewing is discuss exactly this. I ask about rotation, how many times they get after-hours calls, business-hours calls, an example of what the team did in reaction to an after hours call, etc. I'm trying to establish the product stability and the team norms so I can decide to join or not.\n\nWhat I'm usually looking for when I ask about after-hours calls is a few calls *per year*. After hours calls need to be treated extremely seriously, and should be \"Fix ASAP\" kind of issues. If the product is so on fire that they can't keep up with patching after-hours issues, and you're getting called even once a week, I want no part of that product.\n\nWhen I was job searching in 2021 I had offers from several companies. When I asked one of them about after-hours calls, the hiring manager smiled and proudly said \"we only get a few calls a month!\".... the fact that was *good* in their mind set off alarm bells in mine. Another company responded \"Well the product's only a couple years old, but we've never been called after hours so far, most of our support issues are during business hours\". Green flag. I joined them. I only ended up staying there about 2.5 years, but I indeed got called 0 times after hours during that time.",

I think the general consensus is that new grads need about 6 months to fully onboard and become truly productive, contributing members of their teams. So in effect, to potential employers, you only have 6 months of actual experience doing the job. Again, that isn’t nothing, but it *really* isn’t much. Then there’s the question of why you’re looking for a new job so soon, and by that point it’s probably a tough sell unless you have a good referral that can vouch for you (also unlikely with only 1 YOE).\n\nBy all means apply for roles that you find interesting and aren’t much of a stretch, but you’re up against some decent headwinds that will affect your success rate.",

Add your current experience and when asked, tell them more or less what you said here. Say you felt the job wasnt in line with what you wanted for yourself. \n\nAs for promotions, it may hold you back a year. Really depends on job and on you. Promotions arent really due to YOE. It's a factor but really promotions are due to your output. If your output is expected than expect 2-3 years to get promoted. If you always over-perfrom expect to get promoted quickly. It's easier to go from SWE1 to SWE2 than it is to SWE2 to Sr SWE. Basically the higher you go up the harder it becomes to go to the following level. So you aren't really in a bad position. If you try to overperform your first year you may get promoted between 12-18 months at the job.",

It's not the highest you'll see, but it's definitely within reach.\n\nFrom my own experiences (and I'm no expert), LeetCode is super common in NYC tech interviews. They love to throw algorithmic problems at you, so be prepared! That being said, don't sweat too much about it - just practice and you'll get the hang of it. If you're interested, I can share an AI tool that helped me feel more confident during my own interviews.\n\nAs for your resume, it looks solid! You've got a good balance of work experience and skills. One thing to consider is tailoring your resume to the specific job you're applying for - make sure to highlight any relevant projects or experiences that match the job description. If you want to hear more about how I tweaked my own resume, feel free to ask and I'd be happy to share!",

So I also didn't have much to show for. From USA but did a thesis based masters in Canada, they paid me to TA and RA and I got a full stack internship in there too. Moved back and got a dev job. Its kind of a weird round about thing and highly inefficient, but that time was formative and don't regret it. Also left with like 20k cad, so had a decent emergency budget already setup. So if you want another couple years to figure shit out, love moving and experiencing new places and people then consider doing the Canadian MSc unless u can get funded in the usa but normally only PhD is funded.\n\nAlso bay area might be competitive but they have some many more jobs than other places. Near DC and its either defense, Amazon, or some shitty non defense contractor that pays 50k",

Plus, getting a solid foundation in computer science can open the door to more technical roles within cybersecurity down the line.\n\n  \nNow if you solely want to learn the material, and don't also want degree there are dozens posts on self teaching CS and how to cover all the topics in a BS CS.",

Over half of them are out of work right now. \n\nFor comparison, I usually get 4-7 callbacks per week. Maybe a 10-20% response rate. \n\nIt's a REALLY fucked up market right now. Ai and layoffs mean every posting is flooded and they get a LOT of false positives. \n\nThe most important thing is to be one of the first applicants so your resume actually gets seen. Sort by new first thing in the morning and apply to everything posted that day. \n\nLook for local companies who want you in office.

Base pay was an extra 30k but with bonuses and RSUS it was closer to an exrtr 70k for the next few years. It was alot of work and stressful. i worked in cloud which is known as the deat of work life balance, I just didnt realize how crazy it would be. There was a silent agreement to always be avaialbe. I was a mid-level and expected to do the work of a principal would do at other companies. If you dont paly their game they will PIP you within a year or two and fire you. Working 50-60 hours was the norm and even then it didnt feel like enough. \n\nSometimes that extra 30% in pay means 100% more in work. Im glad im past that and made all the money I made but if I had known back then that my next 3 eyars was going to be like that I wouldnt have done it. At my first job I was in line for promotions and likely would've been a high level senior, but in FAANG I was far from promotion. People I knew who were overperformers were far from promotion.\n\nIm not saying this will happen to you but really make sure you this is something you can sustain and the expectation is reasonable. If you absolutelty need that extra 40k I say go for it but if you dont really need it, I say consider the options and find out if this will give you work life balance and career growth. Im all for grinding when young but you shouldnt have to drive yourself to the ground for it either.",

You are still going to have to do all the things you aren’t talking about (like leetcode grinding) to get a job with a masters unless you get into a very good program that has job placements.\n\nFull stack development is a really difficult first job to get if you don’t have extensive projects or internships to show you can actually do it.",

I wouldn't do one just to do one.\n\nI'm doing a masters, but I wanted to go for a PhD since I was a freshman. Had pretty bad undergrad gpa from some earlier years (I left and returned to college 3 years later) at a really low ranked college, but still wanted to do my PhD at T50. I couldn't qualify for a lot of internships because of GPA requirements, but with a masters I could since it would just go off that GPA. I also wanted to work some a federal job. \n\nSo doing my masters now at school T100 school with a 4.0 and currently in the interview process for a job with my dream federal agency where if I get I'll start at GS-7 (56k) and once I finish my masters I'll go to GS-9 (69k). The hiring manager actually seemed interested cause AI is designated as mission critical for the US government and my concentration for my masters is AI/ML. I guess with the lower pay and it being several hours from a large metro that it's harder to find young workers. Plus they said they'd help me get my PhD if I got the job which would put me at GS-11 for 84k.\n\nIf it would actually be needed for the path you want to follow then go for it. But outside of a federal job pay boost or wanting to do research it may not help. Plus you sound like you dont want to do it.",

You're not expected to know these things up front, but are expected to learn over time.\n\nFor example, reading from a file. In school, you can load the entire file into memory at once, and read one line at a time. In reality, what if the file is 100 GB? What if you are trying to read from a .txt or some other file, but the line is 2GB?\n\nAnother example - it is really easy to accidentally write something like:\n\n>if (x=5)\n\nIn certain languages, assigning a value to a variable will always evaluate as true, so the code inside the if statement will always be executed. It is really easy to leave out the second equals sign, so some companies have policies where you must program defensively like\n\n>if (5==x)\n\nbecause you can't assign a variable to a constant.\n\nIn general, I wouldn't say it is more challenging, but over time you will be exposed to more scenarios where code or software can fail, and you will learn how to deal with those scenarios - when and how to fix, and when to decide something isn't worth fixing.",

A master’s might open some doors for AI-focused jobs, but if you’re aiming for research or highly technical ML engineering roles at FAANG level companies, having a PhD is still the norm.",

The most competitive research roles are mostly for people from the most pedigreed research labs and programs, so not just any PhD.\n\nIn industry you will find plenty of people with CS, science, engineering, math, econ PhDs, etc. doing applied AI/ML. Many also just have an MS. Depends on the team and company, and nature of the work. Some will more heavily prefer PhD over MS. Some just want MS and BS is not enough, basically a hard filter. Other places, particularly if leaning towards more analyst-like work, may hire BS grads.\n\nThere are plenty of people without graduate degrees working AI/ML jobs but more likely on SWE side and many of them already have experience in the area (and got that opportunity when the field was newer). If you don't already have prior experience in AI/ML and want to work in it, an MS is a good investment.\n\nBut if you want to do research in industry or academia, your educational goal needs to be PhD, so don't get an MS if you're considering stopping there.",
