The new tools built in rust, and with interoperability in mind via open formats - both storage with parquet+deltalake/iceberg and in memory with arrow - that work natively in-process with python bindings and even out-of-process, are going to be much easier to work.\n\nI've been plugging away at using daft, which can run in-process with python, or out of process on a single machine, or across a ray cluster. You can take the same code and run it in something super lightweight and then scale it out to a huge cluster. No need to change processing engines.\n\nI can see more being built around duckdb for the same purpose.\n\nI've seen someone benchmark running daft distributed within a databricks cluster and it being *faster*. That is you start up a Databricks cluster, install daft and ray, and you get better performance than the spark instances you're running alongside. At that point Databricks is just a glorified cluster manager and notebook provider.\n\nSpark is just too cumbersome and too awkard to deal with. It isn't suitable for small use-cases, and in very large ones it can be arcane to figure out what is going on. People just can't develop skills with it until they are working at a huge scale, so they get chucked in the deep end with issues.\n\nThese new tools will let people get experience on their own machine, it will let DS and DA roles grapple with things directly, and let everyone get essentially the same experience when they work at scale.",

Thanks for the shoutout, really heartening to see so much of the community resonating with the same frustrations that we had when we first started the project…\n\nHere are some key guiding principles which I hold dear to the data software that we want to build for the future:\n\n1. Python-first, with native wheels that don’t require external dependencies\n\n2. Works on ANY scale — effective both for a 60MB CSV as well as 100TB of Parquet/Iceberg. This means having best-in-class local as well as distributed engines\n\n3. Works on ANY modality — data today is more than just JOINs and GROUPBYs. The reality is that data is messy and unstructured!! Sometimes my UDF fails but I don’t want it to kill my entire job…\n\nWe’re trying to be more public with our roadmap and stuff too so please let us know if there is interest. For instance, we will be working to reduce reliance on Ray as a hard dependency soon and enable raw Kubernetes deployments (which seems to be a common ask), and we have a Dashboard in the works (we call this Spark UI++). \n\nAppreciate the support here ❤️keep plumbing away r/dataengineering the daft team will be here to make things with less oom and more zoom.",

Overall we were spending the same amount for etl.\n\nMight look into if airbyte self hosted is the way to go but I feel like it’ll be more faff vs going with fivetran/airbyte-clpud and in small data teams where saving 30k matters … it probably means that we’re limited on time and taking time out to fix and build connectors would be counter productive.\n\nI’ve also found fivetran’s connectors to be better than what airbyte cloud gave us right out of the box.",

You can process arbitrarily large datasets using a standard declarative  syntax and not have to worry about running out of memory. DuckDB works well for single user / single node otherwise there is a plethora of other databases available if you need distributed processing or to share amongst multiple users.\n\nSpark is overkill for most situations and even for the situations it isn't overkill for you still have to question whether you actually want to deal with it. Its slow and bloated like anything JVM based. I also find it ironic that Databricks is investing a large chunk of energy turning Spark into a SQL engine because it turns out the vast majority of data processing can be described in terms of SQL.",

It's genuinely good to see someone mapping out what they've learned with this much clarity, especially the enthusiasm for the core DE work – debugging, building, improving infrastructure. You've definitely hit on some crucial points that many take years to internalize.\n\nThings like focusing on pipeline resilience, code quality, and the importance of documentation are spot on. That’s the stuff that separates okay pipelines from robust, maintainable systems. The emphasis on CI/CD, templates, and understanding SQL fundamentals alongside frameworks like Spark/Pandas shows you're building a really well-rounded technical base. Keep that momentum going – the learning curve is steep, but you're clearly navigating it well.\n\nJust a couple of thoughts to add from experience:\n\n- You're right that physical presence can boost visibility and make ad-hoc collaboration easier, especially in certain environments or client-facing roles. However, it's worth developing the skills to achieve similar communication effectiveness and relationship building remotely. Mastering clear documentation (which you already value!), proactive updates, and strong asynchronous communication is vital, as many teams are distributed or hybrid. The core skill is effective collaboration, whatever the medium - so don't view remote work as inherently having fewer opportunities; it just requires different strengths.\n\n- Regarding DRY and OOP, I have no doubt they are good principles. Just remember the other side: sometimes abstracting too early or creating overly complex OOP structures can hurt readability more than duplicated code, especially for simpler tasks. Finding that balance between avoiding repetition and maintaining simplicity/clarity comes with practice. You're right to question when not to use OOP though!\n\n- You've got the right idea with watermarks and parameterization for the pipeline self-healing process. Also think about idempotency – ensuring your tasks can run multiple times with the same input and produce the same outcome. It’s key for reliable reruns and recovery. And as you mature your pipelines, layer in dedicated data quality testing on top of unit/integration tests.\n\n- Definitely keep that volunteering spirit intact to improve things. Just learn to balance it strategically cuz it's easy to get pulled into fixing everything legacy, so make sure those efforts align with broader team goals and don't consistently derail your primary project responsibilities.\n\n- This is more of a personal ick, but I generally don't emphasize too much on documenting the finer details of a codebase, since things change and us devs can spend more time documenting things instead of focusing on what matters to our stakeholders.\n\nOverall, your reflections show a great attitude and a solid understanding of what makes a good DE. You're focusing on the right areas – technical depth, process improvement, and collaboration. Keep learning, stay curious, and continue refining that craft. You're well on your way :)",

Honestly, DE is so backend, I would generally rather business users not come to me directly. \nAnd my experience with pre commit and linter has largely been negative. \n\nDocumention is always extremely valuable. Consistent naming conventions and packages is critical. Our consultants did neither and it is a shit show. \n\nOOP can be helpful in some regards, but I'm with you that FP is more than sufficient for the bulk of jobs. OOP overcomplicates, makes debugging more difficult and time consuming, and is rather rigid. It's worth it if it is scalable, but if it takes the same level of effort to cram all the SQL and configs into an OOP approach as just coding it from scratch in FP, you might as well use FP. \n\nI'm coming up on my 1 year as well. My biggest lessons have been think in terms of frameworks (how can you organize your code, how can you automate or parameterize development, etc.), that you simply can't learn everything and delegation is critical, knowledge of the business data is extremely important, that InfoSec is a PITA, and think through things before implementing anything (nothing is ever as simple as it first seems).",

        "body": "Yes, I’d argue that data governance is one of the most critical aspects of any data or IT related field. That said, it’s not flashy, and it’s rarely a direct path to monetization unless you’re working in a highly regulated industry. In most cases its something I think you layer on top of your existing data skills to increase your value in the market, whether you're a data engineer, analyst, team lead, or CDO. But generally once you step into a management role, governance quickly becomes central. At that level, almost every decision touches on it in some way. And I definitely see its importance growing on a broader scale, albeit from a different than traditional point of view that there are generally much more CDO's and data leaders out there who require and need those skills or that organizations are failing in mode modern projects like AI or digital twins and learn the hard way the requirement of governance.  So I guess overall its just more streamlined and integrated into broader management, data transformation, and change management efforts.\n\nTo answer your question directly. Is data governance essential to land a job? I don't think so, unless you're lucky or in a specific industry. But can it significantly increase your value in a data related career? Absolutely, especially if you're entering the management area.",

You can define columns without reference to dataframes, so you can make a list of column expressions *before* you work with the dataframes.\n\nedit: I shouldn't do this at 2am. ~~Your slice [] of the map column based on a key means spark is creating a column expressions mapping every key:value in mapping, then throwing it all away to pick a single key from the map.~~\n\nAll of this requires communication between spark and pyspark, which takes time. When you do it 600 times it takes a while.\n\nEvery time you chain dataframe defining functions pyspark calls out to spark to build a plan. Time spent on the plan increases exponentially as you have more steps as each step takes longer as it builds on the last. 600 dataframe definitions is a lot.\n\nDo the `json.loads` once for each mapping, not for each variable for each model. \n\nedit: I shouldn't do this at 2am. ~~Don't create a full map column just to select one key out of it, just get the value from the original mappings dict. Don't chain withColumn, generate all the column definitions into a list then do `df.select(\"*\",*listofcols)`~~ \n\nedit: fixing 2am mistakes...\n\nEven though the key you pull from the map is the value in column 'v', you are parsing and defining the same map dtype column multiple times -- 150 times if it is the 10 models and 15 variables looping over the same 4 mappings. Think of the size and complexity of this query as it gets built out, where spark is generating 600 chained 'views' with hundreds of mapping objects, and every mapping gets used so cannot be discarded before processing.\n\nIn pandas you don't have this because the mapping object is available in the same process directly and doesn't need to be duplicated data per row. It also processes the dataframe in full at each step, so it can discard any previously used map as it goes. Whereas spark can't access your dict directly and has lazy evaluation, so it has to 'remember' every single generation of every map field all at once when it finally runs, and will be duplicating the data into each row in its behind-the-scenes rdd.\n\nYou want to only parse each model once, and only generate its map once, and reuse that. You also want to make a list of your output columns then use `.select()` on them all at once. To make the reuse explicit you can split it into two selects.\n\n    df = some_input\n    m = model\n\n    original_colnames [c for c in df.columns]\n    # parse the mappings once\n    mapping_dicts = [json.loads(mp) for mp in mappings)\n    # generate the mapping cols once\n    mapping_cols = [\n      F.create_map([F.lit(k_or_v) for kv in mapping_dict.items()]).alias(f\"map_{i}\")\n      for i,mapping_dict in enumerate(mapping_dicts)\n    ]\n    # define all variable redirections through the map all together\n    mapped_cols = [\n        F.col(\"map_{i}\")[F.col(f\"some_var_{v}\")].alias(f\"new_{m}\") # something seems off here\n        for v in variables\n        for i in range(len(mapping_cols))\n    ]\n    # generate new dataframe\n    new_df = (\n      # define a dataframe with the mappings in a first step\n      # (so you can easily view this df if you cut the code up)\n      df.select(\n        *original_colnames,\n        *mapping_cols\n      )\n      # use the defined maps to generate the output columns\n      .select(\n        *original_colnames,\n        *mapped_cols\n      )\n    )\n\n    return df\n\nNote that you don't *have* to do this in two selects if you reuse the actual column objects, but then you can't as easily check the intermediate state with just the mappings available.",

I did ask them where this data would eventually live. They told me assume it was a database then I asked about a dashboard where I mentioned where the schema normalization would be important to make sure that on the front end you could identify specific filters to show the user (like drop downs). \n\nAlso, your point about aligning with their existing tech stack is spot on. I think I got a little too caught up in the idea of feeding everything into an LLM pipeline with vectorization + embeddings. Probably came off like I was optimizing for a use case they didn’t even confirm.\n\nIn hindsight, I should’ve slowed down and clarified whether they needed real-time ingestion, what the downstream usage was (e.g., dashboarding vs search vs ML), and whether historical backfill was in scope. I was so nervous lol 😅. Thank you for your answer",

A lot of experienced data engineers hit this wall after working with legacy tools, especially when the market shifts fast. Most would also wish they had the experience. The good news is: you’ve already taken the hardest step. You recognized the change and started upskilling. Python, Spark, SQL—those are the right moves. You’re not starting from zero.\n\nNow it’s time to shift from learning to building especially showcase a story / impact. Courses are fine, but real traction comes when you can point to something you’ve created. Set up a public GitHub repo with two or three small but complete projects. Think end-to-end: pull in data, transform it with PySpark or dbt, orchestrate it with Airflow, push it into a warehouse like BigQuery or Snowflake. Even if it’s basic, the fact that it works is what hiring managers want to see. Aka you are self sufficient and not to be watched but deliver results.\n\nAt the same time, tighten how you talk about yourself. You’re not “catching up”—you’re evolving. Build a 60-second intro that shows you’ve worked in high-scale environments and now you’ve added modern tools to your stack. The story needs to be clear and confident.\n\nAlso—don’t get stuck applying to roles blindly. Be intentional. Focus on companies in transition—those moving from legacy to cloud. Your past is an asset, not a liability. It’s not about having every shiny skill. It’s about showing you can adapt and ship. Do that, and doors will open. Keep going. Good luck 🍀 keep us posted.",

I have seen so many databases filled with stored procedures that no one wants to touch and they aren’t being version controlled.\n\nWith DBT you organize sql scripts in nice little project folders. Add as much or as little documentation as you wish. You can reuse common snippets of code (macros) among the scripts, which is helpful for making the code modular. The whole thing is code so it harmonizes nicely with git and version control. Finally, the little SQL scripts are easily referenceable by orchestrators to be used as building blocks in other programs.\n\nDuckdb is used to create versatile lightweight ephemeral database instances that can hold a lot of data in memory and can run blazing fast queries and joins in SQL. If you need to temporarily store data then duckdb is a nice way to ingest, transform, and stage data on its way to some more permanent system. Well, you can even use duckdb as the final resting place for some data since it is after all a portable embedded database like SQLite. Duckdb can fit just about anywhere in a data pipeline, but it’s especially useful for memory-intensive or slow tasks that are bottlenecking your workflow.\n\nHonestly the tools have a ton of overlap and you could very well use both, like [this guy](https://georgheiler.com/post/dbt-duckdb-production/).",

Duckdb is fast but not immune to OOM especially when using window functions or pivot/unpivot. One way to get around this is writing a dbt macro that runs your sql per batch and union the results. \nSo all in all it works great but dbt-duckdb doesn’t give you the all the same bells and whistles as dbt-Postgress would. Depends I guess on your specific use case.",

I don't think there is a formula you can follow to stand out ahead of 499 other candidates (that's a suspiciously large and round number that makes be doubt the truth behind the post...) and the sort of person who writes this sort of shit is going to be an annoying, impulsive person who will bin a candidate on a whim because \"the vibes are off\" or something.\n\nThat said there are a couple of nuggets of truth here:\n\n1. spamming heaps of nonsense in your CV is going to just make it look busy, it's not necessarily going to help. There's a quote about writing in general - \"Perfection is achieved, not when there is *nothing* more to add, but when there is *nothing left to take away*\". Giving someone 6 page CV isn't going to make them think \"this person is seriously experienced\" it's going to make them roll their eyes a bit. That shouldn't discount that candidate (I definitely wouldn't throw a 6-page CV in the bin, for example), but it definitely doesn't help.\n2. making \"hail mary\" applications as an entry-level dev for a position that is advertised as a senior position may *feel* productive but is kind of a waste of your time and the recruiter's time. There may be exceptions - maybe they were planning on also hiring someone junior and may contact you about that position - but that's kind of rare.\n\nSimilarly for the \"there's no such thing as entry level in data engineering\" - that's someone trying to appear profound, but instead is frankly coming across as an unhelpful dick.\n\nIf you're lacking experience try for internships, give Google's [Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) a shot, try to do some self-study and personal projects or find some open source project you can contribute to. For the open source projects you can contribute even if you're \"only\" writing tests, documentation etc - that's a really valuable contribution, and demonstrates some commitment and could quite easily lead to contributing fixes and features in the future.",

If you've never worked as a data practitioner (DS, DA, AE, BIA, pricing analyst, etc) before, then go for these and think about making the transition a few years down the road. The job is entirely dependent on having a practical understanding of how data is consumed downstream of its production, and you just cannot have a clue if you haven't spent a few years of your life, well, consuming data.\n\n80-90% of the DEs I know have basically the same story. STEM degree(s), 2-6 YoE in Data, legitimate interest in software engineering (reading books, recreational programming, etc), makes the transition by learning the trade directly from the DEs working under the same roof. These roadmaps may give you the impression you can make the jump by learning the right tech. Learning bash, SQL and python is more like the bare minimum for most data jobs, honestly, not exactly a recipe for becoming a DE.\n\nI know the job title is pretty sexy, but trust me when I say you have no idea of what's it like.

It would depend on what you prefer.\n\nMy preference would be to go deep as for 3 YOE you have quite a wide tech stack so becoming an expert in these technologies will take time and possibly be a good value addition for your next role.\n\n1. Definitely be an expert in Python, SQL and either Snowflake or Pyspark. This can be your core. It is a quite wide stack that will certainly get interview calls and this can become your strengths when you talk about yourself in interviews.\n\n2. DBT and Airflow can be next to master. By mastery I mean you should know what are real bugs/limitations you encountered, how you migrated across versions, how you managed deployments of 1000s of models or pipelines, etc. What works for 10 jobs rarely works for 1000s.\n\n3. For good companies data structures and algo will most likely come in picture. Be good at fundamentals around data warehousing, data modeling, data architectures. DDIA is a must read. General system design can become relevant.\n\n4. Streamlit is a very nice to have feature, not sure about job interviews but once you are in a role it will help you shine if you can demonstrate good insights from the data that you are engineering. Same applies for ML engineering.\n\n5. A good background in a database technology can also be a good thing. Postgresql has emerged as a standard but that again is going to take quite some time to master.\n\n  \nAll the best!",

If you have automatic retries enabled on the thing running your dbt model, then you'll retry it after its timed out on the higher warehouse. So lots of options..\n\nThe chunking may be easier to handle dynamically by parameterising stored procedures in snowflake too :)",

I think they are in various stages of \"good\", it kind of depends on your use-case.\n\nFor example, I actually build such a tool, [VerbaGPT.com](http://verbagpt.com/) My tool is focused on *data privacy*. Instead of web-based, users can download my tool to their machine, and then query their CSV, TXT, or SQL (MS-SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL) data. The LLM gets data schema (or parts of it that the user explicitly shares), but doesn't get access to actual data itself. There is also option for offline use with Ollama, but on-device LLMs aren't as good (but rapidly getting better!\\*). My tool also provides a way/process to curate lots of context about databases, tables, columns, etc. - that helps with performance on complex or domain-specific uses.\n\nIn contrast, other tools are easier to get started with since they are web-based. Downside being there is another vendor-in-the-middle that gets access to data. Very few have good support for SQL databases, and those that do are generally text-to-sql, instead of text-to-python. The difference being that with python you can do a lot more, like data modeling, analysis, visualizations etc.\n\nThe State of Art (SOTA) feeds into what can be done with text-to-sql. With [VerbaGPT.com](http://VerbaGPT.com) my vision is that one day domain experts can ask questions in natural language, and get answers. This has two big assumptions. One is that LLMs are good enough to return accurate responses, every time. This isn't where SOTA is at currently, but getting closer. The second is that LLMs are good enough to understand and disambiguate \"user intent\". We have lots of work to do here. The net result is that I don't like auto-execution of code and getting responses in the chat window. I like \"human-in-the-loop\" approach today and for the near-term future, and that is how I designed VerbaGPT to function.\n\nIt's a complicated landscape. I like the tool I built (I'm of course biased), even though it is less polished than some others. Other tools I like include DataLabs by DataCamp (though it became a tad glitchy lately, not sure why). Vanna ai is also something to look into. Databricks has done some neat stuff here as well (but can get expensive with lots of data and compute). \n\n\\*offline processing example: [https://youtu.be/NNiNKOstP5o?si=xp3y1h3dk3JMPLLP](https://youtu.be/NNiNKOstP5o?si=xp3y1h3dk3JMPLLP)",

Those people need to introduce OLAP as part of their stack, the value prop of what we offer in that case is that we make the opinionated choices for you, the glue is built in the framework for the different pieces of the stack so you don't have to worry about that. \n\nFor bigger orgs that already have something like a Databrick or a Snowflake, we see data engineering with huge backlogs that has a hard time to respond to demand for analytics. All of the data is pretty alive and fluid and what was the golden standard at day 0 is not so golden at day 100.

It is hard to admit for me but I am a consultant data engineer for 3 years and I never wrote a single stored procedure ever. Because my client never let’s me. I feel like a ghost member. There are a lot of stupid work in reporting side and imagine there are stored procedures but they are written by others and they expect me to create similarly new ones by referencing them. This has been like that for years. There were months that I had 0 tickets. And usually testing is being done after a year so I would forget what I did months ago anyway. My company doesn’t care about me and see me as a lunatic when I complain I can’t work. \n\nBut I did what most people never do. I learned A LOT of shiny tech to variety of degrees because I had a lot of free time. Learned two cloud providers, some DevOps, some IaC, obtained many certifications and deepened my knowledge as much as I can while my colleagues suffer with endless tasks. Don’t know if I should be happy or not. If my next company expect me to write pure SQL, I am done. I also have really really hard time what others has written before me, because I don’t have experience writing anything. Made a few dashboards luckily. That was my experience.

Didn't ask a single question, no comments or suggestions. Meeting ends, we all go out for lunch and invite him, he says \"go ahead, there's some personal stuff I need to take care off during the lunch break, see you soon\". The guy never came back. We were all shocked, \"maybe it's something I said?\", \"did he think our architecture was so bad he didn't want to work here anymore?\", etc. I was a little suspicious because in the quick small talk we had he didn't seemed like he was a very experienced programmer, so I asked my boss to send me his GitHub profile. There were dozens, maybe hundreds of repos there. I started to click in each one and... It was all just repos forked from various open source projects with ZERO changes from the guy. So he just basically just forked a bunch of random repos to impress some clueless recruiter and it fucking worked. The guy was a hack, probably didn't understand a word of what we said in that meeting, panicked and never came back.",

That's just reality, but it doesn't mean you need to feel stuck or like you're not doing enough. 10 GB, while not considered \"big\" data in the era of FAANG, can still be really incredibly valuable to the company, and that's where your value lies. Doesn't matter if its 10 kB of data, if that's the most important piece of data to the company, and you are responsible for maintaining it, then you have a vital role. \n\nIn my experience, I've tried to get really good and efficient in the domains that I am responsible for and always find ways to improve there. I ask questions like: Can I automate this a little more? Can I add some fault handling or error handling? Can I set this up to be triggered to run instead of running on a schedule? By solving some of these questions, you allow yourself to quantify your impact to the business, which goes a long way in showcasing your skills and upgrading to a new role.\n\nI wouldn't worry too much about a particular tech or skill you don't have, because you can always try to pick them up on a personal project or training, and there's always a possibility in the future for a use case, especially if your are looking for one. The way I see it, you're already experienced in Azure, a big cloud platform. Don't sell yourself short, you might be able to make a nice lateral move to work on bigger projects.\n\nSide note, I used to work in manufacturing as well, and I sort of miss it. I realize now that I enjoyed SPC (statistical process control) and I've been working to implement that level of quality control in how we monitor data pipelines.",

Why don't my managers recognise how great I am?\" In women forums particularly (I can't speak to how men feel about it), this will usually dovetail into a lot of self-doubt around how much value you're actually bringing.  \nThe key to being promoted anywhere is knowing how to talk to the next levels up in a way they can relate to and feel reassured by. And particularly when dealing with non-technical leaders, they don't want to be bogged down by a lot of technical detail, it's scary and confusing to them. You think you're showing them your great technical acumen but you're just convincing them they would rather work with the other guy. He may be dumb but they don't realise that, they just know he speaks their language.  \nMy lifelong frustration with tech in a nutshell, but too late to change fields now!  \nETA your post has some solid advice OP, even if it has me grinding my teeth.

More often than not, we get so caught up under the hubris of achieving technical excellence that we forget who it's being developed for. \n\nMy only thought was that it maybe slightly oversimplifies why some engineers get overlooked. The \"myth\" of focusing only on technical excellence felt a bit like a strawman – most engineers I know realize communication matters, even if they don't prioritize it enough. And promotions often involve more complex factors than just technical skill vs. relationships (like scope, leadership potential, strategic impact).\n\nBut overall, a valuable perspective on needing more than just coding chops.

Like if chunk sizes or page limits silently break loads, the system should detect and recover dynamically without needing manual retries.  \n  \nWould love to hear more about your approach, are you monitoring error codes directly or using some kind of predictive guardrails? You can DM me too!!",

That's why I was thinking of **starting small**, with \"localized feedback loops\" (e.g., just chunk sizing or retry policies first) instead of trying to self-optimize everything globally.\n\nAlso, love the reference to SQL Server's Intelligent Query Processing,  hadn't thought of drawing that parallel before. Now that you mention it, adapting those \"micro-optimizations\" ideas into ETL runtime behavior makes a lot of sense.\n\nWould love to brainstorm further, especially how to better \"normalize\" feedback signals over time despite different ingestion profiles. Maybe a lightweight baseline sampling strategy?\n\nThanks again — this really made me think deeper about the implementation side!",

Trying to put everything at once will take you a long time and you won’t be able to validate your progress and maybe you’ll stop in the middle because it was too long and you don’t see the project ending anytime soon.\n\nFirst focus on ingestion.\nThis will guide you collect data from a source and store it.\n\nYou can try a couple different sources here like REST api, web sockets, MQTT topics, GraphQL API, just here you can have some fun.\n\nDo things simple, use simple python and once it’s working THEN try to improve if you want ti make it faster or what ever.\n\nThen focus on transformation \nLoad the data from S3 to Snowflake. It doesn’t have to be automated. Ingest enough to have a couple of hour/days worth of data for your need and load that at once into snowflake.\n\nNow configure your first DBT project and make sure you are able to connect to snowflake using DBT debug command.\n\nThen clean and transform your raw data to something meaningful.\n\nNote that before you start the ingestion step you should know what’s the first thing you want to achieve. If you don’t this won’t work. Find something you want to know then find the data source for it, not the other way around. It’s always more fun to do something which have some value for you. \n\nThen work on testing you ingesting code and you transformation. Might be boring, but it’s a needed skill.\n\n\nThen focus on automation. Configure your airflow module and orchestrate  you ingestion module on a schedule with your DBT transformation from a trigger when the ingestion for a specific partition is done.\n\nThen you can start looking into streaming.\nConfigure your infrastructure (Kafka, or red pandas or what ever you want)\n\nThen modify your ingestion module so it send events instead of full set of data. For example if you were collecting all weather records from all country well don’t wait for the complete process to be finished, yield events as you consume them to your Kafka stream.\n\nThen configure your ingestion engine spark/flink/quix/bytewax and run some transformation on real time data.\n\nThen try to configure some threshold will would alert you in real time if xyz happen, if the temperature increase from x in the last hour.\n\nThen work on building beautiful dashboards.\n\nThen you can try to consolidate all pieces together.\n\nThis is never a small project, and doing everything at once won’t bring you where you want. Do small integration instead. You’ll get completion reward as you go and you will be more willing to continue instead of dropping because the scope is to complex.\n\nCheers and good luck",

Back in 2017 I remember wanting to throw my laptop against the wall just trying to get Spark to run locally lol.\n\nWhat I would recommend is instead of trying to do multiple things in a project, just pick one thing and focus on that. And while PySpark is fine, unless you already feel very comfortable in SQL, I’d suggest devoting more time to it as that is the one language all Data Engineers need to know very well and you can even use it in PySpark. Also you may want to consider DuckDB as it could also just be an easier way to accomplish transforming your data.\n\nWhile NoSQL is definitely useful, it isn’t something I’d suggest anyone just getting started to even consider. Stick with CSV or even better, parquet.\n\nAlso if you do BI, I’d suggest streamlit as it is Python based and they have free hosting to show off your project.\n\nLastly and I know I’m being nit picky, but Scala isn’t dying, it is just the use cases where you need to use it over Python are only at massive scale. I’d steer most new people away from it just because it isn’t as marketable of a skill.\n\nEdit: fixed wording",

Most of the analytic data in the cloud is in 1NF(-ish) style and as such limits what can be done with it without starting over. Most cloud tools have a sweet spot that is in the operational spectrum.\n\nSorry for all the links, but data is a huge subject. It is far bigger than the nuances of any programming language.

Don’t trust AI. If you are not confident in your abilities, don’t even use AI, because it can lead you astray",

If you want to ask the right questions but have no knowledge of syntax, you likely haven’t done a deep enough dive to understand how to ask the right questions of AI. AI, at least as it stands today, is not a replacement. It’s more like a really good assistant, but they can only muster up what you can properly describe… so the results are still limited by a lowest common denominator— You.\n\nI am a firm believer tho, that someday, technical syntax will become highly abstracted away from us as AI tooling becomes more fixated on doing absolutely everything between pre and post conditions. Very likely, we’ll end up with a more friendly language to describe the semantics for end-users, and the syntax used by AI will be at a low enough level as to effectively build what the user requests. Anyways, dreams for the future.. for the next decade or two, honing a strong foundation in how to program/query/architect solutions will be be very beneficial to everything else you do, including using AI tooling its fullest.",

I got my first projects through Upwork and contracting and slowly build up my network overtime. \n\nI can't speak about building out a SaaS but I can tell you that I've been doing pretty well as a freelancer and the non financial reward of doing whatever you want has been the biggest perk of them all.\n\nSo here how freelancing works:  \n\\- Small-Medium business who don't know a freelancer directly will go to Upwork. Yes it might be crowded but it's not as bad as many people say it is. I'm not saying this as Upwork is the best place but 90% of people don't have a strategy and endurance to figure out how the platform works. I actually landed Unilever as a client and did 3 projects with them through the platform as a data analyst.\n\n\\- Large / corporates hire freelancers through recruiting firms. That's called contracting. Those project usually last 3-18 months and are almost always full-time. They are great to get started as a freelancer as they pay very well but you will depend on just one client.  \n  \nI have a community of data freelancers so I can testify that yes it's a viable career path. \n\nEnough talk. Ask me anything and I try to be transparent.\n\nThis is me talking about the topic on a podcast: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S93V8RgwBig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S93V8RgwBig)",

You need to create bullet points that show numbers, that show completed things as much as possible. Your resume is meant to give the company looking to hire you an idea of what their employees can look like if they hire you, or how you can make their team better. \n\nThis means that you need to tailor your cover letter and resume to the job you are applying for every single time.

In case 1 (copy on write) all the parquet files containing the deleted rows are rewritten in a new file to omit those rows,  and then the metadata json files are updated to point at the new parquet files. In the second case (merge on read), a special metadata file called a deletion vector is written that identifies which rows in which parquet files to ignore on read. For performance, every so often you do the steps of the first method and produce rewritten compacted parquet files. Stale parquet files that are no longer referenced by any current metadata files can be deleted via an operation called \"Vacuuming\".most of this happens automatically with the \"DELETE...\" or \"VACUUM\" Spark SQL operations.",

Its quite a bit different than a traditional DW only data estate.\n\nIn Delta lake as another commenter said, new parquet files are written and for a time the old ones remain for time travel. In a parquet table, the files are directly replaced (no time travel). This is handled for you based on the type of write operation you choose (overwrite, merge). Appends of course happen with no data deletion. \n\nFile organization is abstracted as well. Each table has a directory based on its name (or a location you assign). This is why hierarchical namespace (in azure terms) is required over the storage account. If you determine there is a need to partition the data on some column, in which case a directory structure is created for you, with files generated in those directories containing only the data matching a column value to directory partition.",

You mentioned GCP, but I wouldn’t rule out AWS or Azure. In fact, I would look to see if there are any companies trying to migrate from on-prem Oracle stacks to cloud based ones and see which cloud provider they tend to go for (I would guess Azure but that’s just a guess) and then get a cert in that. That way you can leverage your old and new skills together. \n\nGood luck.",

Another popular option is [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) (open-source), which brings ACID transactions to your data lake while maintaining compatibility with Spark processing.\n\nFor enriching and connecting your data sources within this pipeline, [Windsor.ai](http://Windsor.ai) offers specialized integration capabilities. It helps consolidate disparate data channels into a unified view, making it valuable for the monitoring and reporting aspects you mentioned in your requirements.\n\nGiven your internship context, start small with a proof of concept pipeline using these tools before scaling.

This is mostly for Material Master Data, Procurement Info Records and Business Partners or other Master Data. The tool also includes automated flows to check and update data and ensure compliance. SAP MDG pushes these entries to the ERP System.\n\nFor Passive Data Governance (data cleansing) we extract SAP ERP, CRM, EWM Data via \"SAP Data Services\" (classic RFC connection) and bring it into \"SAP information Steward\". Within this tool you can create Data Quality Rules with an SAP Script (kind of SQL like). Then we automatically distribute these generated cleansing files to the required business owners according to the scheduler.\n\nOn Top of that we have a PowerBI monitoring the progress of data quality for these data quality rules.\n\nAs you see we are rather SAP heavy. On one hand it's SAP which sometimes can be \"special\" on the other hand the integration works well.",

This clickhouse cluster is hosted on-premise, and the disks of the server are very slow. So we decided to go for a full backup/replication solution on a new cluster.

Languages are tools, concepts translate between them. If you master one, then you'll stand out vs. others who mastered none, and you'll pick up any language required of you on the job in weeks.\n- DSA classes & Leetcode. Most important part of CS due to how interviews are structured. Do 250 most common LC problems and focus on easy/medium unless targetting FAANG for first job.\n- Build practical projects. Initially start simple, like that easy react page you created. You learn by doing 10x faster than tutorial hell. You need to learn how to structure your own projects and build something from A to Z, from having an idea to breaking it down in small parts and building it out (without guidance provided in tutorials).\n- Project structure for bigger applications, everything has its own place and the quicker you start modulating projects the way they do in production the faster you'll grow.\n- Find a specialization and focus on it. Try simple projects: react frontend page you did, then try building a backend API with CRUD, try building a simple ETL pipeline for data, then try a simple github CI/CD with github actions and dockerize one of the apps. Nothing complex. Cover basics of each, build them in a few days, and then ask yourself: which one seems most interesting to you, which one seems like something you'd like to pursue?\n\nSpecialization matters heavily. Everyone spreads themselves thin, and if your goal is to achieve what CS grads do in 4 years, you should pick something early on and master one area. Become employable in it asap, enter the field and learn rest on the job.\n\nI went for full-stack Python+TypeScript React. Docker & Github Actions. Learning Next.js and Kubernetes now.",

        "body": "I've won hackathons before. Best tip is to practice with an existing team, as a team, and do mock hackathons.  \n\nIf you know react, and what packages to download, you can build something in less than 12 hours.  \n\nFirst 4 hours might be planning and reading the docs, 4 hours of sleep, 4 hours to clean up and submit. 12 hours of productive coding.  \n\nWe can break down the 12 hours even further if you want, but assume also each team member knows what they are doing and we can do it in parallel.  \n\nInitialize the git repo, frontend, backend and database on local host with a decided framework. Database can be hosted on the cloud. Frontend is probably react, or vue, with tailwind css or bootstrap as the UI framework or use another one with copy and paste components. Backend can be flask or django, or if you want, ignore backend completely and just connect frontend to the database directly. (don't do this with real production code). (takes around 1-2 hours)  \n  \nYour team of four starts splitting up work. One or two guys start working on frontend with the UI framework. One guy working on util libraries and business logic as well as api and webhooks. Another guy working on the database. You may have a floater or a guy that finished early to do merges and resolving merge conflicts. (3-6 hours)\nWorking in parallel will require constantly preplanning what tasks are important that have a lot of other tasks dependent on it and which tasks have a lot of dependencies itself. (but at this point you should be polishing up) (3-6 hours)  \n  \nCloud hosting is quick and easy nowadays, should only take 1-2 hours. It might take a while to figure out the dockerfile and which cloud hosting platform will help the most.\nIf you know what you are doing, and use existing open source frameworks and solutions, you can cut down the time spent writing boilerplate code and just focus on connecting API calls and endpoints.  \n\n----\n# Just a few tips\n  \n1. Already find your team of four and practice with them before the competition. Treat it like a war game if you want. Go into what if scenarios and try and build real projects together.  \n  \n2. Look into the hackathons previous winners and losers from previous hackathons. Try and figure out how the judges pick the winners.  \nDo the judges really care about ML technologies? or do they just care about fancy UI? Some judges care about how many microservices you used and/or how big your techstack us. Do a lot of preplanning to figure out what the judges like.  \n  \n3. As the competition gets near, usually company names start appearing, judges names start appearing, as well as the challenge names. Do a lot of research on the companies and judges.  \n  \nIf you wanna score points from a company, look into what API libraries they might want you to use. If you want to score points with a judges, and they are industry or professor, do a challenge that they can relate to.  \n  \n4. Never rebuild the wheel. Use other people's code. Use open source frameworks and code from github.\nNo hackathon winner will ever build their entire stack. The use frameworks and existing solutions. The only thing they will build themselves are the connections between the frontend and the backend as well as the business logic.  \n  \n5. Add as much techstack and bloat as you can. Host it on a bunch of microservices, use OAuth, host it on the cloud. Add infinite horizontal scaling. Judges for some reason like that, even if it does nothing for your app.  \n  \n6. The app doesn't even have to work. It only needs to seem like it works.\n   \n---\n  \nWinning hackathons is a specific skill, and only some of it is transferable to actual industry. Over representing your app to judges probably isn't something you will do in industry, and hard coding stuff is probably something you won't do.  \n  \nBut the best tip is to just practice and get good at using other people's code.",

Generating code is easy, maintaining and extending it is the hard part.\n\nI got a bachelor of computer science in my earlier 30s, so it's not too late.

In many ways I have been lucky due to my autonomy at work, but the actual coding part is like 10% of the time many cases. \n\nTasks won't be well defined. Communication is extra overall including meetings. You'll work on code made by others that is weird. You'll work with people that might not share your views on coding standards. \n\nMy worry is that you don't know anywhere near what a developer job would encompass and it wouldn't be nowhere near as fun as personal projects. \n\nWhat I would possible do in your case is to extend and improve your current work by automation with code, and not just no-code tools, but actual coding as well. Python would be great for this for example. When you have some real-world coding projects and experience, maybe then you can go further.\n\nI'd hesitate making the jump before you have done a side-gig of coding, or getting to know it much more than what you know now.

People here are saying \"no\" but it's more complicated than that on modern architecture. Yes, they can slow down your loop if the branch predictor guesses wrong, because the CPU pipeline will have to flush its pending work. But branch predictors are pretty good, so unless the if statement is very unpredictable or 50/50, you'll be fine.\n\nedit: As far as optimizing if statements out of loops, sometimes you can split the loop into two loops with separate logic, and that allows you to extract the if statement outside the loop. Alternatively you can look into branchless programming, which usually relies on methods like boolean algebra. But don't go too deep into the world of micro-optimizations, 9/10 times it is a waste of your time unless you have definite specifications that require it.",

In modern ISAs, you typically see cmp and jump instructions bundled in the same one, this would be executed faster than two instructions, but the jump offset addressing is usually smaller.\n\nHow fast are those instructions? Well that would depend on the architecture, but I assume they are done in a cycle easily.\n\nOf course, if you don't need the IF, your program would obviously be faster, because you reduced the need for an extra instruction.\n\nBut in reality, it shouldn't make it that much slower (remember one instruction only), but since IF is used to cover side cases, it'll obviously make your program bigger, how big you may ask? Depends on what the compiler optimizes the if to, it could be a branch with a link, it could be a skip, etc...\n\nIf you're strictly testing loop scenarios, just think to yourself \"every time I run this loop, I am doing an additional instruction\" so if the loop is 8 instructions long, and one of them is the IF instruction, then yeah, it would make it somewhat slower. So yeah, if you're doing a loop that loops 1 billion times, and you tracked the  time it took, you could probably see a noticeable difference.",

        "body": "Here's a breakdown of some good learning resources:\n\nFrontend:\n\n\\-Scrimba's frontend career path is endorsed by MDN and has a unique teaching style. Not overly comprehensive and could be great paired alongside Frontend Mentor for projects.\n\n\\-Frontend Mentor is great for practice projects.\n\n\\-The Odin Project is probably the most comprehensive resource for frontend online but its not for everyone. There is tons of reading and it takes much, much longer to complete than other souces. However, its up to date and really enforces the fundamentals. Might be best to choose another resource if your focus is backend though since this goes deeper into frontend than you'd probably need to know.\n\n\\-FreeCodeCamp launched a new curriculum recently. I haven't tried it but it looks pretty good.\n\nBackend:\n\n\\-Boot.dev is a newer resource that teaches backend fundamentals in a \"gameified\" learning experience where you earn XP from completing problems. Probably one of (if not the) best resource for learning general backend skills, my only gripe is their focus on Go. Go isn't as in demand as some other backend langauges, but they are launching a Typescript path soon for those who don't want to learn Go.\n\n\\-Hyperskill is a lesser known resource where you get lots of hands-on practice. I used this website to learn Java and I can't recommend it enough. The projects are great and after every lesson you are given plenty of practice problems. The only downside is that its a little unclear when you should start on projects and some of the practice problems pull from content you haven't learned yet but other than that its a great platform that has integration with Jetbrains IDEs.\n\n\\-The Odin Project also covers Node.js if you're interested in that. They also have a Ruby on Rails path but I wouldn't recommend it.\n\n\\-Since you mentioned C#, I've heard good things about [https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/) although I haven't tried it myslef. Also Microsoft recently launched a full stack developer course on Coursera using C# for backend.\n\nWhether you want to learn frontend or backend first is really up to you, just make sure you apply your skills once you learn them with practice projects. The platforms I listed here are all really good about making you practice the skills you've learned. That's why I didn't recommend Udemy courses, because while there are some instructors that do a good job teaching, projects usually involve you just watching them code and copying what they do. I could see using Udemy for frontend paired with Frontend Mentor though, Colt Steele and Jonas Schmedtmann are probably your best bet for that. Also, I would avoid the full stack developer bootcamps on Udemy, since they are often just surface-level knowledge. Lastly, if you ever plan on getting a CS degree I would go with WGU. Very affordable university that lets you go at your own pace. You can proabably get it done in 2-3 years depending on how much time you have (I'm on track to finish in about 3 years, although I've kinda been slacking). Hope this helps!",

Many companies hiring these days (including the one I work for), won’t even look at you without an engineering degree. \n\nWe can debate the merits of that approach all day, but it’s the cold hard truth in 2025. The market is saturated with self-taught and boot camp coders who can do “react” or whatever the latest trendy framework is. What gets you a job is a degree, a good GPA, and a deep understanding of how computers and memory actually work. \n\nAnd before anyone asks if they’re “too old” to go back to school, I went back for my BS in software engineering when I was 34.",

You can learn these but companies tend to like degrees for AI jobs. Your best bet falls in Webdev and maybe cyber. Cyber you can get in to on your own by doing online courses and certifications but this is less programming and more just security information. \n\nPython is generally recommended for beginners. \n\nI would look at JS especially the fancy frameworks like next and react and some new one that came out that probably came out as I am typing this. \n\nIf you want low level stuff I think rust is pretty cool. Its easier to learn than c and cpp but has less community support in comparison however there does seem to be good resources to learn.",

The university may place them on probation but usually does not kick them out for this. If you left voluntarily, that usually doesn’t prohibit you from coming back. If not, did you have a conversation with a department dean or something first? You will not be the first person with this story they’ve spoken to this month. Start there. They can do things like send you to repeat specific transfer credits that you clearly don’t know, recommend departmental tutoring programs, suggest you take a technical writing or presentation course offered by an English department for engineering students, refer you to student mental health services, etc. \n\nStick with this.

If there are a lot, then you're learning the right language.  \n\nIf there aren't, then it's not entirely useless. Learning any language will teach you some coding principles and practices. This is good, because the ideas are transferrable to other languages. And if you're in school learning computer programming as a concept, you may as well learn them in the language it's being taught in. But bear in mind you'll have to learn the more popular language, like Python, when you've graduated.   \n\nSo let's assume you're learning the wrong language. For instance, maybe the employers in your town all use Python instead. How do you get ahead? My suggestion is to find out what is the most popular language used by the industry in your town, and then start a club on campus where you *teach* it. To be able to teach it, go to [Software-Carpentry.org](http://Software-Carpentry.org) . They have courses that are ready to teach in a variety of popular languages, it's just a matter of learning how to teach the curriculum, and doing the work to practice teaching it. Luckily, they also have self-paced courses that teach you how to teach. And by teaching, you learn.  \n\nOnce you've graduated, saying that you TAUGHT a popular language at a university club will make you stand out.",

Nonetheless you can learn programming basics with it, very well, and use the knowledge for other languages later on. You just need to learn to adapt to a new syntax/library functions.\n\nKnowledge of Assembly is good! It will teach you how computers work internally, and what high-level languages work with. Knowing it, you will be able to write more efficient and realistic code. But it is only seldom used nowadays in application programming. It is used in some embedded projects, even when C compilers are way more standard, or platforms running slim interpreters for script languages. It is still useful for some isolated use cases for extreme hand-tuned optimizations, hacking, reverse-engineering etc.\n\nThe Graphic design you describe as making graphics with basic library functions by a basic or assembly header, I understand. Well, it is toddler stuff fpr beginners imho. You can learn programming with it, and collect experience. But later you will have to move on and learn to use more professional solutions for graphics design.\n\nEven if you study these topics in university, I'd recommend you to privately stay busy with more widespread, professional components, i.e. python, java(-script)/typescript, C/C++, ... Another benefit of these languages is, aside possible involvement in way more professional production projects, that you can massively learn from the open source scene using these languages, i.e. on GitHub, and you can get all the tools and docs you need for free from the internet!",

        "body": "I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and used to work as a [backend developer](https://roadmap.sh/backend) for multiple companies including Amazon. For the list of common professions in the Computer Science world, see: \n\nhttps://roadmap.sh/ \n\nI'm going to go through what you wrote one line at a time.\n\n> \"So, I'm in my first year of college and honestly, everything in tech seems super interesting—whether it's web development, AI/ML, DevOps, or cybersecurity. The problem is, I don’t know which one to choose, as I don't know much about them.\"\n\nYou start with the foundations that they all have in common. For example, regardless of whether you are doing full-stack web development in JavaScript, Machine Learning development in Python, DevOps scrips in bash, PowerShell, or Python, or red team cybersecurity penetration testing scripts in Python, you have to know how to code. First, you need to learn programming fundamentals like variables, integers, Strings, booleans, conditions, operators, loops, functions, etc. Then after that, you need to learn Object Oriented Programming (OOP) like classes, class inheritance (subclasses), interfaces, methods vs. functions, etc. At some point you should probably also take a class called \"discrete math\" that covers the math of logic (and, or, not, true, false, etc.). This class (in the University of Michigan course list): \n\nhttps://eecs203.github.io/eecs203.org/ \n\nAlso, for most of those specialties, a Computer Networking class is also useful (note that this is a 400 level class, so students usually take it in their 4th year of undergraduate university studies): \n\nhttps://github.com/mosharaf/eecs489\n\n> \"Everyone says, 'Pick what interests you,' but that’s the thing—I like all of it, and it’s kinda confusing.\"\n\nYou don't have to pick a specialty in Computer Science right away. Look at the list at https://roadmap.sh/ and know you can be in university for years before deciding on a specialty. Sometimes you don't even make a conscious decision, life circumstances and availability end up deciding for you. Like I know one guy who graduated with a Computer Science degree but couldn't get a coding job but did land an on-premise server I.T. job, and then he ended up going that route and eventually managing/supervising a huge number of on-premise servers. Circumstances ended up choosing for him.\n\n> \"How can I try out these different fields for a small amount of time and figure out what I actually enjoy the most?\"\n\nMaybe check out various subreddits, follow them, and eventually send professionals in those subreddits chat requests to ask them about their profession. To help me find subreddits, I start with a Reddit search and then use The Map of Reddit (Google \"Map of Reddit\", it's a website to help you find related or interconnected subreddits). For example, for Machine Learning there is r/MachineLearning and r/LearnMachineLearning , maybe r/DataScience . For experienced developers there is r/ExperiencedDevs . For backend developers there is r/backend . There is also r/fullstack and r/frontend . Then there are subreddits for the individual programming languages like r/java , r/LearnJava , r/Python , r/LearnPython , etc.\n\n> \"I'd really appreciate some simple advice on where to start and how to explore without feeling overwhelmed.\" \n\nStart with the foundations that multiple different professions in the tech industry have in common. For example, backend developers, data science people, data analytics people, data engineers, and software engineering team managers all need to know databases and SQL. Thus, this class, Database Management Systems, should be a class you take at some point: \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1JK6_nmwkouMnU3gtD9AF085hR_LhPKIL1bVPzRAS8MA/mobilebasic?pli=1 \n\nBut yeah, start with establishing a foundation that spans across multiple different professions. Keep your body and mind healthy and sharp, and never stop learning so you can pivot as necessary. Who knows what will be most in demand when you graduate.",

How often the code changes, how solid your requirements are, what your dependencies look like, etc. During development it's a huge boon to already have tests written that you can use to exercise your code path. If not TDD just as an assist to get your debugger to hit while you're sorting out the quirks. If your shipping an SDK or package especially unit tests are important.\n\nI have a personal preference to dislike unit style tests for applications. My experience with them is that you end up with a lot of test cases, that's a lot of code to maintain. Most if it is repeated and exercising the same part of a function dozens of times. I often find unit tests that aren't testing anything at all, but rather validating assumptions of the language or platform, which is completely inappropriate and a waste of time. I've read plenty of great unit tests too, I've just grown exhausted pruning and curating them.\n\nWhat people don't often account for is that tests aren't just expensive to write, but they can be expensive to maintain too. Because of this, I prefer a smaller curated set of tests that cover larger scenarios than a 'code unit'. Not integration tests, but something that exercises the actual intent of the application as thoroughly as possible while not requiring real dependencies to be set up. Then I use a comprehensive monitoring solution to detect when edge cases occur in our production environment.\n\nEverything is a trade off. What I think gets missed in discussions about QA is how a poor ROI on one QA solution can eat time that would otherwise be spent on a different one.",

It looks 3d, but it uses clever tricks and is really not.\n\nThis repository has code for one [https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/DOOM-style-Game](https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/DOOM-style-Game) .\n\nThat said, this is an order of magnitude more complex so google Doom in Python and do a good amount of reading. \n\nIf you make it through both of those projects you will be ready to start looking at real 3d games. Keep in mind while you can do 3D in Python, it will be slow. 3D games use some form of C. or a related compiled language. Full on game development environments like Unreal Engine have optimized libraries and allow you to create at a very high level and then build the game executable. \n\nGame development is a long road. Good luck!",

Also consider your definition of a \"project\".\n\nA project does not have to be large. And if you do have a larger project in mind, you can probably break it down into smaller ones. When I was writing file parsers as part of an automated test tool (it took in a file describing expected values and various data recording files), I studied parsing techniques. I wrote a variety of one-off programs that parsed the various input file formats and then turned them into libraries that could be used by the actual target program. Each one of these took me 1-5 days (some formats were simple, others were not, by the end I was able to reuse code as well for similar formats), then I integrated them into my main program and glued it all together and had a beta version for my colleagues.\n\nWhat I didn't do was try to implement all the parsers all at once (context switching between each task) or only write them as part of the main program with no way to evaluate my partially working system. By setting them up as these one-offs I was able to stay focused, generate some tests, and figure out if I really was parsing the data correctly (mostly taking the parsed data and regenerating the original files and comparing the two).\n\nIf you have multiple projects that you want to complete, set deadlines. Decide that \"By 15 May I want project X to have features A, B, and C.\" Then do it. If there's no external driver of priority (no work or school objective, all personal) you declare your priorities. Otherwise everything is the same priority and no progress is ever made. Even for work I do this. If I have a 12-month project with no one deciding which features needed to be done by a particular date, I just set them myself. If the customer/user didn't like my ordering I'd ask for their priorities and if they still didn't give them (or everything was #1) then I stuck to my plan. Having deadlines and desired partial states for the project work very well to keep things moving along.",

General programming in JavaScript and modular JavaScript ! \n\nI think the above point pretty much covers frontend development ! \n\nOf course as you progress and become better you might reinterpret HTML with JSX or pug. You might go for SCSS, Tailwind instead of plain CSS. You might move to React, Vue or Angular instead of plain JavaScript ! You might start incorporating TypeScript into JavaScript ! \nYou might start bundling your frontend with Webpack or Vite so that issues like cross browser compatibility, code minimizing, treeshaking, etc is automated ! Or you might take up a backend language and database query so you a build the whole web not just the front end, because why not !? \n\nHowever the start is HTML, CSS and JS ! And the amount of time it takes depends on how long it takes you to grasp each of them ! \n\nAlso you may not want to wait until you’re fully knowledgeable but start doing internships or building personal projects as you learn more everyday !",

In addition, since your specifically interested in web development, I'd recommend the Odin project. It has a lot of front end stuff, and it is really well made I think (also free). The two of those combined should really set you up for both backend and frontend development. Some other great resources are freeCodeCamp, Coursera, and edX. Coursera and edX have some free courses, I think Harvard's CS50 is often the go to recommend for a first course in coding on here. freeCodeCamp is just awesome in my opinion.

Then you'll learn the most necessary parts of basic web development using HTML, CSS, JS. Then, backend systems, and then, you'll learn about frontend JS frameworks. Finally, you'll build a real project, an application that you would use. That's just the practical stuff, though. There are plenty of lessons that go into CS concepts like OOP, Data Structure & Algorithms, etc.  \n  \nOn top of that, you'll learn how to build a network. Going into 3 more years of college with that skill and you will definitely have a job before you graduate. \n\nOh, and your classmates who are getting paid for their side projects? Well, part of the program is to get your own client, make a little money, and beef up your resume.\n\nI started 100devs December 2021 with basically no coding knowledge and had a job by September 2022 with no CS degree; I'm employed today and the skills I learned there have kept me well above that pack of other folks with the same YOE and degrees. It is more of a Job program than a bootcamp, but the way the coding is taught is really easily digestible. Technically, the program is like 7-9 months, but I finished(including the big project) in about 5, and that was with a job and other adult responsibilities; I imagine a summer would be enough time to get through it if you don't have much else going on. I tried to stick to the two classes a week schedule like when they did it live, but it didn't take long before I was watching at 2x and skipping big portions of the videos, so accelerating is definitely possible.\n\nLots of people say \"Build stuff\", \"Do projects\", etc.; I think that's definitely something you should do, but it isn't super helpful for someone in your position. You'll build lots of things with the technologies that you're learning doing 100devs.\n\nBest of luck!",

Unless your goal is to research new algorithms, then those are indeed all of the steps - and yet there's an enormous amount of nuance and complexity hidden there.\n\n1. Bring in the data - this part is easy if someone else has already done the hard work of collecting the data, but in many real-world scenarios the data hasn't been collected yet, so this might involve building apps, sites, custom tools, scrapers, whatever is necessary to collect the data for your particular application.\n\n2. Clean and prepare - this can be quite subtle and nuanced. If you accidentally bring in any features that are biased or correlated with the class you're trying to predict, your model will overfit and you might not realize it until months later when it fails to work in production.\n\n3. Call the class of algorithm and fit - this seems easy when all of your data fits in RAM, but once you start trying to train on hundreds of terabytes worth of data, this is no longer simple. Also, when you have to wait days to train instead of minutes or hours, it becomes far more important to figure out how to validate your approach on smaller subsets first before trying to train on everything.\n\n4. Predict - in most real-world scenarios you're not just calling predict once, you're trying to take that model and embed it into an app so that it can do real-time predictions. This means figuring out how to take a lot of the cleaning and preparing steps from training and recreating them in some other environment, plus dealing with all sorts of other error cases.",

Or you could spend time learning javascript/typescript properly instead of relying on a framework, which will prime you for backend or full stack development if you want to go that direction.",

Spending a whole year faffing about with HTML and CSS is not going to work. This is a challenging field to find work in with a lot of competition. So to make it here you're going to need to shift your expectations, and really commit to learning properly and at pace.\n\nIt can be done. But it's not going to work if your learning is spending the occasional hour doing a Udemy course.\n\nTo be clear, I am not trying to discourage you. I am trying to align your expectations to be more realistic so you have a better chance of success if you're actually serious about this being more than a fun hobby.\n\nThe level you are at now (know the basics of HTML and CSS, and a little bit of interaction from JS) is where I would expect someone to be after a few weeks. Not a year. You are nowhere near being ready for work. So have a serious think about if you want to do this, and if you do commit and set yourself up for success.\n\nFor a junior role you will need: \n\n\\- A solid understanding of TypeScript\n\n\\- A solid understanding of some front end frameworks / libraries (React & MUI/Mantine/Shad-CN)\n\n\\- A solid understanding of some backend framework (Express/Hono/etc)\n\n\\- A solid understanding of testing\n\n\\- A solid understanding of databases and ORMs\n\n\\- A solid understanding of surrounding tech such as GitHub & Actions etc.\n\n  \nNobody, in 2025, is building websites with basic HTML and CSS. That is how we did it back in 1999. And commercial work is going to require that you have the skills and understanding necessary to work in a modern way. \n\nThe bar to entry is high. That's why the pay is also good.\n\nYou can do this. But understand that you are currently on step one of a one-hundred step journey.",

To stick with your example, attempting to create your own Carousel module might seem tedious, but it might be great practice nonetheless.

UNDERSTAND\n\n2. Import\n\n3. Adjust\n\nToo many freaking people skip step 1.

It makes the actual changes hard to trace due to all the noise, though I think it may be configured to ignore the formatting changes your repo and admin may not be up to dealing with that.\n\nMy advice is to have the conversation... tell them you want to apply THIS style (pick a standard one you like) to the code as you are working, and that you will do TWO check ins -- the first one will be format fixing the files you are working with, and the second one the changes to the code.   See if they are open to this sort of thing... a blanket \"THIS UPDATE ONLY CHANGES CODE FORMATTING\" on the check-in merge should prevent anyone from needing to look at that entire commit, and your code changes can be evaluated without fuss.  Show them a sample of the code formatted and unformatted, the worst piece you have worked on and can lay to hand, and walk them through why formatting helps you work on it easier.  Let them know that the reformatting is done by a tool in seconds and won't cut into your productivity at all (if possible, demonstrate it).   Make the hard sell, defend it, convince them.",

Looks amazing on a resume if you contribute to open source software as well. \n\nBuild larger more complicated applications and Contribute to open source are my main suggestions.\n\nI’ve noticed a lot of places now really want you to have schooling. Long gone are the days where people truly don’t care if you have a degree or not. Especially in this market as a junior. But not everybody can go get schooling that easily. If you’re one of those people then I suggest taking a couple Google courses and get yourself a google certification. They look amazing on resumes.\n\nCreate yourself a LinkedIn page and start networking! There is literally nothing more important than networking in this market. Goto hackathons, tech events in your area, post on linkedin and talk with recruiters etc… \n\nHave all your code public on github.\n\nAnd if you’re serious about perusing a job in this market as a junior make sure you can code without AI and code with AI (not vibe coding but using it as a tool to speed up your development)",

Once you learned TypeScript, you also get used to have a lot of guardrails, and there's no reason to go back to coding without those guardrails as you'll encounter issues at runtime (in the browser console) that will require you to debug more lines of code. \n\nIt's not a shortcoming for JS, because for a senior JS developer it's part of the job to keep a tight ship, code linearity and easily readable unit tests (see examples of Express in JS), but for someone learning: choose TypeScript as long as it is an option (almost always is nowadays).\n\nI even believe that frontend needs TS more than backend, because it's harder to structure frontend for code linearity when you have more important hierarchies such as layouts, components, events, async effects, the DOM... The logic is being called from potentially many different places and it's harder to enforce type consistency everywhere \"by hand\".",

Salary is great, lifestyle is balanced, and you learn a lot. But boy oh boy, you have to dumb a lot of the stuff you learn.

Thankfully with DevOps, it's less coding atm so I can spend some time coding on the side outside work. I do mostly terraform with AWS atm, and use other tools like Docker, K8s, etc. You learn a lot on the job, and I mean A LOT. Thankfully, I have a very very good team who is about developing engineers. I won't be a CTO in my lifetime but idc, I'm an engineer and I want to solve stuff. \n\nI would say do not do a bootcamp, you learn web dev mostly, you skip out on important stuff like BigO, DSA etc. plus, don't enjoy web Dev as much anyways\n\nDo self taught mostly, I used to research what modules get taught at university for CS degrees, and focus on those modules for a while.

Two weeks ago I got two offers and and accepted one as a Software Engineer without any professional experience. Here's the route I took:\n\n2 year technical college. This got me exposure to more programming concepts, experience working on a small team, and a small portfolio of a wide range of applications to pad out my resume without costing a fortune. The applications I ended up with werent fancy, but I put more work into them than I needed to and really tried to experiment where it was allowed.\n\nAfter graduating I started working on personal projects in my free time. I set up a homelab server to learn more about networking and security, and made some small applications that made my life easier both at home and at work. A few of my software solutions got adopted by my company for widespread use. I had fun doing these, but more importantly I was able to replace a lot of the academic work on my resume with these, and it gave me talking points when doing interviews.\n\nI'm not sure if I've just been lucky or not, but I haven't had to do any leetcode in any of my interviews. They have been way more interested in talking about the solutions I made, and the impact they've had. I spent a lot more time practicing talking points, terminology, and having a professional conversation because I'm bad at interviews. In the end I believe this helped set me apart, and I highly recommend spending some time explaining parts of your projects to someone (or even just to an AI).\n\nWhen you do start applying places, spend some time customizing each application for the job  You'd be surprised how many people don't. Also, it helps to format any examples you give in STAR format. Some say it's outdated, but it helps keep things consice while effectively conveying impact.\n\nThe market sucks, but some things don't change. The jobs are still out there, and the people that put in the extra work still stand out. Don't be in a rush, make sure the jobs you interview for are a good fit for you. Hopefully something in here helps you on your journey. Good luck!",

How did you make up for the lack of formal education? \nNowadays everyone says, especially recruiters “if we don’t see a degree we automatically trash your CV” and that’s so dumb imho bc I know some programmers that might be rare gems but who are HUGE and could eat up any graduate out there.\nSo I’m kinda scared of this way because maybe even though I work super hard and become super skilled, I will never compare to someone else who has the degree.",

A lot of programmers still neckbeard their way through epic Jedi v. Sith, Star Wars v.

I’m sorry OP..I will echo one of the responders you might be better off seeking some vocational training at a community college over trying to mess with bootcamps…there’s less stigma during hiring with AS Degrees.\n\nJust know without a full blown CS degree the going will be tough and we are currently in the most junior unfriendly hiring market I have ever seen in my 11 years of working in this field. Literally no one is looking for junior devs right now and it’s sad…because there is in fact a shortage of GOOD senior level and mid level devs and engineers BUT in order to get fresh talent we have to train the new incoming juniors…no one wants to do that right now though.",

Don't ever think you will know everything about a language either. It is constantly changing and it is quite vast. \n\nYou also don't need to be a full on python wizard to get into AI. Learn a few basic ideas about AI concepts like models, tokenization, how AI reasons and plug them into what you are learning from Python. Remember that much of the AI landscape is built with the idea that it will work with Python and all you lack right now is the practice to merge the two. Find a free online course for AI for beginners and make sure it is paired up with some project work using Python and you will be well on your way.",

I'm basically making pocket change until then. Maybe there's another way around it? But I'm not sure. I'm certainly open to ideas.\n\nAlso I am curious about examples of what you would put in these github portfolios and how much you would want to have in it before you start looking for work.

Makes total sense.\n\nThe reason I was initially (maybe overly) dismissive of QA, is that I've rarely seen people transition from QA to Dev. Not to say it doesn't happen.\n\nThat said, I've thought about this through the week, and warmed up to the idea somewhat. It does get you into the daily flow of a dev shop, and if you're a likeable social person, it can be a potential route to becoming a dev.\n\nFor your github projects, quality over quantity. 3 meaningful polished projects is better than a dozen shallow ones.\n\nI.e. for the junior python role meaningful could be:  \n\\- a command line tool (like a PDF merger or text cleaner)  \n\\- a simple web app or backend API  \n\\- a data analysis jupyter notebook (with graphs, data cleanups, and a good README)\n\nPersonally I'd start looking at jobs that you'd like to work at, and then asking the AI to suggest good portfolio pieces. Try to find some pieces that'd work for several job advert types that seem common enough and that really interest you.\n\nThat way you're projects are hyper-relevant and will help you stand out.\n\nRe: when to start applying, I'd say start as soon as you have those projects, start applying for junior roles when you 2-3 good portfolio pieces\n\n  \nRe: Leetcode, I'd avoid (or at least not take more than casual approach to it) because (a) small companies or startups don't care about it (b) it's becoming less popular in bigger companies (Snapchat recently reported their stopping using it in interviews week)\n\nIt's really not a good representation of coding, at least in my experience, in my 10 years, I've had to look at algorithms a handful of times.  Maybe it's more relevant in certain teams, but not super common overall.\n\nLet me know if you want help brainstorming project ideas based on job ads, or want feedback on anything you’ve already got brewing 👌",

        "body": "I thought I knew the answer, but apparently I was rather off.  Here is Claude's response\n\nI'll explain how physical memory is partitioned into blocks for contiguous memory allocation in operating systems.\n\nIn contiguous memory allocation, physical memory is divided into fixed-size blocks or variable-size partitions that can be allocated to processes. Here's how it works:\n\nPhysical memory is organized into addressable units (typically bytes), and the operating system manages this space by dividing it into partitions or blocks. When processes request memory, the OS allocates these blocks based on specific strategies.\n\nThere are several approaches to partitioning memory:\n\n1. Fixed partitioning: Memory is divided into fixed-size blocks (like your example of 10 MB chunks). Each partition can hold exactly one process, even if the process doesn't need all the allocated space, which can lead to internal fragmentation.\n\n2. Variable partitioning: Memory is allocated exactly as requested by processes, resulting in variable-sized partitions. This reduces internal fragmentation but can lead to external fragmentation as processes terminate and free memory becomes scattered.\n\nFor allocation, the operating system maintains data structures (typically tables) that track:\n- Which blocks are allocated or free\n- The size of each block\n- The process using each allocated block\n\nWhen a process requests memory, the OS uses allocation algorithms such as:\n- First-fit: Allocate the first available block that's large enough\n- Best-fit: Allocate the smallest available block that's large enough\n- Worst-fit: Allocate the largest available block\n\nThe actual implementation involves memory management units (MMUs) that translate logical addresses (used by processes) to physical addresses. These hardware components, along with operating system tables, handle the mapping between a process's address space and physical memory blocks.\n\nModern systems use more sophisticated approaches like paging and segmentation rather than contiguous allocation, as they address many of the fragmentation issues. ",

Yes, examples in video tutorials tend to me very mindless or useless stuff like that. It is something that the book format handles much better. A well designed book will have examples (often they are of the \"useless\" variety but often will be more practical), explanations, and then at the end of each chapter an \"exercises\" part to practice what you learned. And working those \"exercises\" on your own is critical to learning something like this.\n\nIn this respect it's kind of like maths -- yes, you can ask your symbolic calculator to solve integrals for you, but unless you actually do the examples yourself using the techniques shown in the chapter, you won't understand how it \"really\" works. You'll just be feeding in answers from your machine (from your symbolic calculator, for example).",

You can learn that later, but you'll need solid basic understanding of coding first. \n\nLibraries exist so that you don't need to rewrite code that already exists. If you're changing the oil in your car, you don't want to make an oil filter by hand, they are an off the rack standard component. Same with coding, things that are used all the time can be made into libraries so you can just get them off the rack and use them, rather than making them by hand. To know if a library exists for what you're looking for, do a search online or ask people experienced with Python or whatever language you're learning (after doing your own search).",

        "body": "If you want to know \"how Docker works\", that can really be broken down into two separate questions:\n\n1. What Linux kernel features do you use, and how do you use them, to get the behaviors that we call \"containerization\"?\n2. How is the Docker software organized and architected to use those features?\n\nI think question 1 is the more relevant one for what you're asking. [Part 8 of this presentation](https://container.training/intro-selfpaced.yml.html) (the \"Deep dive into container internals\" section) is the best self-contained overview that I know of. For more details, a good starting point would be to read all of the Linux kernel documentation and manpages about cgroups, namespaces, chroot, etc.\n\nThe short version is: the Unix permission system has always provided some basic ability to \"isolate\" processes from each other, e.g. a process belonging to UID can't kill another process with a different UID. This is just enforced by the kernel doing permission checks on the appropriate syscalls. A more interesting example is the `chroot` syscall, which tells the kernel to change the \"apparent\" root directory for a process, so that it can't see or modify any files outside that root. Containerization is just \"chroot on steroids\" by telling the kernel to isolate process groups in various ways.\n\nBeyond that, the \"sharing\" of the kernel works in pretty much the same way that it does without containerization. When a process asks for memory, or the scheduler decides which process to run in a given time slice, the kernel makes the same kind of decision it always does -- except that it keeps track of some extra accounting information to enforce fairness and resource limits between \"containers\".\n\nQuestion 2 is a bit less technically interesting, but still somewhat important because it's useful to know where to look for the relevant source code if you really want to dig into the implementation. For instance, when you run a \"Docker container\", Docker is delegating the work to containerd, and containerd is invoking runc to actually start the container. So runc is where the actual relevant syscalls are made. You can see an overview of *what* runc is doing [here](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/main/libcontainer/SPEC.md), and you can find more details of how it interacts with the rest of the system by reading the [OCI Runtime Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/v1.2.1/spec.md).",

Team member use that script to initialize their development databases, and when database design changes, you update the SQL script and notify team members that they need to update their databases to match.\n\nIf you have no given requirements for this project, I suppose you can invent your own.

Seriously.\n\nWhy do I recommend this? Because today's billionaire tech bros? The ones everyone is accustomed to trying to get jobs from? They've shown that they will lay you off in a heartbeat, regardless of the work you've done, if they think it will boost their stock by 2%. Screw those guys.\n\nWe need to get back to our hacker roots. Learn to build awesome stuff, and then build it. Don't wait for permission.\n\nIf you keep thinking, \"I'm not ready to build a production app. I don't know how.\" Well, that should tell you a lot about your job readiness. Keep grinding. Build that app. Show the world what you've got. \n\nBTW: I'm a software engineering manager, and the kind of person who goes out and builds something production-ready even though they have no professional experience?  That's \\*exactly\\* the kind of person I'd want on my team.\n\nSo, yeah. Check out the Odin Project. Be sure to do the JavaScript / Python path, though. The Ruby path is somewhat outdated.",

Its perfectly normal for them to stop when they find one such example: you didn't respect their time by vetting your code well, so why would you expect them to do the same for you? 'Ad nauseum' would point to a you problem, not a them problem.\n\nIf they're important, but not critical you can ask them to defer their requested change in a follow-up ticket/PR/MR, whatever is appropriate for your organization. This is a judgement call on how important the issue is and they may disagree with you and how that gets handled is a different issue.\n\nTheres also the notion of Work In Progress \\[WIP\\] reviews that some organizations use. These can circumvent CI systems since they cant/wont/shouldnt be merged and can help get feedback early and often. I always encourage juniors/new hires to do this; its lower stakes and gets ppl up to speed faster, IMHO.\n\nNow, if they're nitpicking \"bugs\" that don't matter or are just otherwise blocking merge on a single style nitpick or somesuch without completing the review thats another story: those can and should be grouped. Similar for minor bugs. If your organization is forcing you to move too quickly to do your due diligence to meet your team's standards, thats a different problem.\n\n\\> Do you speak to colleagues that do reviews this way and try to change their approach?\n\nThis is another organizational problem. More something to mention to a lead/manager/etc than something to confront on an individual level. The team should be relatively aligned on the workflow and top-down is usually going to be a more effective resolution. This is especially true the more junior you are: you may not have these experience to know that its an issue with your work.",

A lot of us have been stuck in that phase — jumping from one tutorial to another, thinking we're making progress, but actually just going in circles.\n\nWhat really helped me break out of that \"tutorial hell\" was setting a clear, simple goal: build a project from start to finish. It doesn’t have to be big or original.the point is to create something on your own. It could be a clone of an existing app, a small personal tool, or even a project inspired by a tutorial, but coded entirely by you.\n\nThe key is active practice. You’ll run into real problems, you’ll have to debug, research, and figure things out. and that’s where true learning happens.\n\nSo pick a project, set a realistic deadline, and try to complete it.

Assembly expects you to be explicit, and it's impossible to IMAGINE all the things that would break if you changed it.\n\nIt's not that - theoretically - assembly couldn't have been written so `var` always explicitly references the pointer and `[var]` always explicitly references the value, but that's not how it played out and it's not how assembly functions under the hood.\n\nThis is pretty common in every language and language-syntax. There's always things that seem like they should work, that don't seem to conflict with anything else, that simply don't work.\n\nFor example, in JS we have what's called \"optional chaining\". We can use optional chaining to access an existing property's value, but we can't use it to assign values to an existing property, nor to create properties w/ assignments (if the property doesn't already exist). Why not? Seems like it'd work.\n\nBut it doesn't, it isn't that simple, and making it work would short-circuit all sorts of other things JS does. However, I do believe there are some JS proposals to add \"optional chaining for assignment\" to the spec. But assembly is way lower-level; it's nearly raw processor instructions. There's no public, ever-changing spec, where proposals are made like with JS.",

There are two important facts they seem to be missing:\n\n- Not accepting \"MOV AX, var\" is a quirk of your assembler.  \"MOV AX, var\" works fine in my preferred assembler, [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/).\n- \"LEA AX, [var]\" is semantically equivalent [1] to \"MOV AX, var\" but they are actually different instructions! [2]\n\nYou can prove LEA and MOV are different by looking at their binary representation (for example if you use a disassembler, or check into your assembler's command-line syntax to discover how to make a listing file).  The bytes for each instruction are:\n\n    8D063412                   LEA AX,[0x1234]\n    B83412                     MOV AX,0x1234\n\nMy personal opinion is that your assembler sucks.  If you're doing this for a class, you probably have to live with the professor's choice of tooling.  For your own projects, I recommend looking into NASM.  (I hear the cool people are using [yasm](https://github.com/yasm/yasm) these days, but I've never used it so I have no personal opinion on it.)\n\nOut of curiosity, what assembler are you using?\n\n[1] By \"semantically equivalent\" I mean they have the same effects on the registers and flags.\n\n[2] The reason LEA exists is to let programmers use indexed addressing modes for calculations instead of memory access.  `LEA AX,[0x1234]` and `LEA AX,[BX]` are functionally equivalent to MOV instructions, but `LEA AX,[BX+DI+0x1234]` does a calculation that can't be accomplished with any other single instruction.\n\nExperimenting with LEA can be maddening if you don't understand it.  That's because 16-bit LEA will only let you use certain register combinations, you can only combine one of {BX, BP} with one of {SI, DI}.  (This was a hardware decision of the chip designers, and applies to all address arguments.)  With 32-bit assembly in the [386](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386), they added a whole extra byte to the encoding of indexed addressing modes (SIB, scale-index-base).  So in 32-bit 386 assembly you can use any registers, and they even added the ability to multiply one of the registers by a constant factor of 2, 4, or 8.  So the 32-bit instruction `LEA EAX,[ECX+4*EDX+0x1234]` is legal, but its 16-bit equivalent `LEA AX,[CX+4*DX+0x1234]` is not.",

Where, when, and how they work is not necessarily up to you. \n\nIf you dictate they next come to your office, at x time, to do y work, they are likely going to be classified as an employee.\n\nIn this case, it sounds like OP is an employee for a company, and his employer has a contract to do work. An employee has to do what the employer requires, or the employer is free to fire them. Writing that a job is remote can trigger some legal protections for how much notice they must give you to change your work location, but any employer can change your work location as long as the proper notice period is given. That depends on the state, but it's usually pretty short anyway.",

Some people will not be able to find work in this field and will transition out. Most will find work and the people at the top won't experience it at all.\n\nThere are a number of factors that make the the next few years look especially bleak. After three decades of demand exceeding supply in tech, the market is caught with a sudden drop in demand at the absolute peak capacity of producing new engineering talent both domestically and globally. This is worse than fields where supply has generally matched demand and production pipelines weren't greatly increasing.\n\nBig tech recently ended their decades long practice of hiring talent to keep it off the market and instead is firing employees (across all functions, not just tech) to boost profits. Downstream, companies are copying this. The trend is to run lean on engineering. Even the most well funded startups are no longer focusing much on users or other growth metrics and are instead looking at ARR/headcount. Today, capital isn't looking for growth without outsized margins. This further reduces forward looking demand.\n\nIts unclear how AI, tariffs and economic instability will affect most jobs in 5 years, not just tech. As a consequence companies are dramatically scaling back capital expenditures and focusing on operations. That's further softening the job market overall. This hits tech harder than other roles because tech jobs lean heavy towards capex.\n\nPeople with 5-10 years of experience are mostly fine. It's just taking a lot more time and effort to find roles. It's an absolutely awful time to be in or just out of college, no matter the career path.\n\nThe days of tech being the easiest path to a high salary and stable career might be over but it's hard to know for sure.\n\nEvery college kid needs to be told that they will enter the workforce in a period of change, uncertainty and instability most people have not experienced and can't even conceive of unless they are from countries like Venezuela, Argentina, Russia (that turned out bad), Brazil South Africa (that turned out mixed), South Korea or China (that turned out mostly good).\n\nIf you want to steer your kid to a career with stability, tell them to be a doctor. The supply of medical schools is artificially constrained. The work requires a license by law. It's a field where coming changes like AI will augment but doesn't look capable of softening demand.",

Usually - especially if you’re the only non Indian - they don’t even realize there’s an issue. I’ve had to do this a couple times in the past and ask them to stick with English and annunciate a bit clearer and they did make a concerted effort which helped a ton. Just be polite and have a tone like a request for help rather than an accusation and you should be ok. \n\nStuff that can be jarring for native English speakers vs Indian English - \n\n- pauses at weird points mid sentence and sometimes multiple times per sentence\n\n- rising tones like asking a question but during a statement or other part of a sentence\n\n- dropped words (your brain will autocomplete the sentence anyway once you get used to whoever you’re working with) \n\n- certain phrases (do the needful being one of the most infamous) and words (definitely, certainly, surely, etc pop up frequently) that you will soon realize are far more vague than they imply. For example the “definitely” does not mean definitely, it can often be said as a “yeah yeah whatever” vibe\n\n- sometimes questions are phrased more like demands, but just know that usually it’s still a request and no offense is intended. It can come off as a bit aggressive though. (Ie “you will do XYZ for me”)(paraphrased a bit). \n\nI dunno maybe others here can add to this list for OP to adapt faster.",

That's a very important part of building up the same familiarity as you have. It's known that tickets are going to take longer when given to me, because I don't have all the context everyone has. What might be a 1 liner to you, could be days of digging through code, running the app locally, and building up the context around the issue before I can finally land on that one line.\n\nIf I'm just handed answers, I'll never be able to develop those skills or that context myself, so I'll never get to your level.\n\nGenerally the way mentorship goes is you should treat it as pair programming, and *guide* them towards the solution. As opposed to giving them answers, or even lecturing / dumping similar solutions on them.\n\nIf the change is as easy as you say, it should be super easy to sit with this dev for an hour and arrive at the solution together. Let them flounder a little and explain their thought process to you, if they get stuck, ask leading questions that nudges them in the right direction. Try to teach them *your process*, as opposed to the answer. The key is you want *them* to solve it, not you. You just want to be their safety net that helps them reach that point.\n\nA simple \"Hey, how's X going? Wanna pair up today and see if I can be any help?\" goes a long way.\n\nSometimes the answer to \"how's it going\" might be \"Oh I already fixed it I think, I was just working on figuring out how to test / add unit tests / open a PR / etc\". Really this is stuff that should be coming out in standup so you can reach out before it's been a full 4 days when you notice they're not making any progress... but it sounds like yall either aren't doing standup or this dev isn't providing accurate updates.\n\nAs others have said this stuff was easier in the office. For whatever reason there's a tougher barrier to break to send someone a DM, as opposed to just casually walking past their cubicle and asking \"How's it going?\".",

Meta is probably also a good one if you want to be doing cutting edge ML work. I don't think you can go wrong with either NVIDIA or Meta.\n\n\nEdit: for more context, a SWE at NVIDIA working on ML is more likely to be inside the guts of a model, figuring out how to optimize its throughput or latency. A MLE at Meta is more likely to be applying ML to solve a business problem. So it depends on which part of the problem you want to work on.",

I would always compare other people's lows to my highs and was always surprised at the end result. That being, they ended up much further than I did at the end no matter how well they did e.g. GPA/knowledgeable they were about coding etc.\n\nIn hindsight, my mentality contributed to two major detriments in my first job search:\n\n1 -- I unknowingly built a moat around myself and classmates who could've been a resource, ended up becoming competition or inaccessible instead. In your story, it sounds like you have plenty of classmates who got into F500 or FAANG, yet it sounds like you never reached out for help or built enough connections to avoid applying 400/600 times per cycle. Assuming you carry the same mindset of reducing a company to traits like “in the middle of nowhere,\" you might fall into the same trap of I did in evaluating everyone in a new environment as beneath you and not building the correct connections, or at least practicing, to get to where you want to go.\n\nOne of my early jobs was in a small private company that I've never heard anyone mention in this sub in a random state in the South. From my time there, I knew a few data scientists and engineers who ended up going to great companies 2-3 years after their tenure to places such as LinkedIn, Meta, Paramount, etc. Had I went in with the same energy as I did in college, I would've never made friends and been able to reach out to them for help when it came to career advice or referrals. Instead of coming in with the expectation of getting something out of every interaction, I just became the person people want to work with -- be there for when they need help or talk about the project or life in general. All the \"small talk\" that you think is a waste of time makes you personable and they'll remember you when time comes.\n\n2 -- That mentality carries over into how you present yourself as a person and affects you in ways you probably didn't notice before. For me, it caused mismatched expectations and actually set me back from learning to my fullest potential. I always told myself that I should've gotten a better offer or shouldn't have struggled for as long as I did due to my capabilities; my worldview was shattered over and over again, once someone I deemed \"dumber\" got a more coveted position or had breezed through their job search. And this mentality doesn't really stop, there's always someone luckier or someone better than you in some way, that got an opportunity that you wanted and it looms in the back of your mind on every task that you do. I don't have much advice here aside from realization; getting hit with reality and coming to terms with having weaknesses in certain areas or unlucky in others actually helped me become open to learning a ton and that honest acceptance of my capabilities and circumstance got me more opportunities and help from others than I had gotten previously.\n\nInadvertently this also helped in interviews and building connections, at least at the entry level as no interviewer or coworker wants to work with a new grad/mid-level with a pompous or fake persona even if they do mostly know their stuff. At the end of the day, we all want is someone human to work with and one of the most human traits you can exhibit in an interview is that you make mistakes, can learn and are competent/graceful enough to pivot with a team to come to a solution.",

It's a skill like anything else you can practice and get good at it.  If you have some friends you can do practice interviews with I highly recommend doing so.  I bombed like a hundred interviews before I got good at it and then things became a lot easier.

And that doesn’t mean side hustles, it means living within your means and saving money for a rainy day.\n\nI got laid off a couple years ago with two months of severance. I had enough cash savings to last another 4 months before I’d have to dip into retirement funds or sell anything. That was more than enough time to get another job offer. I’ve also structured my expenses so they are easy to cut out in times of need. I have a lower mortgage, and only one cheap car payment. If I need money I can cancel my gym membership or whatever.\n\nOther people struggle because they get laid off, and they can’t lower their expenses much. They already cook most meals at home and most of their spending is high rent/mortgage and a high car payment. Most people also just don’t have emergency funds, which in our field is ridiculous. An old coworker of money got laid off recently and got a new job offer, but due to it being slightly less money and him missing one month of pay he had to immediately sell his house. \n\nYou don’t even have to live like a hermit.

I also know *a lot* of people currently at Amazon.\n\nI would absolutely recommend you to join Amazon, but you need to have the appropriate expectations. Expect micromanagement, lots of work hours, toxic co-workers and an extremely high pressure environment.\n\nI can't say I've ever personally met someone who had a good experience at Amazon (but this is my anecdotal experience of about a dozen engineers, so keep that in mind). And yet, every single one who left (or got pipped) does not regret joining Amazon even for a second. The things you can learn, the network you can create, the doors that it can open for you... there are lots of benefits there if you try your hardest.\n\nLike I said, I have 4 years at an insurance company. It's been fantastic from a work life balance perspective. I've made lifelong friends, have a great network, and have really had the opportunity for 4 years of peace. The downside? I haven't learned as much as other folks who joined companies that were a bit higher pressure. So there's pros and cons there.\n\nI'm now at a place where I'm just... bored with my current job. So I'm currently doing the good ol' interview prep and planning on applying to Amazon (among others) as well.\n\nI would really urge you to take the offer. You're young, it won't matter too much if you get laid off. It will open doors for you and (hopefully) you'll be able to learn at a much faster pace than your current gig.\n\nIf you look at Amazon as a stepping stone, and not a future home, you'll be in a much better place psychologically to handle the work environment.\n\nGo for it!!!",

This is a biggie, because it's not uncommon for Amazon to hire people in one location and then tell them to move in 60-90 days or lose their job.\n* What's the ops load like?\n* What is the make-up of their team? How many L4's has your manager promoted? Are there opportunities for growth up to L6?\n* Where is your office? Is it Seattle or Bellevue? What's the rent situation like, and is Seattle somewhere you want to live for years? Transfers are tricky at Amazon since 2022, so you'd be waiting a while for L5 before you can transfer - and even then you'll be up against hundreds of others.\n* Do you want to join in what is essentially a new grad role, or would you prefer to wait and join as a new L5 in a few years? Amazon has started downlevelling people lately, and it really fucks with URA as you have some L4's with years of experience making newer engineers look bad (and eventually up for the chop). The \"hire to fire\" culture is also still there in some teams.\n\nMost importantly, if you choose to join Amazon you should have a contingency plan in place in case you end up in Focus/Pivot. Speak to your current boss and see what their boomerang policy is. If you can bounce back in a year, great! If two, even better! There's little to lose.\n\nAt face value, I would say that joining as an \"experienced\" L4 isn't a great idea, unless you're going to drastically improve your income by joining Amazon. Even then, layoffs are still occurring, and PIP is always looming, so you might not even see that salary. If despite all the warnings you're still sold, absolutely go for it. It *can* be a good place to work if you're really lucky, and you find a team that's both good, does interesting work, and has a manager that's invested in your growth - while also great at fighting your corner to help you stay above the dreaded URA curve.",

Technically, you still qualify as a \"New Grad\".\n\nWhether this is the case or not, hear me out, you should take the Amazon offer, but keep your F500 job for the first month while you figure out if Amazon is the right place for you.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. It is actually difficult to switch teams at Amazon. You will have to do a full loop and they may ask you for meaningful code reviews that you've authored. If you haven't been on the team for long OR if it's too ops heavy OR if there's just not enough scope, then HMs may not be interested in you.\n2. You might be a hire to fire. If you're put on focus, then you can't switch teams.\n3. Your manager/team/org might suck. If your manager isn't keen on your growth, then you won't get the scope to grow to the next level. You may also face issues if your team isn't balanced levels wise (e.g., no L6s or 0-2 L5s -> overworked L4s). EnderMB's comment is golden, esp \"What is the make-up of their team? How many L4's has your manager promoted? Are there opportunities for growth up to L6?\"\n4. You might hate the work your team is doing (esp if you're randomly placed). You could be a frontend wiz, but get placed on a team working on compilers. Or your team might be a KTLO team where all you're doing is ops and bug fixes (zero feature work).\n\nTake PTO or a leave of absence from your F500 job, scope out Amazon, and then make your decision. Best Case: you're a great fit for your role at Amazon and you're happy. Worst Case: you have to leave Amazon and go back to your fully remote job.\n\nFWIW: I worked at Amazon as a new grad SDE I and fell into a team of no L6s, only 1 L5, and rest L4s. I had to put in over \\~70 hrs per week to keep up with expectations. I burned out in 1 year and quit without having anything lined up. Luckily, the market was fire back then so I was able to take a few months off and get a job elsewhere.\n\nAmazon on your resume will open a lot of doors, but tread carefully.",

That was not the case in 01. \nThe difference is that now you have a whole segment of people who got into programming recently because they saw it as an easy way to get a high paying job. I think those people are struggling, because there are lots of them and not so many job openings for them. So there’s kind of dual markets going on, some people are doing better than others. ",

Only about 8% of the global population in 2001 had any access to internet. Now, in 2025 from what I can find 68% of the population has access to the internet. Even with all this uncertainty now, startups are popping up all the time, massive salaries are still being paid. There are more students and comp sci graduates now than there ever was before, making the modern market much more competitive. This is also a global market now, plenty of overseas engineers all vying for the same roles. Offshoring is a big one too. But, still companies are hiring, just not juniors.",

Companies like Tesla today that are very hype driven still bring in billions of dollars of revenue each year. A lot of people genuinely believed the internet was a failed fad, that software was, at best, a boring thing banks used that had no growth potential.\n\nSince then, the industry has grown in size tremendously. In absolute numbers, more people are impacted by layoffs today. But businesses are not folding left and right like back then. The job market is slow. There have been many layoffs, but there are still millions employed in the industry. Pay is still higher relative to other jobs than it was back then. There's certainly no sense that the internet was a fad, or tech is going away entirely.",

Consider the fact that, on Stalin’s birthday, prisoners would send him congratulatory telegrams from the darkest gulags: it isn’t possible to imagine a Jew in Auschwitz sending Hitler such a telegram. \n\n> It is a tasteless distinction, but it supports the contention that under Stalin, the ruling ideology presupposed a space in which the leader and his subjects could meet as servants of Historical Reason. Under Stalin, all people were, theoretically, equal.\n\n...\n\n> But why a master at all? The other way to deal with the decline of traditional authority is the anarchist way, and anarchism is having a revival today, from Noam Chomsky to David Graeber. Anarchism \r\nis not against public power—Catherine Malabou, another neo-anarchist, refers to Jacques Rancière, who asserts “radical equality between citizens who are considered able to both command and \r\nobey.” (Catherine Malabou’s words in: Malabou and Balibar 2022, p. 179) There is an essential relationship between the lot and democratic expression: there is public power, but “true democracy would rely on the contingency of who governs and who is governed because governing does not require any particular skill.” (Ibid.)\n\n...\n\n> Consequently, a paradox I argue for is that false opposition is to be left behind: we do not overcome alienation by disalienation, we do not overcome the master by eliminating it, and we do not overcome public power by limiting it to useful public services.\\\nThe non-alienated autonomous liberal individual is itself a product of alienation in capitalist society; a master effectively serving the people, taking care of them, is a fetish created to prevent the possibility that individuals will themselves take care of themselves; the idea of power serving society justifies power and thus obfuscates its constitutive excess.",

There are exceptions, but knowing your stuff will often get you to a sensible result faster in the scope of the interview. You need to be able to coherently explain and reason about your code, why you're taking one approach instead of another. Using AI in an interview doesn't pair well with this. It also gives me less signal as an interviewer.\n\nAll this to say, when you're ready to start your job search, you should be doubling down on fundamentals, Leetcode and upskilling on things like React/whatever framework you're rusty with. Using AI on the job is one thing, but imo you should be focused on fundamentals and interview prep in the short term.\n\nOnce you have a job, then worry about how you'll use AI to work faster and better.",

All that means is we will work to prioritize, and accurately communicate progress and ***timelines*** (independent of \"deadlines\") spread across 1 persons-worth of work weeks. That's how the exchange of labor works. Don't scale your hours.\n\nManagement has tools in their toolbelt to account for at-risk deadlines. It's literally project management 101, shit interns learn, shit that's like on page 1 of any sort of guide to PM. They can dial back scope, they can hire more resources, or they can push back the deadline.\n\nForcing their resources to work more than 40 hours isn't a (healthy) option. But if the SWE's *let them*, they'd be crazy to not take advantage of it. So don't let them. Work your 40 hours. Communicate everything based on those 40 hours. \"We need it done by X\" doesn't matter, because based on your 40 hour work week your job is to communicate the *realistic* estimate. \"Ok... well if I drop A, B, C, D, E, and F, I can get G done by X\", or \"If we take an MVP approach and get rid of H, I, J,  and K requirements we can get the MVP done by X\".\n\nEverything you're describing is a failure of management, not of you. Deadlines, staffing, prioritization, scope, etc. It's all in *their* job description. Will your management like you establishing and sticking to your professional boundaries?\n\nProbably not. But you know what their options are? Fire you, and set their timeline back by *bare minimum* another 6-12 months across the board (probably more). Does that sound like a smart option? Call their bluff.\n\nPut in your 40, be realistic, be communicative, don't fall victim to \"deadlines\", and if your management ignores your very reasonable professional boundaries, start looking for another job. The market being bad doesn't change any of this.",

If it sounds like I'd vibe with it, I join. If it doesn't, I don't.\n\nUsually WLB/culture changes though, it's basically inevitable.

The \"1-year minimum\" rule is outdated, especially for toxic situations like yours. \n\nStart applying now, but be strategic:\n\n1. Update your LinkedIn and resume to highlight the technical skills and projects you've worked on in these 4 months. Focus on what you've learned and built, not the timeline.\n\n2. Have a straightforward explanation ready for interviews: \"I joined eager to contribute, but the expectation of 70+ hour weeks without compensation adjustment isn't sustainable long-term.\" Most reasonable hiring managers will understand.\n\n3. Target companies known for better work-life balance. Look at Glassdoor reviews and ask direct questions about typical hours during interviews.\n\nThe market is tough but not impossible. You can use a service like Applyre to do a passive job search. Your experience is valid, and you've already proven you can handle extreme pressure (though you shouldn't have to).",

It would be nice for them to recognize that you're performing at the next level and automatically give you a promotion. But at a larger company, there's usually red tape and committees that they'll need to make a case to; if you seem happy at your current level and there's no growth expectation on your team they're happy to not have to put any further work in. This is different from consulting and finance, for example, where you have no input into your own promotion and it's assumed that everyone wants a promotion. \n\nIf there is a growth expectation to the next level,  your performance reviews will start getting dinged if you haven't been promoted in a certain amount of time (even if you're otherwise performing at the next level). Which makes it even more urgent you get a timeline for when it's feasible to be promoted.\n\nIf you get an \"I don't know when you'll be promoted\" without actionable steps or \"just keep doing what you're doing\" without a timeline that's a sign to leave.",

Ex. if you make $80,000 and want to make $100,000 tell them you want to make $100,000 to $160,000 (arbitrary ceiling chosen but give yourself a nice range) rather than you make $80,000. I don't think it's unreasonable to give SOME number, if your number is TOO low then it's possible you should have bolstered your position by understanding the market better (to be fair, sometimes difficult to do).\n\nHowever third-party recruiters don't just have the incentive to match you to multiple companies, they have the incentive to match you ASAP. That means if they're going to companies, they may be getting the cheapest offer just to line you up with a few offers and have you choose (if you are presented with 3 offers ranging from $85k to $95k it may also give the impression that is all companies in your area are willing to pay and cause you to commit early). This isn't always the case, but if you get a lazy recruiter, this is more likely.\n\nIf you give them a target, they will more likely hunt against that target, in which case you're aligning their goals (getting you matched) with your goal (getting you matched at your target) which I think saves everyone some time in the long run (companies for whom you are out of their league won't bother, companies who are willing to pay more may be more inclined to be more competitive).\n\nHope that provides some clarity.\n\nEDIT: I also generally don't like advice to never give a number, I think that's just lazy on the part of the candidate and can be wasteful of the time of the recruiter if they're following leads you would already know are not worth your time. Knowing approximately where you stand saves everyone time and makes you better positioned in the hunt.",

Frontend interviews (not that I've attended many of them) also seem to focus mostly on whether you understand `#selector` or what a particular React or JS construct does, and very little on how to communicate with the backend team on APIs you need.\n\n\nI guess my point is, if you're pure frontend, you're both viewing the world (and being viewed in) a similar light. If you can do some backend, at least, you're much better positioned to talk about how the data gets to the FE. That seems to be called a \"Full stack with FE lean\" in job descriptions these days.\n\n\nThat it pays more IMO reflects this aspect of the full stack role. It's worth being able to work on the backend at least a bit, so my recommendation would to be to get into the FS role. (I won't necessarily call it a \"switch\" because a lot of full stack roles do end up being primarily BE or FE)",

Even so, a masters is just so many hours, it's probably much more than you'd be doing by yourself through some sort of self-paced program.\n\nI did OMSCS, and already had graduate experience in bioinformatics, so I wasn't looking to get involved in research. There were a few benefits to the program: exposing me to a lot of topics that helped me be a better backend engineer, like distributed system and more low level stuff, solidifying my ML knowledge (started the program as a working data scientist), and probably most importantly, giving me the credential so I could apply (and eventually get into) big tech companies.\n\nOMSCS is also pretty brutal: your hobby, night and weekends for 2+ years, will be doing CS projects and writing papers.

IOW, maybe the people do have interest in the subject, but what they really want is to show they have a degree. Really for working professionals like yourself. \n\nDue to it being asynchronous, it’s simply not going to have the same rigor as an on campus program. Example: exam is proctored online and must be done within 24 hours. Why not have teams of students where one goes first and feeds the questions to everyone else? This is obviously not a concern in a synchronous exam. I know for my online masters program, there’s a huge de-emphasis on testing, and I suspect it’s because it’s impossible to police. Instead, it’s a lot of research papers and deep dives, which can obviously be useful, but can also be a constant exercise in simply going back through course material to find the relevant topic and answering. Thus far, I’m about to finish course 6 and 7 of 13 (prerequisites included) and I’m tracking to be sitting at a 3.9 minimum, and I’ve been slack on readings. \n\nBalance, it can be hard. You should probably expect to spend at least 9 hours per class per week. Obviously you can try to coast and do the bare minimum, but then why would you pay for that?\n\nI’d look towards certifications after the masters degree.

Can you handle one or two years of garden leave due to non-competes? Can you handle being restricted by non-disclosure agreement?\n\nAnywho, I know Wells Fargo and PIMCO is huge out west. All the regular developers I know who work on securities pricing, risk reporting, trading systems, or otherwise more business-activity related platforms seem pretty secure in their jobs, if overworked. Although the American banks, at least, love a good layoff (eyes on you Goldman). IMO it’s great having a $$$ cash bonus at the end of every year while not being on the front line for layoffs relatively (suck it bankers, quants, researchers, and sales traders!). \n\nMaybe it’d be easier to skill build and lateral into a business-related developer role (ex. Java Algo Dev, E-Trading Dev, Low-Latency Trading Systems Dev, etc) than get a grad degree just to work on capital markets technology again?\n\nDefinitely get in touch with recruiters and headhunters.

The opportunities you find after will mostly be at companies that have similar expectations- mostly because if you want to stay close to your salary band at a FAANG elsewhere then you won’t have the easiest time finding a “cushy” job. It will mostly be fast pace, high expectations, etc. Late career you can probably find yourself somewhere cushy, but just acknowledge there will be sacrifices to get there in the meantime. \n\nAlternatively you could work somewhere with less prestige and live a more humble life. Personally I have no interest in FAANG, but I’m pretty happy with my salary for where I live and the benefits that I get and the low stress my work has. Everyone will have different preferences for what they want out of their career. A place like my company has no interest in FAANG candidates though because they would never have competitive pay- even if they compensate extremely well for the area. It is something we recruit against (my own boss even admitted that- we don’t prefer to hire people who live in the Bay Area in general even for our remote roles because we aren’t looking to meet their salary expectations). But I’m 24 and bought my first home and able to afford to have a child with my husband & we live near family and friends and are very happy with our life as it is, enough to where we wouldn’t consider the move for FAANG. \n\nSo really, it depends on what life you are trying to live.

They want you committed for life but will dump you in a heartbeat. To that end several short full time role is often a red flag, but 2 years is plenty in your case.

I'll comment on the CS path first since I know it.\n\nIf you want to work in CS, AWS Developer Associate is okay to get. Not foundational / practitioner as software developer. Cert won't get any jobs but has a small chance of getting you to the interview stage and helping you with a design problem. Master's in Data Science is a worthless degree. A Master's in CS is useless except either **a)** you can land a paid internship and co-op in CS to reset yourself **b)** reset a long work gap where you feel recruiters are discriminating **c)** you don't actually learn CS with the CS degree or work experience\n\nDoing QA work and deployments, it's more or less a dying job for Americans and has been so for years. Why Cognizant does it, was POS IBM where I was. Newer trend is make the developers do the tester job as well for the same pay. All of a sudden I was coding and deploying my own code with responsibility for all levels of testing. Violates segregation of duty and forces me on 45-50 hours weeks but saves the man money.\n\nIf you still want to go this route and build on your work experience, yeah the cert is probably okay and degree probably works the same way in that it's a calculated risk. Less a risk if the degree is fully funded. You can do Multivariate Calculus. The shock value ended in Calc II. Nice part is taking the derivative of one variable, you treat the other variable as a constant and it doesn't matter what order you take derivatives in.",

So my intent in pursuing these is just for learning something fruitful, then I can hopefully build my own projects to show some competency on my own.\n\nI hear what you're saying about the Data Science Master's, it isn't much on its own and actual experience matters. But I can't get a job without experience, and I can't get experience without a job, as the saying goes, so that's why I considered this. Rutgers also offers a Master's in Business and Science which combines data analytics and business courses, but having to fund it myself, fully or partially, I dunno I just don't want to bother with school again, now that I think about it more. Also for calculus, I haven't touched it in well over 5 years, neither at work nor school, basically forgot everything, so that's why I am so hesitant about that part.\n\nCompanies expecting people to be a jack-of-all-trades just so they can save money is an irritating trend. If I were a greedy CEO I'd probably understand, but as someone who just wants enough of a salary to live comfortably, it gets on my nerves. But that's how this field is, the ones who are willing to adapt in the race to the bottom will succeed.\n\nI'll stick with the self-learning path then, for now. It's the most doable at this point.",

I don't particularly need to be a SWE - the job description itself sounds nice, and I think I would enjoy the work, but I feel that as long as I can work in a structured position (ideally with computers), I can be happy enough. I know some people on this subreddit would disagree, but work is work to me and while I do have some preferences I'm not insanely picky about what kind of work I get as long as I can still live my life.

Are they receptive to tactical investments in tech debt? \n\nAnd second question is do you have the appropriate technical lead to help drive a vision and technical plan to dig out of the hole? This is hard and many are not cut for it, preferring to create plans to burn it all down for something new. \n\nLastly, I hate to say, but just wanting to be a mundane ticket taker is neither good or fun for you long term. You should develop opinions and strategies for how to make things better. This field is getting more competitive and saturated and if you can’t put out more than the exact minimum effort to not get fired, you are going to be left behind in this field eventually.",

I always said if I found a job that really has impact like that then I'd actually be happy going into work. Something to benefit animals and people less fortunate, something that'd be beneficial to the environment.\n\nMaterial Science, Chemical Engineering, Physics, Math, etc. are all going to be about finding the big breakthroughs with hands on in the real world looking for discoveries and leveraging phenomena to build things.\n\nThen of course, the medical field.\n\nA big roadblock though is that so much that stands in the way of progress is nothing even technical, it's political. Shitty policies. We have insane technology today that people 200 years ago would never have dreamed of and I'm sure many of them would be shaking their heads at what we're pointing it to instead. There are simply way too many dishonest and self-centered people. Too many selfish people not thinking about people less fortunate, animals, the environment, etc. is why we're in this mess and in many cases, going backwards.\n\nThat said for Comp Sci I'd say most likely C and C++ mainly for Embedded with potentially Rust and Zig  and there's Python for A.I. Hate to be yet another \"A.I\" person and sound like I'm shilling, but the reality is the tech is going to be a big game changer, even more than it is now imo. We simply don't know when, if we'll ever get it to that level of A.G.I, but even if we don't get there this will help lead to many breakthroughs along the way. NVIDIA recently cracked the genome. Their A.I is actually able to build lifeforms with unique features/genetics and traits. Stuff like that is a gamechanger and that's what A.I brings.",

Data in PE can be useful, sure, but they already know how to use excel, there isn't \"big\" data to crunch in PE, the team is small... and whatever full stack stuff you're working on is likely to be internal tools. Schwab might be similar, but more people will be using the tools, you'll get more mentorship, you won't deal with the sometimes capricious bullshit that comes with working for a small company (especially run by finance guys), and if you don't like your job at Schwab, well, at least you'll have the rest of your life to fall back on.",

That means you aren't content with your quo and you are motivated to learn and grow. I think this means you have the mentality to take on the challenges ahead of you.\n\nStep up to the task. Upleveling yourself means putting yourself in a position you're not ready for because that's how you grow the fastest. What's important is that you feel like you're learning and progressing and not stagnating. Sounds like staying and taking on this opportunity will put you in that position.",

You will be expected to fix it.\n\nWith authority comes responsibility and liability.

But I am also always constantly learning. Various languages, frameworks, technologies, etc. I kick around toy projects at home simply for the reason of using something.\n\nPersonally, I would never hire/promote someone as a senior developer who is looking to \"grow into the mindset\" of a senior developer. I would hire them as regular developer, then after they've \"grown into the mindset\" would they be promoted.\n\nNow, of course, I don't know you. I don't know what you do and do not actually know. So you may be ready, I can't honestly make that determination from a single reddit post. But I will caution you. If you suggest this and they agree, you had best either be ready or a quick learner.

If I were to go that route, I’d probably explore computer vision or ML, I find the idea of working on autonomous vehicles and humanoid robotics really interesting, and I feel like the market might shift that way once the GenAI hype dies down.\n\nI’m definitely planning to get back into LeetCode seriously again, haha. \n\nAlso, based on your suggestion, would you recommend I start learning JavaScript/TypeScript on the side or go all in on that stack?  \n  \nAs for the other tech recs — I’ve worked with MySQL during undergrad, and I have some light exposure to AWS, but I’m planning to go deeper. I tried Docker before but found it a little tricky, so I’ll give it another go. I barely have tried git so ill give it a look andI haven’t heard of Nginx.\n\nOne thing I’ve been wondering is — will diving into all these tools and backend-focused tech take away from what I’ve been working on recently? From Jan to March this year, I spent time learning front-end development since the volunteer place I was at suggested it might make me more employable. But in hindsight, it didn’t really lead to anything, and I felt like that time didn’t pay off, which led me back toward ML.\n\nThanks again for taking the time to respond!",

More credentials tends to be better, but remember that every decision has an opportunity cost, specially when it comes to the use of time since it's irreplaceable.\n\nI'm optimizing for income with these suggestions, since it's what people is usually going after, myself included 🤣, but if money isn't a barrier you could even go to PhD level and become an ML/AI expert.\n\n>Also, based on your suggestion, would you recommend I start learning JavaScript/TypeScript on the side or go all in on that stack?\n\nI suggested JS/TS because it gives you a broader range of options. You can do fronted with Reac, backend with Node, you can do automation with Puppeteer, you can do scripting and provisioning i.e. AWS CDK, AND freelance work, with only one language. This reduces friction and allows you to reach the whole stack. Maybe you wanna build a product in the future.\n\n>One thing I’ve been wondering is — will diving into all these tools and backend-focused tech take away from what I’ve been working on recently?\n\nTo be honest, yes, if you have a strong interest for ML, then learning backend will divert you considerably from that path, but then again, we're in a saturated, hyper-competitive, outsourced market. I'd prefer to be doing backend than be unemployed. Unfortunately we can't be too picky when we're dealt a bad hand. You gotta play with what you have, or fold...",

That's not how the hourly relationship works, because if I work *less* I get paid *less* due to my non-exempt status. I don't want the downsides of being non-exempt without the upsides. So I'd just decline. I wouldn't attempt to negotiate, I would try and start a tiff by talking to a labor board, it's not worth my time or energy. I would politely decline the offer, and move on with my life.\n\nBut if you're a full time exempt employee, you don't get overtime, that's what \"exempt\" means. They don't even need that clause. If you work an 80 hour week, because you're exempt, you're not obligated to be paid overtime. And if they demand you work 80 hour weeks, and you say no? They just fire you for performance. That's the big downside of being exempt/salary.\n\nFor things like that, you need to sus out the WLB/culture of the company. Technically every company I've worked at over 12 years could demand I work on Saturdays, and fire me if I refuse. But I did my due diligence ensuring they had a good WLB/culture, so that's never happened despite it being well within their rights. Contracts/laws are strictly CYA, if I get good vibes from my hiring manager and my team, I join them.\n\nRegarding the inventions clause, I'd be surprised if you found an offer that *didn't* have something similar to that. Wording/scope might differ between companies, but most companies have something like this.\n\nBut again.... it's CYA. It's if Mark Zuckerberg invented Facebook while using the company laptop and made a billion dollars off it, so the company could sue and get their bag. It's not for when Joe Shmoe makes an app entirely on their own time/equipment that brings in $50k/year that barely anyone's ever heard of. Speaking from experience. I have an LLC, I've released several mobile apps, one of which makes low 5-figures, and I've signed invention clauses. It's never mattered, nobody's asked, I don't talk about it, nothing happens. Could they *technically* come after me? Sure. But it'd cost them more in legal fees alone than the whole app makes, and the app has nothing to do with them so it's not a competitor.\n\nAll that said, at the end of the day, if you aren't happy with the core language the company uses in their contracts, you're not likely going to convince them to change it. I would just move on.",

In a way that not so subtly indicates that if you're spending >30 minutes on the assessment, this role might not be for you. It's 2 trivial ds/alg questions -- the sort of stuff you'd find buried in a block of 50 questions in a textbook chapter. For engineering roles, we do this to make sure the candidate can code their way out of a paper bag before we disrupt management/staff+ people's time with an interview.\n\n> A timeline that moves quickly and doesn’t ghost you for 10 days between steps?\n\nOur commitment is a definitive yes/no decision within 15 business days of the candidate's very first conversation with a human. We average closer to 10 business days because it's not some altruistic thing; Managers are busy people, and don't have infinite amounts of time to spend on hiring.\n\n> Upfront honesty about comp, equity, and actual day-to-day work?\n\nWe always leave at least 20 minutes of time during each interview for the candidate to ask any questions they may have. Where 20 minutes is not enough (it usually is), I and other managers have skipped scheduled meetings to ensure viable candidates have 100% of their questions answered. You can ask about comp -- I and our HRBPs/recruiters will happily tell you the min/target/max for the req once interviews are happening. We're not going to send you a full spreadsheet of every comp band for every role/level, but can talk about the specific req you've applied for. If the candidate shared their compensation requirements on the application, they're talking to us right now because their comp requirements align with the min/target/max for the req.\n\nSharing comp requirements are optional, but if I have 100 viable applicants, and 50 of them stated their compensation requirements in the application, and we can afford 25 of them based on their stated comp requirements, those are the 25 resumes hitting my desk as the hiring manager. For budgeting purposes I and my CFO need to know if we're buying a Toyota Corolla or a Porsche 911. Again, managers are busy people and can't spend infinite time on hiring. It's ~4 lost hours, plus the opportunity cost of \"things the manager isn't doing\", if the candidate needs $100k/yr and we've only budgeted up to $80k/yr.",

Example: \"Here’s a simplified version of a real challenge we’ve faced. Let’s pair for a bit, and then you take the lead while we stay available for questions.\"  \n  \nSet a 2–4 hour timebox. Pay candidates for their time. Respect their calendar.\n\nProvide transparent, upfront documentation with role expectations, compensation and equity ranges, work style, tech stack, and team values. Make it clear who they will work with, how decisions are made, and what the first 90 days might look like.

        "body": "For a startup hiring a founding engineer, I don't want to waste time talking to a recruiter. Why do you have a recruiter before a founding engineer? I already think your business is inefficient.\n\nI want about 1 hour talking to each of the founders about the vision of the company and your engineering style and mine. If that all matches, let's do a technical round (can be any style, preferably under 3 hours of commitment total from me). If you need 1 more fit interview with any of your other staff at the end, I'd be happy to do that.\n\nI actually experienced a startup interview kind of similar to this and I loved it. I ended up not going to the (final) technical round because I decided to stay at my current company.",

Less means you're technically slacking (i.e. probably not holding up your side of the contract, possibly to the detriment of your own long term employability/competitiveness). More means they're probably taking advantage of you and/or you're not setting your boundaries correctly.\n\nSome things have reputations for being meat grinders (early startups, game dev), others have reputations for being chill (insurance, defense), but YMMV. Lots of people specialize in specific tech stacks, which usually makes them versatile enough to pivot to SWE roles within any industry.",

But its flexible enough that you can do it in any way. Some do 4/10s others do 9/80s. I worked in one of those companies fkr a few years and i never thought anout work after 5 pm. Bosses were hardly on your ass and i really worked like 20 hours and was a top performer. You just need to be able to get a security clearance and the security of the job is always there. \n\nYou wont make faang wages or get stock but you will earn a respectable wage. I earned 80k in 2018 and left at about 94k in 2022. \n\nReally bad WLB comes from companies and industries that are a bit more 24/7. Cloud is usually the worst at this because it is so 24/7 that availability and on-call is pretty much expected. I did cloud for a few years and was miserable. \n\nHonestly for what you want id say avoid faang, most “big tech” and especially cloud. It’s possible to have great wlb at faang but its very team dependent. I know a guy who works for amazon but doesnt have to work past 5pm. The thing is faang had a silent agreement to always be available and go all out for the company but there are plenty of companies with good benefits who just want you to get your tasks done and go home.",
