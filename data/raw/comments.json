And I'm likely to get downvoted for a practical non-theory answer, I know.\n\nBUT...\n\nData engineering and software engineering are two different disciplines, so you can only draw parallels so far. \n\nAnd within data engineering, there's a huge difference between (1) a pipeline that supports a piece of software used by millions, or on which lives (any number, small or large) might depend, and (2) a pipeline that just ensures Sally from accounts payable can see the latest invoices in her report, which she only looks at once a month anyway, and occasionally forgets to look without anything bad happening.\n\nThe same difference exists within software engineering, between that million-user piece of software and a script running on a server in a medium sized business to do something useful but not business critical, and that hasn't had a code change in 4 years. Those two things won't (or at least shouldn't) have the same amount of testing effort even if the same software engineer did both. \n\nDitto for the two data pipelines. Ultimately, testing of any sort takes time that could be spent on other things, so for a business, it needs to provide more value than it costs, or you shouldn't do it. I see people forgetting this sometimes. Nobody should do testing purely dogmatically, except perhaps for FOSS projects, and any kind of libraries, which are a very different story. \n\nAnother angle is that user-facing software typically has lots of code branches, conditionally-executed code, and complex object interactions. Data software _might_ have that too (in which case it has the same potential for testing), but it might be very simple and linear. If running a pipeline executes every line of code in the project - isn't running it an adequate test for a reasonable swathe of test conditions?",

Although for smaller writes the data is stored within the database itself, so it is doing the planning for that. \n\nObviously under the hood duckdb is querying for the metadata and then executing the query. I thought you were saying that when using duckdb you had to attach to the Postgres, then write the metadata query, then use that info to write your main data query. So what I was saying was that you just attach duckdb to the Postgres db and then you can start writing queries in duckdb as if the Postgres db actually contained the data.\n\nBut yes even that might be too much for less tech savvy users. Plus other db formats that are able to read parquet files could implement the ducklake format more natively so that they are both the repository and the query planner.

Anyone who tells you they know what's going to happen in the industry over the next 5-10 years is probably wrong.  AI will be a disruptor. How significant that disruption will be and what form it takes is still very much a question mark. Turning towards more soft skills with job titles like \"Data Architect\" may insulate you somewhat from that disruption, but as I said, predicting the next few years is very difficult. \n3. If you want a masters, do it because you like the subject area and you want to learn about it. If it costs too much then get a hold of the syllabi and read the materials. As someone who hires engineers, masters degrees mean very little to me.

This isn't limited to just Data Engineering, this is true for all software engineering practices.\n\nThere is no one right way to do this, so you'll have to figure out what works for you and your company. Here's a  couple of things that have worked for me in the past (does not always work, but you can always try)\n\n1. Making them feel the pain - when pipelines break, make it known. Send an incident report email to everyone hen it happens. As you're fixing it, give updates, even if the update is still investigating. If they ask why its taking so long, let them know about the \"right\" work we have chosen not to do, and why it is making things slower to fix. This is especially important on data that is used in highly used reports. Connect these \"best practices\" to things that they care about.\n2. Insisting on specific practices - sometimes you just need to stand your ground and say THIS IS THE WAY WE ARE DOING THINGS. This is tough to do, especially if you don't have a high position in the company, but from the sound of things, you are the only data engineer, and you are the subject matter expert on the engineering pipelines. You will most likely not be able to say to them that you'll spend a month to \"fix\" the pipelines and make sure they are following best practices, but at the very least, for newer pipelines, you can insist on a few practices. Maybe automated data quality checks and alerts.\n3. Do things that bring value. While us engineers want to take the time and effort to design things well, and to make sure things are running well, what business cares about is always value - can I get my report in time? Can I trust the data that I see? Any best practice you want to do, or introduce into your work, should always be connected to something that matters to them. There is no use in doing medallion architecture  if it means we will need to stall everything for months, without new reports, or fixing current issues. People will be more willing to go with you if they can see that what you want to do will fix issues that they care about. In this case, your lead seems to be focused on the powerBI reports - ask him, what things about the reports are bugging him? what does he think we need to fix in those reports? Can he think of things that will make it easier to build reports? Any dataset that would be commonly used? What issues in the data do they constantly see? If you can connect your practices to these items, it will increase the likelihood of them agreeing with you.\n\nFinally though, there is a limit to what you can do. I think a lot of people of this thread has basically said - time to give up, and look for a different job. And there is truth to this - sometimes people just don't know what the best thing to do is, and isn't willing to listen, even to subject matter experts. OR sometimes, they don't care about the long term, and only care about the short term. If your values don't align with theirs - leave. Find a company that cares about what you care about. You can't change everyone.",

One Dataflow Gen2 per table?! That’s rough and you are building up tech debt fast, unmaintainable pipelines, and debugging nightmares might become a way of life. The only winners here are cloud providers raking in cash for unnecessary resources.\n\n**A few thoughts:**\n\n1. **This isn’t “just” consulting.** You’ll see it in product companies too, but consulting *magnifies* the chaos. **Speed > Quality** every time. The “default tool” is often whatever the least-technical person understands, not what scales. You’re not crazy or missing anything; what you’re seeing is just bad design, period.\n2. **You** ***can*** **find real data engineering work.** Look for companies that actually value automation, code quality, and actual engineering best practices. Hint: If they use Databricks, Airflow, or even just ADF (with dynamic patterns and metadata logging), you’re more likely to find serious teams. **In interviews,** ask how they handle orchestration, monitoring, and tech debt. If they can’t answer, that’s a red flag... share how you’d do it instead and see how they respond.\n3. **With your current team:** Quantify the pain. Estimate hours lost to debugging, tech debt, slow refreshes, and cloud spend. Reference stats (e.g., Gartner: bad data/processes cost orgs \\~$13M/year). **Write it up**! Put it in an email, a slide deck, or a doc, so the business impact is clear and visible. Propose practical alternatives: dynamic pipelines, metadata logging, or just consolidating flows so you’re not maintaining 100+ separately. Sometimes, seeing wasted hours or dollars is what finally gets through to non-technical leads.\n4. **If they won’t listen?** You’ve done your best, don’t let their lack of vision drag you down. There *are* companies that do this right. Weed out the ones stuck in low-code, quick-fix hell.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* *You’re not broken, the system is.*\n* Don’t settle for shoddy, low-code “data engineering” if you love automation and code.\n* Use quantifiable pain points to make your case, but start looking for roles at companies with real data engineering maturity.\n\nIf you want to chat about specific job types or interview questions to weed out the bad fits, DM me. I’ve been there, and you can absolutely find a better situation.\n\n(And yes, as a Microsoft Partner, I’ve seen some shockingly poor Fabric implementations. The stack is fine... when it’s used *right.*)",

You need to design the workflow, test it, deploy it, expose the data and of course maintain it. This is more or less what a typical DE does. \nNow, depending on the business, the volume of data, the stack etc data engineering might be from code less till fully open source. During the early days, a business will usually go for a managed service to set up the data platform. If the volume increases they usually switch to open source solutions(spark on emr, airflow, hive metastore, etc) for cost cutting reasons. As you understand there are cases where data engineering might involve more than data related tasks such us managing infra, setting up permissions/vpc/etc, modeling, database administration, unit testing, scripting etc. Do these tasks fall under the DE's responsibilities? Big discussion so not sure. Is it common for DE's to do these? Yes (I'd like to say it is something common but not sure either). There have been cases where I did some swe tasks like api in js.\n\nThe tasks themselves tend to be \"boring\" compared to swe since they are less \"creative\" and more \"engineering\".

We just take slightly different approaches. \n\nSQLGlot can parse 20+ dialects.  \n\nhttps://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/parser.py\n\nIt has type inference and logical planning.\n\nhttps://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/optimizer/annotate_types.py\n\nhttps://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/planner.py\n\nIt even has a Python based physical execution engine.\n\nhttps://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/executor/python.py\n\nAt the end of the day, there's been a big media brigade by dbt trying to hype up catching up to us. But it's the equivalent of boasting about making your GPS (compile time of SQL) when your engine is still slow (run time and execution of SQL). \n\ndbt core + fusion still doesn't have state. There's no scheduling / cron. So although they can now validate SQL queries, it still can't do something as simple as remembering what days of data your transformations has run for or when it should run. Compile time of SQL queries really should only take a couple of seconds, so they're solving a problem that shouldn't have been there in the first place. You're spending minutes/hours, thousands of dollars running queries on your warehouse, and SQLMesh is significantly more advanced there.\n\nHappy to chat any time, give me a ping.",

Having a good mentor can help steer your own career. Working in FAANG it shouldn't be difficult to find one and they don't always need to be within your own reporting lines.\n\n- Teach, don't do. You'll find yourself a lot just fixing juniors problems but not solving the underlying issue. The teach a man to fish anecdote is so applicable and you'll feel less uncomfortable with them struggling. Failure is a part of learning so treat it like that for them.\n\n- Be informally formal. Imposter syndrome at your age is always rife and I too had the same issue. I ended up on a training course for working at an enterprise level and raised the same challenge with the trainer. The main learning was reading the situation and being yourself where applicable. The imposter syndrome is hard to shake but it'll get easier with time.\n\n- Most importantly, make time for yourself and your own development. You'll find yourself putting more time on others and taking a leading role. However don't forget to take your training days and learn. \n\nGood luck!",

I use Iceberg with Spark, Trino, Snowflake at work. Iceberg works really well with Spark, other client drivers usually are behind.\n\n5. Maintanance of small files, compaction, etc [see these docs](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/maintenance/#delete-orphan-files)\n\nI haven't used Singlestore but do not expect OLTP(or clickhouse like speeds from Iceberg.\n\nIMO its helpful to avoid vendor lock in (althought I am usually doubtful of these claims, since most vendor data can be dumped out into parquet, or some common standard).\n\nAs for time travel, its definitely helpful. I've also used SCD2 and kept fact table entries as non immutable past certain lookback time with an etl_inserted column to eseential do time travel (think processing ts column).\n\nI'd really nail down the requirements, what does time travel mean to your use case, why do you need it, any other way to easily get what you are looking for? And what is fast mean (under 10s, under subsecond) can you optimize your query to make current system faster; Iceberg will not magically make your queries faster.\n\nHope this helps, lmk if you have any questions.",

While it has certain drawbacks it makes us think more like a software developer rather than a traditional Data Engineer with SQL scripts. I really love their branch based development where you can tested your code with production datasets as input (fall back option) to your current dataset under development. I personally am a huge fan of their data lineage tool. Unlike other data platforms creating a pipeline or a DAG can be done in a few mins. They have thought through all these concepts way ahead and in my opinion their platform is way ahead of other solutions. Foundry had this concept of table format way before Iceberg or delta got popular. \n\nOne take away I have is if your organization needs a data platform that needs traditional data warehousing alot Foundry sucks in that area. This is a great solution for Extraction and Transformation but if your organization depends on datasets mostly for creating charts and dashboards with strict SLAs. Foundry can only be used as compute layer and then load this data back into snowflake or other data warehouses.",

Extracting data from an RDS instance\n\n2. Extracting data from an external API endpoint\n\n  \nYou have to give permissions to the orchestrator (most likely ECS task) to access the RDS instance and also secrets such as API key and RDS password. \n\nBut let us say the ETL logic lives outside (separate ECS tasks) then the orchestrator essentially only needs permissions to kickoff those tasks. The individual tasks get separate permissions to access their specific instances. This is in line with the least privilege principle often recommended for defining permissions.\n\nGiving the orchestrator too much permissions is exposing you to a lot of risk. There are some newer approaches like the ETL logic is defined in the orchestrator but the flow/task itself runs in a specific pre-defined compute which seems like a better balance. So if you do want to put it all in the orchestrator make sure you leverage such an approach.",

        "body": "Great question, thanks for asking and giving me a chance to explain a bit more :)\n\nJust to clarify up front: Heimdall isn’t trying to replace Airflow (or Dagster). It’s meant to complement those tools, especially in big data environments. We actually use both -- Airflow and Heimdall -- and each plays a different role in our system.\n\nIn our setup:\n\n* Airflow handles scheduling -- the \"when\" something should run (\"run this job daily, but only after X completes\").\n* Heimdall handles orchestration -- the \"what\", \"where\", and \"how\" something runs (\"run this Spark job with version X on cluster Y, with these configs\").\n\nSo why build Heimdall for orchestration instead of just using Airflow for everything?\n\nA few reasons:\n\n**1. Consistency:**  \nWe want a single, unified interface between all tools and data systems (Spark, Trino, Clickhouse, etc.). Heimdall abstracts away infra details -- our users just submit workloads the same way every time (from user's p-o-v, the way they submit SparkSQL and Trino query and get results is exactly the same). We can manage things like version upgrades, logging, error tracking, etc., in one place. Similar to what Netflix’s Genie does -- it creates a clean boundary between clients (humans and systems) and infrastructure.\n\n**2. Security:**  \nEngineers can run and test jobs locally -- even against prod data -- without needing shared credentials (we integrate with many systems, zero creds for those on laptops). They just use their own identity, and Heimdall enforces everything (RBAC, logging, etc.) in one place. Airflow submits jobs *through* Heimdall, so we get a centralized entry point to everything.\n\n**3. Simplification:**  \nBy offloading orchestration to Heimdall, our Airflow operators got *really* simple -- each is maybe 10-20 lines of code, no matter how complex the job is. This helps us avoid the usual “infra logic leaking into pipeline code” problem. Heimdall gives us reusable building blocks that keep our DAGs clean.\n\nThere are other reasons too, but those are the big ones. Happy to go deeper into any of them if it’s useful.\n\nAnd just to be clear -- we still really like Airflow. :) It’s become much more lightweight for us now that it only handles scheduling. We’re even looking at turning Heimdall-based operators into lightweight sensors, so we can run thousands of DAGs on a small Airflow box.",

I think the easiest way to approach this project is to post on this subreddit, and the businessintelligence subreddit asking if anyone is willing to mentor you on building out this project, and make sure to mention what sport industry you are in.

You can do this cheaply in Azure or AWS (or any cloud provider). I recommend sticking with Azure if that’s where your organization already has its IT centre of gravity. Otherwise you’ll pay money transferring data between the two providers. \n\nBut if you reply with some additional detail about your requirements, I can help you out more. In other words: what does the team want to do with this data? What capabilities are you expected to provide on top of it?

        "body": "IMO the data architecture depends more on the complexity of your organization and required analytics than on the data volume. In our case we had gradually accumulated 1500+ DBT models that were split into 3 layers and multiple streams. That was mostly because we had a self service setup where other teams were able to set up their own DBT models.\n\nI think the best thing to do when you design your warehouse is to agree on the common business vocabulary. You would be surprised to hear the number of times when different teams disagreed on the definition of a subscription or what a logged in user is. After you have the definitions locked down you can set up a classic 3 layer structure: raw, cleaned/merged and marts. Depending on your situation you might not need the middle layer, but i found that it helps to standardise the data and denormalise it where necessary.",

I think anyone who goes through many rounds of progressively complex technical interviews will logically assume the last one could be the toughest.  \n\nI personally have had it happen to me more often than I want to remember that the interview process can take an unexpected turn. You’re nervous and you get stuck in your head on what you prepared for, not what’s actually happening. The way I have dealt with this is to make notes about these types of situations and think through how I would have liked to handle it differently next time. I actually review this list of past flubs every time I interview and my own mistakes have made me better over time. \n\nIn this case obviously it might have been better for you to be able to just take a step back and see you had simple problems in front of you. Or, if you felt uncertain, to say “I see a simple solution to this question or I could offer a more sophisticated approach, do you have a preference for how I tackle it?” But the point is no one answer is going to help you here because the next round of interviews the opposite situation could arise. So I prefer to reflect on all the past weird situations that have arisen in the past before I interview. This alone helps me slow down and expect the unexpected.",

My company has DEs who do nothing but manage Kafka infrastructure, and there are others who are doing almost exclusively dbt modeling. The learning paths for those roles are completely different. I'll assume you want something more general.\n\nIf you have a passion project and time, it's a little easier to build out a coherent training plan, since you have something concrete to work toward. For example, if you're really into sportsball, you can find a place to get sportsball data, extract it on some cadence, transform it, maybe do some simple ML on it, and then visualize the whole thing. That gets you:\n\n1. Extraction patterns. This can be DIY Python scripts or an ETL tool like dlt or Airbyte\n2. Scheduling and orchestration. Maybe it's as simple as cron jobs, or maybe you'll stand up Dagster or Airflow\n3. Database management. You can probably comfortably do everything in DuckDB, but if you want to get fancy, you can use a single-node Spark cluster to write out to Iceberg or some other table format\n4. Data modeling. Your data may have quality issues or just isn't structured in a way that's easy to work with, and you can learn about patterns like dimensional modeling and Data Vault. You can also pick up a transform tool like dbt or SQLMesh\n5. Optional: you can do some (simple) ML with keras / Tensorflow or PyTorch. Think simple classification or prediction\n6. Visualization. Make a dashboard. There are a billion tools out there, both OSS and proprietary: Power BI, Tableau, Looker Studio, Lightdash, or Superset are just a few. Pick one and make a dashboard to help you understand the data you've extracted and transformed\n7. Optional: A lot of this stuff can be managed either via cloud resources or locally-run via containers. There's a lot of opportunity to learn about cloud infra, IAC, and CI / CD",

That's obviously a bit different since you specify it separately, so I suppose the lineage is 'manual' in that case.\n\nThe workflow tooling has some advantages. You can specify which clusters to use for which steps, so you can keep a cluster live throughout the process for faster job startups, or switch clusters if some steps need specialised settings or need to be larger.\n\nObviously you don't have that with just Spark, but essentially any orchestrating job runner could work.\n\nYou can mix DBT in with python functions for python models. Those can specify their model dependencies within the function, and other sql models can reference the python module. I believe there are some more hoops to jump through in specifying the model in yaml and needing to set up your spark session to be passed in, so it might take some work to figure that out.\n\nThen things like Airflow, Dagster, or more classic things like Ctrl-M can be set up to orchestrate things, or in Azure ADF can do it if it isn't too large. I believe they all have a similar limitation that you can't just ask for \"things leading to this\" or \"things following this\" or both, you just have a set pipeline to run.\n\nYou can also do a very basic one yourself. If you have a function that runs some data process you can create decorators to specify dependencies, then as long as you `import` the module with those decorated functions you'll have a full dependency tree and can automatically execute what you need. You could find all dependencies leading into some data process function, so they are all refreshed, or run a data process function and update everything that follows from it. The functions to map all that out, but it is a pretty general dependencies problem so an LLM will likely have something to get you started.",

You'd need to do the overlap joins then, but you'd only need to pull in the `starts_at` for each table where there's an overlap.\n\nIf you have dbt macros, or can use jinja templates to help build the sql for you, or you're using a dataframe library, you should be able to make something adaptable to multiple tables being included.\n\nThe benefit is you'll still get the full grain of every change across all tables, and you won't have to create dummy entries for periods where nothing changes, and you still get to use equijoins out to the original dims when using the table. You just have to macro up the process to put it together.",

Union the valid_from and valid_to from all of the source scd tables to create a “spine” of every state change timestamp and person ID.  The reason you have to stack the valid_froms and valid_tos vertically is to handle gaps in the source scds’ time ranges for cases where dims were deleted. \n\n2. Join each scd table to that spine on person id and where the state change timestamp is within the scd time range, e.g. scd.valid_from <= spine.timestamp < coalesce(scd.valid_to, ‘9999-01-01’). \n\n3. The spine timestamp becomes the new valid_from, and use a lead() window function to add a valid_to. \n\nTo make it incremental, you’ll need to add a surrogate key built from person id and valid_from in step 3. And use that as the “id” in the incremental config to prevent duplicates.  The incremental clause should filter each scd table to only include rows where the scd.valid_from is greater or equal to the max valid_to for each person in {{ this }}.\n\nI could dig up an example query if that would help.",

        "body": "Thanks for posting this… it’s a good topic to unravel. First, it sounds like you have good/smart people even if they aren’t familiar with modern platforms and technologies (public cloud, etc.). Someone mentioned “data mesh” and that came to mind to me as well. Specifically, the principles around ”data as a product” and “self-service” as these are largely about organizational empowerment and alignment more so than technology choices.\n\nIt sounds like the teams need some guidance on how to organize and get work done. I recommend looking into the following.. the teams and company may be doing some of this already but it’s hard to tell from a short narrative. Each of the topics below embody principles of modern data teams.\n\n1. Agile\n2. DataOps (the modern data value chain and how to build data capabilities and the operations around them)\n3. Data as a product - creating things that matter and generate value for the business. The tech is not the point.\n\nIf you want to go deeper on organizational design ideas for technology teams, I recommend the book “Team Topologies.” What you read in the book is helpful and insightful but it’s not a blueprint - in my opinion - to simply go and follow. Instead, take what the book teaches, overlay it with your company, teams, and culture, and determine what your own organizational next steps should be.\n\nHope this helps give you some ideas on where to start.",

And instead of doing it with systems we do it with manual effort. \n\n\nCase in point - we changed the way some data was represented in the application. The DBA team ground to a halt so that the lead DBA could spend all their time and attention nannying the change. The analytics team ground to a halt because they wanted to manually check and manage 50+ reports and talk to all the stakeholders of those reports to find out how they wanted the reports to work with the new data. \n\n\nIn other organizations I've managed this by creating a data lake, creating pipelines and DAGs and incremental models with tests. Breakage was fine and normal and planned for and dealt with accordingly. Here, breakage is seen as catastrophic... Yet we don't spend time engineering against it. ",

Postgres is great and all but there’s no reason to do extract/load that you don’t need to, and if you’re licensed for MSSQL then use it!\n\nHaving an intermediate layer means another tool chain. What would you use? I tried dlt for that and it can’t properly handle MSSQL sources or designations; its reader library fails on large column types and the writer library writes everything as varchar rather than nvarchar! I ended up rolling my own (for MSSQL to MSSQL). \n\nBut also for performance tuning and investigation tooling wise, MSSQL has it all. I’d keep it all in there. \n\nI haven’t used dbt but I’ve been trialing sqlmesh which is a kind of successor to it. It’s good at managing nested views on top of data and materialising it, and I’m contributing a patch to make it run better on MSSQL also for my own purposes.\n\nTo expand on that, sqlmesh works perfectly for all of the MSSQL data types I’ve thrown at it so far. Because you aren’t moving data through it and just managing views, that’s all it needs to do, and so in that case it’s great.\n\nIt reads in your source tables and data types. You create your views and it understands what output types should be there, even in views that reference views too, and creates the output heaps to dump into with all of the right data types (they say you should explicitly declare them but I don’t want to and it seems to work without it, so why would I? that’s the whole point…).\n\nSo there’s no repetition of basic data type information or table management. Just write your views and go.\n\nMy patch is around improving the way it does its merge for incremental updates to the views. But also the output tables it creates are just heaps, there are ways to add indexes after the fact though and even in an automatic kind of way, it’s just not as intuitive as it could be. Still, it works!\n\nSo yeah I’d keep it all in MSSQL but also if you’re mostly interested in materialising views I’d probably at least try sqlmesh before fully committing to dbt. Just in case it’s a better fit for you.",

Do not enrich with fields specific to one domain or subprocess because now you add the overhead of having to know which fields have to be filtered out for downstream consumption. If for example your sign up date is an attribute that is relevant to the whole enterprise it would be a good candidate for a customer field. If it describes a specific sign up for a newsletter that is relevant to marketing it might be better suited to keep those sign ups separate. Maybe create a signup table that references the customer id so it can be reused across different business processes and is easily understood.\n\nIn the end it is more about the approach itself. A few fields here or there wont break your architecture but once you have super wide tables because people keep adding columns to defined tables the madness starts. Thats where normalization comes in handy.",

Think of the french speaking region of Belgium being in the same marketing region of France while being in a different financial region).\n\nBesides that you also have ownership issues. Who controls this dimension and is responsible for its data? What if they decide to change the region of a customer, will that break dependencies from other areas of business?\n\nSo I agree with her. Keep only things that are relevant and have unified meaning across the business on the silver layer. I would go as far as create multiple dim_customer on the gold layer, one for each department (so, dim_customer_finance, dim_customer_marketing etc) so that, ownership, meaning and purpose of usage becomes clear for everyone who sees the table name itself.",

I felt frustrated too. \nAnd then there was an interview. Was going on well until they said they moved on  with someone else. More frustrated than before, I started to give up. But then I started to remember the positives, About what I can deliver as a Lead and how am I really competent. Tried to reflect that in my resume. Imagine being out of work and then applying, that would be even more stressful, so I counted that as a plus too. At work I was just managing and making sure that nobody knew about my job hunt, made sure I was doing just enough. I targeted roles at specific companies and even reached out to recruiters directly, saying in a few lines how well I can fit into the role. By some miracle I got two calls. I was able to convert one. Didn’t have to lower my comp from the current too, however, I did lower my expectations a bit after a while. It was tough and looking back the journey was hard, stressful and brutal.

This greatly reduces cost of cloud computing, but still allows you to take advantage of certain cloud native tooling, such as Power BI connection to database without gateway middleware. There are also some advantages on the data security side of things. I would not be surprised to see more companies approach data infrastructure this way in the future, as we see cloud computing cost skyrocketing, and a mass emigration from the cloud.\n\nOther than allowing for half the data infrastructure on prem and the other half in the cloud, I can’t see why anyone would implement this approach on a strictly cloud based environment. Generally, OLAP based systems are faster and more efficient at data transformations than OLTP, so you might not be getting any cost advantages. You are also managing yet another pipeline, and likely need another DBT project implemented with incremental models. This approach also reduces visibility and traceability of your pipelines, and complicates CI/CD. \n\nThere are plenty of reasons NOT to do this. I would not recommend this approach unless you have some convincing reason to do so.",

It would be useful if you could list what you're trying to solve for in making changes. If something is working, just fine even if it's nonstandard or antiquated, it may not be worth updating.\n\nFrom what you've said, here are my thoughts:\n\n>So, my question from here is: what's our best option moving forward for improving where we store our data and how we keep it synchronised?\n\nHow many data sources are you trying to sync? I'm still a bit lost on how you're using both Power Automate and Service Bus. If you need low-latency, I don't think a data warehouse with reverse ETL is going to be a good solution. My guess is that if you have decent data volume and velocity, it's going to get costly pretty fast. If your message bus isn't getting you quite what you want, you could always look at Event Hub or Confluent for managed Kafka. Either way, you're looking at some amount of custom code to read / write data to / from your queues / topics.\n\n>Alternatively, the option of Microsoft Fabric to try to keep things within Microsoft / Azure, despite my many hangups with trusting it lol.\n\nI have literally never read anything positive about Fabric.\n\n>Trying to use FOSS tools to build our own stack, (difficult, we're a small team)\n\nI think your team is too small to take this approach, but it depends on your company's cost sensitivity. Some have the mindset that it's \"cheaper\" to avoid vendors and have engineers build everything in-house; in my experience, that math only works if you discount labor costs at 100%. You will certainly have some custom tooling and processes, but make sure that you're getting good value: the commodity solution is very expensive, or you can build and maintain a solution with minimal resources.\n\nIt still sounds like you want a data warehouse for reporting. Snowflake is a fine choice in Azure, though you could also look at BigQuery Omni. You may want to look into ClickHouse, since it's got a realtime / time series angle. My hunch is that this still won't satisfy your systems integration requirement, but I'm not familiar enough with ClickHouse to say definitively.\n\nIf your data is relatively small, I'd at least look at a recent feature from DuckDB: [https://duckdb.org/2025/05/27/ducklake.html](https://duckdb.org/2025/05/27/ducklake.html) This goes against my advice to do things in-house (although MotherDuck may offer this in a managed solution soon), but if you're not processing multi-TB datasets, DuckDB is very attractive in terms of pricing vs. traditional distributed warehouses.\n\nGood luck!",

So one job is moving that into a more robust ETL/ELT/sync solution.\n\nThe second problem is ingesting data for analysis is difficult. Right now, the reports that are ran directly on the web database have to be refreshed manually after opening an SSH tunnel (the DA opens it through PuTTY right now). Instead, I want to have this data pulled into a more accessible place. The data from D365 and our other tools would also benefit from being in here, as we'd be able to leverage something like ELT to transform these datasets into something easily useable for PBI reports or synchronising with each other.\n\nSo, the problems I'm looking to solve are to find a good place to centrally store our data for reporting / analysis, and to then find a good way (not Power Automate!!!) to move that data there.\n\n> How many data sources are you trying to sync? I'm still a bit lost on how you're using both Power Automate and Service Bus.\n\nMain 2 datasets are MySQL are D365. This is through power automate. When one makes a change, it gets put into a service bus to be processed.\n\nAdditional sources are:\n\nExternal API from a similar org that uses Power Automate to pull into D365. This runs on a schedule. Every change made then syncs real-time with MySQL.\n\nSeries of spreadsheets from another service we use for raising tenders (it's complicated). These are processed by Power Automate on a manual basis, pushed into D365 which then synchronises realtime with MySQL.\n\nMailChimp also synchronises here, pulling data from I believe oth MySQL and D365. We're apparently contacting our D365 vendor about a quote for having this data more closely married with D365.\n\n> If you need low-latency, I don't think a data warehouse with reverse ETL is going to be a good solution. My guess is that if you have decent data volume and velocity, it's going to get costly pretty fast. If your message bus isn't getting you quite what you want, you could always look at Event Hub or Confluent for managed Kafka. Either way, you're looking at some amount of custom code to read / write data to / from your queues / topics.\n\nGot it. I've heard about Kafka, the other two will probably be similar enough. Custom code is something to consider.\n\nGenerally, I think the real-time requirement is one that causes more problems than solutions. Changing an accounts name on CRM might be nice to have immediately show up on the website, but I've found achieving that so far is difficult and time consuming.\n\n> I have literally never read anything positive about Fabric.\n\nLmao, me neither. The only benefit I see is it makes setting something up a little bit easier.\n\n> I think your team is too small to take this approach, but it depends on your company's cost sensitivity.

You will certainly have some custom tooling and processes, but make sure that you're getting good value: the commodity solution is very expensive, or you can build and maintain a solution with minimal resources.\n\nThis is something I've realised / been realising. Hiring an external vendor to build something is gonna be costly/ difficult to get to pass, but would be at least a decent idea. The vendor we use did suggest adding Data Factory to the unused Synapse instance we have, but with Synapse now being effectively discontinued I'd rather find a new solution than depend on it even more.\n\n> It still sounds like you want a data warehouse for reporting. Snowflake is a fine choice in Azure, though you could also look at BigQuery Omni. You may want to look into ClickHouse, since it's got a realtime / time series angle. My hunch is that this still won't satisfy your systems integration requirement, but I'm not familiar enough with ClickHouse to say definitively.\n\nI'll take a look at those names. Main reason for a data warehouse / lake is that the main existing alternatives would be Microsoft Dataverse which isn't a great idea imo, or wrangling the Azure SQL DB that's sitting empty. A little more feasible, but wouldn't offer as good a feature set as something made for warehousing.\n\n> If your data is relatively small, I'd at least look at a recent feature from DuckDB\n\nI've heard a fair bit about DuckDB, it might be time to give it more of a look.",

The website contains much of the same information, on top of some additional website specific data: the actual quote requests raised and reported spend being the main pieces.\n\nWe had originally used a vendor to move from a Dynamics 2014 system to 365 back in around 2020 and the requirement was to make the synchronisation between the new CRM and the website realtime as they shared a lot of data. From what I know, that requirement is intended to stay for the time being.\n\nHopefully, depending on however the solution we end up with shakes up that requirement might change. But generally if say an Account (eg one of our members) has some of their details changed on say the CRM then that change needs to be propagated to the website on-demand rather than on-schedule.\n\nI am aware that's a rather big ask. Performing that sync on a scheduled basis with a more meaningful separation between our CRM and web data would probably work better.",

Why not use Azure SQL for your central data location?\n\nThis was a choice made when the CRM was first remade with assistance from our vendor. I wouldn't really intend on continuing to use it as a central store rather than a simple CRM.\n\n(Edit: we do have an Azure SQL instance as an option for a central data store, but it's currently not used at all and I'm not fully certain how good of an option it would be compared to other solutions. I suppose that's one of my questions here.)\n\n> I will say my opinion outright. Power Automate is a toy integration technology and it appears you are now hitting the limits of what is possible to accomplish with such a toy.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree. It was chosen by our vendor as the way to synchronise these datasets at the time, and since then I've hated it considering I've been the one to maintain it. One of the main purposes of rethinking our DE solution is so that we (I) can stop using it.\n\n> If I was designing such a system, my choice of platform would be SSIS from the start because I know I can accomplish everything you have described and not worry about the solution not being able to handle all the additional requirements that are being added as the time goes by.\n\nSSIS is a reasonable option. Might take time to remember how to deploy and use it again etc, but it's at least a good step. I may need an ELI5, but what would be the difference between SSIS and Azure Data Factory?",

Testing in ADF costs you money.  \n\\* You can develop SSIS solutions on your notebook without any network connectivity in a designer that is a desktop application. ADF designer requires network connectivity and it becomes clunky once you start to create more complex solutions.  \n\\* In SSIS you have a choice of many third-party extensions to use when developing solutions. In ADF you are completely dependent on Microsoft for connectors and new features.  \n\n\nSome people call SSIS legacy. However, the reality is SSIS is still the best ETL platform on the market and people not only continue to use it, but the use is increasing. I suspect many people are now discovering that having the ability to run SSIS both on-premises and in the cloud is a very attractive feature compared to having a solution that is cloud-only with no ability to transition back on-premises for cost reasons, for example.",

        "body": "I'd vote for [Malbolge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbolge), if we're counting esoteric languages. The language was designed with the express purpose of being as difficult to use as possible, going as far as requiring the source code itself to be encoded in a cypher, making it essentially impossible to read. Beyond that, it uses base 3 arithmetic, and essentially requires to use of self modifying code to accomplish most tasks.\n\nThere are very few programs written in it, with the first hello world program appearing 2 years after the language was published. And that code was not written by hand, but instead generated using a [beam search](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search) algorithm.\n\nIf we relax the \"uselessness\" requirements a bit, and focus more on languages that are simply incredibly different from the ones you've learned, there are a lot of potential candidates.\n\n[Prolog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) is a logic programming language where you basically describe the problem and the compiler finds a program that solves it (assuming it has a solution). This is a very radically different way of writing code compared to the languages you have experience with.\n\nSimilarly [Rocq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocq) (previously Coq) is an interactive theorem prover, where you wrote code that describes mathematical logic modeling something and can find formal mathematical proofs about it. It is possible to write programs and verify their correctness in Rocq as demonstrated by the [CompCert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompCert) C compiler.\n\n[Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html) is a functional programming language with algebraic effect types, which clearly define what kind of side effects (if any) a function is capable of causing.\n\n[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is an extremely powerful functional programming language with an absolute crapton of functionality that can be enabled for all sorts of advanced type level programming. As a bonus, since everyone loves to create custom operators, it's not uncommon for Haskell code to look like symbol soup with a handful of recognizable names mixed in here and there.\n\n[APL](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)) and other array languages treat everything as arrays and provide a bunch of super basic functions to manipulate them, leading to solving problems in a very different way than you might in other languages. As a bonus, APL specifically uses a bunch of custom symbols, leading to code that looks like this:\n\n    life ← {⊃1 ⍵ ∨.∧ 3 4 = +/ +⌿ ¯1 0 1 ∘.⊖ ¯1 0 1 ⌽¨ ⊂⍵}\n\nThis example implements [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in APL.\n\nYou could also try Racket, as another commenter mentioned, or any other Lisp really, as they are different enough from what you're familiar with to require learning to think differently about solving problems.\n\nThere are tons more languages in various different paradigms you could try, and they would all be valuable right now. All the languages you;be learned sit within a very tiny corner of the world of programming languages, and offer only the tiniest glimpse into the variety of languages, paradigms, and ways to think about solving various problems.\n\nWhile I respect that you aren't interested in learning something just because it's \"useful\", I think putting emphasis on the \"uselessness\" of a language is not the best way to think about this. Instead you should consider \"how different is this language from what I'm familiar with\", because the more different and alien a language feels, the harder it will be to learn, but it will also reshape how you think about solving problems.\n\nEdit: fixed APL link (at least on mobile)",

You use it at runtime and include it to do something. (e.g. \"I used the image processing library to sharpen the image.\").\n\nAn api (application programming interface) is a particular code interface (think logical types and methods/operations) that others on other teams are expected to use. Because of that, the publishing team will promise that changes and especially breaking changes to the interface definition will not be made without notice and time for code bases using it to adapt. When you as a programmer include someone else's library, you would be advised to interact with it through defined apis. If you don't and instead use reverse engineering techniques to find and interact with other internal points like internal methods, services, or data tables, the library publisher may change these at any point without notice and you may have unexpected emergency fixes.\n\nNote that something being an api is about the stability and change notification promises not about a particular format, spec, or connection method. An api is often a set of service layer or business layer web services using rest/json or soap formatting, but it certainly does not have to be. There are UI layer apis, which are usually js, iframe, or css interaction points. There are apis that are simply methods you call when you add someone else's code to your project. There are plugin apis where you code an extension that implements a published interface and register it using a published json or xml config file. There are data layer apis which are usually sets of tables, views, and stored procs you are to use when extending a product's data model.\n\nIt's not all about web services and not every web service is an api.",

So for hobbyists or self-learners, Python is simply a better first (or second) language. C++ is like learning calculus before arithmetic.\n\nBut C++ still does matter.  There is a ton of existing code written in C++ that needs maintaining and the language is still unmatched in performance-critical domains. And there is a lot of learning value in it. Even moderate exposure can teach you a lot about how computers work under the hood.\n\nSo in a way, it is indeed Excalibur: It’s immensely powerful and if misused, it can easily destroy you. But those who master it wield near-magical abilities.",

        "body": "I'll provide a contrasting point of view since most people are trying to convince you there's nothing special about C++. I believe C++ is very problematic for newer programmers because a huge list of reasons. The general dismissive advice is to just program in the \"safe\" areas of C++, but there is no way for a beginner to know where that is.\n\nThere are basic problems right off the bat for a beginner.\n\n1. No real package management system. If you want to use libraries in C++, you'll often need to download someone's .hpp and .cpp file and figure out how to compile that into your program and use it. That directly leads into\n\n2. Compilation. No other modern language has a system as complicated as C++, you are going to struggle with your program finding your headers, things are going to compile and not link the right libraries, these words don't even make sense to beginner programmers in other languages. But of course C++ programmers have tried to solve this and that causes problem number\n\n3. Build systems, C++ has 3 popular build systems, and they don't necessarily work well with each other. You got make, cmake, autoconf and just regular writing the compiler arguments yourself. These systems are extremely complex, introduce a whole new language to learn, and are often impossible to debug. People will tell you that a newbie doesn't need to know about any of this, well they do if they want to be doing anything substantial using existing code instead of implementing every single thing themselves.\n\nSo all of that is before you get a program running, so once we've figure out how to compile code, what happens when we write code and try to learn stuff from online?\n\n4. C++ is extremely fragmented. C++ has gone through multiple incarnations, from C with Classes to C++11 to more recent versions. The way you write C++ code differs dramatically between pre and post C++11. By default the majority of the code you write based on basic examples will be considered incorrect. For example, you'd think you can generate random numbers using `rand()`. You'd be dead wrong, C++ developers do NOT suggest using `rand()` to generate random numbers, it's not guaranteed to generate a uniform distribution or numbers that are sufficiently random. People will even tell you off if you use iostream, the basic recommended way to handle input/output in every tutorial, because C++ code is supposed to be fast, and iostreams are considered slow. Basically C++ does something wrong in some initial implementation, and has to maintain that for backwards compatibility forever, so they implement a whole new different correct way to do it, but a newbie has no way to tell if they are looking at outdated and bad code or new code.\n\n5. Standards vs Compilers. Suppose you are super keen and keep up to date with new language features. You see that C++23 has some cool new feature you want to try in your own code. Well too bad, it probably hasn't been implemented yet. The standards committee are independent from the people that write the compilers. So the committee declares that the new version of the language has this new feature, and it's someone else's job to actually implement that feature into the compiler so it can actually be used in code. This is done bit by bit, so your compiler will support some C++23 features and not others. Hell, some features are in the spec and NEVER get supported. So if you're a keen beginner and see people present cool new features and code patterns you want to try, bad luck, try again in 5 years and pray that compilers have caught up.\n\n6. C++ data structures are heavily memory focused. This isn't the memory management that people usually talk about. These are the standard vector and collection types that manage the memory for you like in other languages. Except in almost every case, you interact with these objects via iterators, which dips down a level of abstraction and makes you think about memory anyway. So where in another language you might run `sort(s)`, in C++ you run `std::sort(s.begin(), s.end());`. That seems ok, until you start using references and pointers, and `sort` shifts the values in memory and you end up not pointing to what you thought you were pointing to. That's just a rookie mistake, but most algorithms do things in-place in memory and it's an easy mistake to make. On top of that you get pointer invalidation, where sometimes the automatic memory management just takes your data somewhere else and all your previously declared pointers are now pointing at nothing. The simplest way to accidentally do this is when you are using `push_back()`, when the allocated vector fills up it'll relocate somewhere else.\n\nI could go on. But the overall point is that\n\n1. Compilation and library management in C++ introduces significant complications to beginners that simply do not exist in other highly used languages.\n\n2. C++ has many conflicting ways of doing something, and there does not exist a single agreed upon set of teaching material for beginners to learn best practices.\n\n3. C++ has MANY hidden pitfalls that will cause beginners to write broken programs. Almost by default any code you write intuitively will be considered wrong in some way. The simple `for (int i = 0; i++; i < s.size()) { s[i]; }` should be written as `for (const auto& v : s) { v; }`, note the additional syntax and operators that might be unclear to beginners. Also you were meant to use `size_t` instead of `int` for the first loop, but that's almost never presented in basic teaching material.\n\nC++ has more complicated language constructs than other languages, worse developer support, has no single high-quality resource for learning, and online resources are litered with bad practice that beginners have no ability to distinguish.",

This isn't even true. The only situation where this might be a thing is where you're copying around data needlessly, but using references in C++(just like Python does by default) is an idiomatic language feature. \n\nBarring those cases, C++ code can be like 100 times faster than Python, unless you use Numpy arrays or something(which is written in C, so hardly counts as Python code).\n\n>I also understand that there's a huge responsibility in managing memory safely. \n\nYeah, except if you use smart pointers, C++ even has automatic memory management. People who say memory management in it is this super hard and difficult thing probably never heard about C++11. \n\n  \nThe language's complexity is greatly overblown, of course, but there is some merit to it. For example, template metaprogramming is functional programming, while your normal code tends to be object-oriented / imperative, so you need to learn two programming paradigms to properly program, which indeed is a lot. \n\nBut most of people's problems with the language aren't really a problem if they use the right solution. It's just that the right solutions aren't the obvious ones.",

No way is programming dead, trust me. The idea that AI will wipe out coders is a myth. Tools like GitHub Copilot are like having a brainy assistant—they make you faster, not replace you. Coders who skip AI might lag since it cuts problem-solving from weeks to hours. You’ll learn quicker, debug faster, and tackle big stuff, but AI needs your creativity to work. Coding’s been around forever (before you were born!) and isn’t going anywhere—it just evolves. Use AI to level up, and you’re golden. It’s totally worth jumping into in 2025. The industry needs solid coders who solve real problems. Stay curious, keep learning, and you’ll stand out, no matter how many others code.\n\nLearning paths depend on you. Self-taught is awesome but tough—you need discipline to avoid scams or getting lost. A mentor, even paid, can save you tons of time by guiding you right. Tons of top devs are self-taught, so it’s doable with grit. Bootcamps are great for fast, practical skills—3-6 months and you’re job-ready if you pick one with mentorship and job help. Check Course Report for legit ones to dodge duds. A CS degree gives deep theory for stuff like AI or systems coding and looks great to employers, but it’s pricey and takes years. You don’t always need it for jobs like web dev But remember that if you don't learn the deep theoretical stuff like systems design, algorithms, data structures, computer architectures and operating systems, and only the final technology like web development, you will reach a stage where you will not develop, and you will not move up the career ladder until you have comprehensive knowledge and experience in all aspects, not just simple technological skills like html, css, etc. Whatever path, you’ll need to self-learn, so try Coursera’s “Learn How to Learn” to master studying. Tech’s got endless free resources—use them! I’d start self-taught to test the waters, then maybe a bootcamp or degree if you’re hooked. Just know bootcamps focus on jobs and might skimp on theory like algorithms, which you’ll need.\n\nPlease do not be tempted by crash courses, all of them aim to teach you how to use the programming language only or just a basic understanding, and do not teach you deep programming concepts, the least professional course may take more than 50 hours of learning, and time is not a condition on the professionalism of the course, but for example, you will not find an in-depth algorithms course of 10 hours ...\n\nFirst, see if coding’s your thing with Harvard’s CS50 on edX—it’s free and a fun intro to programming with bits of C, Python, and JavaScript. It’s not a full course but a taste of what coding’s about. You’ll know if it clicks and get a sense of next steps. After CS50, don’t jump straight to a track like web dev—focus on building core programming skills, like algorithms, data structures and solve a lot of problems on websites like hackerrank,leetcode,codeforces, and so on... . These are the foundation of coding and crucial for any field. You can learn them while exploring a track (like web or AI) or before picking one—it’s up to you. Python’s a great first language—easy, versatile for web, AI, or data, and super in-demand. But it’s not about the language; it’s about getting loops, functions, and logic, which apply everywhere. Think of coding like swinging a hammer: easy to learn, hard to master. Start with computational thinking to grasp how computers work before diving into languages.  \nTo gain a solid foundation in your level, I suggest reading books that will develop your way of thinking. It can be read while you are studying CS50. There is a great book called Computational Thinking: A Beginner's Guide to Problem Solving and Programming by Karl Beecher. I really like it and still read it from time to time, even though I am experienced but it's really a great book.\n\nExpect bumps—coding’s all about solving problems. Don’t quit when you’re stuck; take a break, hit Google or Stack Overflow, or use AI to explain (but don’t let it solve coding challenges—that’s cheating and you learn nothing). Everyone learns differently—some pay for courses to stay motivated, others grind free stuff. Stay consistent, even 2 hours a day. You’ve got this! Finish CS50, then focus on algorithms, data structures, databases , operating systems, programming with C++ and OOP, and any programming fundamentals that didn't covered in CS50(because 8 weeks not enough to know what you should learn ) (try free resources like FreeCodeCamp or books like “grokking algorithms”). Hit us up for next steps.\n\nWhat you did was the right move, you took the initiative to ask, keep doing that when you have questions, always ask the experts and don't rely on the answers of laymen or non-specialists, not even AI, AI can help you along the way if you know what you're doing, but it may not be appropriate at all times.\n\nAnd not all paid courses are good and not all free courses are bad, I can give you advices for hours, but unfortunately that is not the way you will develop, you have a path that you must discover for yourself, what I discovered is what you will discover, but you will discover it in your own way and with your own understanding, so I said it directly to you ... You may not always be convinced, so I'm not going to give you all the advice as much as I'm going to give you what works for you at your current stage.\n\nAnd remember that not everything is clear at the beginning, meaning that I cannot give you everything from the beginning until you are an expert in the field, but this depends on you and your research, reading books and learning, I only guide you to the beginning of the road. Good luck!\n\nupdate : CS50 (also called CS50x which is the most popular course of the CS50 series) may be difficult for some students, but in some countries computer principles are taught in schools, if you don't have knowledge about it, you can watch the content of the CS50T course first and learn more about computer principles and how to use Windows and what is hardware and software.",

You don't yet know how complicated something outside of that zone might be, how far away it is, and how much else you need to learn before.\n\nSo - to sort of answer your question:\n\n>So how does one bridge the gap from being a programmer who can only create a terminal CRUD to becoming a programmer that understands how to build something like a compiler?\n\nBy gradually making projects that are harder and harder, always make sure that you know how to build *most* of it, but that there's some aspects you don't yet know how to do. And then you research those specific parts, using books, tutorials, ask around and so on. And you learn something. Then you either build a new project, or expand on the one you already have, and learn yet more things!\n\nThe same way you'd \"bridge the gap\" from fixing a puncture on your bicycle, to being a formula one car mechanic - by learning more and more and more - and at some point taking a dedicated class, course or job in exactly that, but there's usually no straight line!",

If this is enough to discourage you, then maybe you don’t actually love or care about this enough to go all in.\n\nThink about actors — look at what age most of them got their big break versus how long they had been grinding. If you're ready to give up now, then yeah, quit — because the pressure this industry will put on you will be way worse than this.\n\nYour first dev job won’t be easy. It won’t be smooth sailing. You still have to learn how to communicate well, adapt quickly, and solve real-world problems. I used to volunteer, I used to code for free just to get experience and feedback from senior devs — some who worked at Amazon, Google, and Netflix.\n\nI’ve led teams while volunteering, participated in hackathons, and mentored people — taught them how to lead and grow. On my *days off* from working a warehouse job, I would go into coding Discord servers and help people debug their issues.\n\nI tried college — it didn’t work out because of life circumstances. Everything I know is self-taught. I couldn’t afford bootcamps, so I found free ones. I hunted down Udemy courses on sale or found ways to get them free.\n\nThere are **plenty** of ways to make money coding. Go find one. I used to be homeless, and I was still learning, still listening to lectures and podcasts, still grinding.\n\nMy first contract? Made me $300 and $7/month. My second? I built software for a company, but the staff all quit before it got deployed. I still got paid. Now? I’ve got a pending contract with a startup and I'm building a demo for someone else.\n\nI’ve been doing this for about five years now. I’ve worked with people in Canada, Africa — folks who don’t even have consistent electricity or stable internet, and they still made it work.\n\nSo I’m saying this:  \nIf you *really* want it, then you have to *work* for it. You have to grind.  \nNot for weeks. Not for months.  \n**For years.**\n\nAre you willing to do that? Shiii I was diong this homeless.

Networking is good as a dev because you can work on projects with devs , you can work on projects with ui/ux designers etc . They'll reach out after if they don't its fine. Even if you network with busienss people you can get work though them . Sometimes it not about being good its about communicating and getting the job done because poeple don't understand what they are looking at in terms of code they look at results .

Saying they are 'ready for the workplace' is the same as saying 'my first year comp-sci 101 class got me ready for the workplace'. I'm not saying that these aren't good places to start, they really are, but they need to be used as the baseline for a least a year of extra learning or hardcore personal portfolio creation.\n\nNot to be harsh here, but you got advertised to by Udemy and they gave you expectations that were way too high. I think next steps to get a job are A: go to some form of higher education. B: work your ass off doing personal projects.\n\nThat being said, this market is extremely saturated at the moment and if you got sold comp-sci solely as an easy industry to get into, maybe think hard about if you really enjoy doing it.\n\n  \nIm currently a hot-property azure dev, and the absolute nightmare it is to find jobs (in the UK) for people with 5-10 years' experience tells me that the junior market is way worse than it was 5 years ago, its not impossible, but its hard and unless you are some savant-level coder (I'm definitely not one of those) its mostly luck based.",

That's exactly what I did and I don't have any certificates, college education, etc. I basically found a small web developer shop that did websites for local businesses and offered to work part-time on a contract basis and cut my teeth on developing POS and/or internet ordering systems for them, and then leveraged the experience I got working with payment processing to get a job as a junior engineer at an actual payment processor. From there, I have had no trouble finding work as a software engineer.\n\nMaybe it is harder these days - maybe there are even people lining up to do the free or low-cost work to build up a portfolio. Other posters here make it sound like it's a moonshot. Is it harder than when I got started? Probably. Is it fair? No. But what are your other options? Either try, or give up.\n\nWhat I will say is that the best thing you can do is find a smaller business willing to take a chance on you, find a problem they have, and solve it with software. There are still plenty of opportunities like that.",

Then I used it to learn how to export the data to a JSON file.  Then I upgraded to SQL.\n\nThis is going to be my career so I'm doing everything I can to be the best I can.

I know the hard part sometimes can be picking a project and feeling internally motivated to do it, so here’s a suggestion. Pick a topic and act like you’re taking a course on it. If you need to, just latch onto the first project you see on the subject that way the choosing part of the project doesn’t prevent you from the *doing* part of the project. Worst case scenario, try to recreate a project you saw on YouTube or something. Even if you break things, that’s better than nothing. Ask your classmates, professors, or even Reddit for help when you’re stuck. The key here is that you just need to DO it. Don’t be afraid to do it wrong or accidentally make your machine catch on fire.\n\nEdit: I would like to add that you should always start small. Programming a microcontroller? In my classes, we always started with a program called “stop-go”; when the microcontroller turns on, there’s a red LED on. When you press a button, the red LED turns off and a green LED turns on. Programming an application? Okay, maybe figure out how to make a window for a GUI. It doesn’t have to do anything other than be a program. Make pong or Notepad. Reinvent that wheel.",

You usually learn that through a scientific education heavy on math, physics, etc. and an applied field.\n\nBut what you mentioned, backend and frontend, is definitely not programming but software development. I'm saying that because you sound like you are focusing on the tools and missing the bigger purpose as well as all the tasks needed before even starting creating a new source file. You and your team identify what the software needs then you build, select and piece together all the components, and sometimes you will be programming some logic or patterns here and there.\n\nI understand that you panicked and did something permanent in a temporary situation, but you could have believed that you had enough tools to assist you so that when it wasn't the time to code you should have focused on the rest of the software development lifecycle - a lot of which is about everyone preparing, reading and understanding their assignments.",

The good news is that you just got in some real world interview practice.\n\nSure, it didn’t go well and you feel bad but now you know even in the worst case you didn’t die ;) \n\nHere’s the real test, do you keep going and try again or give up? That choice says way more about you than one bad interview. \n\nYou clearly know the material from practicing right? Now how much practice do you have doing it in front of people with a job on the line? Probably not much right? So of course it goes wrong sometimes.",

So once you learn the when and why to use these things, that knowledge is language agnostic. For cybersecurity I will say starting with something a little lower level like C, might not be an awful idea, but it will be more difficult as there’s more boilerplate code.

I'm able to get somewhere because I've taken courses that include kinematics / maths of projectile motion, but the wall exists for me as I'm not familiar enough with the equation of bezier curves, and the relationship between control points and the equation, to be able to create the path, let alone figure out how to dynamically create a bezier ease that hangs at a given point in time, and otherwise exhibits  acceleration in gravity. The internal framework we have doesn't facilitate positional tweens on different axis concurrently. However, I think I'll get over this wall, as I've already got some understanding of the topics involved. \n\nIdeally you should study a wide range of maths, as you never know when any of it will help you understand a more difficult problem.

With that said...\n\nMath is a formal way of solving a problem which means if you can map your problem to a math problem with known solution that means you know your solution is correct and you basically have to do no work.\n\nFor example you can use truth tables, set theory and/or boolean algebra to ensure your if...elif...else covers all the correct paths. The more familiar you are with this math the easier it gets and you'll recognise more and more problems for which you already have the solution. If you're not very familiar you will not even recognize that it's a problem which can be solved this way and you'll not see that it can be simplified using de Morgan's etc\n\nInstead you'll solve it by for example the most naive solution which could be to evaluate all cases and see that it branches like you want. Or you'll solve it by writing different implementation like using a sequence of if with early returns which might be simpler and better for some reasons and more complex and worse for others.\n\nTo sum it up in most programming math is just one other tool, very powerful but still just one of your options and that's why I think a \"wall\" is going to be very domain specific like if I had no idea what fourier/z-transform/laplace was I would be in trouble in Embedded but on the other I don't need to really understand them. Just understand what my electronic engineers are talking about and recognise when they might be used (because of the specific things I do in my current role)",

Maintaining diagrams can be a full time job, but it's ultimately one way you could start. Remember there is no best way, this is just one way of doing things.\n\nEdit : regarding how to learn I'd ask AI how to conform code to a pattern, how to start with high level system architecture. Maybe from an academic standpoint it wouldn't hurt to build a very thorough UML diagram, AI can help with that. Then move on to something more than practical.",

You want people to be responsible for things - delegating the responsibility of ensuring things get done and that they are correct. Ai in 5 years most likely will not be able to replace a person at determining the correctness of some code. \n\nThe best path forward is to keep an eye on the tools. Learn on your own but also try the tools since that may be expected at your first job. Also good to identify where ai makes mistakes. The best way to not worry is to observe that for yourself. If you ai doesn't make mistakes then you are a god among vibe coders and your future is safe either way.\n\nI would recommend windsurf. The best option might change over time, but currently for windsurf you can purchase their lowest tier subscription and get unlimited use from their base model. If any kind of expense is a problem, then use a normal code editor and ask a free ai service for code, like perplexity or Google or Bing.

The current job market, plus all the AI advancements in the news, has everyone worrying about AI, but it's a scapegoat to larger issues over-hiring from Covid, interest rates, and tax laws (Section 174 being a big one).\n\nAnd in regards to AI, if software development gets to a point where a non-technical person can use AI like a \"cheap high-quality on-demand agency\", nearly every job is getting replaced. Put \"will doctors\" into Google search, the first result is likely \"will doctors be replaced by AI\".\n\nBeing concerned about AI ***right now*** is pretty ridiculous. I've not seen any major instances of \"AI replacing developers\". There have been some decent showcases of AI reducing workloads (AirBnB did some interesting work in regards to testing migration), but even those are pretty limited. In general, it helped cut out some of the mundanity with repetitive boilerplate code, and helped people who have never written code to get things started, but that's about it.\n\nBeing concerned about AI in 20 years is perfectly reasonable though. We've seen major advancements over just the last two years, but we still are not completely sure if there's a \"ceiling\" that might cap what AI can do, or if those advancements will continue to accelerate.\n\nOverall, if you're passionate about something, especially at such a young age, it's worth investing some time into that passion. No one knows what the world is going to look like in 5 years, let alone 20. People who are really passionate about what they do, and put in the time and effort to make smart decisions, tend to make things work.\n\nEdit: grammar",

That role is absolutely critical, since AI can't take over management, and someone needs to be responsible for ensuring the technology get built and solves the problem you think it does.\n\nSo how has AI changed out life? I write code faster (for some things), I get better search results, and I can have in-depth conversations about parts of my life I wouldn't otherwise talk about, with an agent that is willing to walk through very specific scenarios for hours and hours.\n\nAs for other people, my job is to basically use LLMs to save costs. We don't need to automate away a full job for their to be fewer people hired, we just need to take a fixed cost center and figure out how to do the same thing for less effort.

But when I jumped into web dev, I had to learn how HTTP works, how to structure a web app, and how to connect to databases. If you want to build apps (like desktop or mobile), that’s another layer you’d learn different tools (like Kivy for desktop apps or something else for mobile). So yeah, the core language helps, but web dev and app dev have their own sets of skills you’ll want to pick up along the way. Keep going it’s all part of the fun!",

I started with that as well as C. This kicked my ass thoroughly, but I managed to join a closed source project for an old MMO game emulator. There was another one that was the competitor around 2003 that was open source. We had decided to merge but they made an interesting choice during the merger. This strange language called C#. This was a very early version of it. But I couldn't believe how cool and approachable it made things. I personally loved it. Others hated it and said nothing serious could ever be built with it. But me being new to this, I loved the idea of removing so much complexity behind things like memory management, it was like magic. You could get so much done by doing less. This decision fractured the team. The C++ diehards refused to work with it and eventually left to continue the C++ version, I stayed on the C# version. Fast forward some years, the C# version was pumping out more and more features while the C++ version couldn't keep up. Eventually the C++ version of this project died out, but the C# project is still alive today (sort of, it's gone stagnant since about 2018 or so). But it's incredible to see how far C# has come over the years. It's what I use in my current job (the little bit of coding an architect does anyway). \n\nI think it's important to know how languages like C/C++ work as they provide a better understanding of what's going on under the hood. But I also think it's better for someone new to start with something more approachable like Java & C#. That's good you decided to delve into it after learning Java. It's all good stuff to know, but certainly not a requirement. If anything, can make you really appreciate everything these higher level languages are doing for you.",

If I could do it over again, I would just go do a masters at somewhere like Georgia Tech, be done in 2 years, and who knows, maybe be working in the industry by now.\n\nYes you can do projects and that will help some, and you should absolutely do that whether you go for the degree or not. But having a masters from a reputable university will help you get your foot in the door, clear hiring screens, etc. There are also plenty of affordable programs from highly-regarded public universities for you to choose from, so cost shouldn't be that big of a deterrent. \n\nThe one caveat is that you do already have a STEM bachelors (which I don't have), so *maybe* you could pull it off if you leverage that plus some quality self-studying.

Especially nowadays where the cost of degrees are astronomical compared to what I paid (I graduated in 2010 and paid off my degree through work contributions alone in 2018). As a PHP developer you will have some income and also proven time spent actually doing development. As you get further and further into your career the fact you have a degree becomes less and less important. The only thing I would say that you would benefit from perpetually from a degree is learning the fundamentals as in my experience self taught engineers often skip a lot of these and struggle at certain points in their career when these fundamentals become more important (switching languages, architecture etc). Id also say that in my experience a lot of people doing ML / Machine learning that I encountered in the wild aren't actually people with Computer Science degrees they tend to be mathematicians. Two very different disciplines despite what people say (I'm awful at maths as I'm dyscalculic but really good at software development as it's more akin to algebra).",

Most of my own games sucked, and weren't really that fun to play, if playable at all, but it was more about the programming for me, and I learned a lot.\n\nI also didn't know what kind of project I could build - I just decided on what I wanted to see on the screen, and then tried to program that. Always as simple as possible, or re-creating a specific visual effect, and forgetting about the rest ...\n\nMy personal suggestion after having learned some C++ OOP, would be a game - not a modern 3D fully immersive experience, but something simple, a 2D shooter, a 2D platform-game or maybe even a text-based adventure. \n\nGrind the idea down to the bare minimum, something you think you can build.\n\nThen, once you've built that, begin to add features - what would you also like to happen in the game? All the time, make sure you don't plan something outrageous, but simply a small incremental step from what you already have!",

Some don't like reading the theory parts because they just want to program, so reading programming principles bores them. They prefer to jump in and code.

Just find a good balance between them, it is still good to study so that you know how things work under the hood, especially subjects like Data Structs and Algs, Discrete Maths, etc, because the concepts taught in these subjects will act as supplement for your programming knowledge.",

You seem to imply that either you find something boring or too complex, meaning, the ones you find interesting are unfortunately too complex or out of scope for you to do.\n\nMaybe make a list of the interesting but \"too complex\" projects you find, and see if you can either find a common theme to inspire you, or if there are some of them you can simplify and start out with on a smaller scale.\n\nFor example, let's say you find the thought of building a game interesting, but, games are too big and complex. Well, you can start small, I would assume that tictactoe is too simple for you as well, what about something in between, like Pacman? You can add a lot of interesting depth to that game. \n\nSome part of it is visual, which usually helps make it a little more interesting and captivating. But there's also stuff like Ghost behavior, which can be solved in a lot of ways. You can do it with more traditional search algorithms, you can make deterministic tabled graphs to use for look up. They both need to flee and pursue Pacman, the 4 ghosts all act differently, so figuring out how to add that nuance in, once you find the solution you want to use could be an interesting little thing to tweak around with.",

There are like a million CSS frameworks and other front end technologies that exist, I think not a ton of people really spend time tinkering with this stuff directly as a career. Similarly, you can have a UI without being a front end expert, just keep it very basic, like just use a template and be done.\n\n3. You can just have projects with no UI, this is extremely common. In fact, a project should really just solve one little tiny problem if possible, and if someone else wants to make a separate project that wraps your project with a UI then fine.\n\n4. Not that this probably matters for you, but there is a subtle difference (front end devs can correct me if I'm wrong) between front end software dev versus UI/UX design. You can design for functionality (and performance etc.) on the front end without really worrying about the design itself. You can conversely design a UI without getting into the functionality or even writing any code.",

It's rare for people to just be able to install whatever they want. You might need to check with someone to see if you can install some kind of python runtime environment. Even if you can't though, there's plenty of online python environments (Google Colab is a big one).\n\nIf you really want a job as a SWE, you probably should still invest time into web development. There's plenty of web devs that feel the same as you (they hate frontend), and many people have come up with different ways to streamline that process (component libraries, frontend frameworks, etc.).\n\nIf you want to get into data science though, you should look into more \"data science career\" related material.

That’s a real sign you’ve found something you’re genuinely passionate about. A lot of great devs started the same way - just getting lost in code.\n\nSince you're learning C#, that’s a strong start. It’s used in tons of real-world applications - especially in enterprise software, game dev with Unity, and even backend web stuff (with .NET). So don’t think it’s a “just-for-school\" language - it’s got legs in the industry.\n\nIf you're eyeing cybersecurity and want to branch out smartly, here's a quick breakdown of useful languages based on where you might go:\n\nFor Cybersecurity:\n\nPython – absolute must. It's everywhere in cybersec (automation, scripting, tooling, etc.), super beginner-friendly, and has a massive library ecosystem.\n\nBash/Shell Scripting – essential if you're going to be dealing with Linux servers or writing security automation scripts.\n\nC/C++ – if you ever want to understand exploits, memory management, or reverse engineering.\n\nFor General Dev / Building Stuff:\n\nJavaScript + HTML/CSS – if you ever want to touch frontend or build tools with a GUI.\n\nGo – gaining traction in cloud & network tooling, really nice for fast and secure backend systems.\n\nSince you're enjoying it already, I'd say:\n\nStick with C# and get comfy building small projects.\n\nStart Python next - you’ll love how fast you can get stuff working.\n\nMaybe check out TryHackMe or Hack The Box once you’re comfortable with the basics - great intro to hands-on cybersec.\n\nAlso, shameless plug, but I’ve been using this app called BootSelf lately. It gives you an AI mentor that helps explain code and quiz you with flashcards. Pretty helpful if you're learning solo and want to stay on track. There's a free version if you're curious.\n\nYou’re on a great path - you don’t need to have it all figured out right now. Just keep following your curiosity, and you’ll build the skill stack naturally.\n\nGood luck, and keep building 👊",

I look for what seems exciting or relevant to the kind of software I might want to build.\n\nFor example, I wanted a personal website, which led me to Eleventy. I tried to dive in, read some docs, and attempt small things, until I realized that I was really struggling to get what I wanted. I then looked for a tutorial that builds a complete project, so I could get a notion for what it could look like. When doing tutorials, I try to actively change minor things, add small features, or try to integrate it with something else. I like doing this because it forces me to understand why it works and make it my own.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree with project-based learning. I also like to say that you should embrace failure and be quick to abandon learning projects if they're not serving their purpose (i.e., you're not learning or enjoying the process). The goal is learning, not necessarily something you'll put on your portfolio.",

Then rinse and repeat. \n\nI was tired of just copy pasta tutorial videos and then not being able to recall anything. Now I can print “Hello, World!” with confidence :)\n\nI eventually plan to go back at the end when I finish the whole tutorial/lesson/class on what I’m watching (like 4-8hrs of said programming language) to refactor and make all the lessons and mini projects code to be more efficient. And that’s in hopes of refreshing concepts as I clean the code getting some hands on experience, even if not crazy complex.\n\nAn example: at the end of my current YouTube class/lesson, or maybe in the middle when topic is touched, I plan to somehow create an array or some data structure to be able to rotate my lessons/miniprojects to run and output instead of hard coding each function I want to run.

I was hired into a team and at a time where all the others in my cohort had masters degrees and seemed so much more experienced than I was. And it's possible that they were, I didn't realize that it didn't actually matter that much. I was showing up, passionate about doing a good job, and learning every day.\n\nI have a distinct memory of talking to a mentor about it. A meeting had just ended and I asked him to hang back in the conference room with me. I mentioned those feelings, that I wasn't as good as the other junior developers. I'd hoped my mentor would have some sage advice for me, recommendations on learning materials to catch up, or even just a pep talk. Instead, he told me to never let anyone hear me say that again. Because people will believe it if they hear it. And it sort of crushed me, because **I believed it.**\n\nLater on, that same mentor was let go from the company. In my final chat with him he shared that he'd had a lot of personal things going on in his life. The reality is that he was struggling too, all that time. And his way of handling it had been to put up that front. That's why I thought he was the person who would be able to help me. Because he presented like he had it figured out. When really, he was falling behind just like the rest of us. He felt lost. His mental state was impacting his work, etc. And worst of all, he didn't have a healthy mindset of how to address it.\n\nYears later, I was one of the most senior people working on a product. I had a manager who was new in role and together we built out a team of mostly college hires to stand up and then operate a new set of services. Every one of those developers we hired were brilliant. I always felt like they were so far ahead of where I was when I started and found each of them to be so impressive. But sure enough, in the months and then years that followed our building that team out... those new junior developers would each take me aside on their own to express how they were struggling with feelings in inadequacy. Literally, every single one.\n\nIronically, it was those junior developers who helped me to overcome my imposters syndrome. Not the experienced mentor like I'd imagined. It was when I realized how **we all feel behind,** that I managed to wrangle my own feelings. What you're feeling now is completely normal. Its okay to be vulnerable. To share if you feel lost, or don't understand something that everyone else seems to. You are on the long road to becoming an expert. Give yourself grace.",

And pretty much everyone I've seen who thinks they have it, doesn't actually have it either.\n\nThey're merely recent graduates who've hit the point on the Dunning-Kruger curve where they're correctly realizing how little they know about CS, and feeling overwhelmed. Their feelings of inadequacy are completely justified because they **are** literally beginners, and now they're understanding that completing a 3 year degree doesn't mean they know everything.\n\nOr they're too young to understand that the top 1% of any field are outliers, and everyone else is just a regular human who makes mistakes and doesn't know everything. Basically they haven't yet mentally grown out of the phase where they think parental figures are magical perfect beings, they've just replaced their actual parents with like, a senior colleague, or some YouTuber. But hey, better that pirate software guy than fucking Peterson or Tate right? Then their idol either quits or fucks up, and after a short existential crisis they realize they were just normal people after all, boom no more \"Imposter Syndrome\".\n\nOr they've grown up with social media, where your understanding of the world is warped by selection bias. User X is an expert in A, user Y is an expert in B, user Z is an expert in C, they conflate it into some amalgamation of everyone knows everything. Then they get a job in the real world and find out individual people are good at maybe a few things, but really fucking stupid at everything else.\n\nTL;DR as far as I can tell 99% of \"Imposter Syndrome\" is just young people lacking cognitive development and real world experience to understand they have every right to feel less capable. They literally are. That's why we pay them less. If you're asking questions on this sub, chances are you fall into at least the first category, if not the others as well.",

Not advanced stuff.\n\n\\~15 minutes of role-related knowledge questions.  Again, the goal is to see if their resume is correct.

I would ask a question that a seasoned professional could solve in 10 minutes.  The extra time was to allow the candidate to take time to disuss the problem, maybe have a false start or two, and still have plenty of time to get to a working solution.\n\nMy general advice:  Try to relax.  Try to think out loud if you can - the interviewer is probably trying desperately to figure out how you think about problems and whether you consider alternative solutions and tradeoffs between different ways of answering questions or solving problems.",

There is no standard for how fast the books will teach what it talks about, so you'll likely discover much later if you're taking anything out of a book.\n\nSo just having read is a great gain, trying to maximize the benefits will make you read slower, read less or feel pressured to be 'better' at getting your money and time's worth from books during reading or immediately after. Dont think about a hypothetical quiz at the end, you're reading for you. \n\nIf you did the bookmarks thing, you will be able to come back, write down, practice, etc. later when you've already read the whole book.\n\nAnd why read? Well... Imagine having read 3 books about a subject instead of just a few pages out of one book. One might feel like there are better things to spend time on, but books are a very practical medium that doesn't require both hands like a computer would.",

You understand the theory by applying it. Work on a project, encounter problems, fix the problems.\n\n>Any good projects or tutorials you’d recommend for practicing?\n\nAny project that you personally care about and are motivated by. And it's far more useful if you work on it yourself instead of just copying it from some book or video. \n\n>Or even just personal experiences — what helped it all *click* for you?\n\nFirst, figure out the properties of your problem, and then find a solution that best fits those properties. Try thinking about the future, like \"what if I wanted this to work for both 32-bit and 64-bit floats?\" or \"what if I wanted to change the database I use without having to change any other part of my program\" and the solutions guide you to SOLID principles naturally. \n\nI think that it's important to always have a reason for everything you do. Don't follow the SOLID principles because someone told you that it would be good to do. Understand what problems they help you solve or avoid. If you don't understand, then don't use them. Eventually, you might encounter a debugging session that frustrates you, and you might then realize that the use of SOLID would have avoided you the headache.

Well, those patterns never really resonated with me and using Java helped solidify to me that OOP cannot be the simplest way to organize things in a maintainable way.\n\nIn my career I’ve seen a lot of patterns, and the one that really clicked for me was pure functional programming. Working with a language that doesn’t have mutable objects, null values, or even a semblance of classes was such a revelation: nearly all the problems the golden rules try to mitigate come from mutability and complex hierarchical state. Pure functions always return the same result, given the same arguments, which makes testing them incredibly easy and fun. And if the language has nothing but pure functions, then all applications built with it are incredibly easy and fun to test.\n\nMy point is, it’s okay if some aspects of programming don’t click. Maybe they will later on, when you’ve seen how following it avoided issues or cutting corners lead to issues. Maybe you’ll come across another way of looking at things (like FP for me) that finally makes sense and helps put everything else in a new perspective.\n\nJust build things you want to build, that’s the only way programming is going to start making sense. Try following the rules and try breaking them. Come up with your own solutions and once done, analyze if what you did actually followed a common pattern, just in a roundabout way. If not, was it better than the common pattern? Why did it work, would it scale to a larger codebase or a project with 10 developers?",

Dependency injection means some external body knows all about the internals of an object and injects other objects into that object as needed.\n\nNow the OOD model still works if you think IoC as some kind of God object that has control of the construction of every object in the system. Because IoC is a God these objects literally pop into existence.\n\nOnce you understand this, it makes a lot more sense.

Return a option from the devision (for example rust's `checked_div()` functions) so that you have to check later if you tried to divide by zero. Arguably another flavor of 1, just more explicit.\n5. Return a sentinal value such as NaN, which when any math is done to it returns NaN, but is also not equal to itself. Just about every floating point type does this. (apoligies for the slight tangent)\n\nAnd to make it harder to set up this situation, have the compiler do const propagation, and throw a compiler error if it statically determines that the divisor is always zero.\n\n3 and 4 are the most 'strongly typed' flavored options.",

For example, to fully grasp diabetes knowing what insulin actually does first helps a lot, but it’s not a hard requirement to understand the disease. Similarly för programming, learning the basics like stacks, pointers, arrays etc. will make further concepts so much easier to understand, but it’s not required.\n\nIf you’re interested in AI you’d need at least a bachelors, and probobly a masters as well. AI works on a lot of linear algebra and multi-variable calculus. You basically have an input, break it down into a bunch of smaller components represented by numbers. You then feed these numbers through a magical web consisting of a 1000+ tunable dials which outputs a prediction. You need linear algebra to efficiently traverse this web, and you need the calc. to identify how *wrong* an AI and how to best adjust the 1000+ dials to make it less wrong.\n\nIt’s never to late to start coding, it’s a really cool space and I hope you’ll enjoy it!\n\nHere are some videos graphically showing how AIs work:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk?si=XmQwghEwlM-x11H7",

Would recommend learning a bit of C before tackling a project like developing a kernel - C programming will force you to learn some systems concepts, but it’s still a “high level language” that can be used for many of the same things that Java can be used for. \n\nFor learning C, check out books like Modern C or K&R. For learning systems, check out courses/materials online. I recommend Nand2Tetris, it’s a wonderful resource. \n\nThere’s no reason you can’t learn C and learn systems at the same time, but it helps to have some familiarity with how C works before diving into a really complex systems project like an OS kernel",

It has to do something that's not straightforward and easy, something you have to think about a lot and figure out.\n\nMost of your criteria are more about \"clean\" and \"polished\". But if you do all of those things and it's just a simple to-do app I won't be impressed.\n\nWhat I'd far rather see is something that actually has features that are not easy to get to work. Let's say you started with a to-do app. Things that would actually be \"complex\" might include:\n\n* Hierarchical list, like items within other items, with collapse/expand\n* The ability to select multiple items and apply an action to all of them\n* Real-time sync between different devices\n* Sync that works even if one device is offline for a while\n* Share your to-do list with others, with options for read-only or collaborate\n* Push notifications / reminders when things are due\n\nThose are just ideas. The important thing is that some of those features are tricky, and the more of them you add the more complex your product becomes, and that's what makes it much more like a real product and impressive.\n\nNow of course I also want it clean and polished and efficient - but it has to have some complexity to it first.",

I can't speak to how it compares to other codebases but for someone who has only worked on small projects for classes, it's pretty daunting. Plus, while I have basic familiarity with Java, I don't know C# at all.\n\nI looked at a bunch of other mods for the game and decompiled the source code to get some starting points, but it wasn't long before I ran into roadblocks that no amount of Googling would have ever resolved. Normally, I'd probably have just given up. Being able to make tangible progress has been hugely helpful in keeping motivation up and frustration down, and I feel like I've learned a ton about C#, Unity games and even certain OOP concepts I wasn't super familiar with.\n\nBeing able to say, \"Okay, here's how this other mod did Y, can you give me some ideas on how to implement similar idea X?\" Or, \"I understand what this piece of code accomplishes, but why is it structured like this?\"\n\nYou have to be willing to challenge the AI's ideas sometimes, too. Like, a specific weird issue I was having with this mod the AI suggested a very \"brute force\" solution that probably would have worked, but I was 99% sure was not the correct or \"ideal\" way to do it. So I would say, \"No I'm pretty sure you're wrong. I can see a bunch of methods in this source file that may be applicable to our situation, maybe we can find an alternate path?\" And then we found a better solution together. The AI didn't solve the problem for me, it just saved me the frustration of having to parse thousands of lines of unfamiliar code in the hope that I was on the right track.\n\nIt definitely leads me astray sometimes, it hallucinates methods pretty regularly but *conceptually* it's implementation plans are usually pointed in the right direction. I treat it like a pair programmer, not a code monkey, and I can say with complete confidence that I have a better understanding of coding because of it.",

        "body": "Avoid AI for most of your project. \n\nI’m in a similar boat to you going back to college and ya AI is a great tool to help get through it but your not actually learning that much by tweaking the code after it spits it out. \n\nThere’s a lot more to learn in how to take an idea and how to start making it. \n\nOne of the biggest lessons I’ve learned so far is in planning and design. Sitting down and actually breaking down each element, what do I want, what do I need, who will be doing x and who does y? What “date” should I be using and why?\n\nLearning how to define the success factors and set realistic goals is vital in coding. As I’m going through it I’ll jot down possible approaches and methods I might need going forward. I don’t need to fully code them now but I need to make sure I have everything tight for when things get complicated later. \n\nYou won’t be designing every system you work on from the ground up but you will need to be able to read and identify what the other coders were doing, what were they thinking when they made this method or class and where does it go? You won’t be able to feed full applications into an AI to read them out to you when you’re on a team. \n\nI also put a lot of work in before I started college and got advanced entry into Y2. At Christmas I was miles ahead of most in the class and took the foot of the gas looking at other languages instead. Come April I realised I’d slipped too much and had work my balls off to catch up. Yes I had a basic understanding of what we did but I couldn’t use it effectively. \n\nThe best example was SQL. I could read SQL, I knew where the query was going how things joined but I struggled trying to fix it together myself. I used AI while making my database connections and had to constantly look back to do them from scratch myself. Eventually I just stopped using the AI designed methods as this is something I need to be able to do. \n\nWe had interviews presenting our final projects at the end of the year and they asked “You have well designed methods for database queries in the first 4-5 frames but you don’t use them later in the project. Why?”  I explained that while I would be using those methods from the helper files in real world conditions, I wasn’t happy with my understanding of them. I couldn’t do them from memory and kept making errors, so I decided to drill them in by typing them out each time. \n\nThey loved that answer. It showed I was able to use helper files and methods to keep code clear and concise making the project easy to read, but I also knew how to make and adjust the process to perform custom tasks. They asked me to isolate certain conditions and how I would pick out individual combinations and I was able to do it on the spot because I knew the system and understood how it worked. Some of the others struggled with that as AI had done all the thinking for them. \n\nWhen it came to exams I flew through the test because I A) understood how I would do it. B) was able to identify what they were looking for and how to trace back to it. And C) I made the mistakes and worked my way through them so when they happened there I knew what I was looking at. \n\nTLDR:\n\nDon’t use AI to design everything. Yes it’ll spit out loads of lovely code that works for this window of the project but it won’t improve your skills or work when you only have this small section on larger projects. \n\nKeep pushing in college, you might be ahead right now but that’ll slip real quick it you get lazy",

Then, if you want to incorporate some OOP principles, you could create a more complex program that involves abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and/or polymorphism.\n\n\n\nIf you need ideas for projects, you can google \"<language name here> beginner projects.\" You're bound to find one that catches your eye. And if you ever get stuck on something, just google \"how to X in Y,\" where X is some task (e.g. use a switch statement), and Y is the programming language you are working with.\n\n\n\nTLDR: courses are beneficial, but they are even more helpful when supplemented with practical work and experimentation.",

Unless you do some incredibly stupid things (like deleting random files, or formatting your computer) nothing serious can happen. The worst case is that you need to restart the computer, so what?\n\nYou need to shift your mentality about failures: with every failure, with every error, with every thing that doesn't work like you expected, you have learnt something.

When you finish the branch and merge it into master, it won't try to update backwards if you're missing some unrelated commits from master, which is why you don't necessarily have to pull.",

You just need to pick something, anything and move forward. You don't need to worry if you stop or quit because something else sprouts out of the side of that. It's even ok if you move on to something else (if you're doing it because that drew your interest). Just program. \n\nThe issue is that new ideas won't come to you until you get more experience coding and playing around. You'll be working on a website, learn about networking and then think... 'hey I wonder if I could create a program that would connect my two laptops in a way that.........'. Or you'll be using a database and think... 'could I put a layer in front of that which handles X case?'. You'll get frustrated running a shell command and as part of script to install a separate project and wonder if you could edit its source code to alter something. \n\nJust learn and practice.

Books like that often go beyond the surface level stuff you'll find in tutorials, and that depth has always helped me.\n\nNo matter what tools or frameworks you explore later, I strongly recommend getting really comfortable with at least one programming language. That solid foundation will make it much easier to pick up new technologies down the road. From what you've shared, I'd say focus on either Python or Java for now. Both are powerful, widely used, and have a lot more to offer than most people realize at first.\n\nOnce you're confident in one language, you'll be in a better position to understand how and when to use other tools specially in project-specific contexts.\n\nYou'll hit plenty of bumps down the road, so no need to get frustrated this early on. :)",

And once they start making money, they will have more than enough accumulated losses so that they don't need to worry about taxes for several years, and by then you're essentially getting a 100% deduction because the past 5 years stack to 100%.\n\nThe real reason why companies laid off in 2023/2024 is because they overhired in 2020/2021/2022 because they misjudged the pandemic spending.",

The higher up you get and the more responsibility you have it becomes hard to have the energy to take on another job (passing interviews) while you have a lot of eyes, reports, and money on you. \n\nMy advice is don’t try to get pushed up too soon. I have 7 years experience and now I’m an engineering manager not really by choice and it’s so hard to slack at all, yet I get paid half of that this individual does. \n\nTLDR: do what OP did and not what I did. \n\nCongrats on the offer and I’m super jealous.",

        "body": "* There's extreme pay disparity of SWE just in the US. Compare us to other countries, and the differences get even greater. Pay is not solely based on merit. A rockstar SWE living in bumfuck nowhere Montana might be making a very \"normal\" salary at a normal company, and a dumbass SWE living in the Bay Area might've weaseled their way into a top-paying SV startup. And we *certainly* don't make \"2x or 3x\" what ***most*** other white collar fields make. Maybe if by \"most\" you include working in fast food, but definitely not white collar.\n* For one, this isn't an inherent trait of a SWE career. It *never* has been. There are lots of fully onsite companies, even top tech companies. But it's also not unique to SWE. It's a trait *of a company*, not of a role. At every hybrid/remote company I've worked at, ***everyone*** is hybrid/remote and is afforded that same amount of flexibility. Marketing, sales, legal, IT, etc.\n* It's genuinely interesting to you and me! But to a lot of people out there what you just described is more boring than watching paint dry. Different strokes for different folks.\n* Variety also exists in many other careers... You know those prestigious companies you're talking about? And the exciting startups you're talking about? Guess what they both also hire? Non-SWE's.\n* Now you're just saying \"White Collar careers are the best careers by far\". This has nothing to do with SWE.\n* If you work for a large, well-known company it's just as likely (I'd argue significantly *more* likely) that you'll be working on some boring internal tool that has 20 internal users. Scale is also not inherent of this career. \"I work for Google\", \"Cool, what do you do there?\", \"Oh.. uhh... I manage a dashboard that lets a small team of internal users track internal budgets between departments\".\n\nIt's a great career, don't get me wrong. But all of what you're describing isn't inherent of a SWE career, nor is it unique to a SWE career. There are billions of people. When you use words like \"best\", you're forgetting that the overwhelming majority of humans out there don't care at all about the things you care about.\n\n*Your* \"best\" career is someone else's living nightmare. Someone else's \"best\" career that makes them love waking up in the morning (someone who *enjoys* a manual labor job and like working outside, in extreme conditions for example), might be ***your*** living nightmare.\n\nIf you enjoy SWE, pursue it. There's really no point in trying to argue it's the objectively \"best\" field. Let people do what people want to do with their lives.",

The demand, i.e. desire, for R&D hasn't gone away- it's arguably only getting more intense than ever in strategic technologies what with all the \"but china\"-isms. But the cost of financing R&D has ballooned between the hike in interest rates (keeping zombie companies on debt fueled life support, incentivizing borrowing to spend on growth, i.e. R&D) and loss of immediate tax breaks. (ammortization is the same in the long term- but getting the full break that year is the difference between 20% cost reduction and 4%. If not for the previous years of instant \"refunds\", they'd have stacked 4 years of ammortizations and have the same effect right now.)\n\n**The loss of the tax advantage for R&D and the hike in interest rates would have suppressed wages, but not diminished the demand for employees.** What we're seeing is collusion between major tech employers to time their layoffs with the DOGE cuts to create a glut of desperate, highly senior, non-pay motivated talent in the market. The longer they can perpetuate it, the more desperate those people will get, and it creates a hermit crab conga line of companies firing their less senior staff hired when times were good to bring in more senior staff who've finally gotten desperate enough to accept lower pay.\n\nThere is an argument to be made that because other companies are laying off tech staff and the abundance of tech graduates is creating an environment where wages are so severely depressed that it becomes in the interest of companies to also layoff their staff to rehire cheaper replacements *without direct collusion*, but **when that sort of behavior occurs in the banking sector or stock market, there are regulations in place to prevent the situation from becoming a feedback loop that tanks the institutions.** \n\n**This cycle of mass layoffs will repeat every time companies think they can get lower wages, more experience or both from a new hire over their current staff until the US gets serious about passing labor protection laws.**",

Then again, 0% interest rates already sounds unsustainable.\n\nMy hypothesis for the bad market:\n1.  Too much new grads and bootcampers, entry is impossible. Add on to the tax code, there are fewer positions than before.\n2. Most software already exist, cheaper to pay subscription for a software another company made rather than hire more SWEs. Most seniors with 20 yoe just maintain old software these days (remember that one Google article?), if not that they are getting laid off and then the junior market becomes impossible.",

When you're growing, you need to hire a lot of people to take bit bets on many projects. You have to pay more and making interviewing less frictionful if you're hiring a lot of people. If you're focusing on profitability, cost cutting by reducing labor is a huge lever.\n2. Tax issues like Section 174 also have an effect. For big tech companies, it doesn't matter as much since these companies are very profitable and have strong cashflow. They're already paying a lot of corporate income taxes in most cases anyways. For startups and not yet profitable, growth companies, this makes it more financially challenging to operate. It also pushes them toward profitability and cost cutting, but this may not be viable for more growth-oriented business models.",

I think the reason why so many people latch on to it here is because it's a simple explanation where there's literally a number assigned to it. It's an easy way for people to hope: \"If only the interest rate goes down, market goes up!!\" But I think it's much more complex than just the interest rate number.\n\nFirst, I think companies are just trying to do more with less. I think this is a big cultural shift in tech that they need to be more efficient in terms of human capital and talent. I think this is here to stay. After all, it's in the culture of tech to want to optimize, streamline and efficientize everything. So we are seeing this play out in the workforce.\n\nSecond, economic uncertainty (and interest rates!) is making companies invest less new projects that might not have immediate payoff, except for AI, which is supposed to automate a lot of stuff and save them costs in the long run.\n\nThird, AI. A lot of basic work can be done pretty easily with AI now and it saves so much time that would have typically required a junior-level worker. Aggregate all these little tasks that are able to get done fast and quick, and there's just less need for junior-level workers. I think AI is overplayed by AI companies and the general public, but I think on this subreddit, it's quite downplayed. I think too many people here are in denial tbh because to admit it means something very uncomfortable for them. AI is not fully replacing people anytime soon. But I think it can make many people quite efficient and productive across an entire company that there's less need for more workers to do the same amount of work. The US still has people working in manufacturing, but there's just much less workforce required to get the same output.",

He probably doesn't think about how much people like him or dislikes him, not because he doesn't care but because he hasn't thought about it, he is there to work. Make no mistake he has feelings and is sensitive to being hurt, that said, I did socialize in a small circle but I didn't waste time either.\n\nI was protected at times, especially in one job but they didn't change the expectations of everyone else, no. Instead I was looked at as a leader following a company mandate ( saving money ahead of downsizing - in 2015). Other guys asked me what they thought they should be doing instead. I had no idea and I wasn't ready to be a manager of others.\n\nLooking back, your manager needs to put aside through put to a degree whilst also acknowledging that maybe you don't want that person to work, maybe like I did all the time, they may regret not taking it a little slower and not enjoying the role more. And if they at all care about the person, they unilaterally should and it should be a concern discreetly shared to his peers, like you.\n\n\nAs for letting him fail, I'm not surprised it being stated but still feel awful hearing other people say that and probably did about me. There's better ways and conversations then to just let someone drop and if I'm honest, you've probably got no idea if you're really testing him in the role. What I mean is, this may not be a strain for him or even considered work. This might be a passion and something they take a great deal of pride in and not even work but is paid to be. \n\nYou have every right to raise a concern though and your manager needs to look at the person aspect. You all do but do it with them in mind as well as yourselves, maybe with their skills, they can learn to articulate them and go towards the team. \n\nIt might be sensible to expect that the standard of work will improve and that doesn't have to be a bad thing (doesn't necessitate 'harder'). \n\nHope that's helpful.",

That was the whole point of the layoffs. If all these big tech companies lay off employees at the same time, the hiring pool is suddenly filled with lots of talented employees. All of these employees need jobs and are competing with each other. In order to get employed again, some of these employees will take big pay cuts. So the companies are able to hire new staff at the same or similar level of talent for a reduced cost.\n\nThat obviously won't work forever. And once the economy improves some of these employees will jump ship. But it's what these companies have decided to do in the short term.",

Every year people are being paid less. \n\nIt’s a slow process because if they don’t pay good employees enough they jump ship to a competing company which is why today in a lot of white collar roles in the US it’s common to work 24 months at a company then switch. Larger companies like FAANG have attempted to address this through vesting. You don’t get fully paid unless you’re there for 4 years. On year 4 you’re getting paid for your first year of work. Leaving is like losing 4 years of half of your pay. \n\nIn Europe wages are lower in part because people are far less likely to jump ship due to pay so they can just low ball everyone from the get go. Within the next 20 years it wouldn’t surprise me if in the US pay is closer to what Europeans are making but without the benefits.",

But what makes you think anything would be different if you pivot to an entirely different career path? You're not going to be safe from getting fired or laid off if you jump into something like sales. You're not going to get any better growth opportunities than you do here.\n\nI read your other comment where you described what led to the issues with your past 2 jobs... what immediately jumps out at me is you're working at startups, or at least small enough companies where you're interacting directly with the founder, and the CTO. Startup environments like that are chaotic, and can be very exhausting, and aren't good fits for *most* people. I think you might be burnt out on startup culture, not the industry itself.\n\nInstead of abandoning your career entirely, have you considered looking for a more traditional job at a large company? Where you could work on a normal team, doing normal things, with normal expectations, where you aren't in a fast-paced high expectation environment where the founder or CTO aren't talking to you directly and are many, many layers removed from you and the work you do? Working a job like that will be like night and day from a startup.\n\nIf you're truly no longer interested in the work, then by all means pivot. I'm just worried that you're thinking a pivot is going to be a magic cure that fixes all your problems. The grass is always greener and all that. I think changing the type of company you work for would be a much smaller and easier to achieve change that could be refreshing for you. You don't need to immediately jump to the nuclear option when there's still smaller changes you can make that could make a major difference.",

A mediocre performance on a very supportive team will likely be better than a stellar performance on a highly dysfunctional team. \n\nI think you should as a minimum try to find: \n\n* A manager who's been with a team for multiple halves\n* At least one IC6+ who works around you (if not associated with your work), also multiple halves on the team\n* Ideally, clear scope and some sort of vision for the team. \n\nThere's a lot of subjective opinions, but I think these are generally agreeable things that are worth prioritizing. It's relatively common to have weak support (either by a manager carousel or lack of E6+ sponsors) that can block your promo - ask me how I know lol. \n\nMore subjectively, I think it's worth finding a team that you trust in their feedback (there are some people who are 10x more critical than average), and if you care about timelines, a staggering of levels (if there's like 8 E3s, it might take longer for your promotion to come through). \n\nAs an aside - I think performance will be much more about stakeholders talking about how great you are / other people in PSC, and objective metrics are somewhat secondary, esp for E3->E4.",

They might not want to/cant give you opportunities to check off those requirements.\n\nImpact is also important. Theres an idea in big tech where you need to make impact, which means “what can i do to make something easier for another engineer”. Its not always “i have to work on the newest feature”(although ig is alway making then removing features lol), it could be related to fixing something for On-Call, etc. You just need to optimize some part of the job to “make life easier”.\n\nThe only thing you need is to adapt and meet these requirement, but the hard part is if your team is going to even let you/give you the opportunity. After 6-8months I would bring it up with your manager that you would like to start the process for promotion and just try for it.",

        "body": "Approximately 1/50 application to interviews is pretty good in the current market. \n\nMy advice would be to try to figure out what went wrong in the three interviews you did get, and work on fixing that in addition to applying. Because if you can fix that, you just need 1-2 more shots and you're good! \n\nAssuming you posted your resume to solicit feedback, here's a huge text wall of resume advice you can take or leave: \n\nAs another user suggested, you might want a different template. I linked one at the bottom. I'm not sure if your template is the issue, but it doesn't hurt to try something different and test results, you can always circle back to what you have now.   \n  \nI'd also include a projects section, put your 2-3 most impressive school projects with some jazzed up bullet points (you can get an llm to help you with jazzing them up) and work on a project yourself using industry tools in the space you want to work in. Using and mentioning industry tools in projects is a great way to get through ATS assuming it's checking for keywords (for example \"Docker\", \"React\" and \"Java\").   \n  \nHere's an example of what I mean by a personal project, say you want to work with python full stack? Make and deploy a django app or something. Link the frontend on your resume, maybe the github too. What kind of app? I don't know. It doesn't have to be crazy, but try to use docker, a common database, maybe make the frontend with react that's popular af. If you can't get actual work experience in a company, try to get a bit of experience doing a project. You don't have to use industry tools to make a toy project, but doing so gives you a little practice and exposure to them which is what's valuable, and can help you get through ATS.  \n\nMaybe even better than a personal project would be if you could contribute to an open source project and put that on your resume under the projects section. TLDR get a projects section and have your 3-4 most impressive projects on there until you get enough work experience to de-prioritize them. \n\nI'd shorten the skills section up to make room for the projects, mine is only two lines, languages and frameworks. I had an interview where the person was like, ok i'm going to list stuff from your skills section, you tell me on a scale of 1 to 10 how good you are with it, then proceeded to ask me corresponding difficulty questions about that skill/language/framework. After that, I trimmed my skills section up to stuff i'm at least a 4/10 confident in and it hasn't had a negative impact on my response rate.\n\nI'd consider putting one or two of those summer jobs back, you could put them under \"additional experience\" section at the bottom or something, just one liners very brief, if you give a description I think that describing teamwork and communication would help the most. \n\nFor a template that has additional work experience I think the \"additional expereince\" template in this google doc from Codepath would be a good start (make a copy don't request edit access).   \n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TDGkSD5l--GjKu56jw6frHmjr075QHbr\\_wfma\\_gmv8s/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gjdgxs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TDGkSD5l--GjKu56jw6frHmjr075QHbr_wfma_gmv8s/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gjdgxs)\n\nYou might want to consider making tailored resumes for different roles like swe, data analyst, etc where you put the popular keywords in. For example in your data analyst resume put a data project you did in there that uses powerBI or something at the top of the projects list, maybe change the skills up to include numpy pandas excel and tableau. \n\nAnyways, good luck. I'm curious from a scientific perspective if your response rate will improve after tweaking your resume. If you do change it up, you'll have to let me know if it made a difference.",

        "body": "One very important thing to keep in mind is that the markets from 2010-2022 were not all the same. We can't just give a single description/anecdote to describe that entire period.\n\n2010 for example was the recovery period from the Great Recession. Hiring was picking up compared to 2008-2009, but it was still slow and cautious. Companies were not hiring with confidence.\n\n2021 for example was the golden era of SWE. Companies were massively over hiring, the demand for SWE drastically outpaced the supply of CS grads, and that single-handedly created an entirely new sub-market of bootcampers and self-teachers. People already in the industry were job hopping and getting insane 100% raises,.\n\nThat said, in my experience, good market or bad market, thing's aren't all that different. I still do the same interview prep, there's still the same kinds of startups/companies hiring, the expectation of this industry is still that you have a CS degree, etc. The difference I notice between a normal market (2011-2018-ish) and a bad market (2023+) is that the response rate is much lower. You need more applications to get responses. When I was applying for jobs in 2016 I did 10 applications total. When I was applying for jobs in 2021, I did 11 applications total. When I was applying for jobs in 2024, I did 82 applications total. I didn't feel like there was any difference in the process itself between those markets, once I got a company to actually interview me, the process was the same\n\nFor your second note, I think the insane over-hiring of 2021 is what ruined todays market. Not AI. We're still recovering from that overhiring. A lot of people that wouldn't have had a chance of being hired in a normal market broke into the industry in 2021, and the industry is trying to self-correct. It's a slow, and painful process.\n\nAI is a valuable tool for SWE's. Some companies are buying into the hype, and might try to reduce headcount as a result, but it's still just hype. There's always some sexy new hyped up thing in the industry that companies try to chase, and might make them increase/reduce headcount. AI is no different. A company that laid off a bunch of employees because of AI-hype might be desperate to hire a ton more employees a year from now to fix all the shit that the vibe coders did.",

Things are just so different now. \n\nAI is an excuse for layoffs, not the root cause. A moderately skilled engineer still does a better job than AI tools. Often because you have to know what is actually a good solution and how to prompt your way to it. It’s easy to see it do tricks and get excited, but it’s not replacing real experience for a while. Many big businesses are messy, hesitant for countless reasons, or existing code just too complicated for it to work right now. Can’t say that will be true forever. \n\nThe economy, at least in the US, depends on consumers consuming and a top fraction exploiting everyone else’s labor. Billionaires are living proof that there is no end - there is seemingly not limit so the cycle continues. Probably until enough people have nothing to lose and revolt.

In practice, it means that the law says an employer has to post a job ad for a role that had already been filled and ramped up a year+ earlier.\n\nThe undertone of these kinds of exposes seem to be that some cohorts are more \"deserving of the opportunity conferred by the law\", but arguably the immigration lawyers involved are actually going by the spirit of the law (even if it may technically be malicious compliance) when they ask the H-1B worker to provide job descriptions with excruciatingly high level of detail to construct these job posts. It is already hard enough to get candidates to match nice-to-haves in a regular job post, so who else can check every checkmark in a huge and highly specific list other than the person that is already doing the function, and with zero ramp up time, to boot? Or so the rationale goes.\n\nOne could argue that labor market assessment ought to be done upfront, and it actually is in some countries, notably the LMIA in Canada, but as Canadians might attest, that's not necessarily successful in practice either.\n\nPersonally I'm pretty cynical about political reform in general. \"Don't ask what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country\", as Kennedy famously said, if nothing else because the political machine doesn't really have your personal interest at heart in the first place.",

It's going to take a bit of time to read, to process the noise, to think of a solution and it takes time to write the code for question 1 and by the time you finished writing the code for q1, you are met with a bug. Then by the time you solved the bug, you now only have 10-20 minutes left to work on question 2. There is no time left to work on q2, especially when both qs are leetcode hard. Not sure if that's very reflective of the industry, at least in the internship I did, it wasn't like \"you must solve this in X minutes, otherwise we are all doomed\".\n\nThe other thing I don't like about leetcode questions being used for assessments is that we can't use debugging tools. I use my IDE to debug my code, to understand where my logic is wrong, to better understand my thought process and to fix them accordingly. This is also what happens in the industry but I can't use them. And so I am left staring into the screen trying to understand what I am doing wrong, I am trying to guess where I fked up. Sometimes print statements are not helpful because you don't know where you are going wrong and it's not effective/efficient. It all takes time.\n\nIt's like they are looking for robots/AI who can process everything in seconds and write up a solution in minutes. It's like they are not looking for humans.\n\nTo solve these questions, you need to have tons and tons of of leetcode practice. It's why I tell everyone to start DSAs asap, and to start leetcoding asap. It's the only way to match a robot/AI when it comes to big tech leetcode questions.",

I was a bit worried when starting the search due to the doomer posts on this sub, but it honestly hasn’t been that bad. I admit I’m in a decent position due to a well-known but not FAANG company on my resume (as a previous role, not current role), name brand school, and yoe. \n\nI dropped to about 50 jobs on LinkedIn and other job boards, heard back from 8+ decent companies (like companies you might recognize, not just no name startups). Hit rate is much better for recruiters who reached out to me via LinkedIn or email. I honestly had to stop responding back after the first week of showing “open to job opportunities” on LinkedIn because of the overwhelming amount of messages for various startup roles, mostly AI. Went through the process for about 20 companies so far, rejected by 15, with the rest still ongoing but probably not able to finish before the offer deadline.\n\nBehavioral questions and hiring manager rounds I think are a cakewalk, just prepare your stories ahead of time. Hardest part is grinding leetcode questions to shake the rust off implementing DFS, binary search, etc. Feels like school again. System Design is okay. Can be challenging sometimes, but I feel like it’s easier to fall back on work experience with this and supplement with some studying. As opposed to coding questions which doesn’t have as much overlap with real work, and it feels like you just need to study solutions to a lot of different questions and practice.\n\nI don’t doubt that the market is grim out there for new grads or early in career folks, and certainly worse than a few years ago for senior folks. But at least from my limited pov, it’s still okay. When I get rejected, it’s still mostly because I fucked up a coding question. And there's definitely no shortage of AI startups trying to hire senior engineers.",

Generally, what tends to work is talking through the individual manual steps id be doing to implement the task. So like if someone said \"why cant you just add X\", then I could say \"sure, I could, but the out of the box library doesn't do that. So first I'll have to find a different library thats closer to what you need, which means upgrading the server stack, then I'll have to spend a couple of days testing to make sure the new library doesnt break your existing functionality, then finally I'll be able to code the changes you want, that'll take a day or so, and then I can test.\" \n\n\nThe more specific and granular you make your step by step explanation, the easier it is for them to understand the level of effort involved.",

If something isn't literally on fire, you probably don't need to drop everything else to do it today. Normally you agree on milestones and delivery deadlines upfront, or at least in advance.\n\nSecond is deconstructing delivery timelines based on whether it's due to technical complexity or due to scheduling. The former presumably means you've done some due diligence before estimating, and you should be able to articulate what the time consuming parts are with some degree of granularity, and their respective estimates. The latter is about what prior commitments you already have, and you have to decide how negotiable it is to make changes. Maybe you can deliver things faster by dropping/negotiating other things that have lower priorities or charging premium to work overtime or hiring a subcontractor, maybe not. If you can't, then be transparent about having other commitments. In other words, urgency is a feature, and you can charge money for it.\n\nIf it's a question of perception, you could try to explain via analogies, e.g. in law movies everything happens very quickly, often within the same day, whereas in reality, they drag on for months/years because in the real world things just take time. Same thing here.",

What's so difficult about it?\" are asking those questions because what they *really* want to know is When will it be complete? So your response to these questions should be a date you'll have that feature complete. Once you give a deadline, you'll get many fewer of these questions and if you do, just refer them to the aforementioned date.\n\nThe other part of this is just that non-technical people just don't know how hard things are. They've been taught, through drag-and-drop website builders and, sadly, AI-marketing, that things are easy. A new form should take an hour to add, right?? It can also be helpful to explain, as part of the communication providing them with the estimated timeline, what goes into the feature you're building. If they ask for a button to send a report to their email, for example, you can explain that part of your work means preventing security issues, handling permissions, formatting the report, testing it, making sure the email doesn't go to spam, etc etc.\n\nAs for the full-time job part, if they knew you had a full time job when they contracted with you, you can remind them of that, but I honestly think that's unnecessary to include. Just focus on giving them the timeline and they'll back off. It's not coming from a place of malice for them; they're just feeling in the dark probably.",

When I first started, I was told \"Go build an integration between our product and X CRM\" and that was about as much interaction as I got.\n\nSame thing where everything is always urgent, everything is always broken, everyone always needs something from you CONSTANTLY. I think that's unfortunately pretty common in SWE, but even more so at a startup.\n\nMy advice would be first, to stop caring so much, and second, keep looking for new opportunities with a healthier company. I'm not saying give up, or slack off, but I am saying that you should understand and accept that you will always have work to do and tickets to complete, and if you put forth your best effort and don't get all of those tickets done, it's not a reflection of you or your productivity, it's a result of poor management and unrealistic expectations.\n\nWhen I first started, I felt like I had to grind late nights and weekends so that I could meet the needs of every customer, and I would often work 60+ hours a week just to push a project past the finish line. Time and time again, I would put in all of this extra work and a few weeks down the road, the customer would churn for a reason unrelated to my work and then suddenly all of those extra hours were for nothing.\n\nNobody else cares about your mental health as much as you do, so you need to learn to set boundaries to protect your mental.\n\nI adopted the mantra \"Not my circus, not my monkeys\" lol. At the end of the day, if this company lives or dies, your life will ultimately be the same. Don't let it consume your life or your mental health, because one day you will find that it was all for nothing. My only other coworker in my department was just like me -- he stressed out about customers after hours and worked extra, and guess what? One day they decided he was too expensive and they canned him. All of those late nights and extra hours for nothing.\n\nPut forth your best effort during the work day and try to leave the stress in the office. If work is unfinished, it's unfinished, but it's not your problem because you already did as much as you reasonably should.\n\nI could go on and on, but my point is, *while you're looking for another job,* try to at least make this one more tolerable in the meantime by learning reasonable ways to protect your mental health. If you get punished for that in any way, let it roll off your shoulder knowing you're gonna leave the toxic environment as soon as you can anyway.",

Wait until you find out how little support you'll get at the average FAANG.\n\nWhat have you tried so far? Have you tried sending PRs to add/improve docs whenever you do finally figure something out? Have you talked to the other engineers about this?\n\n> Unrealistic expectations\n\nThat's literally every company. It's your job to push back and manage expectations.\n\nIt's very easy at your level. You just \"yes and\" everything. Examples:\n\n  - \"Sure, I can definitely do that. It will take N days instead of the 2 you've suggested, though, because <brief technical reason that's more detailed than anything they could debate>.\"\n\n  - \"Yes, I can prioritize this, but I'll have to put aside the other tickets on Foo and Bar, which will delay those by 42 days.\"\n\n  - And so on. You get the idea.\n\n> Long commute: have a 3 hour daily commute (1.5 hours each way).\n\nThis is pretty common in major cities for serious tech jobs. Lots of people start with this and then work their way up to a better situation.\n\nMy roughest commute back in the day was a drive to the train station (which had to be ass-early to get there in time to get parking), a train ride, and then a 1 mile walk from the train to the office. Then, in the evening, I'd do the whole thing in reverse. I dealt with it 5 days a week for a year, then got a better job. C'est la vie.\n\nI recommend a nice pair of noise-canceling headphones and a playlist of your favorite podcasts. It's temporary, and you'll have a better job with a better commute sooner or later, but in the meantime there's no need to suffer unnecessarily. Use the time to decompress or study, and be glad the noise-canceling headphones are way better these days than 10 years ago.",

Previous employer responds with yes, or no, and practically nothing else for liability reasons\n3. Prospective employer says thanks, hangs up the phone\n\nAnd if your title/tenure doesn’t at least kinda match what is in your previous employer’s ERP, you have introduced a new line of questioning for your prospective employer.\n\nIn so far as job seeking is concerned, nothing title-wise really matters outside of very large tech companies with well understood levels. The sort of stuff you see on levels.fyi. What you actually did in the role, and how it’s represented on a CV/resume, is the more important thing.\n\nYou can certainly lie about what you did, and be reasonably confident those lies aren’t surfaced as part of a routine background check. Most people are terrible liars, and worse liars in the context of a job interview.\n\nIf you care about whether you’re growing appropriately, focus on engineering management and staff+ roles.

Should be able to handle medium sized, week long tasks with just a Q&A session for clarification. I’d say this can go from about 3 years to around 7 depending on the person.\n\nSenior: Should know the system and tech stack (assuming they aren’t new to the team) well enough to discuss architecture with others as well as give input on a wide range of things with the code base. Should need very little guidance outside of larger tasks, even then it’ll likely fall more into a requirements clarification discussion like “Should this button open a dialog with an are you sure prompt, or simply bounce them back to another page?” than an actual “I need help with this”.

        "body": "Here's some actually helpful advice:\n\n1. Make maintaining good work/life balance an explicit goal. If you budget your time like you have 60 hours a week, you will be working 60 hours a week. Most people find 45-50 hours a week with short bursts above that sustainable, and I think that's a good place to target. You will be be pressured to work more; be ready to gracefully wiggle out of it.\n\n2. Whenever you ask someone for a piece of information (\"what is X?\", \"how do I do Y?\"), also find out how they know/obtained that information. Getting questions answered is good (and you should ask a lot of questions), but you should also be learning how to find answers yourself.\n\n3. Underpromise and overdeliver. You should describe every single task task you complete as both absolutely amazing and the product of tons of hard work.\n\n4. Optimize your commute. If you spend an hour sitting in the car each way, that's equivalent to working an extra 10 hours a week. Live close to work, work from home, or go in early and leave early to beat traffic. I usually listen to a podcast on the way in and call out of state family on the way home, much better than feeling your brain bleed out your ears as you sit in traffic.\n\n5. Be *very* careful when it comes to agreeing to take responsibility for something. Once you take responsibility for a project or feature you become the person on the hook for it, and if/when things go poorly you're going to be working 80 hour weeks while out of your mind. You need to be strategic, you need to advocate for yourself, and you need to resist peer pressure.\n\n6. If you're on a team of workaholics, just lie. Work 45 hours a week and tell people you're working 60.",

So there are definitely companies willing to give older people a go.\n\nThe disability could be another issue. I don't agree with it at all, but sadly remote work is being more and more rare with at least 3+ days in the office being the norm here.

The piece of paper you get at the end is one thing, but what's more important are the general skills that you can learn from pursuing a college degree: time management on a progressively longer scale, learning independently, collaborating with other people.  Of course, these may be skills you have picked up from elsewhere, but if they are not (or if not to the level you would like), then this is an excellent opportunity to pick them up.  Note that these are not necessarily things that happen automatically, though; graduation requirements get you the piece of paper, but how you spend your time engaging with your coursework determines what skills you'll actually get out of your degree.  This is especially true if you're able to go full time and not worry about work during that time, because otherwise you will rarely have the time and energy to spend as you like on thinking and learning as you will during those 4 years.\n\nOn majoring in CS: choosing CS because you \"like math and computers\" is a much better rationale than choosing it because of the job market, and part of why there are a lot of people complaining about the job market now is because a lot of people entered this field only because of the second reason back when the market was good.  This of course does not guarantee you a job, but it does mean you're more likely to engage more deeply with the material in the degree, which means you will get more out of the degree one way or another.  That said, do you know whether the program will allow you to switch majors?  While you shouldn't switch out just because some class is harder than expected, if you discover that CS is really not for you, having the option to switch into something that better matches with your interests will make starting the program feel less constraining.\n\nOn getting a job after: Let's be honest, no one actually knows what the job market will look like 4 years from now.  Will it be challenging, especially with your nontraditional background?  Probably.  But would it be so bad that you would regret even \\*trying\\* in the first place?  Some people on this sub may say so, but that outlook has a nasty habit of becoming self-fulfilling.",

If you're picking CS because of remote work, you're mostly wasting your time unless you've been lucky with lottery tickets because remote job is the dream job.  Most roles require in-person nowadays.  \n\nDon't get fooled by the cheap or free tuition from the state if the bargain requires majoring in something CS or IT related.

Check out CS50 for a formal introduction, I've heard it's a bit difficult but it's a great intro to programming and CS fundamentals. The Odin Project is a great starter resource if you're into / want to try web development. \n\nIf you choose the school route, go to a community college first to save some money, then transfer to a state school. See if you qualify for any grants. If not, check out scholarships. \n\nRegardless of your decision, I don't think you should base it solely off of the opinions of people from the internet. Not saying you are, but I just wanted to make note. Do your own research, make a plan (budget, time, courseload) and look into possible programs. \n\nDo you have any connections in the industry? Even a connection in something software-adjacent, like IT, would be valuable. Any sort of connection would help. Even a help desk job, or some IT position on campus would be great, assuming it makes financial sense for you. \n\nSign up for CS50 or start The Odin Project to see if you enjoy this stuff. I can't speak for CS50, but the actual CS degree would be different from The Odin Project. The common ground is problem-solving. Just see if you enjoy the actual problem-solving process, whether it's practical or theoretical.\n\nBest of luck!",

They'd interview as many people as they could and hire everyone who passed, rather than the usual case of some \"passing\" the interviews but still not getting selected over even stronger candidates.\n\nOverall tech companies are still growing and hiring.\n\nI'm seeing a trend to hire more in LCOL areas and countries - not outsourcing, but actually opening offices in other cities and countries.\n\nAnother issue is that the number of CS grads has doubled in the last 10 years and is still rising. It's quite possible that the number of CS grads is going up faster than demand, so the issue isn't that hiring is down (in historic numbers), but rather that demand has grown faster than supply.",

You may also have to do something similar in a salaried position, but it's usually mostly for PTO tracking purposes unless you are doing agency/consulting work for multiple clients or business verticals.\n\nMost places in the US are expecting at least 40 hours of time a week. Most aren't sticklers about it, but some places (especially micromanage-y or \"productivity focused\") can get really in the weeds about how you're spending your time \"on the clock\", even if you're salary.\n\nExpect to have \"core hours\" for your day when you're reachable. These are generally around 10am-4pm local time, but you're often expected to work at least 9am-5pm/6pm daily. Many places will also expect you to set up chat/email on your phone so you can reply to random messages managers send when they're anxiety working on the weekends, feel free to ***not*** do that though, setting boundaries early is a good thing.",

You want to get to know your co-workers because you want to be able to work with senior/principal engineers. The jrs who have a good upper level engineer on their side are usually the ones who succeed. It's hard to create the connection online because everybody is so busy and if they arent they arent trying to have DM chats with their co-workers. \n\nAlso you never have that transition so it is very easy to work 10+ hours without realizing it. Becuase yo uarent sure if others have left or not and sometimes doing an extra 30 minutes because you can and are waiting for something to finish building is easy to do with your laptop in the other room. \n\nAgain all this is job and team dependent. I will let you know that one thing that is never really said when you are in college is that many of these jobs are not really 9-5. Salary means you work to get the job done wheher it took you 20 hours or 60. Sometimes it's even a game you have to do.

The tech stack, the team, what your role will consist of, what the expecations of you will be, what an average day of a SWE looks like, what kinds of major projects are coming in the future, etc should *not be a surprise*. These are all things you should be asking about in the reverse interview.\n\nNext time you job hop, make it a point to reverse interview. Otherwise you're literally just rolling the dice that you'll end up at another place that you thought would be doing X, but is actualy doing Y. You need to be the one rejecting companies you don't want to work for.\n\nThat being said, I don't think your situation is that bad. Firstly, *you got a job*. In 2023, as a new grad. That's a win, regardless of the stack you're using.\n\nAlso, especially this early in your career, companies won't necessarily require an exact 1-1 match of their tech stack expectations. You know Java. That's big. You can learn Spring on the side, or even on the job, it's not that hard. Just because you haven't worked professionally with Spring doesn't mean you're unqualified for Java/Spring positions.\n\nAnecdotally, I've switched stacks completely many times. Companies aren't DQ'ing me because I have no experience in their stack. They know I can learn on the job, and my resume paints that picture. One company I was talking to used Java/Micronaut, which was a completely new concept for me. That interested me, I had some great conversations about it with my interviewers, its pros/cons compared to Spring, etc. I got an offer. My confidence, and my interest in learning the new tech, made up for lack of experience in a core technology that company used. You can do the same, swapping out Spring/Micronaut with GWT/Spring.\n\nAll that said, right now you're disqualifying youself without even trying. You've made this whole post freaking out about starting to find jobs... *but you haven't started lookign for a job*. You have no idea how it's going to go for you. Make sure your resume is on point, get rid of the negative thinking and start oozing confidence because you're an intelligent SWE that can pick new things up easily. Companies will see that. My confidence, warranted or not, is what gets me my jobs offers.",

How are they staying within the country?\n\nSome of them end up leaving. There are ways to stay, but for a lot of those people they need a legitimate job that pays legitimate money, and if they can't get that, then they end up having to leave because of not only immigration status but also finances.\n\n>Also, could this hiring freeze combined with the layoffs be intentional to make the foreigners leave the country without overstaying illegally on an expired visa? Basically slowing down hiring for 90 days until the foreigners on visa have to self deport?\n\nHiring freezes and layoffs are company-driven decisions. Those companies have no incentive to drive foreign workers out of the country - that would just make the cost of labor for them go up. Most companies want foreign workers to be available.\n\nSo this makes no sense. Companies are doing layoffs because layoffs = higher profits, and that has always been true.\n\n>If people on those visas do an unpaid internship, for example, can they stay in the country until they find a real paying job, even if it takes more than 90 days to find the job since they're not unemployed technically while doing an unpaid internship?\n\nYes. As long as it's a valid unpaid internship - i.e., an internship that is consistent with their field of study/profession. Like, on OPT you can't go get an unpaid job as a janitor and have it count. But you can, for example, work as an unpaid researcher for your former grad program (I've seen this done several times).\n\nAgain, the problem with that strategy is that you need to then have the finances to float you until you do find a job, which isn't something everyone can do. And in a lot of cases, if you get to that stage, a lot of people end up preferring to just go back to their home country and not have to deal with that situation.",

Be comfortable with saying \"okay, I don't know how that works properly... for now\". For now, just take a deep breath, every senior you respect has been where you are today. \n     \nHere are some tips to make your life easier:\n\n1. Keep your world small. The route you already did with your mentor is the GOLD right now. You have 2 possible small ways you can expand your world. A) implement the rest of the routes for the project that you are working on right now, B) implement the same route across other projects.  -  It is probably easier to implement the other routes.     \n2. When working on this type of thing, you will be slow initially, it might take you 2 weeks to get through 2 routes initially, but by the last week of the summer you might complete a route per day. In order to move quickly, you are going to have to move slowly and intentionally. Things like Gradle / DI / those other internal tools and random config files on first blush don't sound super relevant to the task at hand, only learn how to use it if it is going to progress your goal. If you are going to *not* learn it on purpose, write it down and square it away for later.     \n3. Ask for feedback often, your mentor may be able to tell you what route would be the next simplest to tackle.    \n4. Don't be afraid to look at pull requests where any specific route was implemented. Often times, complete feature pull requests give you a really good idea of just how \"Small\" your world can be when you want it to, if you find some good ones.     \n5. If you are stuck on a particular thing for more than an hour, ask - just ask, ask your mentor or something else, \"Hey <name>, do you have 5 minutes to explain something to me? I am trying to understand why when I remove the mock here this other test unexpectedly breaks - I Think you mentioned this during our call <initially | yesterday | on thursday>, but I think I just need a quick refresher - would super appreciate it!\"\n     \nJust take it a day at a time, recognise that feeling like you don't know stuff is normal, panicking will not help you and it will detract from your ability to learn. You are also wrong about one thing, the ability to \"remember\" context is not key for success at larger companies, the actual key is realising what context does and does not matter. No one on your team knows everything, they're just capable of figuring out what bits are important enough to learn *today* to progress them towards whatever goal they're working on.      \n      \nLate July is a also a fairly reasonable goal for the task you were given, without knowing the specifics of the codebase. You'll be fine, just keep your head down, stick to it, and remember, keep your world small!",

Make a new database with the UI and do CRUD operations. Can get up to speed in 1 day. Oracle isn't nearly as common as it used to be and MySQL is the cheapskate version of Oracle. MSSQL is good though.\n* **Learn one of AWS, Azure, GCP**. I used to think no one used GCP but I saw one company switch to it because it's cheaper. Recruiters were always cool with me only knowing 1 of the 3 since the others are easy to learn at that point. Using on the job goes a long way, else get an entry level cert that you see listed in a few job applications. The only cert that not a scam for this reason but it is crazy expensive. Thus your employer pays. Probably need a book or course and the exam has extra cheating detection.\n* **Learn one of Docker or Kubernetes**. You can learn both but there's some overlap. Pick what you see more in job descriptions. I guess Kubernetes and that's what I've seen more as well.\n* Microservices, yeah this is on the job experience. You can't teach yourself, or you can, but it won't matter to a recruiter.\n* Less important: Compliment Java with another language. Could be Python, Kotlin, Go aka Golang or TypeScript/JavaScript with your choice of React or Angular. Actually is important but if not used on the job, it ranks here.\n* Less important: Use Jetty with Spring Boot, preferably now on the job for local testing. I haven't used Tomcat on the job in 10 years. Cloud crap is taking over but local servers is a nice plus and they don't use cloud data. Bonus: Mock a database with JUnit + Mockito or PowerMock or whatever. You should know JUnit.",

But in 2025, that probably won’t lead to a pathway into a more technical role, since most data science and ML roles are looking for either loads of experience or advanced education. \n\nSo yeah, I think an advanced degree would 100% be beneficial to your candidacy at companies. In person and hybrid more so than online, since you’ll be able to network better. \n\nWhat’s the offer from the school, how expensive are we talking?

Most people in the field have a degree, and it puts you on a level playing field.\n\nNot having the degree is going to close doors -- there's no way around it. That doesn't mean that there are no open doors for you, but it's going to limit you. Particularly if you ever think you might want to work in another country, your visa may hinge entirely on having a CS degree.\n\nWhen changing careers to software engineering, I went and did exactly what you are considering and got a Masters in CS. I have never even once had regrets, and many of the opportunities I've had wouldn't have been possible without it. If you have the time, and can afford the expense (I received a partial scholarship), I cannot recommend it enough.\n\nAdditionally, considering the current job market, it is so competitive for new grads right now that I don't think companies are taking risks on giving someone their first CS job with no work history and no degree. At this particular moment in time, I think it would be incredibly difficult to get your first job in the industry unless you already have personal connections to do so (getting the first job without a degree and proving yourself is the biggest hurdle) or are prepared to work for absolutely abysmal pay or conditions (which may have lifelong career repercussions -- people will probably know exactly how your previous employer paid you and treated you, and it can be a struggle for your wages to catch up even as you move to better and better companies). Getting the degree also gives time for the current job market to possibly improve, though I don't know I'd put money on it getting better so that's neither here nor there.",

Jumping tracks will be difficult to near impossible without some sort of inflection (like getting a graduate degree from a top institution). \n\nThis is already how it works in other fields like law and finance.

The cheat detection tools will likely get more sophisticated too. \n\nIn person interviews might make a comeback. This has been said but they companies might start trending toward getting people on site for technicals.\n\nMove away from leetcode to open-ended technical questions. I have had just as many of these as leetcode style interviews, or at least some marriage of the two.\n\nPair programming. This is still probably one of the common ways to do a technical. My current job was gained through a pair programming exercise.

When I told my GF (we live together) she looks at me and says \"OMG we will be able to buy so much for our house\".I dont want her to sound like she is money craved, it's more like she is a spend-mentality where i am save mentality. My mindset is I will live the same regardless of how much money I make (to a certain degree) and just save the rest and hoepfully retire younger. When I heard about the 30% raise my first thought was \"ok I can set about 10% of that to pay off some stuff from when I was unemployed, then when that's down invest that 10%, maybe with another 10% i will put in my savings/invest funds and then the last 10% will be for anything for us\". When she said that I was taken a bcak. My GF is someone who will pay and buy for her own things so I have never felt like she has cared about it. She'll buy me clothes even when I dont ask for it. She makes good money too. She has good money saved but when it comes for future money she hasnt really prepared well for it. She is definetely more of a spender than a buyer. \n\nTo your point about people not wanting to go down. I gave her some tips to help her save more and told her to put maybe a couple hundred bucks per paycheck. She did it and for over a month she was crying about how little her paycheck was now looking. Again this is a girl who makes 6 figures. I think she is around 105k and in a no-income state her take home is probably around 70k.",

It's not a great data source (uncontrolled factors like Indeed itself and changing in recruiting market), but it's a large signal that the overall field is not in a great place!\n\nThe other signal: [https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe\\_sbc.pdf](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe_sbc.pdf) is that unemployment for CS grads is higher than all 25-29 year olds, in a statistically significant way.

I'll have to shift focus away from X in order to do that though, so X won't get done\".\n\nI have 40 hours in a week. My manager/PM is in charge of deciding how I use those 40 hours, they get to choose my priorities, so if they want me to address something immediately, I will. But *I'm* in charge of setting expectations, and enforcing my professional boundaries of a 40 hour work week. So the question goes back to them, they can trade one priority for another. They don't get to tell me \"Everything's gotta get done\", that's just a sign of poor management if they try. Luckily for management though, a lot of SWE's are scared to establish professional boundaries, so they just decide to quietly do everything and inflate their hours beyond 40, which is not sustainable.\n\nWhen unknowns pop up in tickets that I've estimated, I very clearly communicate those things as early as possible. \"X, Y,and Z came up while doing this ticket. We can either make a 2nd ticket to tackle next sprint and close this one out partially complete, or we can include that increased scope as a part of this ticket and it'll carry over\".\n\nIt's all about how you respond. Obviously having completely clean sprints would be great, but that's rarely how things go. When things come up, tickets carry over. It's pretty normal.",

This varied by team, but sometimes someone would act as a point person for the sprint from other teams. I don't recall if this was the same person every sprint, or if two different people played the roles.\n\nPerhaps your manager would be open to tracking the additional work that way. It might also be helpful to track how much time is being spent either not fixing things the right way or poor planning. Some of what you're describing sounds like requirements might be inaccurate, which adds to these issues popping up. \n\nThere could also be an increased culture of testing. There used to be a practice back in the day that whoever broke the build was the new buildmaster until the next person. Or, you can rotate the role. It may give people more appreciation of what they are committing (realistically, there are some people who will never care). But if you go with a per-sprint role, maybe that can be a pointed ticket/story to cover that work. \n\nSounds like your manager might not like those ideas because they just want to push features, but it's worth at least having the discussion. It's real work, and it may help the team find ways to be more efficient in the long-term. \n\nAnother huge advantage of these rotations is spreading knowledge across the team. What happens if you're on vacation, or you're not longer on the team? This helps protect against that. It will also hopefully expand peoples' skillsets. It will help everyone and the team as a whole.",

There was no duplicity on our part, we interviewed these people with full approval, in the belief that we would be hiring a new dev",

So that discrepancy - like, $400-$500K - *that* is really tough to offset.\n\nBut if you're just sacrificing $25K a year, $75K total? That probably is worth getting a PhD.\n\nNow, [as some have commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l3ueaa/comment/mw3rrha/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) if you get your PhD in something ultra-specific, you might actually be limiting your career growth and potential. *But you don't have to*.\n\nA lot of people do their PhD in a relatively broad area of CS, or an area of CS that has applications acrosss industries and areas, and in that world you don't get the same negative impact of specialization.\n\nSo to me, that is important - if you go to do a PhD with a focus on going back to a corporate/industry job instead of staying in academia, then make sure you shape your PhD (research, publications, etc.) to match that. Don't let the incentives of your academic-minded colleagues and advisors (i.e., publications) to take precedence over your priorities (i.e., developing proof of skills that are valuable in the workplace).",

The fact that interviewers kept pushing about certifications despite your detailed technical explanations shows they're following a checklist rather than assessing your actual capabilities.\n\nGetting multiple certifications in a short timeframe isn't a red flag when you already have the underlying experience - it just shows you're adapting to market demands. The reality is that in today's job market, especially in Europe where compliance and formal qualifications carry more weight, having those pieces of paper can open doors that your experience alone might not. It's frustrating and somewhat backwards, but playing the game strategically by getting certified in technologies you already know well is a smart move that demonstrates both your existing skills and your commitment to formal validation.\n\nI'm actually part of the team behind [interview assistant](http://interviews.chat), and we built it specifically to help people navigate these kinds of tricky interview situations where you need to articulate the value of your experience alongside formal credentials.",

Rust is more of a replacement for OOP focused languages like Java while golang is a replacement for scripting languages like Python, and to a point languages like C.  The similarities between them is primarily just how much better they are about memory management than the existing languages.\n\nI’m an SRE and when I was at Apple the dev teams were switching to rust so I started picking up that language (after researching whether I should pick up rust or golang because Python was on its way out).  Then I moved to a fintech company and virtually everything here is in golang so I obviously develop in that now.\n\nAs some other people said, don’t marry yourself to a language.  It’s easier these days to pick up new languages than ever before. That being said the best bet if you’re looking for a language to help you find a new job the best bet is to pick one up you can use in your current job.  Second to that, golang is going to offer you more opportunities.  Rust is going to be a language that you should easily be able to change to other common backend languages like Java if the job requires it (eg: you’re experienced enough to be language agnostic)",
