We have spent decades trying to build deterministic systems that give the right answer every time but effectively we are throwing a probabilistic system on top that will add to the error rate.  Their expectation is that you one shot determine the correct answer every time and that's never going to happen no matter how much you tune  it, add agents or whatever.  The best you can do is reduce the error rate, but that takes some serious work with experienced people, not just something you get out of the box from some crap tool or whatever.\n\nAlso the context of how the LLM got to that answer that it gives is often SQL and that's gibberish to most business users, so they can't even evaluate whether something that \"looks weird\" is actually correct or it's an obvious mistake in the SQL construction.  Personally I think AI is great for tasks in which the user can evaluate the output from their knowledge like doc retrieval with links, coding assist, etc.  But we are not at a point where we can blindly trust answers from AI.\n\nKinda related, we had a call with a company that was offering some kind of vibe coding tool for data engineering.  You feed it a bunch of context and it would build your pipelines with an agentic model (orchestrator/workers from what I could tell).  I asked the question of how it could get to understand your source systems when the documentation is often lacking.  They said the expectation was that you had full documentation for your systems that you could feed to the tool.

You can then, in theory, hook that up to Copilot or some other LLM as the MCP host. There are probably good and bad ways of doing this, but it should in theory be doable. Someone on this sub recently posted that that they had successfully implemented this (I give this sub slightly more credence than LinkedIn lunatics).\n\nTo those concerned about OP feeding private data to public LLMs: enterprise LLM products exist (ChatGPT Enterprise, GitHub Copilot, etc) and they typically have privacy/security guarantees, or so I’m told. This type of setup should only be used with those, obviously. \n\nAll that being said, the most successful use case of such a setup would probably be the data team having more intelligent/aware AI coding assistants, eg using an agent to build you a pipeline that isn’t just guessing at your schemas.

I was planning to write a separate post to address it, but since you brought it up here first, here I am :)\n\nWe really should make a clear distinction between testing **imperative code** (like Python, Java, etc.) and **declarative code** (like SQL). There are some similarities, sure, but the overall intuition is quite different.\n\nProcedural code is much more detailed — it’s built to operate on small units of data or small transactions. You can stop execution at any point, inspect variables, and debug step by step. You have full control over dependencies, can inject mocks, and create true unit tests (It is all very well described by many books and authors).\n\nThat’s basically impossible in SQL-driven projects (which is what I’m talking about in my posts). Here tests are essentially black-box tests you're testing the outcome of a whole query or pipeline as it runs through the SQL engine. There’s no pausing mid-query or stepping through line by line.\n\nHere’s how I see the distinction in SQL-driven projects:\n\n* **Data tests** — I treat these as part of the models itself. Like you said, they run at runtime. I think of them as *assertions* that validate whether the model can handle certain inputs.\n\nIn imperative code, it would look something like this:\n\n    def foo(request):\n        if request is None:\n            raise Exception(\"Request cannot be null\")\n        if not is_request_valid_from_business_perspective(request):\n            raise Exception(\"Request is not valid in this context because of X, Y, Z\")\n    \n        do_actual_processing(request)\n\nThe actual processing code is only meant to work with data that’s already been validated. If the data doesn’t meet the criteria, we terminate early and skip that specific request.\n\nIn SQL-based projects, I see data tests playing the same role. The simple, built-in tests are kind of like basic assertions like `request is None`. More specific, custom tests are closer to the business logic checks, like `is_request_valid_from_business_perspective(request)`.\n\nThe difference is that we place the test on a previous model in relation to the one we're currently building, and we run it against the entire dataset — not just a single piece of data. Unfortunately, if it fails, it can bring down the whole build, unlike in transactional systems where only one transaction would fail.\n\n* **Unit tests** \\- These focus on verifying logic rather than the data itself. The goal is to ensure that a specific block of logic behaves as expected. Support for writing this kind of test is limited (it’s available in dbt, but I don’t find it particularly easy to use). Still, it can be useful for checking that complex conditional logic works correctly or that your regex patterns aren’t doing anything weird.\n* **Diff tests** – These run the whole pipeline with your new changes and compare how the exposures or main models differ between the old and new versions of the code. It’s kind of like an integration test. It’s especially useful for explaining to data consumers what changed and why those changes happened.\n\nThese are all the automated tests I use in analytical projects, and so far, this testing setup has been sufficient for all my needs.\n\nSo, in summary, I agree with the distinction you made. I think about data test in specific way, I am aware that this is a run time concept and use it there.",

It could be directly from a source system, from a curated lake are, data model, or a cleansed area. \n\n\nThe idea is to drive a feedback loop to upstream and downstream systems by engaging data stewards to enact process, behaviour or policy change to drive long term improvements in quality. \n\n\nSometimes it may be possible to directly integrate with these systems to automatically enact change/fixes, but this should always be done with a person to approve. \n\n\nThe point is, what you describe are two different concepts entirely, and are not comparable in any way.

Data engineering is hard - we can’t afford the risk of bringing on too junior people so we want proven experience.\n\nI think my only advice for you is even if you are able to job hop like you seem to be, I think it’s wise to spend your first years of your career building solid skills from solid experiences. And you won’t get those in four months at a place. If I were to look at your resume I would be worried about your intentions if I saw that you had changed jobs three times in a year.",

You’re getting exactly what changed, straight from the DB’s transaction log, with no table locking, no SELECT \\* FROM hell, and no risk of missing updates between batches.\n\nBut just because CDC is real-time doesn’t mean your *pipeline* has to be. For example, at Estuary we separate the extraction from the delivery. So even though we pull changes instantly from the source, we can hold them in our internal buffer (cheap object storage) and forward them downstream however you want, hourly, daily, whatever. That gives you the performance and safety of CDC without forcing a real-time architecture where it’s not needed.\n\nSo yeah, real-time extraction doesn’t mean real-time everything. But CDC at the source is non-negotiable if you care about correctness.It also lets us backfill history or debug weird usage spikes by looking at the full change stream. it's absolutely worth it.",

        "body": "You need to see every state change.\n\nTake a CRM with a customer issue workflow. The issue may bounce between a variety of states through the day, and the CRM doesn't log all of the information related to the state change at the time it was made into a fully comprehensive audit log. This is even a reason why the system might have CDC enabled -- so that this in depth functionality is offloaded from the system.\n\nAlternatively, getting account balance and related details in a banking system on each transaction. Transactions may not log the actual remaining balance at the time, that's just on the account table. You might want analyses on lowest/highest value on account even during the day, or the amount of time spent below a balance level or in arrears.\n\nAll sorts of tables live system back ends may provide better information if all their state changes are logged to a full history table.\n\nYou might not necessarily *need* this now, but I've seen business want to convert to faster update frequencies and/or finer granularity pretty frequently. It is generally not that much more difficult to set up, and once you have the pattern set once it is just repeated for every other table.\n\nDoing it by default makes later development much easier. If it saves the work of just a single person for just one week in an entire year, that could be worth $10k/yr. Is the marginal cost of the full history more than that? Does it save so little development time? What if an ask for finer grained data came in for more tables? What's the lost value of all the data you *didn't* collect?\n\n---\n\nSpeed / latency and flexibility\n\nIf you bring this into a bronze style append-only log table, you have access to all the data essentially immediately. Any use case that could ever use just the latest state information without having to burn down the core database with excessive queries to get it will want to hit this instead. You can be constantly ingesting this data.\n\nYou don't have to integrate it into SCD2 tables constantly though. You could do that daily, or hourly, or every 15 minutes, or skip it on weekends, or do it monthly, or on demand. Because the incoming data is a full change log it doesn't matter how often you run the process, it works the exact same way. It isn't like snapshots where you have to run each snapshot individually and sequentially in order to get the correct behaviour for building a history, and you run into issues when you have to skip a day due to the source system having a planned outage because your DQ checks throw up errors that you're missing a snapshot.\n\n---\n\nEfficiency with actual slow changes\n\nIf only a small proportion of the data is changing over a given snapshot period, then you don't need to be sending the 10x, 100x, 1000x, or 10_000x data volume of the full snapshot just to make the state change (including deletes) calculable. You can get away with sending significantly less data.\n\nIf your integration process to SCD2 or other tables is set up properly, you can also get away with significantly less processing. Only the primary keys in the latest CDC slice will be updated, and only for SCD2 records that are currently active (or end after the CDC slice starts). You can filter the target table for the appropriate date range then semi-join on the primary keys to limit what you're working with. I've had this cut down the amount of data being processed when compared to snapshots by ~95%\n\n---\n\nAutomation and concurrent uses\n\nCDC is useful for all sorts of ways to use a database, and it is a fairly generic feature. Rather than maintaining lots of manual queries to snapshot data and then having to write more scripts to export it and transfer it, some SaaS come with built-in CDC processes where you can direct the data to be emitted to lake storage, or to an event system like Kafka. It may be significantly easier for the ops team for the original database to just enable CDC and point it to somewhere you can access, rather than managing and tweaking an in-house snapshot setup.\n\nIf the CDC is being evented out low latency as it occurs, it could also have multiple consumers. There may be other processes around the business that want to follow along on data level changes to trigger alerts or workflows, so that the business doesn't have to dig into the guts of a SaaS or overload the development team. If they're setting this up anyway, there's no need to then set up another redundant process for another team, they can just pull the CDC like anyone else.\n\n--- \n\nCaveat\n\nIf the data is changing extremely rapidly and outpaces the size of a daily snapshot, then you're probably not really looking at something that's typically usable as an SCD2 table, or at least one where it probably isn't helpful. You can often just have an append-only table for the CDC if all the data are essentially inserts, as would be the case for banking transactions for example. Or you might want to initially ingest into an append-only table, then on a daily run grab the last change per primarty key before midnight to generate a daily snapshot delta.\n\nIn any case, for almost everything you receive, always put it into an append-only table first, then work with it from there. It almost always make later processing easier and more efficient, it really helps with being able to test or scope out changes on real data, and if anything ever goes wrong with the integrated (eg SCD2) data then you've got an essentially immutable copy that you can rerun and restore from.",

        "body": "I think the question is confusing a little unstructured data (image, video, etc.) and unprocessed structured data (raw JSON, raw CSV, etc.). My experience is on structured data, so I will be answering about this.\n\nIn my understanding, the value proposition of the \"lake house\" as opposed to \"data lake + data warehouse\", is to reduce the amount of tools and data pipelines required to get your data from a raw state to a state that your end user can analyze.\n\n1. data lake + data warehouse (from Hadoop ~ 2007 then cloud ~ 2015):\n  1. ETL 1: Raw data is extracted/transformed/loaded (ETLed, or just dumped) into the data lake.\n  2. Storage 1: A data lake is optimized for massive low-cost storage (S3, GCS, Azure blob, MinIO).\n  3. ETL 2: Data lake data is cleaned, joined, aggregated etc. into a query-able state loaded in the data warehouse.\n  4. Storage 2: A data warehouse is optimized for analytical-oriented queries OLAP. It is generally an expensive independent black-box service with its own internal file storage so it requires additional data transfer (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift etc.).\n2. lake house (from Delta Lake ~ 2019):\n  1. ETL 1: Same as above.\n  2. Storage 1: Same as above.\n  3. ETL 2: Same as above, but you're not loading into a separate OLAP service, you stay in your object storage and just store in a different format, a lake house format.\n  4. Storage 2: A lake house (Delta Lake, Iceberg, Duck Lake) is optimized for OLAP queries, but it can be created in the same massive low-cost storage as Storage 1. It relies on additional table metadata that allows replicating some of the features and optimizations that make the previous OLAP services more performant than querying a basic partitioned Parquet table. For example, compared to Parquet only, it allows: \n     1. transactional changes (either successful or not at all), \n     1. schema evolution (adding new columns without rewriting the whole table),\n     1. time travel to previous versions, \n     1. upsert/delete/merge at the file level instead of the partition level, \n     1. and related read/write optimizations.\n\n> 1 - One of the most common examples is the data lake populated with tons of parquet files. How different from each other in data types, number of columns etc are these files? If not very much, why not just throw it all in a pipeline to clean/normalize the data and store the output in a common warehouse?\n\nSo the key with Lake House tech is you can keep using your massive low-cost object storage for your OLAP layer as opposed to loading into an expensive OLAP black box.\n \nI have not detailed the generation before \"data lake + data warehouse\" (before Hadoop), which is mostly \"OLTP + data warehouse\", as you didn't ask about it.\nYou can find more details in this article from Databricks who makes Delta Lake: https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf\n\n> 3 - Will these technologies become the de facto standard in the near future, turning traditional lakes and warehouses obsolete?\n\nGiven their killer features above, I think so. But it can be a progressive evolution of your existing data lake, you don't have to trash it.  \n\nNow, \"lake house\" warehouses are still distributed \"big data\" warehouses, which means they shine in processing huge amounts of data in a reasonable time and cost, and they do that better than partitioned Parquet tables.  \nBut this is still not as performant as PostgreSQL on average data, highly specialized OLAP databases like Click House or expensive black box OLAP like Snowflake. Although, Duck Lake may be bridging the gap for average data, with its metadata stored in OLTP instead of file, and its highly performant single process C++ engine.",

Many of the systems that are older, but still very functional, are also very brittle. You don't change the file format just because you want to use a different format. You have to come up with a business case that makes changing the format worth it. BTW, cost savings are a terrible way to start a discussion to get money. Figure out how to make more money by changing the file format and you may have something.\n2. We have heard all about the coming of semi-structured or unstructured data for years. Like cold fusion, it is just 20 years away. PDFs are a horrible way to move data. They are designed for how the information looks, not how it is held. You wouldn't believe the number of escape sequences are used to make PDFs look good. Those are very hard to get the data out of. Ask your local data scientist how much they love pulling data out of PDFs. They'll tell you it sucks. The first step to using them is to get the info out of the PDF into text and then try to make it work.\n3. Not even close. 90% of what you hear about these \"coming technologies\" is marketing BS. Know what huge financial institutions, like BoA, and huge retail, like Walmart, use? They are still using EDI. Yep, technologies from the 70s and 80s. Why? Because it works and they all trust it.

Fail fast, if you will. \n\nThis means understanding your source data fields and testing them. This is especially true for json blobs where nested keys are expected to hold json data, only to find that the API actually returns null values or different nested values or keys based on other keys in the blob - yay. \n\nBut achieving this is not easy. You need to get in contact with the business owner / data owner to understand the fields and the business rules (and what they mean). And you need to ensure you've got signoff prior to deploying the pipeline, so that any failures can be reviewed with them before you make your pipeline constraints more lenient. Trust me. \n\nBut, the myth of \"we will fix it in post\" is real, and never actually happens once the next pipeline comes your way. Post-fixing methodologies are essentially like adding a second etl to your pipeline - which you will also need to maintain, and it's totally abstracted away from the source data pipeline now. \n\nMost analytics is quite removed from production systems, and business/ stakeholders want their data NOW. But part of any data pipeline is the \"people pipeline\", connecting people from the relevant domains into a single conversation so that parties can understand the risks and uncertainties and the business rules. \n\nBut, if you only build pipelines and you don't care about what happens after you give the data to people, or you don't care about the teams who need to use the data, then just build tests against your destination schema constraints. Bonus shortcut, just exclude all records that fail the test and magically your pipeline never fails. Business will think you're a rockstar! \n\nI strongly encourage KYD.",

Then, half a year later, after adding new logic, it failed right away pointing that something went wrong.   \n\n\n**Regression testing** could be the most rewarding. The idea is simple: produce two versions of a table, before and after applying the changes. Then compare them record by record, see what doesn't match, and try to understand why.\n\nThese two require the least investment from you yet bring immediate value.",

In most dataset this won’t be an issue at all and you guarantee that your pipeline or the source didn’t generate duplicates data which happens a lot because of a lot of reason or just because of reprocess of the ingestion.\n\nYou can test for expected values but I only have bad luck with those because the data we play with change a lot. Unless  your datasets are very deterministic or doesn’t change a lot I wouldn’t go there. Unless there’s an action do to on your end if you receive a new value.\n\nYou can test for data continuity (try to find holes). That help a lot. Most systems aren’t fully sequential because you need that all part of the pipeline support sequential task to deliver you data sequentially which is not the most common. For example at the moment you rely on s3 events, you’ve just lost your ordering. Can be interesting to build things in order but also to find missing data.\n\nAnd like you said, build test right (closer to your business domain tables), then shift left (closer to the source of data) anytime it’s possible. It’s usually easier to build a test that apply to a specific domain use case because you know what you want and expect. And it’s always better to test closer to the source.",

I don't know what kind of aggregations and transformations you do, but with those volumes you very quickly end up with billions of records in one database table. At that point you get into issues with index fragmentation, limits of reporting tools (power BI won't be able to do it), no chance at doing real-time either. Of course you can do a lot of smart stuff; partitioning the data per day and such. But I'm quite curious how much data ends up in your reporting table, how you report on it and what tier you're using for your database? Scaling up a database on Azure can get very expensive. Much more expensive than some cheap ADLS storage.",

IMO this never should have happened and I ended up stepping back to senior. This has hurt me in some respects trying to find my next role but that's off topic\n\nWith no awareness of cloud tooling I originally built a skillset in SSIS. Weirdly - maybe due to the fact that I was still largely a dev day to day - nobody would give me the time of day when I tried to find roles in that area from like 2018 onwards. I largely credit COVID/full remote/zero interest rates and the explosion of hiring for even getting interviews for cloud native jobs as my dev job never had cloud native options. I still wonder if I'd have even broken into the field at all without that\n\nAs to how I'm managing - I've really been on the \"learn outside of work to the point of burnout\" trail for the last 3 years. I was a SQL heavy dev so no issues there but I still don't think I know enough about anything else. This gets more complicated because my current role is analytics for security teams so I'm also doing SIEM work and chasing security certifications...\n\nI always get by in my roles by being passable at things the teams I work in can't even get started. As a data engineer that's been teaching everyone Git, CI/CD, and infrastructure stuff, or in my current team doing actual security work in the SIEM/SOAR space\n\nI've written far too much but there's lots to share I guess.

When we shift to corporate, there will be politics involved or there will be some culture that you have to adopt. \n\nIn this case, sounds like the culture is not that good. You might not be culture fit. But it doesn’t mean that your bad or you underperform. It’s just that the company’s culture don’t fit your values. \n\nWorking outside shift hours is bad. There has to be some level of respect there. Not unless the role requires an on-call responsibility. \n\nDon’t be too hard on yourself, brother. \n\nOn the other hand, there are also some factors that might contribute to your situation. \n\nIt might be possible that your communication style ia different from the the comm style of your boss or your peers. \n\nFor example, there are some people who don’t respond via email. They respond via chat. You mentioned that you tagged your boss on a doc and he seemed to miss that. So, that might be an issue. Adjust to your boss’ comm style. If he wants a chat, then do so. His email might be swamp with a lot of emails so your email might be burried in his inbox. \n\nAnother thing is, in start ups autonomy is the usual culture. In corporate, it’s not always the case. There will be a lot of times that you have to have buyins from certain stakeholders. Even your boss. You need to push for approvals and sell the idea to them. Culture is really different. \n\nOn the issue of passive-aggressiveness. I might be wrong on this one but have you spoken to your boss lately? Have you communicated your concerns? One possible reason that it looks like passive-agressiveness is that you don’t speak enough with your boss.\n\nIn startups, speed is usually name of the game. In corporate, you can only do so much until your boss approves it. \n\nLastly, communicate always your work. It’s important that you become visible to your boss and he’s aware about what you do. \n\nIf everything still fails, even if have communicated everything, then it might be the time to loom for another company, specially if it affects your mental health.",

Multiple excel tabs instead of 1 expected tab?\n\nEssentially my point is the folks creating the raw data that you then ingest as \"raw\" data in bronze layer are often times front desk staff who dont know what excel even is - there is huge variance. We can't reject every other row in real life, that data needs to be cleansed and ingested/used for x purpose(s) (because we pay for it, or responsibility to load it or whatever the use case is). \n\nWhat you've built is really cool, and teams out there would pay you big bucks to get this sort of pipeline operating efficiently, assuming you can course correct for the above scenarios.",

If you run OSS locally (outside databricks) and test your application, and submit jobs in cluster mode, then the performance should be comparable to what you might expect in high concurrency mode.  (Open a support ticket if not)\n\nLately I've been unfortunate enough to work with Fabric notebooks on spark pools and they have a totally unrelated concept which is called \"high concurrency\" mode.  Be careful while googling!!\n\nThe reason high concurrency mode was important in databricks -at the time- was because the \"interactive\" clusters sent the driver of all jobs thru a dedicated driver node and it doesn't scale well when lots of jobs are running at the same time.  My recollection was that there was deliberate synchronization performed, for the benefit of interactive scenarios involving human operators.  In high concurrency mode they remove that self-inflicted performance bottleneck.",

External UDF servers shine when you already have a service in production, e.g., calling a fraud score API, but watch network latency and cache aggressively. I’ve used BigQuery remote functions and Snowflake external functions for these patterns; DreamFactory handled the auto-generated REST layer when we needed to expose those services without hand-rolling APIs. Resist jumping to exotic stacks until SQL or basic UDFs truly break down.",

A good observability tool can help establish a baseline and notify you if something changes.  \n\\- Some data sources have fairly irregular schedules, with frequent ingest during work hours, batch updates during the night, and no updates during weekends and holidays. You often end up with very loose freshness tests because you can't combine freshness with a cron.\n\nThe setup can be as simple or as difficult as you want. In the simple case, just create a service user for the SaaS and watch the dashboard populate. In the advanced case, you can spend months writing custom yaml tests in MonteCarlo, integrating Airflow webhooks, etc.\n\nThe crux with the more advanced tools that actually use ML is that they notify you of anomalies over slack, and they then expect you to tell them if this is an actual anomaly. When you set it up it just observes for a week or two, assuming that whatever you see during this period is normal. After this, you will probably start receiving a lot of notifications of possible anomalies. If your team is able to check with some domain expert, you can give the underlying ML model good input and over a few weeks there will be way fewer false positives.\n\nIf you don't have access to someone who can tell you if an anomaly is an error or not, these tools will be very annoying. If you do, you probably also have a good shot at writing meaningful dbt tests.\n\nThe more simple tools are more annoying. The anomaly detection is often a simple Z-statistic, so there is little chance of reducing false positives (other than accumulating more history). On the plus side, the simple tools are often open source or open core.\n\nLastly, a few questions to keep in mind:  \n\\- What types of failures are you looking for? Is it silent failures in the data ingest pipeline you created? Is it upstream changes to data structures, odd content etc that might stem from an error in a different system?  \n\\- What do you want from it? Is it for the DE team to check possible errors in their own system? Is it to notify users of possible issues?  \n\\- What is your tolerance level for false positives?  \n\\- How much effort is it to check out a possible anomaly?\n\nNone of these projects ended up seeing the observability tool as an indispensable tool. From what I can remember, there was one or two cases where the tool caught an issue before anyone else. But they are expensive, and there are mostly false positives.",

We've been running data observability tools at iDataMaze for about 18 months now, started with Monte Carlo then switched to a custom solution built on top of Great Expectations.\n\nHonestly the biggest value isn't catching data quality issues dbt tests handle most of that fine. It's the lineage tracking and impact analysis when something does break. When a client dataset gets corrupted upstream, we can immediately see which reports and dashboards are affected without having to manually trace through everything. The setup was painful tho, took way longer than expected to get all the integrations working properly. And yeah there's definitely some dashboard fatigue we had to be really selective about which alerts actually matter vs just noise.  What pushed us to stick with it was scaling issues. When you have multiple teams pulling from the same datasets and everyone's building their own stuff on top, traditional testing just doesn't give you the visibility you need. The blast radius of a single bad dataset can be huge. One thing I wish these tools did better is understanding business context. They're great at telling you \"this column has more nulls than usual\" but terrible at knowing whether that actually matters for your specific use case. For what it's worth, most of our enterprise clients are still hesitant about full automation. They want the monitoring but still prefer human validation before any auto-remediation kicks in.

If the execs really insist on concurrent writes both coasts, look at Citus for shard-level conflict handling or jump to CockroachDB/Yugabyte, which keep the Postgres wire protocol while baking in global consensus. Keep the hot 6–12 TB in the primary cluster, offload historical partitions to cheaper storage, and you sidestep the 87 TB headache.

Your instinct about Postgres being easier on the dev side is spot on the SQL compatibility makes the migration much smoother.But honestly, with 87TB of highly relational data and that schema structure you described, I'd lean towards Postgres here. few reasons: The relational nature of your order management system is gonna fight you every step of the way with Mongo. Sure, sharding comes easier but you'll end up with a mess trying to handle all those one-to-many relationships across collections. Plus your devs will hate life trying to rewrite all that logic.\n\nFor active-active with Postgres, yeah its more work upfront but:\n\n\\- Citus handles the sharding pretty well for this scale\n\n\\- pglogical or BDR can handle the multi-master stuff \n\n\\- Your existing queries won't need major rewrites\n\nThe 15M users across US east/west is definitely doable with either but given your schema complexity I think you'll save months of dev time sticking with relational.\n\nOne thing to watch out for tho - active-active with financial transaction data gets tricky with conflict resolution. Make sure you have a solid strategy for handling concurrent updates to the same order records across regions.\n\nWhat's your timeline looking like for this migration? That might influence which route makes more sense from a project management perspective            Also curious about your read/write patterns are customers mostly reading their order history or do you have heavy write loads during peak ordering times?",

        "body": "Upfront disclosure - I work at MongoDB. But I’ll fully upvote every comment that says you’ll have to redevelop most backend code to use MongoDB. Fact! \n  \nOn the other hand - an Order Management use case is perfectly suited to the MongoDB document model. Your data is not highly relational; it is highly structured. A customer places orders, and orders contain items. That can be entirely achieved in a single collection with nested fields in MongoDB. The performance will be superior. There is rarely a need for transactions in MongoDB - use a flexible document to capture the reads atomically, and if you need to update other collections that contain values use change streams. Jumping across 87TB in relational tables is inherently less efficient. \n\nGoing further, if you use MongoDB Atlas, I’d expect you can use the built in archive for a majority of the customer data (orders >6 months go to archive?), adding minimal latency degradation (+1-2s? Vs sub 100ms for hot data) and massive savings, with no added code. That could half the size of your cluster and costs. But at worst, for the near hundred TB of data, you are looking at a 25 shard cluster which would be active-active and could accept east/west geo-specific writes\n\nGoing even further, how does your order management support search? Atlas will provide you order search capability within the same cluster or with dedicated search nodes. And vector search. And all of this is Highly Available starting with 4 9s of uptime with options to increase to 5 9s. \n\nSo if your C-Suite is weighing in with technical requirement (active-active) - my suggestion is ask them what the business requirement is - uptime, latency - and steer them back towards doing their jobs and letting you do yours ;). And ask them what value lucene search would provide to users? \n\nAnd then returning to the reason for you not to use MongoDB Atlas - you will have to refactor more code. But we do offer purpose built genAI refactoring solutions to help customers achieve this. DM me or check our website. End Users can even Experiment with “Relational Migrator” but you’ll need custom or some of our internal tooling to migrate 87 TB. Good luck!",

For heavier processing that takes many hours/days typically you might look at Apache Sedona, a spark fork designed for geospatial processing.  Based on your example though it sounds like you could probably get away with parquet files or some cheap cloud columnar DB implementation.\n\nWe do similar stuff at the billions of rows scale (no geocoding though), with spatial indexing and location points on Snowflake.

The brutal truth is that after 5+ years of experience, companies expect you to not just solve problems but to think strategically about data architecture, communicate trade-offs clearly, and demonstrate leadership potential. You might be nailing the coding challenges but struggling with system design discussions or not articulating your thought process in a way that shows senior-level thinking. The gap since March isn't helping, but it's not insurmountable if you can identify what's happening in those final interviews.\n\nThe good news is that reaching final rounds repeatedly means you're close, not failing. Companies are investing significant time in you, which signals genuine interest. Try getting feedback from those rejections, even if it's just a brief call with the recruiter. Practice explaining your architectural decisions out loud, prepare stories that showcase your impact beyond just technical execution, and consider doing mock interviews with other senior engineers who can spot what you might be missing.

Leave the technology selection and named individuals etc for project/programme world. \n\nEach strategy will be different due to the current context helping you to identify the goals you want to go for. The last one I wrote just a few months back targeted a change in operating model. Mainly due to a lot of pain points coming from heavy IT, engineering led decisions and a complete lack of governance. \n\nThere's plenty of bad examples out there but the MOD and NASA strategies are ideal I've linked to a few below with elements I rate as being good. They focus on principles and goals. The strategies which focus on \"we need to move to databricks\" or \"data governance process will look like this\" is not a strategy. \n\nOnce the context, vision, goals and objectives are in place you simply lay out a roadmap for the next X years and this is then used to kick off the initiatives in the business to deliver on the strategy. Again, this is why it's a strategy and why it leads you simply in a direction to fix where you are.\n\nThe people hired, the architecture patterns, the solutions chosen and tech changes all use the strategy vision, principles and goals to keep aligned. You can not allow the strategy to dictate the low level answer. It's direction.\n\n\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nasa_data_strategy.pdf\n\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/614deb7a8fa8f561075cae0b/Data_Strategy_for_Defence.pdf\n\nhttps://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-06/ESMA50-157-3404_ESMA_Data_Strategy_2023-2028.pdf\n\nhttps://www.surreycc.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/308017/SCC-Data-Strategy-v2.1_Accessible_DRAFT.pdf\n\nhttps://www.westmorlandandfurness.gov.uk/sites/default/files/2024-10/27624%20WFC%20Data%20Strategy.pdf\n\nhttps://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/Data-Governance/DOL-Enterprise-Data-Strategy-2022.pdf",

        "body": "For most data teams, those analytically oriented, I think the high-level business expectations are for us to answer these questions:\n\n1. What happened?\n2. Why did it happen?\n3. What's going to happen next?\n4. What do we do about it?\n\nLuckily, those things build on each other and can help you prioritize your work. For example, first standing up simple reporting and over time growing that into predictions and recommendations. That last part is where a data team really shows its value.\n\nYou can extend, or alternatively, start this thinking by considering who your data team's end users or customers are now and, just as important, who they'll be in the future. These are usually:\n\n1. Business users: The folks looking at dashboards.\n2. Analysts: The folks diving into the data to answer novel questions.\n3. Reverse ELT: Platforms you send enriched data back to, often marketing.\n4. Data Science: Perhaps to answer questions 2 and 3 above, or to power your application.\n5. Application: Your application itself. Are you responsible for master data concepts like a single representation of a user that needs to be fed back to your platform?\n\nOnce you have a sense for these things you can then think about the technical requirements that answering those four questions and serving those five customers might entail. Often, these can be grouped into two big questions (the ones we're always asking first in this sub):\n\n1. What is the volume of the data?\n2. What are the latency requirements for my uses?\n\nFor example, making a dashboard for business users to see what happened usually doesn't require data more timely than a day. That's why so many organizations start with simple batch ELT jobs. From here, you can begin to build into the other use cases and customer needs. But, on the other hand, maybe you know that you're immediately going to be tasked with some application or data science need. Being aware of that could help you get in front of that problem and start with a more robust, lower-latency solution like streaming or microbatches from the beginning.\n\nIf, like many data teams, your first responsibility is to get the business users and analysts the data they need to understand what is happening to the business, I find [Metric Trees](https://www.datacouncil.ai/talks/designing-and-building-metric-trees) to be the most useful way to think about this. You can use this framework to anticipate the data you'll need to surface and to inform your understanding of how to organize it so that all the data relevant to a particular domain or user responsible for that data is co-located for their use.\n\nIn the end, it all comes down to your unique needs, but those various points are some of the things I consider when building out a vision for what the data team should be building, how they should build it, and when.",

I work with spark, but don't really leverage its distributed power, so there are probably other people better suited to answer the question for you, but that's just my take.\n\nAlso in general I would recommend getting your fundamental understandings of anything you do down first, rather than specializing on a specific technology especially if you're early on in your journey. If you limit yourself to one technology, you limit the positions you can potentially be hired to do. Also if you're really early on in your learning, you don't really have the perspective to know what makes a technology good or easy to use or not and your opinions on it might change once you see how you work with it in real world scenarios vs classroom/tutorial/personal project scenarios.",

Although my experience is in the first one, I think there are way more jobs in the tool user category than in the toolmaker category. But making those tools probably require quite advanced knowledge of performance, so you may succeed with specialization.  \nThis community is about DE, so you will get most of your answers from data engineers.\n\nWhat is your level of education, are you graduated in CS or already an experienced coder?\nFor distributed system engineering, if you are into theory, I think a good starting point are the scientific articles that described the concepts behind the tools when they were still cutting edge research inside the laboratories. \n\nFor example, those are articles from Google that served as a foundation for building Hadoop at Yahoo:\n\n- \"MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters\" - Jeffrey Dean, Sanjay Ghemawat, Google, 2004\n- \"The Google File System\" - Sanjay Ghemawat, Howard Gobioff, Shun-Tak Leung, Google, 2003\n- \"Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data\" - Fay Chang, Jeffrey Dean, Sanjay Ghemawat, Wilson C. Hsieh, Deborah A. Wallach, Google, 2006\n\nThere are likely more recent articles in the same vein.\n\nIf you want to develop those tools, I would probably study the active open-source tools like Apache Spark, Trino, Apache DataFusion, DuckDB and Sail to understand the general designs and the hard problems. Then study the foundations of those problems, try to solve issues and submit PRs as training, and eventually try to get a job at those organizations.",

This wasn’t a huge problem if the table was not joined, but it became a really big deal when trying to run joins and if there was redistribution across all nodes. They would totally gum up speed transferring data across the network, and you really felt it when you were handling millions of rows.\n\nIt’s possible Amazon fixed this, but I doubt it. When I was there the most senior eng on that team did not understand why CTE’s at times took longer than temp tables.\n\nYou should test this yourself with runtimes (turn off caching before doing so).",

Treat your warehouse as a feature store for documents: break sources into small, well-tagged passages, snapshot them, and pump the embeddings plus raw text into something like PGVector or Pinecone so RAG stays deterministic. Build lineage on the chunk level, then wire row-level roles into the retrieval layer; that’s way easier than hoping users classify PII correctly before pasting it into ChatGPT. Automate redaction inside the pipeline-simple regex masks won’t cut it, lean on entity detection like Presidio. Observability matters more now because any silent refresh lag will surface as hallucination, so monitor vector drift the same way you watch table freshness. I tried Airbyte for bulk pulls and LangChain for orchestration, but DreamFactory gave me the instant REST endpoint over our on-prem SQL that let the agents pull just what they need without exposing the whole database.

I agree, especially we don't really need structured database to power LLM - basically we can just throw unstructured data, create embeddings, RAG it and let LLM deal with it, or use the data for fine-tuning.  \n2. This all the more reasons companies will want to move to create their own chatbots with internal knowledge and localized models, and force employees to use it for work, and maybe the task of data engineer will be to update the RAGs and the models behind it once in a while. I think by allowing even access to external LLMs like ChatGPT somebody will bound to throw PIIs to these tools sooner or later.",

The job feels more grounded in logic, documentation, and promoting vector search tools and observability for our analysts. Reading docs seems to be a chore. I recently told an analyst to stick my documentation and schemas into claude as well. It claims to have no need for a RAG database when fed good context. As for other tasks, llms can create boilerplate. I usually have to find the random bug and perform validation checks. For some reason, setting an integer to 0 is an optimization, lol. There is more focus on logic, cleanliness, readability, searchability, and quality for sure. Less on the boilerplate. If you dont use a tool like dbt, use it. It is a context generator.",

Job boards rarely cut it; I land work by hunting seed-to-Series-B startups on Crunchbase, hitting their CTOs on LinkedIn, and offering a fixed-price “first data pipeline in 10 days” package. A tight scope (e.g., ingest Stripe to Snowflake, build dbt model, hand off docs) shows value fast and opens retainer work for monitoring and cost tuning. Keep a public repo with Terraform + CI that spins up Glue, dbt Cloud, and a cheap BI demo so prospects can click instead of imagine. Upwork and Toptal help fill gaps, but your outbound brings higher rates-start at 1.5× your last salaried hourly. Full-time remote roles exist too, mostly at cloud-born SaaS firms; filter on “US only” to avoid time-zone pain and pitch your infra-as-code chops. I bounced between Airbyte and Supabase, but DreamFactory is what I ended up adopting because it lets me wrap any legacy DB in a locked-down REST API without babysitting. Treat yourself like a product, niche down, and stay visible-remote gigs do land.",

If you need stricter schema and permissions, throw up Supabase or Postgres behind Appsmith; business users fill a simple form while you still query via SQL. For our vendor-format tracking we store element, subelement, status, and comments in Airtable, then run a nightly dbt job that syncs the base into the warehouse so every pipeline sees the latest approvals.

When something goes wrong, it's challenging right now to even answer what this table looked like yesterday. \n\nI'm thinking right now of an observer service and an anomaly service at least and have it extensible for different source types (Snowflake, S3) and table types (raw source, transformed source, transformed model). Checks happen on a cron-friendly cadence but at least once a day. Maybe even configurable indepdently by source, path, table or check type. Is it opt-in or opt-out?\n\nWould love to hear more about how you are thinking about it! I'm just starting to formulate my thoughts about it. And before any vendors come at me, don't bother, you're barking up the wrong tree :).\n\nEdit: I should amend this to say that we have a LOT of dbt tests and we are very good about defining a unique key and testing on it (not null and unique) so we generally know about fan-out problems but I'm more thinking the silent failures. Something is null all of sudden or data volume drops off a cliff or there is a significant skew in the most frequent values in recent data, amounts skyrocketing due to math errors, etc. Logic has changed somewhere so how can you be very certain that the downstreams aren't silently negatively affected.",

Based on [this explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/6wilmr/comment/dm8blj7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), I then got detoured into the researching pedantic questions like whether Java byte code is at the same level of abstraction as assembler (answer=yes, though its binary form is more comparable to machine code in that it doesn't use text mnemonic labels and the instruction set is for a virtual processor) [1].\n\nGoogle AI says that an app that is deployed as a docker image \"doesn't have direct access to the host OS's files, processes, or network configurations in the same way a natively installed application would.\"  The ambiguity here is \"in the same way\", which pretty well makes the statement impossible to decipher.  I hope that it allows access to `c:\\users\\My.Name\\MyProject\\MyScript.py` or `c:\\cygwin64\\home\\My.Name\\MyProject\\MyScript.py`?\n\nIn any case, even though it took years, I now *can* access Anaconda at work, so the availability of PySpark provides much needed relief from the setting up of PySpark outside of Anaconda and integrating the two.\n\n**Notes**\n\n**[1]** I also found it informative that *microcode* is at the level of abstraction of sequential state machines for digital circuits, according to Google AI.",

This would've saved you hours and can possibly save you hours in the future. \n\n\nThe answer is yes, ofcourse you can add scripts, files and networking (it narively passes your own connection, so you can download packages within the container, but you simply copy files into the container). The whole point is that you can run your entire application inside of a container without the overhead of an entire VM, but with the flexibility of everyone 'using the same os'.\n\nFor pyspark is also just skips the JAVA and SPARK environment variables because those are just already setup for you.\n\nIf you ever need to host your applications using something like docker is highly advised anyways. There shouldn't  be a barrier to installing docker.  It's one of the essential applications in any orginization where code and hosting plays any role. And (almost) completely bypasses the 'it works on my computer' syndrome.",

If MSSQL hiccups for some reason, Databricks jobs will fail\n* You’re paying for Databricks to sit and wait on network calls. Even with pushdown, you're still bound by MSSQL perf and network I/O.\n* No lineage, no retries, no observability. If something goes sideways, you;re stuck\n* Anything more complex than a simple pull turns into a mess of SQL.\n* It scales like garbage. You’ll feel it when you hit 10M+ rows or high concurrency.\n\nIf you're even semi-serious about reliability or data freshness, it’s not worth the pain imo.\n\nHow often are your jobs running?

The real hit comes when five analysts launch the query at once-MSSQL tempdb balloons and the firewall team screams, so set WORKLOAD GOVERNOR or spin up a read replica. Cache the result in Delta and keep a water-mark table so you only federate deltas. If latency isn’t critical, batch every hour and vacuum old snapshots. We tried Fivetran for CDC and dbt-exposures for lineage, but DreamFactory ended up being the quick way to surface the delta API without more Python.

Loading into a database first then storage before Databricks adds extra steps and cost unless you really need the database for processing or indexing. If your ETL system already outputs structured data, you can often skip the DB and write straight to storage like S3 or ADLS in Parquet, partitioned by date or other useful fields. Databricks handles that raw/processed separation pretty well using different paths or tables.\n\nThe DB makes sense if you need a place to do fast lookups, joins, or data quality checks before landing it cold, but even then a proper ETL tool could do these in-flight. Otherwise, you're just adding another thing to maintain. What's your reason for that intermediate DB? Is it for transformations, or just legacy setup? Also, what kind of ETL are you running, batch or streaming?\n\nI work at Estuary, which handles ETL directly into cloud storage OR Databricks natively, if you're looking to simplify that part.",

Not only that, RAM cache is also very critical for performance, and hash tables are nearly always inferior to simple arrays when it comes to hitting cache. For performance there is also the idea of branching - in simple terms: whether or not the CPU can guess correctly if an if-statement will be true or false. Due to that you want as little if-statements as possible in performance critical areas, and i think all practical implementations of hash-tables have if-statements.\n2. Hash tables usually dont have order. If i want sorted data and often return the smallest/biggest member or a rank related to size, Hash tables are useless. Even simple strings have meaning to their order. EDIT: i dont think you can actually achieve order in hash-tables without a complementary list/array.\n3. You may need/want to use stack memory instead of heap memory and hash tables are hard and inefficient to implement using only stack memory.\n4. hash-tables pre-allocate chunks of memory before its ever used. if you want to save on memory you may want a different ADT.\n\nWith that being said, when you mostly care about average case big O notations, hash-tables are pretty amazing.

Walk into any bookstore, and you'll see how to Teach Yourself Java in 24 Hours alongside endless variations offering to teach C, SQL, Ruby, Algorithms, and so on in a few days or hours. \n\n> The conclusion is that either people are in a big rush to learn about programming, **or that programming is somehow fabulously easier to learn than anything else.**\n\n> Felleisen et al. give a nod to this trend in their book How to Design Programs, when they say \"Bad programming is easy. *Idiots* can learn it in 21 days, even if they are *dummies*.\"\n\n> Researchers (Bloom (1985), Bryan & Harter (1899), Hayes (1989), Simmon & Chase (1973)) have shown it takes about **ten years** to develop expertise in any of a wide variety of areas, including chess playing, music composition, telegraph operation, painting, piano playing, swimming, tennis, and research in neuropsychology and topology. The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability, trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting any mistakes. Then repeat. And repeat again. There appear to be no real shortcuts.\n\nIt's a marathon, not a sprint. As long as you're learning, you're achieving something. Keep going.",

I found a lot of my spiraling was due to being overwhelmed  \n\\- Optimize feedback loops. Fastest way to kill my productivity is needing to wait 5 mins to see if a fix worked. Test-driven development is nice. Fast builds are nice  \n\\- Struggling with a problem? Write about it, pen & paper. Doodle if you want. Rant if you want. I personally find it more effective than rubber ducking  \n\\- Silent timers: you may have heard of pomodoro timing, but I didn't mesh well with being interrupted right as I was in the flow. I do something pomodoro-like but keep the timers muted, and just switch when my focus is drifting and I notice my time is up  \n\\- I found taskwarrior (CLI) meshes really well with my brain as a task tracker  \n\\- Jumpstart guides: for larger projects that have some setup, I found it takes a lot of effort to get started making changes. I wrote a four-step \"jumpstarter\" for one of my projects that carefully walks through making a trivial hello-world-style change to one of the classes, building/deploying the project, and seeing the change on a UI. Takes like 30 seconds, but somehow, doing that helps get me in the headspace to start doing actual development\n\nYou mention a lot about reading unfamiliar code: unfortunately, this is more-or-less a practice game. Some more tricks that work for me in no particular order:\n\n\\- Above all else, make sure the code can run. Trying to do any development on code that doesn't run is a death sentence  \n\\- Commit archaeology -- whole codebase is hard to read? Try git blaming some stuff you're interested in and just understanding one well-documented commit or PR  \n\\- Documenting things -- there's probably missing comments that are making things tricky, may as well make it easier for the next guy. Having docs for a function's dependencies makes it easier to read that function since you can now understand what it does without needing to ctrl+click into another context  \n\\- Debuggers are good, learn to use them  \n\\- Tests are good, learn to write them -- this is the core thesis of \"working effectively with legacy code\"  \n\\- Learn editor navigation shortcuts: be able to quickly navigate to that one class that you know the name of, to jump into and back out of specific functions, etc\n\nOverall, I'm fond to say \"productivity is an engineering problem.\" It's not the type of thing where you just find The Solution and you're good to go. Any engineering problem worth talking about has competing solutions with tradeoffs that require a process of designing, implementing, testing, and revision. Try to find specific things that are killing your productivity (the 5 Whys technique is good) and hack at it like any other complex problem.",

Build, break and fail. \nYou need to get good at troubleshooting and overcoming obstacles.\n\nCreate a small project, then break it into tiny, winnable tasks. I also recommend splitting the creative and logical tasks\n\nBefore you start, take five minutes to remind yourself why you’re doing this and how you’ll feel in the future if you have not made progress. \nIf you find your mind wandering, switch from logic tasks to creative.\n\nIt won’t always feel good in the moment.

What works best for me is a combination of small targeted problems on different topics and using questions/answers to test my knowledge.\n\nI’ve used LLMs for this. I’ve asked them to list out the main things I need to know without going into implementation and to then come up with a series of questions that would help me practice it. I go through the questions and code up the problems it gives me without looking at a solution. I take it as far as I can. \n\nI’m not concerned with being right, I’m concerned with training my brain to think. Some of my best learning came from allowing myself to do it my way all the way, even if it turned out to be dead wrong, because that teaches me exactly why things are done the way they are. I then take my solution back to the LLM and ask it to give constructive criticism. You can also get problems from a book or a website, it doesn’t have to be an LLM, but I like the instant feedback.\n\nAdditionally, in my notes, along with having definitions for things I’m learning, I also have a questions section.  The goal isn’t to answer the question immediately, the goal is to track with honesty what I actually know vs. what I need to work on. For example, if I keep asking the same question 5 times across different problems, that’s an area I don’t truly understand.\n\nBonus: LLMs are really good at pattern recognition. Once it has enough data on you, you can ask it something like ‘Based on out previous conversations on xyz, what do I know well, what are the areas where I need to improve and what learning style has proven to work best for me?’\n\nWe learn in chunks. You have to build up those chunks one at a time and train your brain to think, not consume.",

Hopefully there will be minimal to no permanent harm done to you.\n\nTake note that we may end up working for a toxic workplace too and it's better to learn how to protect yourself, both in your family environment, workplace, and anywhere. Learn not to overthink and stay rooted and grounded in the physical world you're in. Trust your thoughts, emotions and gut feel, don't let others tell you poor or even dangerous advises.\n\nConsider doing internships to gain real work experiences, learn to sell yourself well on your resume, LinkedIn and in interviews.\n\nThe best thing for you is learning how to protect yourself, and plan to move out of there or be away from them.\n\nand if you ever choose to get a life partner, be careful not to repeat the mistake of being with someone toxic. We tend to be attracted to who we find familiar, and children from toxic family, have a tendency to gravitate to toxic people too, even when they themselves aren't. Break that cycle.",

From your post i understood that your in a very tough situation!  The major problem you have is 1.toxic family 2. Financial problem 3. & currently dont have a laptop! The first thing you have do is convince your parents to give your laptop back! Then you said your financial situation is very bad so you should do some part time job in any clothing store or any shop, you can try cafe or something like that! They will pay you enough to survive i think!  Considering your 20 year old female i think it Will be very tough for you to leave your home just like that!  If you can do that it will be very good but outside home in india as a lone girl finding suitable living place is very tough to get! You can live in your local hostel where College girls lives or something like that! So now you got your laptop & got a part time job & also found a shelter!  Now the journey of coding begins! As you want to learn ai / ml or like this kind of things!  But the thing is this very possible to learn but considering you situation you should first learn WEB DEVELOPMENT!  Because it is a very suitable career path to enter the tech world & you can land a job very fast as a intern or junior web developer  & you can learn 100% of it in Just 6-9 months!  So how will you learn? For that there are many resources in  YouTube & those are completely free! In my opinion you should learn from codewithharry's sigma web development course! There are also others resources like Freecodecamp etc but sigma web dev course will ne best for you bcz its in hindi!  Thats all!  If you have anymore quarry plz feel free to ask & Don't lose hope!  Have faith in yourself you will be able to overcome any problem  in your life!!",

Contrary to popular belief banging your head against problems and trying to self-solve everything is most often the worst route. There is a bit of nuance here. \n\nWhen you already have a degree of skill in an area, then solving things to get a deeper understanding / appreciation is good. But as a newbie learning core ideas, be that in mathematics, or programming, or otherwise, the \"solve it yourself\" approach of so many old school masters is well evidenced as being a poor route.\n\nI would recommend a middle road.\n\nGetting AI to simply spam code at you is a terrible idea. But having it do code reviews, and even to give you clear answers so you know what to do, is a good idea. There is very little value in sitting there for a day, struggling to figure out how to align things in CSS, if you could have learned the core functions of flex and grid in 30 minutes and then spent the day actually practicing them.\n\nBe sensible. \n\nYou seem like a smart person. So you can tell the difference between a case where you are using AI to do the work for you vs using it to teach you things in an efficient way. And don't depend only on AI. But it is a powerful tool and you should use it. There are many Luddites who swear off it and will tell  you that you will never code if you touch it. But honestly, they are just living in denial.

But more importantly, you made up a formula that increases the payout if the player spends more, and you did it in a way that would be a **big problem** if this were a real casino. With a wager of 3 credits, the house has a significant advantage (a player will lose 1.333 credits per play on average). But with the way you're calculating payouts, a player who wagers 6 credits or more has a positive expected return per play, so they can easily just bankrupt the casino by playing repeatedly.\n\nAlso, this is a much smaller issue, but your test code in `SuccessfulGameTest` seems kind of sketchy to me. For one thing, I really don't like the structure of making all your test cases being dependent on running in a specific order, because it means you can't test them separately. For another, you're not *meaningfully* testing the final balance; if you start with 10000 credits and spend 800, then checking whether the final balance is >=800 tells you nothing about whether the payouts were correct.",

The most important part of your gambling game is the Reel logic, and you have no tests for that.\n* Your tests are kind of unusual. Most tests I see are self-contained at the method level. They set up a situation from scratch, they exercise the system, and they examine the result. Your test methods each run one part of a larger scenario. That's not necessarily wrong. It even comes across as readable and maybe is the best way to do it, but it did give me a \"huh?\" moment, which might be bad for an interview project.\n* The main logic of your game is, to me, oddly organized. You have a \"CreditStoreService,\" which is fine, but its interface is \"takes arbitrary logic to manipulate the balance.\" Why doesn't the credit store service just have deposit, withdraw, reset, and checkBalance methods? Why put the business logic of how to modify balances in the controllers and also the game service?\n* When a game is played, you simulate the result before checking whether the player was allowed to play. This has no side effects, so it's fine, but it struck me as odd.\n\nStill, all in all, a reasonably fine project. I don't see any obvious red flags.

Maybe this is the missing code to make it work.\n\nThat part looks fine to me. The `Reel` class is an enum which has three values. The syntax `APPLE(10)` denotes that the `APPLE` singleton object is initialized by passing 10 as the parameter to the constructor, and that value becomes the value of the `final int winCredits` field.\n\nThe only criticism I'd make of that class is that it's poorly named (in my opinion). A \"reel\" is the thing that spins when you pull the slot machine handle. The machine has three reels, each of which contains three symbols. The class name is conflating reels with the symbols on the reels. But that's a very minor issue.",

I recently learned Go (I'm mostly a JavaScript and Java developer) and it took me a weekend. Not because I'm amazing, but because the core skills I already have are all applicable to Go too. I just had to learn new Syntax (which a good cheat-sheet helps with anyhow) and work through the quirks.\n\nI'm far from a total wizard with Go, but I have written a pretty decent API server using Gorm easily. \n\nMy point being, pick a language and just focus your efforts on going deep. Learn the core skills. Build actual useful things with it. And then, down the road, explore other languages if and when you need them. Which you choose is most often a practical choice based on how easy it is to do something in them, who else needs to work on the project, what is already in place, etc.",

Make mistakes, recreate things that are already created. Don't expect that it will lead to greatness but it will help you understand why (in the case of libraries) some decisions were made. Likely you will (in some cases) run into the same constraints.\n\nFor chess: why not make a chess board that lets you move a piece (and the board verifies your move is valid). that's an achievable goal. You can do it in text or using simple graphics. (graphics takes some learning but it is manageable if you set your goals low, like just load sprites for board and pieces. then displaying them in a grid. then if you cna make moves and if you make illegal moves it will stop you (just with 1 side of the pieces) you can start on taking turns with the opponent. \n\nAt any of these stages you can ask for help, talk through your planned strategy. Don't literally build what people here / elsewhere tell you is 'the optimal' way to do it. You don't need to get a perfect solution , you are exercising your brain at the coding gym. It's good to get pointed in the right direction but it's important you do the work.\n\nWe all feel like this. Especially at the start of a project because there are too many options. Once you start a project, the options become smaller and it will become easier to do steps forward. At some point you have removed enough unknowns for a specific problem that you have mental space to work on the problem at hand (isolated from the rest of the issues it becomes easier to think about). then you'll find you actually can work your way through it.\n\nThere is a reason that in school you get given clearly defined problems with clear boundaries. It makes it very easy to focus on what you have to do. Build a datastructure that ...  , build code that finds ... , etc. If you want to get a break from the high level things you can always go do some exercises but don't stick to them permanently.\n\nAnd when you see a tutorial, don't copy paste their solution but read it and then implement it yourself.",

Often that is, because one does not understand what exactly is happening on the lower levels of a thing. And if one was looking into that, then the actual project one was working on would be completely stalled.\n\nIt can help to either do a very minimalistic project, or consciously say no to something like React and build things the traditional way, just rendering a few templates in Django. And if Django is too magical, you could go more minimalistic with something like Flask, or Falcon + Jinja2 + some database connector.\n\nOr you could go even more rudimentary and choose to do some coding puzzles. Like Project Euler, Advent of Code, or similar. Those allow you also to write beautiful code to solve problems elegantly. For example last year I did AoC with solutions developed to be purely FP.\n\nOr you could do something bog standard like \"write a blog in Django\" to get more familiar with it and make it feel less like magic.",

If it's about \"need,\" the answer is \"not much,\" because there's such a wide range of specializations needing different things. Moreover, you're right that nowadays it's very easy to look up things, but it's a matter of proficiency that eventually you should be looking up less things.\n\n\nFor example, the first time I ever got a NullPointerException I remember it was a really difficult bug, I didn't know what pointers *or* null were, and I had to frontload learning all that. Once you've seen them enough though, you just know what it is, how it happens, and how to debug it, and usually (for NPEs caught early) it's a ~2 minute ordeal. I see stories online about people spending hours debugging missing semicolons: once you reach a certain level of familiarity with syntax, that just stops being an issue.\n\n\nAs you start to get more proficient, people generally expect you to \"just know\" more. Seniors *are* very adept at learning new things in tech, and very good at finding information to fill their gaps. But they also know a lot, and can more or less jump into a moderate-complexity codebase and get to work without much ramp-up. It's not that they \"need\" to memorize the information, but that they need a certain critical mass of experience to be able to do their job effectively. (Try asking foreign language learners about the difference between being able to look up a grammar table vs having the table memorized vs being able to speak correctly.) This is all ignoring the logistics of how one even knows what to google for unclear issues.\n\n\nThis especially applies with specialization: I wouldn't expect most programmers to know low-level details of memory layout, paging, CPU caching, etc, but since I write database internals, it's sort of critical to being able to do my job. OTOH I've met other devs at the same company that don't know the difference between RAM and disk, and they're doing fine in their expertise: it's just not a thing that's very relevant if you're working in some areas.\n\n\nSo, overall, I think the answer is \"learn *some* things well.\" You see people often reference T-shaped skillsets, where there's a large set of shallow skills (the top of the T) and a few deep ones (the vertical line). Syntax / basics are pretty much must-have, as well as some library/framework experience. But beyond that, be willing to dive into the details of tools you work with, practice learning as a skill, and start building that internal library. Looking things up on the job is fine, but learn from those resources, don't just drop them and move on as soon as you've found an answer.",

N. King, available on the internet archive for free). It will teach you the most fundamental of all programming languages, C, but almost more importantly: You will understand every other language afterwards more easily, especially a lot of design decisions in C++, Java, Rust and many more.\n\nIt has little exercises and some larger programming projects in it to directly apply the stuff you read about. The book might seem intimidating at 800 pages, but it's actually a rather swift read, there are just a lot of examples and additional explanations.",

Your comments about your portfolio website suggest that you got stuck in a “I have to pick the right thing” loop, and that stalled progress… and I’m going to assume (rightly or wrongly) that a similar thing impacts other projects.\n\nIf you’re anything like me… you start something, build up some good momentum, then reach a “decision point” where you’ve got multiple equally valid paths you could explore. At this point, you lose momentum, it stops being fun… and in your case, you move on to something that feels more fun again.\n\nFor personal projects (and, many a time, even professional work), better to deliver *something* that isn’t quite right than to deliver nothing at all.\n\nIf you accept that you might have to make big changes in the future (your “large front end revisions” you were avoiding), you can just pick something and see how it goes. If you like it, great… if not, you have another mini project ready for the future to redesign this to use some other design system (or whatever).\n\nAlso, yeah, you’re going to have times when working 8 hours a day on coding leaves you not wanting to touch a keyboard when you get home. Make sure you have another hobby (crochet is good) that you can switch to so you don’t burn out on coding entirely.",

The part of the kernel that does this, is called the **scheduler**, and it is also responsible for running the different threads in a multithreaded process.\n\nThe difference between concurrency and parallelism is very important. You can have a concurrent system that never runs anything in parallel...for example an event-driven system. A concurrent system *can* be parallel, but doesn't have to be.\n\nAlso, bear in mind, that neither multithreading nor multiprocessing guarantee actual parallelism. They are a requirement for it, but it is absolutely possible to have a system that is concurrent, but not parallel, using either of those. For example, currently (as the GIL is still in place), a threading python program is multithreading, it is concurrent, but it is not parallel processing, as only one of those threads is allowed to run at any given time.",

It's more useful to know how you'd practically use concurrency.\n\nGenerally, you can either pass messages between processes, or share memory.\n\nIn the former case, you create a pipe between two different processes, and then send data from one to the other through the pipe. This is convenient, but there's a cost to it; the message itself must be copied and typically you'll have to make a system call to the operating system to do it. Still, it's great when you don't have much data to send or you need to compose different programs together and make them talk to each other (as in most command shells).\n\nIn the latter case, there's the risk that two different threads will edit the same piece of data at the same time. To prevent this, you can use atomic operations and/or mutexes. An atomic operation is guaranteed by the language to make other threads wait to mess with the variable until you've finished reading or writing to it. A mutex is a lock that only allows one thread at a time to lock it. So, you can lock the mutex, mess with the variable, then when you're done, unlock it and let another thread do whatever it wants.",

Small achievements should always be celebrated - especially when overcoming hurdles that have held you back a while.\n\n\nI'm a middle-aged hobbyist, and one of the things I've learned when pursuing other hobbies (Chinese, guitar, etc) is small steps. Good to have goals but need to crawl, walk and eventually run in that order.\n\n\nMost never get near to achieving their original goal because either their original goal was too ambitious and / or there is too large a gap between the effort and the end i.e. the amount of used guitars on sale when people realise that just learning to strum EAD chords takes approx 2 weeks of work.\n\n\nGlad to see another person presuming the time honoured text adventure (or in your case a CYOA). I too, have a number of goals that eventually included creating a MUD [multi-user dungeon]. I'm working on baby goals by first completing CS50x, then working ony simple RPG character generator.\n\n\nThe key is simple: get the basic concepts  working, then expand. Can I do points allocation for stats and include out of bounds error checking? Great! Can I get player input for name including out of bounds error checking? Better! Can I expand upon that and create a banned name list ruleset, et al?\n\n\nGoing in with lofty goals from the get-go, sees them cut down to size, and either the initial motivation disappears or one adjusts and creates smaller goals w/ a more realistic expectation.\n\n\nIf the original motivation remains intact, and one can embrace and actively enjoys learning - and has a realistic timeframe - then go for it!\n\n\nKeep your CYOA - simpe, very simple - to start. Once you have the basic structure, good method to handle and track decisions, then think about expanding. \n\n\nAll the best",

Take a look at different jobs that are going in your area, what is hot, what is not, what you like, what you don't like.\n\n2. Make a note of the skills listed in the Job Descriptions (JD) for all of these jobs. You'll notice these jobs can now be categorized into job groups, based on the skills required. These grouping will be based on things like languages/frameworks/technologies etc. There will be dozens of these job groups.\n\n3. Now based on what you learned in boot camp, pick a job group for which you think you have the most skills.\n\n4. Next identify the skills you don't have for that job group and go away and learn those skills to at least a basic level.\n\nWhy do this? Because at the end that process you can confidently craft a resume that lists ever skill set required for the job group. \n\nThat then means your resume has a better chance of getting through the vetting process should you apply.\n\nIn summary, if you want to get a job in IT you'll need to make sure you have at least a basic understanding of every skill listed on the JD for the role for which you are applying.",

Then it turned out that I couldn't ever do the job of a senior computer programmer because of a brain disability. If you're interested in the details of my brain disability, read this GitHub issue I created seeking a workaround: \n\nhttps://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/159406 \n\n👆🏼 Basically I can only handle codebases that I am not the designer and author of if that codebase has fewer than a (relatively small) number of lines of code in it. I got around this issue as a junior developer by having a senior developer tell me, for every task I had, which file or class the code fix needed to be made in. That being said, eventually the senior developer got tired of holding my hand and spoon feeding me and then I got fired. Eventually employers caught on. \n\nBut yeah, in short, you could literally have a 4-year degree in Computer Science from MIT and then discover that you cannot work due to a very specific brain disability. Life's not fair. Unpredicted shit happens.",

        "body": "It is a difficult question to answer, because, yes, programming IS mostly about plugging things together smartly, but the thing is, that that has always been the case!\n\nWay back in the 1940s, \"programming\" was about literally plugging computing equipment together in the order needed to run the calculations you wanted. The ENIAC computer was programmed by connecting wires between components that did addition, subtraction, multiplication, comparison, storage and so on!\n\nBut of course that was very low level, and programming languages then came about, that did the job for you. You wrote \"A = B + C\" instead of plugging C and B into the addition-component, and the result into the A component.\n\nAnd as programming projects grew, you didn't write code for mathematical functions yourself, there were libraries for that, you write Math.sin(X) to calculate the sine value of X, you never write the lower level calculations yourself.\n\nWhen programmers repeat code, then instead write functions to reuse, and when those functions are needed a lot in every project, they become part of a shared library, or often the programming language itself. No one writes code to sort a list alphabetically, there's always a built in .sort function, that you don't even need to know how work.\n\nAnd when you write applications that look a lot like each other - say a web-interface to administer a database with users and their logins - you don't write the same code over and over, but do it once, and create a framework, or even easier, use a framework written by someone else! \n\n**But!** And this is the important part! - There's always something missing! The application you are working on will always need some feature that isn't in the framework, or library, or language, and then you have to write it yourself. You always have to \"dive down in between the cracks\" and write filler-code for that one thing or another. \n\nAnd also, to connect the components you still use very basic programming at the lowest level available in the language, variables, for-loops, if-statements and functions are still as important building blocks as they have ever been. \n\nSo you won't get away from needing to understand basic coding - but mostly you don't have to write very much from scratch, you almost always build on something existing!",

Sometimes you're plugging together things that you wrote, sometimes you're using something that someone else wrote. But we're always plugging things together. \n\nLet's say we're writing something that needs data from an API. Well, I'm not writing my own network layer or HTTP client, that's a waste of time -- someone else did that. So I'll write a class that handles using an HTTP client to pull down data from an API and do something useful with it. Cool. Now I have something that can be plugged into a larger system to do other things based on that data. Rinse, repeat until you have a program that's solving a unique problem (or solving an old problem in a new and hopefully better way). \n\nA core rule of our craft is \"don't reinvent the wheel\". If something already exists to do what you need to do, use it. If it doesn't, write it yourself. But generally speaking once you get past the educational phase and into the real world, you're solving unique problems within a certain domain -- medical billing, insurance, manufacturing, banking, flight scheduling, game development, whatever. You're not going to find ready-made solutions to everything within that domain, so you'll by designing and implementing solutions with the lower-level stuff as building blocks.",

No catalogues necessary. \n\nOf course, people are always a mixture of both to a greater or lesser extent.

But if you just want to have fun and you don't really have a clear path and you just want to build and learn then I don't see why not, go ham and smash your keyboard until something cool is built. But if you have a clear goal, like mobile development, or embedded systems or web development, then I think watching crash courses that focus on that alone is a lot more beneficial if you're trying to master your field of interest. It's good to be curious, but doing 3 different crash courses on completely different things can lead to fatigue and burn out, at least that was my experience when I did that.",

I also don't get why this is courageous and hard. That gives vibes like you're only doing this because you don't know what to do and don't want to work.\n\n\n\nWhat stopped you from learning until now? Everyone says the same thing about how passionate they are; but if you ever had a computer or even a graphing calculator then you could have learned. This seems like the only thing people ever say they're passionate about before they have even tried it. And they always say it after talking about games.\n\n\n\nAgain, this is really the default thing to say. Someone wants to make games. They're \"passionate\". Never tried. They don't know what to do about their career. You could pick almost any 18-25-year-old boy and they'll say the same thing.\n\n\nThe point isn't really to discourage you but instead to encourage you not to limit yourself to the only thing that feels safe: games and internet. I think it's pretty cool that you're studying to be an electrician and yet you talk about it like it's nothing.\n\n\nEveryone grows up and has to work. You can't be 20 and having a mid-life crisis already, giving internet hugs while feeling fear and helplessness at the thought of adulting. I think it's time to unplug honestly.

(e.g \"woof woof\" for dog, \"nyaa\" for cat).  \n\\- The age value should not be longer than 20 for cat, 18 for dog\n\nTry and create that application. You don't need to use database or txt or external store. just an application that you can create Cat and Dog object in main function. It's simple application that make use of inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation that you mention. You will understand what, how and why in this simple application because to meet all of the requirements I listed, you have to use all three of the OOP concept that you mention.",

It's a silly thing to need to know how to do, but it really helps, and you'll start getting \\*much\\* more precise at reading/writing/debugging syntax in other contexts too.\n\nRegarding the actual topics, I agree with others that finding another textbook might be the way to go if your lecturer isn't working out for you. Many of the types of people who write textbooks are really passionate about teaching, and have put in a lot of work to put their own spin on these concepts. There's a lot of recs online that you can try reviewing.\n\nI personally really liked making my own versions of others' abstractions. E.g. at some point I wrote a program (mini search engine) that used my own version of the \\`List\\` interface with my own implementations of \\`LinkedList\\` and \\`ArrayList\\`. I also liked making a \\`Logger\\` interface supporting a \\`println\\` method that could interchangeably log to the console, to a file, to an encrypted file (with caesar cipher), and to a graphical window.",

Never implement an algorithm, if some exists in the language/library/framework you are using! Don't choose a sorting algorithm, use the built-in sort, that is always the most efficient one!   \nAnd for data structures, there are mostly only two choices: lists and maps. A list is an ordered list of items, where you can get, add, remove, insert any item you want. A map is a collection of items identified by a unique key-value, for instance user-objects with a userId. Every language has effective implementations of both, in Python it is list and dict, in JavaScript it is Array and Object, in Java it is ArrayList and HashMap, and so on. Most of the time one of these will do just fine!\n\nBut if you want to know more, you need a course in DSA - or a good book.

This could easily be handled by a single kernel thread when it comes to CPU load, so it makes perfect sense to create virtualized threads, which expose the same API as a kernel thread, but all run on a single kernel thread.\n\nWhen faced with CPU-bound work, however, user space threads are simply not that useful. No matter how you slice your algorithm, you only have a fixed number of threads capable of independent computation, so even if you run 10 thousand virtual threads per kernel thread, all of them together can execute only as much real computation (not waiting) as the kernel thread itself. Of course, since managing user space threads has some overhead, this is also a net negative in performance for CPU-bound work.\n\nModern server applications are rarely CPU bound, though, so feel free to go as far as you want with your millions of user space threads, like Go has shown to be completely possible and manageable.",

If your program executes on a single core, there's no benefit. Multithreading (and lightweight async execution) lets a program benefit from context switching where a blocked thread can surrender the cpu until its data arrives. The OS scheduler will do this with processes as well. As long as the thread can still do work on the cpu, there's no point in switching off. Also, do note that cpu cores are pretty good at parallelizing independent work and simulating in order execution. We've had cpus with multiple ALUs per core for example since the 90s and the hardware will dispatch parallel instructions as long as there's no dependency within the execution window. You as a programmer don't have to specifically ask for this. The same is true for things like hard disk caching.\n\nOn the multiple cpu issue, it is worth testing or reading more about if you need this. There have been notorious cases like Playstation where hardware designers shipped multi-core hardware only to find that the OS hardly ever used more than one and never more than two. On the flip side, there are cases like Sql Server on Windows, where the server absolutely can scale across cores to process large volumes of data. I know that's an IO bound load, but often the whole load is aggressively cached when the request comes in so there's low latency.",

        "body": "It can be, if the executor of the user-space threads is itself multi-threaded and runs on multiple system threads.\n\nUser-space threads are designed to solve a very specific issue - to reduce the time a system thread needs to wait on operations that block (think: locking a mutex, waiting for IO, waiting for timer,...). It is implemented thusly:\n\nInstead of calling blocking APIs, we call their non-blocking alternatives . The non-blocking version of the API works the same, but instead of blocking, it returns \"would block\" error.\n\nA user-space thread is a state machine. The states are the values of thread-local variables at the points where blocking operation is called. Advancing a state means executing all the code up to the operation that would block.\n\nThis advancing of states is done by an executor, which runs directly on a system thread. The executor has a set of user-space threads. It advances a user-space thread up until the point it calls a \"blocking\" that would block. It then tries to find another user-space thread in the set, which no longer blocks and can be advanced. If all the user-space threads in the set are blocked, the executor (ie. the system thread its running on) blocks, until one of the user-space threads unblocks (operating-systems do have API that lets you wait on multiple blocking operations simultaneously, until one of them unblocks).\n\nAs you can see from this, user-space threads are completely useless for CPU-bound tasks (ie. tasks that don't wait on blocking operations). You might as well just directly run such tasks as a sequence, because that's exactly what a user-space thread executor will end up doing (likely with some additional overhead).\n\nHOWEVER! A user-space thread executor can be parallelized using system threads. You spawn multiple system threads (as many as your computer has cores) aka. a thread pool. Each system threads runs an executor, but they all share the same set of pending tasks. Now the tasks (in our case, user-space threads) can actually truly run in parallel.\n\nThat being said, user-space threads, as tasks for thread pools, is not the best abstraction for CPU-bound tasks. If you don't divide the work evenly between the user-space threads, then some of the system threads in the thread pool will be busy with big long tasks, while the rest are parked, waiting for something to do.\n\nA better abstraction are tasks that can be automatically broken down into sub-tasks that can be done in parallel. That way, the thread pool can automatically spread the load among the system threads. For example \"apply this operation to each item in a list\" can be easily split into processing sub-ranges of the list, or even individual items.\n\nThis is why pure functional paradigm has gained some notable traction in the last decade. It is trivially parallelizable, because the program is ultimately a tree of function calls where branches (ie. evaluation of arguments) can be evaluated independently of one another.\n\nImperative code, much less so, because it essentially describes a sequence of operations that are expected to be executed in order. Transforming that sequence into multiple independent parallel sequences (ie. threads) is not trivial.",

Usually one process:one app but when you can and want to utilise multiple CPU cores you need more processes. That usually gets called multi threading but that's not what your operating system, or my concurrent computing textbook calls it.\n\nIn my experience outside uni, both these things tend to get called threads without much care for the very important distinctions. Like I'm seeing people talk about user vs kernel threads and it kinda sounds like when they say kernel thread they mean what I've called a process above. However windows and Linux both provide a kernel feature that matches my definition of a thread above. Not having a go at anyone we're all just using words the way we were taught to. Bottom line is though, if you're confused about what someone is saying about threads it's probably because the word means something different to them than it does to you.",

I don't know how much tuition costs and what your constraints are. I also don't know what the reasons are for your grade. If it's a genuine lack of understanding I'd reconsider retaking it perhaps. If it's something else like a personal issue or something maybe just focus on knowing the material in time for interviews.

Try to think of rules, win-fail states, interactivity, tokens, how it would loop. At the end of the day, once you know what game you want to make and what it needs, it's easy enough to learn a language or engine (from weeks to months). The hard part depends on how ambitious your project ends up being. Don't bite more than you can chew.\n\nThat aside I would start with Godot since it's free and that means C# most likely or it's own GDscript. Maybe some HTML for certain data management.",

I actually prefer C++ (I use the POCO library) overall because it lets me write the fastest code possible, and to access other C/C++ libraries directly (most of the core libraries you'll use in any backend framework are based on C++). But I learned to program long ago and I'm in the minority on that.\n\nFor front-end, you are ultimately always working with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. There are a ton of pre-processors that can compile, obfuscate, and otherwise turn code from some other source format into JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. For my part I just use those basics straight, usually with jQuery. But I've also used JavaScript compilers like esbuild (which I like because it's very fast).\n\nSo I think it's largely a matter of taste and people tend to mostly use what they already know.\n\nI think the main constraints are (1) if you're writing server code that needs to be very fast, you either need to master something like numpy or the equivalent JavaScript libraries, or use C++ or rust. In my opinion, it's easier to use a fast language like C++ instead of trying to cleverly use numpy or other C++-based libraries to make a slow language like Python faster.  And (2), because front-end code is always in JavaScript, if I'm using a scripted back-end language I'll prefer Node over Python, just to keep everything in the same language.",

If you start from python its hard to understand heap VS stack memory, memory leaks, pointers, parsing binary data into structs and other concepts. Its also the common intermediate language between many languages - many languages have integration with C, and then integration between the languages is done through C.\n\nYou may not use these \"low level concepts\" most days (depending on your job), but when you will need them (optimizations, weird bugs, integration with weird external projects) you will understand them better. You will also learn to appreciate higher level languages, and understand some of the \"whys\" in their design.\n\nThen, in parallel, python is just a great scripting language for quickly getting something done, can teach you how higher level languages work, and many big projects use it.\n\nAfter knowing enough of those two, i would suggest trying to understand what you like and want to learn/work at, and either pick another language popular in that domain or stick with C/Python.",

Everything is well documented with a virtually infinite amount of resources. \n\nI recommend W3schools for an introduction to any of the well known languages, and CS50x for a general introduction to computer science.

My job was to put together the backend of the core starter kit or \"platform\" as we called it. The frontend was also a generic frontend that could be branded and modify very easily, and my backend needed to work no matter what the client's ask was.\n\nEventually this became a much bigger deal with dozens of people on the broader project once the platform started selling. Back then though, it was a great time to learn how backend works in the real world without being tied to a client.",

Good luck.” What they should say is, “Here’s why you’d use X in situation A, why not in situation B, and what the tradeoffs are.”\n\nThink about how your best teachers helped you learn a difficult concept. They didn’t just throw facts at you, they used metaphors that hooked into emotionally salient narratives you already understood. They met you where you were. Docs almost never do that. They assume tabula rasa logic and ignore the emotional friction of learning.\n\nFor me personally, I can’t remember something if I learn it in isolation, like just reading the docs. I need to actually understand why I should use X or Y by thinking through what problems this solves. So instead of trying to memorize pandas functions, I focus on understanding what problem each one addresses. When I encounter groupby(), I don’t just memorize the syntax, I understand it’s for when I need to split data into groups and perform operations on each group separately.\n\nPeople think the software industry is smart because it’s lucrative, but honestly, most frameworks are born in corporate hellscapes, not classrooms. There’s almost zero thought given to long-term cognitive overhead, onboarding cost, or whether the tradeoffs even make sense outside the dev team that built it.\n\nWe don’t need more features, we need more epistemology. Teach people how to think through code, not just parrot API calls.\n\nDelete out of your mind “move fast; break things” a more mature ideology is “move slow; ask why”.\n\nAnd most importantly never give up!

I don't know much Python (but yours looks un-idiomatic), I can comment on the C++ though.\n\nFirst off, and everyone's gonna tell you this eventually, don't just write `using std;` because it will pull the entire namespace in; this is considered bad practice for a large number of reasons\n\nSecond: you should learn how to use iterators of the STL rather than iterating through structures manually. Your `vector_print()` (as well as a number of other functions) has a bit of fragile code to set up the loop. You can replace that for-loop with something like `for (auto i = vec.rbegin(); i != vec.rend(); i++) { ... }` as reverse iterators were designed for this exact purpose.\n\nThird: you sometimes just forget to pass by reference :') check `vector_to_str()` and see that you're copying by value.\n\nFour: don't write pointless comments, they become noise. Like [here](https://github.com/SkySaksham/Long_Integer_Arithmetic/blob/5d050435dadece69d950e1af788edbc25f9bb682/long_integer_arithmetic.cpp#L163), this is totally useless information and makes the (already kind of weirdly formatted) code less legible. Keep comments for blocks of code, or when you're doing something that isn't obvious. Don't spend your comments on telling us which loop this is, tell us what the loop is doing.\n\nFifth: you're really having trouble with vectors in `add_vectors()`. Ask yourself: why are you passing in the two vectors by reference, and then doing a deep copy? Your algorithm doesn't even need you to have an additional copy of the vectors, you can just pass them by reference and not modify them at all, just iterating through and doing memberwise sums.\n\nSixth: it can be good practice to preallocate your resulting vector sizes. While vectors can be dynamically resized, this is an expensive operation (since a new memory space has to be allocated, then each value copied over one by one, every time you resize). You can know that the sum of two numbers will have at *most* one digit more than the larger of the two (so n+1), and the product will have at most *twice* the digits (so n*2). You can preallocate memory using `std::vector::resize(size_t)` member function which this container has. \n\nThere are lots of other nitpicks, but this is probably good enough to chew on for a start",

AWS, iPhone, Facebook, YouTube among others were all launched in that time period. There was massive growth every year as more people got cell phones, wanted apps and social networking and companies moved compute to the cloud. Fast forward to 2025, everyone who wants a mobile app has one, everyone who wants on the cloud is already there. What’s the iPhone moment now? LLMs? One of the reasons they are being pushed so much is that this is probably the only hypergrowth market around right now. While there will always be a need for engineers unless there is a heretofore unknown radical increase in demand, one that AI/offshoring can’t meet, the past 20 years of growth are gone.

I had to actually request access to the full pool in workday and start filtering on my own. It's also possible that you two aren't aligned on what qualified for the role means. It's very possible that none of those applicants are actually qualified and they're picking the ones they feel can learn on the job.\n\nI'm not sure where you are but I'd like to share something...A few years ago I was hiring for a test engineer. We wanted someone in the US city where the office was, where one of the company offices was or possibly remote. Out of \\~2000 applicants 1500 were not even in the US (all of them needed sponsorship which the post explicitly said wasn't available). Of the remaining 500, 450 didn't live anywhere near one of our office. Of the remaining 500 we determined that 200 weren't actually real or in the US. Of that last 300 only 20 had what appeared to be relevant test or development experience. So out of 1000+ applications there might be less than 20 worth moving on or who you actually could hire.\n\nIf you're pressed then try hacker news or posting a listing here if it's allowed",

That's true for other types of engineering, but unlike building a bridge or a car, in software the transition from \"development\" to \"production\" is continuous.\n\nInstead of thinking about that, orient yourself to the job the software is doing, and what specific problem its solving for people. Under that perspective, there's a minimal set of things you need to do in order to do that job. Most of development planning I do, is figuring out what is that minimal set of things we need in order for the app or whatever to be successful.\n\nThe difficult thing about software, and what will take years to learn, is to understand the tradeoff space between doing something fast that quickly solves a problem but might have a lot of tech debt, and taking more time to do something right, and having less tech debt or ongoing costs. There's no right solution, and in different business cases you'll want to make different tradeoffs.",

We have pyramids to build.\n\nMaybe you \"finished\" implementing Amazon, now you can expand into better user experience, you can improve latency on so when users click, things update faster. You can optimize infrastructure so your website costs less to keep running. You can build analytics to study user behavior and increase user dwell time/user spend/whatever metrics to target. You can build software to remove fake listings and illegal listings. Even keeping the lights on is non-trivial as you expand your user-base you'll have scaling issues, internationalization, need to deal with local tax law and compliance, etc.\n\nEven if you chose to sit on your hands the whole time and just keep things as-is you'll eventually be subject to externalities: compliance things like GDPR and CCPA (user data retention), or your business will fundamentally be disrupted as is the case with Google Search (ads) and ChatGPT changing the way users query internet.\n\nI spent the last few weeks literally writing document to define Q3 work.

Generally speaking, if you are just building user-facing features, Android has a lower ceiling as most of the hard problems should be taken care of by the backend. You aren't going to build something out of a system design interview in your day to day.\n\nBut here are some examples where you CAN differentiate yourself:\n\n1) Building frameworks / features in a way that's easy to iterate on. What if your app wants to show every new UI screen with a certain template that serves a nice entrance and exit animation? Okay, now you have to build that animation out. But it would be inefficient for every engineer who wants to add a new screen to deal with that themselves, so you build it in a way with enough abstractions / modularity that it's easy to use for other use cases.\n\n2) Finding and solving problems that nobody knows exist, because they're not directly attributable to the product. Maybe your app startup time is too long, or you lose a lot of users while a certain page loads. You have the ability to improve this stuff and see incremental but significant gains in engagement.\n\n3) Influencing the backend / APIs - the backend doesn't always know exactly what's needed and what's possible from a mobile perspective, or edge cases that might arise. Being good at your job means you participate in these discussions, not just showing up to plug in their fully baked implementation to the mobile app\n\nI'd also add this: judging the value of an engineer solely in the context of \"What technically difficult problems can they build\" as if you need to be building something worthy of a case study in an algorithms textbook is a very junior way of thinking.",

Hell, you can spend another 3-4 years getting a whole second degree in something else if you want, and still be the same age as most of the student body(again, priceless).\n\n21-with-a-degree-and-no-debt is the most future any adult can possible have. Cheers to you dude - the \"Press Start\" screen is flickering right in front of you. Time to play.",

Companies have been known to backchannel and torpedo candidates who have gone on public record bashing them. Especially in the tech world, it's not unheard of for one C-Suite to reach out to another to \"warn\" them about a problem candidate. A close friend of mine was let go after her first 2 weeks at a new company after the CEO of the company we both worked at got wind that she was trash-talking her experience on Facebook. He reached out to another exec at her new company, pointed out her posts, and said it would be risky to keep her on. \n\nAnother is that some companies love to sue. This is especially true when people sign a non-disparagement clause in a severance agreement. If a former employee starts talking shit and the company catches wind, you could lose out on your severance, they could come after you in court, or just make you suffer through a legal fight you likely can't afford. \n\nAs much as I would love to expose the garbage companies I've worked for, it's not without it's risks and frankly, many folks aren't in a position to defend themselves.",

Are you getting past the resume screening at least? Are you getting recruiter phone calls and moving to the technical interviews? \n2. Are you open to interviewing outside of Vancouver, maybe even in the US? \n3. Curious how you’re fitting all of that experience on a resume.

Mostly to pivot and be eligible for new grad/student recruiting pipelines again. \n\nYour best bet is to continue doing internships and get a return offer.

The good news is that your background is genuinely impressive and you're not starting from zero like most new grads.\n\nStop delaying graduation - you're essentially in limbo right now and employers can sense that uncertainty. Graduate in August and commit fully to the job search, but expand your geographic scope beyond Vancouver. Toronto, the US, or even remote opportunities could open doors that Vancouver simply can't right now. The trades and military options aren't bad backup plans, but don't abandon tech when you're this close to breaking through. Get your resume professionally reviewed, practice your interview skills extensively, and consider contract or startup roles that might be more willing to take a chance on someone with your background.\n\nI'm on the team that made [interview AI](http://interviews.chat), and I've seen how much difference it makes when people can practice handling tough interview questions and get real-time feedback on their responses - it might help you convert those eventual interviews into offers.",

But he also was the AH engineer who cut people off, wanted to get in arguments over any little disagreements and would go on rants for over an hour if someone dared to disagree. People def walked on eggshells for him. The thing was, I think he basically knew there was very little they could do to fire him. This was in FAANG for a product that had many big time customers. Even with his AH behavior, he produced results even in his sleep. In my opinion he was like what teammates say about michael jordan, he wanted it so bad he didnt care if he was an asshole about it. It sounds great in sports but in an office job, it doesnt sound as great. He would tell my manager how to do his job. I could tell my manager hated the guy too but just was complacent with him.\n\nOne time I worked with him on something major. I could tell he hated my work ethic. Im not saying I was perfect but I felt like I was getting a hand on the work at that point. When I was done, my manager decides to have a 1:1 to discuss my work with him and I basically get a list of what I could've done better. I accepted it and tried to improve on it. But guess what was in my next review session when I got underperforming, all the shit that the higher level engineer had said about me. I accepted some that I felt I could've done better but tried fighting the ones I felt were unfair. One that I remember the most was that there was a merge I did that had too many commits. I admit that it did have more commits but it was because the change we worked on had like 20 different iterations because everytime I wrote one change in, it broke something unexpected so it was a lot of trial and error. That one merge was an outlier from all my other work but it was used against me for the following year. I got Pipd shortly after.\n\nI saw the writing on the wall but I gave the company 110% and then I got fired early this year, a year after I worked with that guy. It definetley was the beginning of the end when that one higher level engineer. I dont regret it I tried respecting my work life balance and I knew early on the job wasnt for me.",

It sucks that you are getting singled out, but you might be working on particularly sensitive or critical stuff and that might justify a much stricter review process.\n2. If you think it’s unjustified then you could try and have a 1:1 chat with the person in private and try to figure out what the problem is. You should not assume malice, they might be very busy. If you made an RFC previously, you should be ready to say you solicited feedback early and these concerns never came up, and that you’re finding it difficult to make progress at the moment because this late feedback is asking for major overhauls. You’re hopefully looking for them to back down, or for compromise, and to figure out how to avoid this problem in future. I would also think carefully about what this person is likely to respond positively to if you want a positive outcome, much depends on the individual here.\n3.

The junior is paid like a junior so they'll easily find a better deal somewhere else once they have more experience.\n\nThe current system of hiring juniors, training them up and hoping they don't leave at the first opportunity is unattractive to employers and consequently makes junior roles less plentiful.",

This was masked by the 2012->2022 software boom driven mostly by VC money that finally died down.\n\nTo some extent mobile development (Android/iOS) created some demand, but you need a bit higher skill to get into that even as entry level and that market is also massively slowing down lately.",

The first company literally created an impossible promotion requirement (you need to break production to get promoted, seriously?) and the second one wouldn't give you the senior title despite you interviewing at that level. You were doing senior-level work for years, mentoring people, doing system design and architecture - that's what matters, not some arbitrary title that got screwed up by bad management and weird rubrics.\n\nThe job market is brutal right now and you're getting filtered out because of title inflation, not because you lack the skills. If you were the longest-tenured engineer doing senior work but got stuck with \"Engineer I\" because of a broken system, then putting \"Senior Backend Engineer\" reflects what you actually did, not what some dysfunctional HR system labeled you. Just be prepared to explain the work you did in interviews - your experience speaks for itself.

Its not the shiniest anymore but companies actually use it in production. Next.js is also huge right now if you wanna go that route.\n\nThe thing is, at this point its less about picking the \"perfect\" stack and more about getting really good at one thing. Companies would rather hire someone who's solid at React than someone who kinda knows React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte.\n\nWe see this at Metana all the time. Students who try to learn everything end up not being great at anything. The ones who pick a stack and build 2 to 3 real projects with it are the ones getting hired.\n\nBuild stuff that actually does something useful. Not another todo app lol.

I know lots of teams that have much \"harder\" interviews but then the actual role turns into just doing dull, bite-sized tickets assigned by somebody else.\n\nSo my only conclusion is that a team's hiring practices are, at most, a relatively weak signal about the team culture and the nature of the work.\n\nI would not try to draw any strong conclusions from your hiring experience. Instead, I'd try talking to the hiring manager, talking to somebody on the team and asking questions to understand the day-to-day experience as well as the broader context around the team and the work. This isn't full-proof—I just left a miserable role at a company despite talking to multiple past coworkers who seemed happy there—but, with social questions, *nothing* is fool-proof.

That said, the military is no jobs program, when in you exist to serve, and that service is a sacrifice. If you want to fight, if you want to serve, do it, otherwise, you could easily end up worse off where you are today, in ways that will be difficult for you to imagine right now.\n\nTherefore, you need to try harder to make what you have now work. Expand your job search, hit pavement, look for roles outside of CS, be willing to move. You gotta hustle, and one way or another that's going to require a bunch more work that you are currently doing. Good luck!",

If you do it solely for your own career and everyone/thing comes second, life will suck for others, and as I've seen personally, men will die. If you do that, fuck you.\n\n2. There's lots of roles related to this field, particularly in the AF. Look into those.\n\n3. If you do it, and serve honorably, you will not regret it. Of all the good, the bad, and the ugly, and there was a lot of ugly, it's the greatest point of pride in my life and I'm thankful every day that I did it. I gained so much, both materially and non-material. \n\n4. Talk to actual vets/actives about it. Do NOT listen to anyone here who did not serve. My DMs are open. I was USMC infantry, but I have a lot of connections across fields and branches.\n\n5. It WILL help you in the job market. Good vets that get and into stem out have a great reputation of working hard, thinking critically, and being able to work under pressure. I was asked a lot in interviews about how my prior service related to my think critically and problem solve, as well as leadership roles. I always tied it into technical projects in college, but it gives you a fat jump in the game.",

I know somebody who spent 2 months at work before he was given anything to do aside from trainings. That was partially because it was a job at a bank and there was a lot of red tape, but also...just a super awful onboarding process.\n\nI just started a job recently, and my onboarding was kind of a mess too. HR person was on PTO and nobody picked up the slack. My manager eventually messaged me halfway through the day, but I had next-to-no guidance my first week. I just sorted my system out and noodled around company docs. Fortunately it's a remote position, so I just got to hang out and play videogames in the dead space. Not as much fun to do nothing all day when it's onsite. Sorry homie.\n\nIt sounds like you're doing the best you can. I'd ping your manager again just to check in and see where things are at, but not in a *needy* way. Just ask if there's anything you should be doing while you wait on the onboarding stuff, but I'd try to write the message in such a way that you are not concerned/bothered by it. Not a great move to annoy your manager on your first week, but it is still their job to...do something. Or at least let you know that this is how onboarding always goes.\n\n> he called me and we had a 3 min team chat where he said he would assign me an onboarding guide\n\nThis is the one thing that hits me weird. Was it *actually* 3 minutes? Not even 10? That's an alarmingly short intro call. If that's the case, I'd be prepared for him to be a very dont-give-a-fuck sort of manager. Ideally, that means your work life is chill, and not that everything is a scramble and you look bad because your manager doesn't do their side and throws you under the bus after the fact.\n\nI wouldn't sweat it yet, but there are a ton of managers out there who...need to be managed.",

I'll do this for the time being until I can land a much better-paying job that's at least IT-related or adjacent.\n\nAt this point, it's just outright borderline impossible to even get your foot in the tech work field door right now because there's just no way to get the necessary experience without time-traveling back to the past when entry-level jobs still existed or without compromising a lot of money(certain certifications, unpaid personal projects, volunteer, etc.). \n\nIt's also gotten rather tiresome for me to see quite a lot of out-of-touch folks in so many CS subreddits making the boomer assumptions that all of the latest CS grads who are unemployed are just too unqualified and incompetent for any job in tech and that they supposedly didn't try to get internships during college. They conveniently ignore that even CS internships have gotten a lot more incredibly competitive, selective, and oversaturated now than ever because they're aren't negatively affected by today's poor job market, especially in tech.\n\nOn the bright side with my temp agency work, despite not paying a liveable enough salary, at least the job itself was pretty laid-back in my experience when I briefly did it during my short time off from college before graduating.\n\nSorry for this TL;DR-length comment.

That time I’m there was very little emotion. The next team I worked on, I spent 6 years going from a mid-level to and lead. Over 4 years I got to build out an awesome team. Not just developers, but a few BAs, a PM, and a QA team. This was for two huge projects. Nothing makes people close like time in the trenches. We all became great friends. After the second project launched, I needed a change of scenery and a great remote opportunity opened up that would allow me to move home. Resigning from that team was the hardest decision I ever made. Some of those developers couldn’t hardly write OOP code when they started with me and by the time I left, we were a well oiled machine.  Not a day goes buy 2 years later that I don’t think about them.\n\nThe last two years I had the chance to build a software dev practice from near scratch. It has been a great experience, and some of the folks I’m really going to miss when I leave in about two weeks. This time I knew it was the right decision to leave (bad culture fit, lost a big contract for reasons the dev team had no control over, inconsistent / lack of full time adjacent support, and never ending dangling of carrots that always vanished when they were to materialize). Am I going to miss my team? For sure. Some have become friends like my last team. But the reality is that for them to grow as well, I need to move on. They rely way too much on me and I failed to get them to fly on their own because of pressure from the top to deliver now now now. \n\n My new role is a director of software engineering, so it’s going to be a new experience for me… but I will always appreciate the folks I work with daily. I don’t think leaving good people is ever easy. It’s great when you can challenge each other just the right way, attack problems with some out of the box solutions, and just being nerds together in general. \n\nAt the end of the day though, you have to worry about your and your career progression. You don’t want to be the guy/gal that sits for 10 years on a project and never gets to grow or even totally stagnates. It’s human to care, but at the same time be happy for what you all accomplished together and leave on a high note.",

You just need to showcase it properly and target companies that don't filter purely on pedigree. Experience and interview prep do matter. But so does clarity about what you actually want. Do you want to go deep into systems? Build user-facing products? Work on small teams or at scale?\n\nPigment self discovery helped me figure out what kind of engineering I'm wired for when I was stuck between chasing prestige versus finding purpose.

A lot of successful engineers don't start at FAANG, and plenty of people who do start there end up leaving for smaller companies anyway.\n\nYou're in a pretty solid position. Full stack experience at a small company where you're leading features? That's valuable real-world experience that beats a lot of what new grads get at big companies where they might spend 6 months just learning internal tools.\n\nFor getting into big tech eventually, it really does come down to two main things: 1) having solid fundamentals, and 2) being able to communicate your experience well in interviews. Your portfolio projects + the feature leadership experience you mentioned gives you good stories to tell.\n\nDon't bother with a masters unless you want to go into research or very specialized areas. The time you'd spend in school could be better used gaining more experience and prepping for interviews.\n\nPractical next steps: Start doing leetcode regularly (like 15-30 min daily), practice explaining your projects clearly, and start applying to mid-size companies as stepping stones. Companies like Shopify, Slack, Stripe etc often have good engineering cultures and pay well but aren't as competitive as the absolute top tier.\n\nFor the behavioral side of interviews - this is where a lot of engineers struggle. You need to get good at telling stories about your work using frameworks like STAR. That's actually why I built Score My Interview, because so many talented engineers miss out on opportunities just because they can't evaluate and communicate their impact clearly.\n\nThe comparison thing is tough but remember - social media shows highlight reels, not reality.

The old guys I know in this business, do not give a shit were you used to work. They barely care where they worked. And no one outside this business cares who you work for. \n\nNow, how do you advance your career. Try to stick it out for two years in your job (but it's okay to bail if a better opportunity comes along...becoming the CTO of your buddy's start up is not a better opportunity), then move on to the job, work another couple of years, three if you like it. Then move on. Every time you change jobs, you will get more money. More importantly, you will increase your breadth of experience. You'll be exposed to more approaches to development. Which will make you better able to advocate for one approach over another. It will also help you understand what really matters vs. what's just noise.\n\nEventually, you'll want to start increasing your time in jobs just to show you're not a job hopper. However, you wil reach a point where it really doesn't matter. My default advice is keep your linkedIn profile up to date, turn on the quiet open to work flag, and respond to every recruiter that isn't a clear scam, even if it's to say, \"thanks, but this isn't the right opportunity for me\".

Let alone per week. The type of company you join is very much in your control.\n\nThere is a bit of a differentiation between after-hours calls and business-hours calls though. During business hours there's all sorts of support issues to work through, but I'd never really describe them as all hands on deck critical production incidents. Either way, during business hours I'm OK with incidents. That's stuff I work through as a normal part of my job. It's the after hours prod fires that I'm not OK with.\n\nHere's my anecdotes for after-hours on call incidents:\n\nCompany 1: I was called once in my 3.5 years here. The team as a whole was called a couple times I think. There weren't any during business-hours support fires either.\n\nCompany 2: Across 5 years, there was a single after-hours prod fire I had to deal with. There were some small fires during business hours, but nothing major. Even if we didn't get them fixed during business hours, we'd just wait until the next day to fix it, so it was a very casual business as usual.\n\nCompany 3: Across 2.5 years, 0 after hours calls. This company was a bit of a shit show, so they had a lot of small fires during business hours, but again nothing was ever serious enough that it couldn't wait until tomorrow morning. We were not working after 5pm.\n\nCompany 4: Only been here a year, but so far 0 after hours calls.",

So most emergencies result in just swapping to disaster recovery instead of an all-hands-on-deck incident. This is at a financial institution and they are naturally more cautious. There's no such thing as \"move fast and break things\" here. It really depends on the type of company you join.",

Particularly in CS this is true because you’re probably getting interviewed by people in their 30s/40s who went to this degree purely for passion. The rise of the job market was an upside from the desired major. \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/335277092_Exploring_factors_influencing_the_continued_interest_in_a_computer_science_major\n\nWhite paper researching the success predictors in career an education related to CS, passion was among the most important. \n\nIt’s also definitely a sentiment on a lot subreddits and in person anecdotally. I have a couple friends struggling to find jobs, but they all became programmers after a career of passion or major of passion. All the folks who majored in CS because they wanted to make games or loved coding are fine. Some had to make career pivots (leaving games industry mostly cause that market is toxic as hell). \n\nThe major is no longer the automagical 6 figure pumping major it was 10 years ago, but those who love the craft are finding jobs. Being on forums or discords about coding, going to hackathons, etc. \n\nI also should note I think this is a bad thing and always has been. Teams that require you to be really into it are usually toxic workaholics and creat a poor environment for long term retention. But now every job wants that and it’s leading to overworked and burnt out high performers and disenfranchised adequate performers. ",

Most companies wouldn't even let a junior dev talk to clients without supervision, let alone own the entire relationship.\n\nI've seen this pattern before. Companies dump everything on whoever's willing to take it, especially if you came from QA and they think you \"understand the business better.\" But just because you CAN do all this doesn't mean you should.\n\nYou're not crazy. This is definitely too much for a junior role. Either push back and ask for support, or start looking elsewhere.

The AI does it at $3/task.\n\nOne day, we hear about another CEO who wants to “streamline” and cut junior roles, the next day, we are told to “stop panicking”, all while every junior I know is 200 applications deep with a few phone calls to show for it.\n\n\nI’m not denying that tech hasn’t been bad before, but for the first time ever, this doesn’t feel cyclical. It doesn’t feel like we gotta just “hold on until the market stabilizes”, it truly feels like there IS a replacement, there IS genuinely a reason to not hire juniors. \n\nLet’s say juniors do break into the market. It takes 2-3 years to move from entry level roles to mid level roles for most people. Where will AI be in 2-3 years? Even if we get in to the disappearing junior roles, I feel like it’s going to be the same uphill battle moving forward, AI won’t stop advancing unless we hit a wall. With each step up the AI ladder, the market is flooded with more and more people who can all work down (think seniors applying to mid level roles), so the people at the bottom (us) will be FUCKED.\n\n\nThis is all just my opinion based on what I’ve seen though, maybe there’s something I’m not seeing. I hope there is.",

Employers are expecting devs to be fully knowledgeable of their tools and languages, but also to use AI to quadruple their output. \n\nExcept, when you begin learning this stuff in 2025, it’s very difficult to force yourself not to use AI every time you get stuck, especially when your employer is expecting you to and their deadlines reflect that.\n\nTruly understanding programming comes from writing your own code from scratch, running into problems, and spending hours and hours nearly ripping your hair out trying to fix it. You can use AI to help understand small bugs or minor new technologies, but there is no substitute for building that foundation the hard way.\n\n**What should you do?** \n\nKeep using AI to get your intern work done, you’re already in and you’re doing your job. On the side, start really learning how to program. Since you’re already using JS, and it sounds like you’re going the web dev route so far, I recommend doing [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths). Start with foundations, then do the JS course. No use of AI allowed, at all. When you get stuck, you have to research on good ol’ google. After you complete even just the first project all on your own, you’ll feel so much more knowledgeable. Don’t drop the ball, make a weekly schedule and complete the entire course. \n\nEdit: As you learn more via your individual learning and projects, start incorporating this knowledge into your intern work. Start writing your own code as much as possible, lean less and less on the AI.\n\nOnce you’ve done that, you’ll probably have enough understanding to know what you need /want to work on next, be it PHP or something else. \n\nTo touch on your comment about REST APIs, this isn’t a language, more just a concept that you can get a general understanding of in just a couple days or weeks. The more you work with them the more you’ll understand. Again, do real research on this, take notes, and then experiment with making API calls in a personal project",

The problem is that your team isn't putting in the necessary work to ensure that emergencies don't happen and there are no mitigation strategies for when they inevitably do occur.\n\nYour team has a lot of bad practices/habits and unless your team is willing to recognize the problem, it's only going to get worse.

That’s not some big secret to your employer. They know you are still finding your way. And that takes time. But you have to be proactive and learn. The fact that you feel the need to constantly ask questions is good! Someone who doesn’t care to learn would not ask for help. Schedule 30 minute meetings with the people in your team and learn about them. What was their journey? What is there specific role in the grand equation? What about your manager? What’s their perspective of what the team does? Are there specific skills in tech you want to learn more about? Find people you work with and pry them for information.\n\nSee something you learn pretty quick is that people love flattery. And nothing is more flattering than having a young twenty-something come up to you and ask you “How did you do it?”",

I'm also assuming (maybe this is wrong) that you are progressively getting larger features/tickets and writing longer PR's over time? If you're not that is not good.\n\n>or how to make the system scale,  perform better....\n\nWell you should be learning by just being in the room and being in discussions with those that are doing the actual work of scaling the system. That said, nobody in their right mind would be letting someone with 1.5 years of experience try to architect their system.\n\n> implement patterns\n\nDesign patterns really aren't that interesting. I would argue one of the big problems in this industry is people trying to overuse design patterns. Build something that works first...once that thing becomes annoyingly difficult to maintain you can try applying a design pattern.\n\n>decide as a senior engineer,\n\nYes no one is going to let you decide things. You are very junior.\n\n>That being said, I wanna still grow towards a more senior role, like a senior SWE or software architect\n\nSenior is hard position that is still a long ways off for you. A very fast promotion to senior would be 5 years. I've seen many people that were very good in their role take 10+ years to make Senior. I wouldn't worry that much about it. Keep working hard and keep asking your manager for bigger projects.\n\nAlso, enjoy this time because eventually you are going to miss it. Your job is low stress, nobody is really counting on you for anything, and you have free time. This will not last forever, you will have deadlines, many of them will be unreasonable. You will be asked to make hard decisions and then people will bitch and complain about it you for years afterwards when it doesn't work out. People will want things from you. Nonstop. You will have meetings, hours of them every day. Even outside of meetings people will want things from you. I literally have to go hide in a phone booth at the office to go heads down because people are always coming up to my desk to ask me things.\n\nSource: was Senior at Amazon and was also Staff at Google.",

You're trying to do everything at once and that's why you're advancing slow. Pick one thing and go deep for like 2-3 months. I'd suggest focusing on system design first since that's what'll get you to senior architect roles fastest.\n\nBut something most people miss is that you can actually grow within your current crappy role. Those support tickets? Start asking why they're happening. Is it bad error handling? Poor user experience? Scaling issues? Then propose solutions during team meetings. Even if they don't implement them, you're thinking like a senior engineer.\n\nDocument everything you fix and the impact. \"Fixed authentication bug that was affecting 15% of users\" sounds way better than \"did support tickets\" on your resume.\n\nAlso, start a side project that mirrors what you wish you were doing at work. Build something that scales, implement proper architecture, use modern patterns. This gives you real talking points in interviews.\n\nThe leetcode grind is overrated unless you're targeting FAANG. Focus on building stuff and understanding systems.\n\nOne more thing. Networking matters more than people think. We see this all the time at Metana with our bootcamp grads. The ones who connect with other developers, join communities, contribute to open source... they level up way faster than the ones just grinding tutorials alone.\n\nYou've got this, just need to be more strategic about where you spend that energy. Stop trying to learn everything and start building something real:)\n\nYour current job sucks but it's temporary. Use it as a stepping stone while you build the portfolio that gets you out.",

At the time the max db connections was about 10 which to many of us didnt make sense because the design was meant to be more than 500. Through various debugging and unit testing skills I discovered that there was a potential deadlock that went unnoticed. I presented my findings to the team and after resolving the issue we starting seeing the max db connections go up to 500 as expected\".\n\nMaybe tie in the business impact of it too. Like it saved the company millions of dollars in troubleshooting or some BS.\n\nI dont see how this story makes you look bad. You didnt make the error, you found it and fixed it. Honestly, debugging skills is something that many companies value. Because many of these codebases are complicated especially in databases. If you can find a difficult bug in a large and bad quality codebase, you can defientely do it in a large, better code quality one. I would leave it and use it as an example.

Asking about *why* you have to do that is spitting in the wind.

Sure we have sprint goals and all, but it's not like school where we're handheld and given a strict syllabus of assignments. If you have bandwidth for more work, you just need to communicate that.\n\nEven if you're on one of those teams that's hyper-focused on keeping sprints set in stone where they refuse to pull in work from the backlog in the middle of the sprint, or if your teams tickets are support-based, you can pivot the conversation with your manager into asking exactly what you're asking us. \"How should I best use my downtime?\".\n\nThere could be POC's your manager thinks you should experiment with, maybe moonlight on another team and help them out for a portion of your time, maybe help take the load off your fellow devs, maybe experiment and dabble in tangential roles, maybe a million other things.\n\nIf your manager actually responds to this conversation with \"Sit and twiddle your thumbs\", or \"I don't know, do whatever you want\", that's a bad manager. There's lots of things they can do to help you grow as a SWE if you have downtime like this, part of their job is making sure you grow.",

In recruiting this is often referred to as a \"pipeline\" posting or approach. \n\nI've shared some thoughts below regarding the information that you brought up in your post. \n\n\\----\n\n**Timeline & Cooling Off Periods:**  \n  \nRegarding your viability, six months is a relatively short 'cooling off' period and most companies prefer to revisit after 12 months. This is generally a better timeline for a candidate building meaningful skills/experience/knowledge. \n\n**Interview Process:**  \n  \nHaving an initial 1-2 part technical screening and 4-5 part onsite (six total) is standard, and your seventh interview round being a repeat round indicates that you did show some potential but likely failed in one key element (coding, design, or modeling). Sometimes this can result in a down-level, but that might have been the reason for the follow-up, to confirm if they should reject or down-level. \n\n**Recommended Approach:**\n\nRather than trying to frame things as \"this position has been open for very long and you should reconsider me\" I would simply check in and see if they have any new opportunities that you can be considered for, and perhaps share some of the interesting work that you have been doing over the past six months that might make you more qualified. \n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with a periodic check-in, and hiring volume can often change things (more hiring is better for candidates, less hiring often leads to a more challenging 'bar' for talent). I would still expect that it could be another 4-6 months before they reconsider you, though.",

You're describing a completely normal junior developer experience. The fact that you're getting no negative feedback and they're cool with you taking extra time? That means you're actually doing fine. Companies don't keep people around for a year if they're truly not cutting it. But I get it, you want to level up and feel more confident.\n\nWe see this pattern all the time at Metana with developers who feel stuck. The breakthrough usually comes when they start building real projects and connecting with other devs who share similar struggles and wins.\n\nYour current role is actually perfect for learning fundamentals properly. Enterprise environments teach you things bootcamps and tutorials never do, like working with legacy code, understanding business constraints, collaborating with teams.\n\nOne year in is still super early. Give yourself some credit and keep pushing forward. The fact that you're self-aware enough to ask this question tells me you're gonna be just fine.\n\nYou got this man, just gotta be patient with the process :)",

There is a reason you are a junior dev and not a senior dev.\n\nThat being said a few words of advice from someone who's been doing this for 11 years.\n\n  \n1. The fact that you can acknowledge this at all and care about it puts you ahead of the game. This was all of us at one point, myself included. I basically lied to get my first job because I was so desperate and then I had to deliver. What did I do? I wasn't the smartest person in the room but I was willing to work more than anyone around me. I worked nights and weekends, not every one but when I had the time, I was working all the time. You don't have to do this forever, but I would recommend this to any dev new on the job. Absolve yourself of the idea of \"work life balance\", cause if you wanna be good and you aren't naturally gifted, its not gunna happen. Don't get me wrong, I still played hard on the weekends when I had time, but most likely, you are young and have very little responsibilities and you need to take advantage of that. Yourself in 10 years will be on your knees thanking you.\n\n2. I had a great professor in college that told me something I never forgot. \"A great developer has read for 15 minutes for every line of code he writes\". You need to read. Read everything, read all the docs of all the tools you're using, know them front and back. Read books, clean code, clean architecture (these are terrible books btw but you need to know them), gang of four, anything you can get your hands on about programming, read it and know it.\n\n3. You need to be kinder to yourself. Believing that you can do it is 90% of the game. Instill some fight into your spirit and dig in. No one is going to advocate for you like you can advocate for yourself. Positive affirmations, whatever it takes, you have to believe you are capable.  \n  \nIf this shit was easy, literally everyone and there mom would do it. There is a reason it demands a premium in pay. I believe in you, you can do this, its gunna take some work, but you have an opportunity here to build a career that people would kill for. Make the most of it!",

When I was building startups, I'd see people constantly worried about being replaced by someone cheaper/smarter/faster. But something Ive learned is that average devs who can communicate well and understand business problems are actually gold.\n\nAbout the PM pivot tho, honestly, it could work. You already have dev background which most PMs lack. You understand technical constraints, can talk to engineers without sounding clueless, and you've got that project leadership experience.\n\nBut before you jump ship completely, maybe try focusing on becoming a technically aware PM rather than abandoning code entirely. At Metana, we see tons of people who started as \"average\" developers but found their niche by combining technical skills with other strengths\n\nAlso don't let imposter syndrome make you quit something you might actually be decent at. Maybe you're not the next senior engineer, but you could be a damn good technical PM who actually gets how software works.\n\nGive yourself more time to figure out what clicks for you before making the full pivot :)",

It's a bonus if you're interested in what they're developing. Likely a more casual work environment with sharp people. Job security highly dependent on how successful the company is.\n\n\nWorking at a big company means more job security, way better benefits, 401k, and better company name recognition on your resume. You will have to deal with bureaucracy for basically everything. You can probably clock in your 8-9 hours per day and not worry much outside of work. Probably have lots of downtime as you work there longer. Clearer path to promotions and career trajectory. You can be successful if you just follow the rules and do your work as expected.\n\n\nSome questions you can ask yourself are - how big is the salary gap between the two, including benefits? Will you have to be an independent contractor at the startup for tax purposes? What is your personal situation like (i.e. if you lose the job, will your family go hungry)? What are your career goals? \n\n\nI was presented with the same situation when I graduated. I worked one day at the startup and ended up quitting in favor of a government job (they gave me the offer the same day). After 8 years in government now, 32 years old, I'm glad that I took the path I chose. I built my pension to over $100k, put a downpay on a house for my mom, have seniority on my team, basically impossible to get fired. \n\n\nI think the pragmatic decision would be to take the startup job, stay and learn for 1-3 years, then you can explore options after that with the skills you built. You're probably the most motivated out of college with the least responsibilities, so you'd be able to afford working extra hours.",

Also AI is going to take out a LOT of entry/mid level CS jobs very soon. You need to seriously consider if you have what it takes to make it in this industry given these market dynamics. If you feel like you have the drive.. then go for it and you may succeed.. but you need to be honest with yourself and consider a different, more stable field if you don’t have the passion for this field.

I have worked at Amazon and Meta. One thing which is good about Amazon is that each team owns their service/product/infra completely. So you get A LOT to learn in first few years. Compare that Meta where infra and reliability is owned by Infra teams and product is owned by product teams, product engineers don't get a lot of exposure on end to end tech stack.\n\nEventually this is a skill which is very transferable to other startups and companies. Plus at Amazon you are mandated to use AWS so you get to learn that as well which again is very in demand skill in industry.",
