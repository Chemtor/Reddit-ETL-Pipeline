        "body": "Writing actually useful tests in data engineering tends to be much more difficult.\n\nWhile there is some value in writing unit tests, the reality of most pipelines is that if you're using any sort of framework like Apache airflow or dagster you're just testing the framework itself which, while of some value, given the need to keep these frameworks up to date and the need to ensure breaking changes don't affect your code, don't really help you validate the day to day running of your pipeline.\n\nInstead, integration tests and stress tests are much more important. You often need to ensure your pipelines will work (or at least fail gracefully) with bad data and not hang with huge amounts of data.\n\nYou also have to deal with external APIs or flat file transfers where your assumptions will be based on the documentation the external party provides. You quickly come to realise this documentation is often old or just plain incorrect so building a test suite on it is a lesson on futility.\n\nThis is obviously much harder to do than writing unit tests of your own code and when the pressures mount of delivering integrations and new data products to the business mount, testing can often fall by the wayside with data engineers falling back on \"we'll test it in live!\".\n\nThis, compounded by the fact that setting up a testing environment that truly represents your production database/data warehouse can be expensive and time consuming all combine to mean tests are a much less rigourously followed discipline in data engineering.\n\nDoes that mean you should skip them altogether? Absolutely not, but ensuring you have 100% unit test code coverage is not nearly as valuable as ensuring a complex pipeline has a decent set of integration and stress tests for, say, 75% of its functionality.\n\nThe reality is that most data engineers will be lucky to get anywhere near that, which is almost certainly why they were impressed you wrote tests at all. It should mean that you approach the challenges above with the right mindset, rather than just avoiding them because testing is hard on data engineering.",

Source database keep changing their entities and fields, so that we ```SELECT``` from the wrong columns,\n2. Data that we expect… are more mendacious than we anticipated.\n3. Sometimes, data is forbidden from us because these data are personally-identifiable information and we have to first deploy our ETL pipelines first, so that our business users/customers verify that our SQL statements are correct and generate the right output.\n\nUnit tests are largely useful if you want to enforce a culture of \"make sure you cover your asses first.\" In a large corporate or public sector environment, however, we exploit gaps in either technical or structural (i.e. \"the data is not cleansed properly\") situations to push back effort.\n\nIs this bad? Absolutely. Companies and public sectors, however, care not about holistic software development (remember how **hard** it is to employ *zero trust model* as a way to develop our software, let alone ETL pipelines?).",

Simple enough. He couldn’t get it to work. Found out he used Gemini to generate the code…which was riddled with errors. The intern showed a poor understanding of the assignment and an absolute reliance on AI.\n\nAnother example: we get CSV dumps from financial organizations daily. One of the orgs had changed their CSV specs without informing us. It broke our pipeline, which led to garbage data being loaded, which led to dashboards being broken. Fixing this problem required long conversations with that org, their techs, our DBA, our DevOps.

This is all just a ruse to keep shareholders invested.\n\n\"Gen AI use for everything\" is a bubble that will blow up in everyone's faces, and its strengths and weaknesses will finally become apparent as to where it's actually deployed effectively only after that time.",

Ideally you also have tests that can be run before you deploy into a test/integration environment, and more tests that you can run before you merge your code to the main branch.\n\nTests should be done as early as is reasonably possible, to detect errors and issues as soon as possible, so that people waste as little time as possible creating and then hunting down and fixing defects.\n\nThese tests are built on certain assumptions, positive or negative, then 'Given [x] When [y] Then [z]'. DQ checks are there to catch when your assumptions on 'given' and 'when' don't hold -- something gave you nulls when it shouldn't, or some new code value came in for a column that didn't exist before, or some formatted number had a format change. You can't check the output for various features to detect if something went horribly wrong, and you can halt the process or quarantine some data so that it doesn't corrupt everything.\n\nBut those DQ processes should themselves be tested. Do they correctly identify certain scenarios and actually halt the process (or do whatever other mitigating action you specify). Otherwise, where's the confidence that they actually work?",

        "body": "I feel like I’m being called to respond here. I remember you commenting something similar under one of my posts. I was planning to write a separate post to address it, but since you brought it up here first, here I am :)\n\nWe really should make a clear distinction between testing **imperative code** (like Python, Java, etc.) and **declarative code** (like SQL). There are some similarities, sure, but the overall intuition is quite different.\n\nProcedural code is much more detailed — it’s built to operate on small units of data or small transactions. You can stop execution at any point, inspect variables, and debug step by step. You have full control over dependencies, can inject mocks, and create true unit tests (It is all very well described by many books and authors).\n\nThat’s basically impossible in SQL-driven projects (which is what I’m talking about in my posts). Here tests are essentially black-box tests you're testing the outcome of a whole query or pipeline as it runs through the SQL engine. There’s no pausing mid-query or stepping through line by line.\n\nHere’s how I see the distinction in SQL-driven projects:\n\n* **Data tests** — I treat these as part of the models itself. Like you said, they run at runtime. I think of them as *assertions* that validate whether the model can handle certain inputs.\n\nIn imperative code, it would look something like this:\n\n    def foo(request):\n        if request is None:\n            raise Exception(\"Request cannot be null\")\n        if not is_request_valid_from_business_perspective(request):\n            raise Exception(\"Request is not valid in this context because of X, Y, Z\")\n    \n        do_actual_processing(request)\n\nThe actual processing code is only meant to work with data that’s already been validated. If the data doesn’t meet the criteria, we terminate early and skip that specific request.\n\nIn SQL-based projects, I see data tests playing the same role. The simple, built-in tests are kind of like basic assertions like `request is None`. More specific, custom tests are closer to the business logic checks, like `is_request_valid_from_business_perspective(request)`.\n\nThe difference is that we place the test on a previous model in relation to the one we're currently building, and we run it against the entire dataset — not just a single piece of data. Unfortunately, if it fails, it can bring down the whole build, unlike in transactional systems where only one transaction would fail.\n\n* **Unit tests** \\- These focus on verifying logic rather than the data itself. The goal is to ensure that a specific block of logic behaves as expected. Support for writing this kind of test is limited (it’s available in dbt, but I don’t find it particularly easy to use). Still, it can be useful for checking that complex conditional logic works correctly or that your regex patterns aren’t doing anything weird.\n* **Diff tests** – These run the whole pipeline with your new changes and compare how the exposures or main models differ between the old and new versions of the code. It’s kind of like an integration test. It’s especially useful for explaining to data consumers what changed and why those changes happened.\n\nThese are all the automated tests I use in analytical projects, and so far, this testing setup has been sufficient for all my needs.\n\nSo, in summary, I agree with the distinction you made. I think about data test in specific way, I am aware that this is a run time concept and use it there.",

It could be directly from a source system, from a curated lake are, data model, or a cleansed area. \n\n\nThe idea is to drive a feedback loop to upstream and downstream systems by engaging data stewards to enact process, behaviour or policy change to drive long term improvements in quality. \n\n\nSometimes it may be possible to directly integrate with these systems to automatically enact change/fixes, but this should always be done with a person to approve. \n\n\nThe point is, what you describe are two different concepts entirely, and are not comparable in any way.

Data engineers often work within a data platorm or framework, so I am not sure what is being built where an integration test would be useful beyond valdiating results in a Dev and/or UAT environment.   \n\nThe link to your blog in your previous post is not working.

Then you have to figure out how you’re going to get your test cases hooked up in there. Tools like dbt and sqlmesh don’t feel like they scale all that well imo, and it’s odd to store database tables to test as yaml.\n\nPlus some more head scratchers about how you’re going to make ephemeral and idempotent tests, and separate environments.

In my experience (mostly feeding business/analytics reports) having good tests for business logic is more useful than technical testing (like is this column nullable or unique, etc) because I'm trying to minimize scenarios where the data pipelines succeed but the numbers make no sense to business people and then the business complains or stops trusting the numbers. And I find a decent amount of issues with technical data quality will be noticeable immediately, like if you try to upsert with a duplicate PK, the pipeline will fail and you'll get a notification. \n\nIt seems like you have the perspective of a DE working in a tech minded company where tech/software is the product, so it makes sense to have the highest possible software quality. This is not the case for all non software companies, where having old and shitty software is the norm and asking for budget increases gets you laughed out of the room. This culture filters down into who gets hired and what tools get used, so the business ends up with worse quality engineering talent all else equal. Sometimes that blows up in the business's face, other times nothing bad happens for years. Those DEs probably aren't going to write tests because they don't see the benefits, are too lazy, are overworked, or don't have the budget (or some other excuse). idk if that answers your question but i think it describes reality a bit better than the strawman arguments the earlier commenters provided",

        "body": "I've been working on (and failing at, honestly) getting data engineers to adopt proper testing practices for ten years. Here's what I've observed:\n\n1.     **Legacy Systems and Technical Debt** Many organizations are stuck with legacy data architectures - monolithic data warehouses, batch ETL processes built years ago - that are incredibly difficult to modernize. The technical debt from years of ad hoc development makes implementing proper testing and observability feel like trying to retrofit a Formula 1 engine into a horse-drawn carriage. Migrating to modern cloud-native stacks requires significant investment that many companies aren't willing to make.\n\n2.     **Lack of Data Engineering Maturity** This is the big one. Most companies still treat data engineering as a back-office function rather than a core engineering discipline. You end up with a mess of one-off scripts, undocumented workflows, and manual interventions everywhere. Very few data teams practice basic software engineering principles like CI/CD, proper testing, or version control for their pipelines.\n\n3.     **Resistance to Cultural Change** Data teams have historically worked in silos - engineers, analysts, scientists, and business teams all doing their own thing. DataOps requires breaking down these silos and adopting agile methodologies, which is genuinely disruptive to existing workflows. Leadership has to drive this cultural shift, but most executives don't understand data engineering well enough to know what needs to change.  You need to test at every point on the data joureny\n\n4.     **Tooling Complexity & Vendor Overload** The data tooling landscape is overwhelming. Every vendor promises to solve all your problems, but integrating everything into a coherent, testable system is a nightmare.\n\n5.     **Lack of Automated Testing & Observability** This is where we really fail compared to software engineering. Data teams still rely on manual SQL checks instead of automated data quality pipelines. We have open source tools now - Great Expectations, , dbt tests, and my company's DataOps Data Quality TestGen - but adoption is still painfully slow.\n\n6.     **The Meaning of \"Testing\" is Confusing** This one drives me crazy. When software engineers talk about testing, they mean unit tests, integration tests, etc. that run during development and deployment. But in data engineering, \"testing\" could mean: Testing your code logic during development (like software engineers do), Testing data quality when new data arrives in production, Testing data at various points in the produict process.\n\n7.     **Do you test in development when code changes, or in production when data changes? The answer is YES to both**, but most teams don't distinguish between these different types of testing. This confusion leads to either over-engineering development tests or completely ignoring runtime data quality checks. We need both static code testing AND dynamic data testing, but the industry hasn't standardized the terminology or tooling around this distinction.\n\n8.     **Regulatory & Compliance Challenges** Compliance requirements often prioritize audit trails over engineering best practices, creating friction around automation.\n\n9.     **Lack of Executive Buy-In & ROI Justification** It's hard to quantify the ROI of \"preventing data disasters that haven't happened yet.\" Executives see testing as overhead rather than insurance.\n\nThe frustrating part is that we know how to solve these problems - the tools and methodologies exist. But changing organizational culture and overcoming years of technical debt is incredibly difficult. It's like trying to rebuild a plane while it's flying.",

        "body": "I think the question is confusing a little unstructured data (image, video, etc.) and unprocessed structured data (raw JSON, raw CSV, etc.). My experience is on structured data, so I will be answering about this.\n\nIn my understanding, the value proposition of the \"lake house\" as opposed to \"data lake + data warehouse\", is to reduce the amount of tools and data pipelines required to get your data from a raw state to a state that your end user can analyze.\n\n1. data lake + data warehouse (from Hadoop ~ 2007 then cloud ~ 2015):\n  1. ETL 1: Raw data is extracted/transformed/loaded (ETLed, or just dumped) into the data lake.\n  2. Storage 1: A data lake is optimized for massive low-cost storage (S3, GCS, Azure blob, MinIO).\n  3. ETL 2: Data lake data is cleaned, joined, aggregated etc. into a query-able state loaded in the data warehouse.\n  4. Storage 2: A data warehouse is optimized for analytical-oriented queries OLAP. It is generally an expensive independent black-box service with its own internal file storage so it requires additional data transfer (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift etc.).\n2. lake house (from Delta Lake ~ 2019):\n  1. ETL 1: Same as above.\n  2. Storage 1: Same as above.\n  3. ETL 2: Same as above, but you're not loading into a separate OLAP service, you stay in your object storage and just store in a different format, a lake house format.\n  4. Storage 2: A lake house (Delta Lake, Iceberg, Duck Lake) is optimized for OLAP queries, but it can be created in the same massive low-cost storage as Storage 1. It relies on additional table metadata that allows replicating some of the features and optimizations that make the previous OLAP services more performant than querying a basic partitioned Parquet table. For example, compared to Parquet only, it allows: \n     1. transactional changes (either successful or not at all), \n     1. schema evolution (adding new columns without rewriting the whole table),\n     1. time travel to previous versions, \n     1. upsert/delete/merge at the file level instead of the partition level, \n     1. and related read/write optimizations.\n\n> 1 - One of the most common examples is the data lake populated with tons of parquet files. How different from each other in data types, number of columns etc are these files? If not very much, why not just throw it all in a pipeline to clean/normalize the data and store the output in a common warehouse?\n\nSo the key with Lake House tech is you can keep using your massive low-cost object storage for your OLAP layer as opposed to loading into an expensive OLAP black box.\n \nI have not detailed the generation before \"data lake + data warehouse\" (before Hadoop), which is mostly \"OLTP + data warehouse\", as you didn't ask about it.\nYou can find more details in this article from Databricks who makes Delta Lake: https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf\n\n> 3 - Will these technologies become the de facto standard in the near future, turning traditional lakes and warehouses obsolete?\n\nGiven their killer features above, I think so. But it can be a progressive evolution of your existing data lake, you don't have to trash it.  \n\nNow, \"lake house\" warehouses are still distributed \"big data\" warehouses, which means they shine in processing huge amounts of data in a reasonable time and cost, and they do that better than partitioned Parquet tables.  \nBut this is still not as performant as PostgreSQL on average data, highly specialized OLAP databases like Click House or expensive black box OLAP like Snowflake. Although, Duck Lake may be bridging the gap for average data, with its metadata stored in OLTP instead of file, and its highly performant single process C++ engine.",

Many of the systems that are older, but still very functional, are also very brittle. You don't change the file format just because you want to use a different format. You have to come up with a business case that makes changing the format worth it. BTW, cost savings are a terrible way to start a discussion to get money. Figure out how to make more money by changing the file format and you may have something.\n2. We have heard all about the coming of semi-structured or unstructured data for years. Like cold fusion, it is just 20 years away. PDFs are a horrible way to move data. They are designed for how the information looks, not how it is held. You wouldn't believe the number of escape sequences are used to make PDFs look good. Those are very hard to get the data out of. Ask your local data scientist how much they love pulling data out of PDFs. They'll tell you it sucks. The first step to using them is to get the info out of the PDF into text and then try to make it work.\n3. Not even close. 90% of what you hear about these \"coming technologies\" is marketing BS. Know what huge financial institutions, like BoA, and huge retail, like Walmart, use? They are still using EDI. Yep, technologies from the 70s and 80s. Why? Because it works and they all trust it.

You’re getting exactly what changed, straight from the DB’s transaction log, with no table locking, no SELECT \\* FROM hell, and no risk of missing updates between batches.\n\nBut just because CDC is real-time doesn’t mean your *pipeline* has to be. For example, at Estuary we separate the extraction from the delivery. So even though we pull changes instantly from the source, we can hold them in our internal buffer (cheap object storage) and forward them downstream however you want, hourly, daily, whatever. That gives you the performance and safety of CDC without forcing a real-time architecture where it’s not needed.\n\nSo yeah, real-time extraction doesn’t mean real-time everything. But CDC at the source is non-negotiable if you care about correctness.It also lets us backfill history or debug weird usage spikes by looking at the full change stream. it's absolutely worth it.",

        "body": "You need to see every state change.\n\nTake a CRM with a customer issue workflow. The issue may bounce between a variety of states through the day, and the CRM doesn't log all of the information related to the state change at the time it was made into a fully comprehensive audit log. This is even a reason why the system might have CDC enabled -- so that this in depth functionality is offloaded from the system.\n\nAlternatively, getting account balance and related details in a banking system on each transaction. Transactions may not log the actual remaining balance at the time, that's just on the account table. You might want analyses on lowest/highest value on account even during the day, or the amount of time spent below a balance level or in arrears.\n\nAll sorts of tables live system back ends may provide better information if all their state changes are logged to a full history table.\n\nYou might not necessarily *need* this now, but I've seen business want to convert to faster update frequencies and/or finer granularity pretty frequently. It is generally not that much more difficult to set up, and once you have the pattern set once it is just repeated for every other table.\n\nDoing it by default makes later development much easier. If it saves the work of just a single person for just one week in an entire year, that could be worth $10k/yr. Is the marginal cost of the full history more than that? Does it save so little development time? What if an ask for finer grained data came in for more tables? What's the lost value of all the data you *didn't* collect?\n\n---\n\nSpeed / latency and flexibility\n\nIf you bring this into a bronze style append-only log table, you have access to all the data essentially immediately. Any use case that could ever use just the latest state information without having to burn down the core database with excessive queries to get it will want to hit this instead. You can be constantly ingesting this data.\n\nYou don't have to integrate it into SCD2 tables constantly though. You could do that daily, or hourly, or every 15 minutes, or skip it on weekends, or do it monthly, or on demand. Because the incoming data is a full change log it doesn't matter how often you run the process, it works the exact same way. It isn't like snapshots where you have to run each snapshot individually and sequentially in order to get the correct behaviour for building a history, and you run into issues when you have to skip a day due to the source system having a planned outage because your DQ checks throw up errors that you're missing a snapshot.\n\n---\n\nEfficiency with actual slow changes\n\nIf only a small proportion of the data is changing over a given snapshot period, then you don't need to be sending the 10x, 100x, 1000x, or 10_000x data volume of the full snapshot just to make the state change (including deletes) calculable. You can get away with sending significantly less data.\n\nIf your integration process to SCD2 or other tables is set up properly, you can also get away with significantly less processing. Only the primary keys in the latest CDC slice will be updated, and only for SCD2 records that are currently active (or end after the CDC slice starts). You can filter the target table for the appropriate date range then semi-join on the primary keys to limit what you're working with. I've had this cut down the amount of data being processed when compared to snapshots by ~95%\n\n---\n\nAutomation and concurrent uses\n\nCDC is useful for all sorts of ways to use a database, and it is a fairly generic feature. Rather than maintaining lots of manual queries to snapshot data and then having to write more scripts to export it and transfer it, some SaaS come with built-in CDC processes where you can direct the data to be emitted to lake storage, or to an event system like Kafka. It may be significantly easier for the ops team for the original database to just enable CDC and point it to somewhere you can access, rather than managing and tweaking an in-house snapshot setup.\n\nIf the CDC is being evented out low latency as it occurs, it could also have multiple consumers. There may be other processes around the business that want to follow along on data level changes to trigger alerts or workflows, so that the business doesn't have to dig into the guts of a SaaS or overload the development team. If they're setting this up anyway, there's no need to then set up another redundant process for another team, they can just pull the CDC like anyone else.\n\n--- \n\nCaveat\n\nIf the data is changing extremely rapidly and outpaces the size of a daily snapshot, then you're probably not really looking at something that's typically usable as an SCD2 table, or at least one where it probably isn't helpful. You can often just have an append-only table for the CDC if all the data are essentially inserts, as would be the case for banking transactions for example. Or you might want to initially ingest into an append-only table, then on a daily run grab the last change per primarty key before midnight to generate a daily snapshot delta.\n\nIn any case, for almost everything you receive, always put it into an append-only table first, then work with it from there. It almost always make later processing easier and more efficient, it really helps with being able to test or scope out changes on real data, and if anything ever goes wrong with the integrated (eg SCD2) data then you've got an essentially immutable copy that you can rerun and restore from.",

Fail fast, if you will. \n\nThis means understanding your source data fields and testing them. This is especially true for json blobs where nested keys are expected to hold json data, only to find that the API actually returns null values or different nested values or keys based on other keys in the blob - yay. \n\nBut achieving this is not easy. You need to get in contact with the business owner / data owner to understand the fields and the business rules (and what they mean). And you need to ensure you've got signoff prior to deploying the pipeline, so that any failures can be reviewed with them before you make your pipeline constraints more lenient. Trust me. \n\nBut, the myth of \"we will fix it in post\" is real, and never actually happens once the next pipeline comes your way. Post-fixing methodologies are essentially like adding a second etl to your pipeline - which you will also need to maintain, and it's totally abstracted away from the source data pipeline now. \n\nMost analytics is quite removed from production systems, and business/ stakeholders want their data NOW. But part of any data pipeline is the \"people pipeline\", connecting people from the relevant domains into a single conversation so that parties can understand the risks and uncertainties and the business rules. \n\nBut, if you only build pipelines and you don't care about what happens after you give the data to people, or you don't care about the teams who need to use the data, then just build tests against your destination schema constraints. Bonus shortcut, just exclude all records that fail the test and magically your pipeline never fails. Business will think you're a rockstar! \n\nI strongly encourage KYD.",

Then, half a year later, after adding new logic, it failed right away pointing that something went wrong.   \n\n\n**Regression testing** could be the most rewarding. The idea is simple: produce two versions of a table, before and after applying the changes. Then compare them record by record, see what doesn't match, and try to understand why.\n\nThese two require the least investment from you yet bring immediate value.",

In most dataset this won’t be an issue at all and you guarantee that your pipeline or the source didn’t generate duplicates data which happens a lot because of a lot of reason or just because of reprocess of the ingestion.\n\nYou can test for expected values but I only have bad luck with those because the data we play with change a lot. Unless  your datasets are very deterministic or doesn’t change a lot I wouldn’t go there. Unless there’s an action do to on your end if you receive a new value.\n\nYou can test for data continuity (try to find holes). That help a lot. Most systems aren’t fully sequential because you need that all part of the pipeline support sequential task to deliver you data sequentially which is not the most common. For example at the moment you rely on s3 events, you’ve just lost your ordering. Can be interesting to build things in order but also to find missing data.\n\nAnd like you said, build test right (closer to your business domain tables), then shift left (closer to the source of data) anytime it’s possible. It’s usually easier to build a test that apply to a specific domain use case because you know what you want and expect. And it’s always better to test closer to the source.",

Of course you can do a lot of smart stuff; partitioning the data per day and such. But I'm quite curious how much data ends up in your reporting table, how you report on it and what tier you're using for your database? Scaling up a database on Azure can get very expensive.

Code native platforms are well positioned, while platforms with open ecosystems can integrate AI features more rapidly.\n\nConsider hybrid approaches where you use different tools for different use cases. Evaluate each tool based on your specific connector needs, team expertise, and budget constraints. This positions you to take advantage of emerging technologies and maintain flexibility to switch tools as your requirements evolve.",

When we shift to corporate, there will be politics involved or there will be some culture that you have to adopt. \n\nIn this case, sounds like the culture is not that good. You might not be culture fit. But it doesn’t mean that your bad or you underperform. It’s just that the company’s culture don’t fit your values. \n\nWorking outside shift hours is bad. There has to be some level of respect there. Not unless the role requires an on-call responsibility. \n\nDon’t be too hard on yourself, brother. \n\nOn the other hand, there are also some factors that might contribute to your situation. \n\nIt might be possible that your communication style ia different from the the comm style of your boss or your peers. \n\nFor example, there are some people who don’t respond via email. They respond via chat. You mentioned that you tagged your boss on a doc and he seemed to miss that. So, that might be an issue. Adjust to your boss’ comm style. If he wants a chat, then do so. His email might be swamp with a lot of emails so your email might be burried in his inbox. \n\nAnother thing is, in start ups autonomy is the usual culture. In corporate, it’s not always the case. There will be a lot of times that you have to have buyins from certain stakeholders. Even your boss. You need to push for approvals and sell the idea to them. Culture is really different. \n\nOn the issue of passive-aggressiveness. I might be wrong on this one but have you spoken to your boss lately? Have you communicated your concerns? One possible reason that it looks like passive-agressiveness is that you don’t speak enough with your boss.\n\nIn startups, speed is usually name of the game. In corporate, you can only do so much until your boss approves it. \n\nLastly, communicate always your work. It’s important that you become visible to your boss and he’s aware about what you do. \n\nIf everything still fails, even if have communicated everything, then it might be the time to loom for another company, specially if it affects your mental health.",

Keep in mind you may need to split each word in to its own line, keeping track of the original string it came from with an id, then join it back up so the spelling corrector is applied on each word. You can also split each word in the degree in your master table out so you can keep joining based on relevant columns. Hope this helps",

For CPU-bound crunching-tokenization, matrix algebra, image hashes-compile to WASM and call it from the warehouse; it’s faster than spinning up Spark just for one function and sidesteps Python’s GIL. External UDF servers shine when you already have a service in production, e.g., calling a fraud score API, but watch network latency and cache aggressively. I’ve used BigQuery remote functions and Snowflake external functions for these patterns; DreamFactory handled the auto-generated REST layer when we needed to expose those services without hand-rolling APIs.

A good observability tool can help establish a baseline and notify you if something changes.  \n\\- Some data sources have fairly irregular schedules, with frequent ingest during work hours, batch updates during the night, and no updates during weekends and holidays. You often end up with very loose freshness tests because you can't combine freshness with a cron.\n\nThe setup can be as simple or as difficult as you want. In the simple case, just create a service user for the SaaS and watch the dashboard populate. In the advanced case, you can spend months writing custom yaml tests in MonteCarlo, integrating Airflow webhooks, etc.\n\nThe crux with the more advanced tools that actually use ML is that they notify you of anomalies over slack, and they then expect you to tell them if this is an actual anomaly. When you set it up it just observes for a week or two, assuming that whatever you see during this period is normal. After this, you will probably start receiving a lot of notifications of possible anomalies. If your team is able to check with some domain expert, you can give the underlying ML model good input and over a few weeks there will be way fewer false positives.\n\nIf you don't have access to someone who can tell you if an anomaly is an error or not, these tools will be very annoying. If you do, you probably also have a good shot at writing meaningful dbt tests.\n\nThe more simple tools are more annoying. The anomaly detection is often a simple Z-statistic, so there is little chance of reducing false positives (other than accumulating more history). On the plus side, the simple tools are often open source or open core.\n\nLastly, a few questions to keep in mind:  \n\\- What types of failures are you looking for? Is it silent failures in the data ingest pipeline you created? Is it upstream changes to data structures, odd content etc that might stem from an error in a different system?  \n\\- What do you want from it? Is it for the DE team to check possible errors in their own system? Is it to notify users of possible issues?  \n\\- What is your tolerance level for false positives?  \n\\- How much effort is it to check out a possible anomaly?\n\nNone of these projects ended up seeing the observability tool as an indispensable tool. From what I can remember, there was one or two cases where the tool caught an issue before anyone else. But they are expensive, and there are mostly false positives.",

But of course, you might have your reasons. \n\nAlso, dbt only had community supporter SQL Server connectors, which can be fine, but if the community stops supporting it, you might fall behind on versions quickly (this happened for a while around the second half of 2023). Nothing of immediate concern, but something you may want to keep in mind.\n\nA while ago I had similar requirements but used Dagster on a VM for orchestration and hosting dbt (also storing data in blob storage), so I avoided Azure Data Factory and Azure Functions.

The answer to all of those would be either a \"yes\" or a \"it could be made to easily\" \n\n\nYour pipeline sounds great, good on you for using function app to handle different and varying api calls rather than making something over complex. ",

        "body": "Your architecture has a solid foundation, leveraging Azure's capabilities effectively. Using Azure Functions to handle different API endpoints is beneficial for scalability, while Azure Blob Storage serves as a flexible intermediary. However, consider integrating Azure Data Lake for more efficient data storage and retrieval, especially if data volume grows. Using dbt to manage transformations is great, as it provides modularity and enhanced version control, but ensure proper testing and documentation of SQL procedures to avoid potential pitfalls. Automating more aspects of your pipeline, like error handling and monitoring through Azure Monitor, could also improve robustness.\n\nYour pipeline design appears efficient, but here are some areas for improvement. Directly loading JSON into staging tables is fine, but you might want to explore the use of [Delta Lake](https://www.projectpro.io/project-use-case/how-to-create-delta-live-tables-in-azure-databricks?utm_source=pawan&utm_medium=reddit) for its ACID transactional integrity and improved efficiency in handling large datasets. Additionally, you can enhance the scalability of your Azure Functions by moving them to Azure Kubernetes Service if your function apps face heavy workloads. Incorporating better data validation mechanisms before data transformation can save time troubleshooting downstream inaccuracies. Finally, enhancing your logging and monitoring setup, possibly integrating [Azure Log Analytics](https://www.projectpro.io/project-use-case/building-data-pipelines-with-azure-synapse-analytics?utm_source=pawan&utm_medium=reddit), will provide better insights and faster response times to issues that may arise.",

These are usually:\n\n1. Business users: The folks looking at dashboards.\n2. Analysts: The folks diving into the data to answer novel questions.\n3. Reverse ELT: Platforms you send enriched data back to, often marketing.\n4. Data Science: Perhaps to answer questions 2 and 3 above, or to power your application.\n5. Application: Your application itself. Are you responsible for master data concepts like a single representation of a user that needs to be fed back to your platform?\n\nOnce you have a sense for these things you can then think about the technical requirements that answering those four questions and serving those five customers might entail. Often, these can be grouped into two big questions (the ones we're always asking first in this sub):\n\n1. What is the volume of the data?\n2. What are the latency requirements for my uses?\n\nFor example, making a dashboard for business users to see what happened usually doesn't require data more timely than a day. That's why so many organizations start with simple batch ELT jobs. From here, you can begin to build into the other use cases and customer needs. But, on the other hand, maybe you know that you're immediately going to be tasked with some application or data science need. Being aware of that could help you get in front of that problem and start with a more robust, lower-latency solution like streaming or microbatches from the beginning.\n\nIf, like many data teams, your first responsibility is to get the business users and analysts the data they need to understand what is happening to the business, I find [Metric Trees](https://www.datacouncil.ai/talks/designing-and-building-metric-trees) to be the most useful way to think about this. You can use this framework to anticipate the data you'll need to surface and to inform your understanding of how to organize it so that all the data relevant to a particular domain or user responsible for that data is co-located for their use.\n\nIn the end, it all comes down to your unique needs, but those various points are some of the things I consider when building out a vision for what the data team should be building, how they should build it, and when.",

Scope is also a factor, maybe it's just a data strategy within the eng group, but maybe it encompasses the entire organization. Some examples might be the amount you are choosing to invest in training and knowledge transfer with the business. How are you going to model your data, how does that decision align with your self service ambitions. What does data governance look like, if it exists formally at all. What are you hiring? What skillsets are you looking to develop, how are you looking to code all of this? Maybe you're small and advanced so you can tackle python and spark as the workhorse for all of your work, or maybe you want to make things accessible to as many people as possible with a low entry point to contribution, and you choose SQL or a low-cost/graphical workflow.\n\nThis is really just a few things to consider, and really a lot of it is bumping up against a tactical approach more than strategy, but hopefully it illustrates how a strategy of \"making data easily accessible to the organization\" has many different tendrils into various parts of the organization.",

Each have equivalent lengths. \n\nWhat I could suggest, before doing any dev work, do some data profiling.\n\nIn my previous project, we always do data profiling on the sources to check different metadata.

The reason why is that Redshift allocated the max length of a VARCHAR in memory, uncompressed. This wasn’t a huge problem if the table was not joined, but it became a really big deal when trying to run joins and if there was redistribution across all nodes. They would totally gum up speed transferring data across the network, and you really felt it when you were handling millions of rows.\n\nIt’s possible Amazon fixed this, but I doubt it. When I was there the most senior eng on that team did not understand why CTE’s at times took longer than temp tables.\n\nYou should test this yourself with runtimes (turn off caching before doing so).",

You can pick optimization and DB internals along the road -- you don't get to read the source code of modern DWH plus you probably won't be able to read them anyway, and most of the optimization guides are just a few web pages so you only need to memorize and understand those. And since you are just ingesting data into DWH, most likely you don't need to write raw ingestion code -- and even if you do, it is going to be way smaller scale than Netflix.\n\nBasically the task falls into two parts:\n\n\\- Gathering requirements from stakeholders and make sure you clarify every question before moving into implementation stage. It's difficult and sometimes impossible, depending on the quality of the stakeholders, most of whom don't know what they want anyway.\n\n\\- Put up tests, alerts and monitoring into each pipeline.\n\nThat's pretty much it. Apparently the people part is way more important and difficult than the technical part. It's essentially sort of BI analyst job.\n\nOh and good luck on Fabric.",

The brutal truth is that after 5+ years of experience, companies expect you to not just solve problems but to think strategically about data architecture, communicate trade-offs clearly, and demonstrate leadership potential. You might be nailing the coding challenges but struggling with system design discussions or not articulating your thought process in a way that shows senior-level thinking. The gap since March isn't helping, but it's not insurmountable if you can identify what's happening in those final interviews.\n\nThe good news is that reaching final rounds repeatedly means you're close, not failing. Companies are investing significant time in you, which signals genuine interest. Try getting feedback from those rejections, even if it's just a brief call with the recruiter. Practice explaining your architectural decisions out loud, prepare stories that showcase your impact beyond just technical execution, and consider doing mock interviews with other senior engineers who can spot what you might be missing. The market is competitive, but your background is strong enough to break through.\n\nI actually work on [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat), which helps people navigate those tricky final-round questions where the stakes are highest and the answers need to demonstrate real depth of thinking.",

That’s how I made the transition work pretty seamlessly. Obviously I spent lots of time outside of work learning on the side but here was the career path I took:\n\nManufacturing engineer: I had a few roles before this that were more design focused and even though I hated manufacturing it was vital experience to get my foot in the door for the next step.\n\nAutomation Engineer: worked and learned alongside controls engineers and IT networking experts to bring data from machines to databases for various use cases. Learned some PLC programming (don’t really use it now), a lot about networking and various data transfer protocols, and a lot of data modeling/reporting. I also got the chance to use some of my own data that I collected to mess around and try to build machine learning predictive maintenance models. The models didn’t perform well (for reasons outside my own control), but I learned a lot. I got much better at both SQL and Python and general problem solving.\n\nData/Analytics Engineer: with all the experience I gained from my previous role I was able to make my way into a junior data role by taking a pay cut and just speaking really passionately about data (which I genuinely am). Since then I’ve learned a shit ton about good programming principles/procedures, working in a platform like Databricks, and how to communicate with business partners about data projects.\n\nI’ve since been promoted in this role and absolutely love the work that I do. I find it engaging and I continue to learn every day. If you have additional questions let me know but I hope this helps a bit.",

I would say their program is pretty good for introduction to DE, I respect their contribution to the community. However, there are so many details or problems you need to consider when you are working a real-life project, and some of them are extremely critical for interviews. The lack of depth in their course design (because it's only three months) means you need to take the initiatives to explore way more than they provide to you within the curriculum, which also stands if you enrolled an expensive bootcamp. I was asked a system design question during an interview to design a real-time pipeline, so get prepared for a decent resume, different problems or challenges you might encounter during a project, lots of SQL questions, Python  programming questions (maybe not Leetcode style), and system design questions.\n\n  \nP.S, in my opinion, sometimes I tend to ignore some people's advice like getting a CS degree or get a job in the data field first. I am not saying they're wrong, but their suggestions are based on their background and experience. It stands 10 years or 5 years ago, but nowadays even CS new grads are also struggling to get a job, some people became a DE because there were so many opportunities. I might offend many DE but this is my point view.",

If you need stricter schema and permissions, throw up Supabase or Postgres behind Appsmith; business users fill a simple form while you still query via SQL. For our vendor-format tracking we store element, subelement, status, and comments in Airtable, then run a nightly dbt job that syncs the base into the warehouse so every pipeline sees the latest approvals.

This dictionary macro gets called by other dbt macros so they can look up columns available in a source table and rename them appropriately.\n\nIt seems like maybe you could do something similar with a dictionary where maybe you have an entry from 'Country1' and the value for that key is an array of approved fields. ...or another dictionary of fields for 'Country1' and the status you've given them?\n\nThen a higher-level macro could call your dictionary and say \"Ok, for 'Country1' I will loop through the approved columns and ingest them.\" \n\nAm I following you?

When something goes wrong, it's challenging right now to even answer what this table looked like yesterday. \n\nI'm thinking right now of an observer service and an anomaly service at least and have it extensible for different source types (Snowflake, S3) and table types (raw source, transformed source, transformed model). Checks happen on a cron-friendly cadence but at least once a day. Maybe even configurable indepdently by source, path, table or check type. Is it opt-in or opt-out?\n\nWould love to hear more about how you are thinking about it! I'm just starting to formulate my thoughts about it. And before any vendors come at me, don't bother, you're barking up the wrong tree :).\n\nEdit: I should amend this to say that we have a LOT of dbt tests and we are very good about defining a unique key and testing on it (not null and unique) so we generally know about fan-out problems but I'm more thinking the silent failures. Something is null all of sudden or data volume drops off a cliff or there is a significant skew in the most frequent values in recent data, amounts skyrocketing due to math errors, etc. Logic has changed somewhere so how can you be very certain that the downstreams aren't silently negatively affected.",

Job boards rarely cut it; I land work by hunting seed-to-Series-B startups on Crunchbase, hitting their CTOs on LinkedIn, and offering a fixed-price “first data pipeline in 10 days” package. A tight scope (e.g., ingest Stripe to Snowflake, build dbt model, hand off docs) shows value fast and opens retainer work for monitoring and cost tuning. Keep a public repo with Terraform + CI that spins up Glue, dbt Cloud, and a cheap BI demo so prospects can click instead of imagine. Upwork and Toptal help fill gaps, but your outbound brings higher rates-start at 1.5× your last salaried hourly. Full-time remote roles exist too, mostly at cloud-born SaaS firms; filter on “US only” to avoid time-zone pain and pitch your infra-as-code chops. I bounced between Airbyte and Supabase, but DreamFactory is what I ended up adopting because it lets me wrap any legacy DB in a locked-down REST API without babysitting. Treat yourself like a product, niche down, and stay visible-remote gigs do land.",

It helped because what would otherwise have been an individual topic only had a small trickle of records with occasional bursts -- not enough to justify running a separate streaming ingestion job for each, nor to handle the overhead of parquet+deltalake over individual row writes.\n\nSo we bundled everything into one big stream with a wrapper around each event to indicate which type it was, which just helped with later processing.\n\nThe advantage for us is we could run each downstream job on any schedule we wanted, all the data was there in the big ingestion table. Technically there is overhead with reading all the other data, but compared to reading directly off of kafka (or similar) it was still much faster to pull off lake storage.\n\nAnother advantage was the sharing of overhead on the streaming size. Basically all the topics combined shared the same overhead or cluster oversizing, so while an individual 'topic' might burst to 10x traffic, since it only makes up 10% of the overall bandwidth, it would not shift performance demands too much. It kept usage reasonably predictable.\n\nLow latency use cases still ran off the original topics. The combined one was just for long term storage and batch processes.",

Burnout is real, they should understand that to some extent if they are good managers.\n\nFor two different jobs when leaving I did part-time consulting to help support the transition.

I would never last there at what they were paying.\n\nPut another way, they could definitely find a 2nd engineer. They just aren't paying enough. This is probably a hard business pill to swallow/for them to understand at all. They could be paying half~ for your position remote maybe, but if they care about sitting in office that much they will need to pay.\n\nLot of engineers simply wouldn't go into office that much / might as well move to silicon valley and get silicon valley salary if I'm going in somewhere everyday. \n\nJust my opinion.",

Treat your warehouse as a feature store for documents: break sources into small, well-tagged passages, snapshot them, and pump the embeddings plus raw text into something like PGVector or Pinecone so RAG stays deterministic. Build lineage on the chunk level, then wire row-level roles into the retrieval layer; that’s way easier than hoping users classify PII correctly before pasting it into ChatGPT. Automate redaction inside the pipeline-simple regex masks won’t cut it, lean on entity detection like Presidio. Observability matters more now because any silent refresh lag will surface as hallucination, so monitor vector drift the same way you watch table freshness. I tried Airbyte for bulk pulls and LangChain for orchestration, but DreamFactory gave me the instant REST endpoint over our on-prem SQL that let the agents pull just what they need without exposing the whole database.

This all the more reasons companies will want to move to create their own chatbots with internal knowledge and localized models, and force employees to use it for work, and maybe the task of data engineer will be to update the RAGs and the models behind it once in a while. I think by allowing even access to external LLMs like ChatGPT somebody will bound to throw PIIs to these tools sooner or later.",

A webpage stored locally that can only display information isn’t useful, so technologies were developed to solve these issues, which increased complexity. Honestly, an interesting simile to your observation would be, why do we need C/C++ if we could do everything in Assembly, which is the simplest language.

The reason why complexity exists, is because we have more complex problems.\n\nThe tools and frameworks developers use that are “complex” actually have streamlined a lot of issues for us.

Because you're not starting from scratch, you're hooking into a long-living, already existing framework and ecosystem for creating applications, with well-defined and delineated structures to organize your program to ensure it works within the framework.\n\nYou would see similar levels of triviality if you tried to make a \"bare metal\" web application with native javascript and HTML, as well, the complexity comes in when you pick up a framework, because you're CHOOSING that complexity in exchange for the power the framework offers you. Same with servers, you can write your own bare-bones HTTP server in C++ and simply use that as a REST-API handler, but that's a lot of tedious work... why would you do that when ready-made frameworks exist that, yes, take a bit more work to get started with, but over time drops your workload by a hundred times?\n\nMobile platforms are different because they REQUIRE you to use their platform to be able to run your applications and ensure they don't do \"bad things\", you cannot do \"bare metal\" development. These platforms are hardware limited, run fundamentally different \"operating systems\", and have a much higher level of integration and centralized control than a PC. This requires you to break up your applications into event-driven models, state-based triggers, setting structures and sign up for all the functionality you want to hook into so that the OS can integrate these things, ensure you get your fair share of background time, and run your app in the correct situations. You *can* do close to native app development if you jailbreak Android, and skip all the framework stuff if you really want to, but you won't be able to run on a locked down, consumer platform.\n\nYou will see that over time as you get more experienced with development and the applications you write get more substantial, you will either gravitate towards the same level of complexity, or you will be stuck doing so much manual work and trying to ensure it all works with each other that you drop it entirely because you get sick of it. Raw SDL is fine if what you're doing is fairly simple, a few UI elements there, a sprite there, but once you get beyond a certain level of complexity you'll either be wrapping it in your own engine, starting to use a framework yourself, or you \"muscle through\" it and create an unholy abomination that's a mess to work with.",

In the old days demonstrated by the console programs that you’ve been playing with you have ASSCII printable characters (the letters you see for instance like a, b, c, etc.) and the non-printable characters like carriage return (CR) that return the cursor to the beginning of the line, new line (NL) that advance the cursor to the next line below, etc. All very easy to control with basic system calls.\n\nEnter GUIs where it’s not that simple. With a GUI you have to define what is called a draw or layout surface that allows you to place elements like text boxes, buttons, etc at various positions within that draw surface. That overall draw surface is stored in the form of a series of buffers or layers to present to the user visually and a further layer to track finger touches or mouse cursor movements so the system can track what the user want to interact with. Now, with SDKs they need to handle a lot of the overall setup for you and you utilize objects that represent text or buttons or other widgets that place on that surface.\n\nNow as you can see we have gone from simple system calls to print text to screen for your console apps to presenting a presentation layer for GUI elements that cannot only rely on system calls alone to display.\n\nThis is why a simple hello world program on Android is so difficult because:\n\n1. You need to set up a display buffer with the resolution and how it will be displayed to the user\n2. You need to create a text box element in that buffer to display the text\n3. You need to set up what text is displayed in that text element\n\nI hope this gives you a good idea in answer to your question.",

        "body": "1. big O notations are nice but in real programs the constants matter a lot. Not only that, RAM cache is also very critical for performance, and hash tables are nearly always inferior to simple arrays when it comes to hitting cache. For performance there is also the idea of branching - in simple terms: whether or not the CPU can guess correctly if an if-statement will be true or false. Due to that you want as little if-statements as possible in performance critical areas, and i think all practical implementations of hash-tables have if-statements.\n2. Hash tables usually dont have order. If i want sorted data and often return the smallest/biggest member or a rank related to size, Hash tables are useless. Even simple strings have meaning to their order. EDIT: i dont think you can actually achieve order in hash-tables without a complementary list/array.\n3. You may need/want to use stack memory instead of heap memory and hash tables are hard and inefficient to implement using only stack memory.\n4. hash-tables pre-allocate chunks of memory before its ever used. if you want to save on memory you may want a different ADT.\n\nWith that being said, when you mostly care about average case big O notations, hash-tables are pretty amazing. This is why they are often used in leet-code questions.",

You would need to keep the order in the stored value, then get all the values out into some sort of list, then sort it in NlogN, then iterate. Or skip all that and don't use hash maps if that is how you are going to do it. Instead use a data structure that preserves order of insertion.\n\nSomeone tells you fishing rod X is the best one.

Many important data structures are defined recursively. For example, linked list is either null or a structure that contains some data and a pointer to a linked list. And when you have recursive data structures, recursive functions are often the best way to work with them.\n\n3. Recursion isn’t just some academic exercise. Consider a GUI framework. Typically, anything that’s drawn on the screen is drawn in a *view*. Controls, labels, text fields, menus, etc. are all specialized views. If a user clicks the mouse button, the framework figures out which view was clicked by asking the root view which view contained the click location. That view then asks each of its sub views which view contained the click, and so on. Or, if part of the screen needs to be redrawn, the framework goes through a similar process.\n\n4. Any problem that can be solved recursively *can* be solved iteratively, but recursion is often the easier, cleaner solution. Recursion uses the stack to keep track of intermediate results; things can get messy fast with iteration because you have to manage that state explicitly.\n\n5. There are some languages in which recursion is the only way to loop.\n\n6. If you’re working on a computer science degree, you probably have courses in theory of computation, compilers, and operating systems in your future. Recursion looms large in each of those. As a small example, read about the `fork()` function in Unix-like operating systems.\n\n7. Your question reminds me of high school math classes when students would ask “why do we need to know trig identities?” or “when are we ever going to factor polynomials in the real world?” It’s easy to understand that feeling, but it’s hard to provide a satisfying answer because someone asking a question like that just hasn’t seen enough to appreciate the importance of the topic. I think the best thing you can do is write your question down now and come back to it in a few years, after you’ve taken more advanced courses. That goes back to item #1 on this list: trust your professors, they know a lot more than you do.",

What about a very ordinary programmer like me, with a couple of decades working in imperative languages where recursion is very much a choice?\n\nIt's a tool for your mental toolbox. You need to learn and practice it (even if it initially feels awkward and even if some examples feel alien or niche). Then, when you face real world problems, sometimes you'll realise that, hey, it kind of feels like if I split this problem up into pieces the algorithm will be simpler or the code cleaner...and maybe I can do that again in the same way...hey, this is recursion! I'm recursing! And when your problems don't nest that way, go back to ordinary imperative code.\n\nKinds of data where recursion comes up naturally are common. Trees are obviously very likely to involve recursive operations and trees come up all the time in real world data wherever data are organised hierarchically: DOM trees, parse trees, nested spatial info, organisational charts, I'm sure you can think of many more examples where data are naturally nested in a self-similar manner.\n\nMost of my code is not recursive, but I wouldn't be a competent programmer if I didn't know how to use recursion when it's the better choice.",

And nowadays, there's AIs helping out.\n\nIt is a mistake to think great coders code everything from scratch. If you use, say, Flutter, you're already not coding \"from scratch\". Someone built a web framework so you wouldn't have to code things from scratch. Also, frameworks have a lot of moving parts, so it's hard to recall it all.\n\nThis is why you see leetcode problems because they require minimal knowledge of libraries and frameworks and mostly rely on DSA knowledge.\n\nIt will depend on the interview.

The first one would be to create a program that opened a window with the text \"Hello, World\", and then change that to \"playing music\" - the second would be opening a file, and not really doing anything with it, just opening it without crashing. The third would then be to play that file as a music-file - and since you probabaly don't know how to program that, but others have built libraries for it, you search for \"C++ Windows play mp3 file\" or something like that, and get some example code.\n\nYou spend a lot of time getting that example code to work in your project, and then you've got your \"Music Player version 0.01\"\n\nNext step is then to maybe let the player display some info about the music being played - adding play, pause, stop, rewind buttons - adding a seekbar etc.\n\nEvery tiny step makes the player better and better - and because it is tiny steps, you can search for specific help on \"how to create play/pause toggle-button\" rather than very generic \"how to create music player\".\n\n  \nThere's of course more to it, but that is basically the way most of us work - start with the smallest thing possible, and everytime it works, we add another feature.

Lay out the project directory as well as bolt together all of the libraries I need, and for a windowed application, make some kind of \"Hello, world!\" window.\n5. Do the rest of the work.

Conforming to industry standards just makes everything easier. For example, many JS network libs (like Axios) understand that a HTTP status code of 400 is an error response and will throw an error on the client. This makes error handling client side a lot easier, as you can implement try/catch blocks.",

        "body": "I am of the camp that outside the most common status codes, no, you should not use most of the status codes that exist, because most of them have niche semantics that won't be applicable to you or are used in specific subprotocols that ride on top of HTTP like WebDAV, or HTTP extensions. Perhaps a 200 for an error is not OK, but I would prefer an API with consistent error responses to one that abuses 20 different HTTP statuses all slightly incorrectly. Same thing with HTTP verbs.\n\nMost HTTP status codes are designed to describe outcomes related to the transport itself rather than the business logic that is behind it, and as such, HTTP status codes should be used to describe issues that occur prior to any form of processing or side effect and past that you should fall back to a very small subset of statuses to describe the outcome. That is what a body is for.. \n\nThe problem with this tends to be when people have to shoehorn complex behaviour into a single endpoint due to reasons outside their control, and they start abusing other HTTP status codes (especially WebDAV codes) to try and communicate their intent for things like partial success, or precondition failure, or side effects. They then do not realise half the HTTP status codes have strict and specific semantics about things like headers that should be included with them, and they break the rules of the spec by using them, which is far worse than just not using them at all. HTTP was not originally designed for requesting that Amazon sends you a new bag of cat food, it was designed for asking Amazon to show you a webpage about cat food.\n\nThere is then confusion on what describes a client versus a server error. Does a 400 purely specify that a request looks okay, or does it imply that the actual data it represents is meaningful in terms of the current system state and data that is stored? Do you expect a server to start processing your request prior to giving a 400 back? Does bad request purely describe the request itself or the implication of that request? Do you consider a 500 to mean something went wrong during processing or just that your server is fucked? \n\nOnce you get into the rabbithole of trying to work out exactly when each code is valid, you realise the system you are integrating with made a totally different decision on how to organise this and interpret it differently.\n\nThe other issue is that some HTTP libraries made the somewhat braindead decision to throw exceptions when you get certain status codes, and this then makes integration more difficult. Really what you are often communicating is semantically tied to your own system, and if that is the case, using the body to communicate that rather than the status code can be more sensible.\n\nEven from a monitoring perspective, anything significant will be relying on application metrics rather than metrics from load balancers to determine system health. Load balancer metrics for status codes just give a rough idea of how much stuff is working versus not working.\n\nTLDR: 400, 401, 403, 404, 2xx, 500, 503 are OK. Use those as you will. Anything more complicated that is related to business logic should just be in a 200 or 500 and detail the issue in the body. Abusing other codes like 422, 423, 507 just because they \"sound like\" what you want is far worse than just using vague codes. If you are giving me a 479 Shits Fucked Yo designed to be used with WebFTP v2.718281828459045 from 1943, or a 486 Its Tuesday that Twitter used once, then I have a problem. Using 200 for errors might be controversial but if it is easier to do that and provide consistent responses in the body across your systems, then go for it. Whether you are checking a status code inside or outside a body, most programming languages use the same constructs to inspect it. If using a 3 digit number at the start of a response is what people think defines usability, then they are just gatekeeping unless there is an actual technical requirement for it.",

I’ve been in a similar boat, where the hands-on stuff takes priority, but then you start hitting roadblocks in interviews or realizing there are gaps in your understanding of core concepts.\n\nFirst off, don’t beat yourself up too much. You’ve already got a solid understanding of how to get things done in real-world scenarios, which is a huge plus. The next step is just filling in those gaps in theory and fundamentals.\n\nOne option could be looking into free or low-cost online resources. There are a ton of high-quality materials out there. Sites like Coursera, edX, or freeCodeCamp offer courses that dive into algorithms, data structures, and other core topics. If you're feeling motivated enough to try something more structured, CS50 from Harvard is an amazing free intro to computer science.\n\nAnother suggestion is tackling coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal. They’ll help you get comfortable with algorithmic thinking and test your understanding of fundamental concepts like recursion, dynamic programming, and graph theory. It can be tough at first, but it’s a great way to get that theory-practice balance.\n\nAs for motivation, maybe set up a study routine that combines theory with practical application—like, for example, learn a concept in theory, then solve problems related to it. It’ll help you connect the dots and see the real-world value of what you're learning.\n\nIn terms of classes, I’d say if you're going to invest in them, a well-structured, affordable course from places like Udemy or Pluralsight might give you more value for your money.

I found a lot of my spiraling was due to being overwhelmed  \n\\- Optimize feedback loops. Fastest way to kill my productivity is needing to wait 5 mins to see if a fix worked. Test-driven development is nice. Fast builds are nice  \n\\- Struggling with a problem? Write about it, pen & paper. Doodle if you want. Rant if you want. I personally find it more effective than rubber ducking  \n\\- Silent timers: you may have heard of pomodoro timing, but I didn't mesh well with being interrupted right as I was in the flow. I do something pomodoro-like but keep the timers muted, and just switch when my focus is drifting and I notice my time is up  \n\\- I found taskwarrior (CLI) meshes really well with my brain as a task tracker  \n\\- Jumpstart guides: for larger projects that have some setup, I found it takes a lot of effort to get started making changes. I wrote a four-step \"jumpstarter\" for one of my projects that carefully walks through making a trivial hello-world-style change to one of the classes, building/deploying the project, and seeing the change on a UI. Takes like 30 seconds, but somehow, doing that helps get me in the headspace to start doing actual development\n\nYou mention a lot about reading unfamiliar code: unfortunately, this is more-or-less a practice game. Some more tricks that work for me in no particular order:\n\n\\- Above all else, make sure the code can run. Trying to do any development on code that doesn't run is a death sentence  \n\\- Commit archaeology -- whole codebase is hard to read? Try git blaming some stuff you're interested in and just understanding one well-documented commit or PR  \n\\- Documenting things -- there's probably missing comments that are making things tricky, may as well make it easier for the next guy. Having docs for a function's dependencies makes it easier to read that function since you can now understand what it does without needing to ctrl+click into another context  \n\\- Debuggers are good, learn to use them  \n\\- Tests are good, learn to write them -- this is the core thesis of \"working effectively with legacy code\"  \n\\- Learn editor navigation shortcuts: be able to quickly navigate to that one class that you know the name of, to jump into and back out of specific functions, etc\n\nOverall, I'm fond to say \"productivity is an engineering problem.\" It's not the type of thing where you just find The Solution and you're good to go. Any engineering problem worth talking about has competing solutions with tradeoffs that require a process of designing, implementing, testing, and revision. Try to find specific things that are killing your productivity (the 5 Whys technique is good) and hack at it like any other complex problem.",

At the end of the day I'm burnt out and don't feel like working with my own projects.  Other days, I'm stuck in meetings, writing documentation, answer questions either from other developers, managers, or customers, or other non programming tasks that need to get done.  On those days I'm often happy and the end of the day to work on my own projects.\n\nSometimes my \"fun\" projects hit a grind where I need to add something and I just don't want to for whatever reason.

What works best for me is a combination of small targeted problems on different topics and using questions/answers to test my knowledge.\n\nI’ve used LLMs for this. I’ve asked them to list out the main things I need to know without going into implementation and to then come up with a series of questions that would help me practice it. I go through the questions and code up the problems it gives me without looking at a solution. I take it as far as I can. \n\nI’m not concerned with being right, I’m concerned with training my brain to think. Some of my best learning came from allowing myself to do it my way all the way, even if it turned out to be dead wrong, because that teaches me exactly why things are done the way they are. I then take my solution back to the LLM and ask it to give constructive criticism. You can also get problems from a book or a website, it doesn’t have to be an LLM, but I like the instant feedback.\n\nAdditionally, in my notes, along with having definitions for things I’m learning, I also have a questions section.  The goal isn’t to answer the question immediately, the goal is to track with honesty what I actually know vs. what I need to work on. For example, if I keep asking the same question 5 times across different problems, that’s an area I don’t truly understand.\n\nBonus: LLMs are really good at pattern recognition. Once it has enough data on you, you can ask it something like ‘Based on out previous conversations on xyz, what do I know well, what are the areas where I need to improve and what learning style has proven to work best for me?’\n\nWe learn in chunks. You have to build up those chunks one at a time and train your brain to think, not consume.",

Contrary to popular belief banging your head against problems and trying to self-solve everything is most often the worst route. There is a bit of nuance here. \n\nWhen you already have a degree of skill in an area, then solving things to get a deeper understanding / appreciation is good. But as a newbie learning core ideas, be that in mathematics, or programming, or otherwise, the \"solve it yourself\" approach of so many old school masters is well evidenced as being a poor route.\n\nI would recommend a middle road.\n\nGetting AI to simply spam code at you is a terrible idea. But having it do code reviews, and even to give you clear answers so you know what to do, is a good idea. There is very little value in sitting there for a day, struggling to figure out how to align things in CSS, if you could have learned the core functions of flex and grid in 30 minutes and then spent the day actually practicing them.\n\nBe sensible. \n\nYou seem like a smart person. So you can tell the difference between a case where you are using AI to do the work for you vs using it to teach you things in an efficient way. And don't depend only on AI. But it is a powerful tool and you should use it. There are many Luddites who swear off it and will tell  you that you will never code if you touch it. But honestly, they are just living in denial. We are where we are. Love or hate AI it is here. And so use it. Because I assure you other people will be.",

Learn a cloud service like AWS or Azure. \n\nMost importantly, always be ready to learn. \n\nI did all that and applied to a DevOps/Sys Admin role.

Pick something modern like Swift or Python, perhaps even JavaScript/TypeScript, but low-level programming languages like C++ or Rust are probably not optimal for a newcomer. Make decent effort to understand how to use various DSA entities, but do not waste too much time understanding DSA internals, as you always get a standard library that already implements DSA for you. You just need to know what DSA tool to use for what purpose. For the problem domain I would recommend either iOS apps in Swift/SwiftUI (the Apple Xcode development environment is of very decent quality, but unfortunately requires a macOS desktop/laptop M1 CPU system; you can also try [Swift Playground](https://developer.apple.com/swift-playground/) for a gamified learning experience if you can get your hands on an iPad) or maybe active web page development in JavaScript/React. Data Science might require (?) some serious math (?) skills, if I am not mistaken, which could significantly slow you down. Cloud development with AWS can (?) get quite complex (?). It would be great if you could freelance or get a job as soon as possible using what you have learned to buy equipment and become independent, but I am not sure how accessible each problem domain market is to newcomers these days. You might want to research which problem domain can get you a job the easiest. Whatever you choose, once you learn one particular programming language well, you will be much better positioned to make your own decisions about what other technologies to possibly switch to.

Plus at 48, you'd have a solid 20+ year career ahead of you.\n\nBut since you asked about tech longevity... AI/ML, cybersecurity, and mobile development aren't going anywhere. Web development is evolving but still fundamental. The thing is, tech moves fast and you gotta keep learning constantly. At Metana we see people in their 40s and 50s successfully transition into development, but it takes real commitment to stay current.\n\nHere's what I'd consider in your shoes. What actually interests you more? Do you want to help people directly through healthcare, or do you get excited about building things digitally? Both can be financially rewarding but they're completely different day to day experiences.\n\nAlso, have you thought about healthcare tech? There's tons of opportunity there, especially for people who understand both sides. But honestly, if you're leaning toward nursing for the stability and recession-proofing, that's totally valid reasoning.\n\nThe rental income gives you flexibility to take either path without desperation, which is huge. Most people don't have that luxury when making career pivots.",

If it's about \"need,\" the answer is \"not much,\" because there's such a wide range of specializations needing different things. Moreover, you're right that nowadays it's very easy to look up things, but it's a matter of proficiency that eventually you should be looking up less things.\n\n\nFor example, the first time I ever got a NullPointerException I remember it was a really difficult bug, I didn't know what pointers *or* null were, and I had to frontload learning all that. Once you've seen them enough though, you just know what it is, how it happens, and how to debug it, and usually (for NPEs caught early) it's a ~2 minute ordeal. I see stories online about people spending hours debugging missing semicolons: once you reach a certain level of familiarity with syntax, that just stops being an issue.\n\n\nAs you start to get more proficient, people generally expect you to \"just know\" more. Seniors *are* very adept at learning new things in tech, and very good at finding information to fill their gaps. But they also know a lot, and can more or less jump into a moderate-complexity codebase and get to work without much ramp-up. It's not that they \"need\" to memorize the information, but that they need a certain critical mass of experience to be able to do their job effectively. (Try asking foreign language learners about the difference between being able to look up a grammar table vs having the table memorized vs being able to speak correctly.) This is all ignoring the logistics of how one even knows what to google for unclear issues.\n\n\nThis especially applies with specialization: I wouldn't expect most programmers to know low-level details of memory layout, paging, CPU caching, etc, but since I write database internals, it's sort of critical to being able to do my job. OTOH I've met other devs at the same company that don't know the difference between RAM and disk, and they're doing fine in their expertise: it's just not a thing that's very relevant if you're working in some areas.\n\n\nSo, overall, I think the answer is \"learn *some* things well.\" You see people often reference T-shaped skillsets, where there's a large set of shallow skills (the top of the T) and a few deep ones (the vertical line). Syntax / basics are pretty much must-have, as well as some library/framework experience. But beyond that, be willing to dive into the details of tools you work with, practice learning as a skill, and start building that internal library. Looking things up on the job is fine, but learn from those resources, don't just drop them and move on as soon as you've found an answer.",

If you are learning, don't use AI. \n\nUse google, use stackoverflow posts (dont make a post though, they tend to be a-holes), read the docs, read a book, watch a tutorial and change it slighty for your use case, ask a friend.

AI is like having a really smart friend, that will happily just do your work for you, even if you ask it not too. This is great when you have a job, but if he does all your homework (or practice projects) you will literally learn nothing. \n\nAnd I'll answer the rebuttal I always hear : \n> but connorjpg what if I understand its output\n\nYou mean you understand the assumed correct answer that was given to you? Yeah I can understand a test when I have the answer key infront of me. Doesnt mean I will remember, why, how or when to use these answers. And as soon as I take the test I will forget everything... Not to mention the more complex the questions you ask the higher chance there will be integration issues or just flat out incorrect returns, and without underlying understanding of the basics you will be completely lost. \n\nNow if you are working, use whatever you want, as much of it as you want, no one cares.\n\nsource : I tutor and mentor college students.",

LLMs will start rambling and get lost in bullshit bingo and buzzwords.

You still have to actually learn how to program and you should learn it on SOMETHING, once you understand the concepts and get a flow for making things it becomes easier to pick up another language. \n\nI wouldn't leave yourself not understanding async for example, it is used almost everywhere, even if you aren't writing it, it will be built into the libraries you are using. The best way to learn is to do, so pick a language and try to write something with a thread or two just to see how it is done and run the thought exercise for managing the sync and flow of everything. \n\nI think the advice is true, when you get your job you will be working in the tech stack the company has and most of the difficulty will be figuring out the companies code base, so while you might be an expert in one language they may be using another. \n\nHowever, this does not mean that it doesn't make your life easier to know one language and just learn the ins and outs of the other language vs trying to figure out say async concepts while figuring out he language, it is much better to pick up a language and read what kind of async stuff is in the language while understanding the concepts and challenges ahead of time.  It is much better to help you evaluate the code base as well if you have a good understanding of what 'good' can look like. \n\nAnother interpretation of it might really be that you can't learn everything a computer can do now a days, it is essentially infinite as it continuously expands day bay day. But again, do not take this as don't bother mastering what you are working on, or, i don't get this topic and am free to  moving on.  If you move on make it for a good reason, you won't ever use it perhaps or hate it so much you would refuse a job working with it etc.",

There's so many steps you'll need to be decent that if you're just looking for the bare minimum to get employed, it might not work out for you. Better get passionate about this hobbie, get obsessed with learning and eventually you'll be at the level you want, not in 3 months though.",

You already understand user problems and how systems break, which is half the battle.\n\nBetween JavaScript and C#, honestly both are solid choices but I'd lean toward JavaScript for someone in your position becuase JavaScript is everywhere. Frontend, backend (Node.js), mobile apps, even desktop apps. More versatility means more job opportunities. The learning curve can be a bit weird at first but once it clicks, you're golden. C# is great too, especially if you're thinking enterprise development or want something more structured. Microsoft ecosystem is huge and pays well.\n\nAt Metana we see a lot of career changers and the ones who succeed fastest are usually those with some kind of customer facing or problem solving background. They just \"get\" what users need in a way that pure CS grads sometimes dont.\n\nMy advice? Pick JavaScript, build a few projects that solve real problems you've seen in help desk work, and apply for roles that value that crossover like developer advocate positions, technical support engineering, or even full stack roles at smaller companies.\n\nEither way you choose though, you're already ahead of most beginners because you understand the business side of tech. Don't underestimate that advantage :)",

That's actually not old at all in tech, and honestly some of the sharpest people I know didn't really hit their stride until their 40s or later.\n\nYour IT support background is actually gold. Most college grads and junior devs have zero real world troubleshooting experience, but you've got 4 years of it. That's huge when things break in production.\n\nAbout the ADHD thing, look, it can be challenging but it can also be a superpower once you find your groove. The hyperfocus aspect is incredible for debugging or diving deep into problems that would frustrate other people.\n\nRegarding web dev vs cloud/cyber? honestly with your AZ-900 already done, you've got momentum there. Don't underestimate that achievement. The fact that you passed shows you can learn new tech. \n\nAt Metana we've had plenty of career changers in their 40s and 50s. What I notice is they often outperform younger students because they have better work discipline and actually know what they want from their career.\n\nMy take? Pick one path and commit for 6 months. Based on what you've shared, cloud seems like the natural next step. Go for AZ-104 next, build some projects, document everything you do. The networking and scripting stuff will come as you practice.\n\nYou're not behind. You're just getting started on the next chapter :)",

But if you just want to have fun and you don't really have a clear path and you just want to build and learn then I don't see why not, go ham and smash your keyboard until something cool is built. But if you have a clear goal, like mobile development, or embedded systems or web development, then I think watching crash courses that focus on that alone is a lot more beneficial if you're trying to master your field of interest. It's good to be curious, but doing 3 different crash courses on completely different things can lead to fatigue and burn out, at least that was my experience when I did that.",

I remember feeling exactly like this when I was starting out and honestly, even now running Metana and helping train developers, I still see this pattern with almost every single student who transitions into their first dev role.\n\nHere's the thing that might help reframe this. You upgraded Node containers, used new JS features, AND you sought help when you hit a roadblock. That's actually really solid problem-solving. Yeah, you could have done the cloud builder upgrade yourself, but how were you supposed to know that without... well, being told exactly what happened?\n\nYour tech lead isn't frustrated with you, they're teaching you. There's a huge difference. If they thought you were doing poorly, trust me, you'd know it. The fact that they're giving you your own features to plan means they see potential.\n\nAt Metana, I always tell our bootcamp grads that the first 6-12 months are basically extended learning with a paycheck. You're not supposed to know everything yet. The goal is to learn fast and not make the same mistake twice.\n\nOne thing that really helped me early on was keeping a \"learning log\". Just a simple doc where I'd write down these exact situations. What I did, what I learned, how I'd handle it next time. Looking back at it after a few months was eye-opening because I could see how much I'd actually grown.\n\nAlso, 5 months in and you're already handling complex features and supporting QA? That's actually ahead of the curve. Most devs I know were still figuring out the codebase at that point.\n\nThe imposter syndrome is real but it gets better as you build up more of these learning experiences. Just don't let it paralyze you from taking on those new features they want you to plan.",

(e.g \"woof woof\" for dog, \"nyaa\" for cat).  \n\\- The age value should not be longer than 20 for cat, 18 for dog\n\nTry and create that application. You don't need to use database or txt or external store. just an application that you can create Cat and Dog object in main function. It's simple application that make use of inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation that you mention. You will understand what, how and why in this simple application because to meet all of the requirements I listed, you have to use all three of the OOP concept that you mention.",

It's a silly thing to need to know how to do, but it really helps, and you'll start getting \\*much\\* more precise at reading/writing/debugging syntax in other contexts too.\n\nRegarding the actual topics, I agree with others that finding another textbook might be the way to go if your lecturer isn't working out for you. Many of the types of people who write textbooks are really passionate about teaching, and have put in a lot of work to put their own spin on these concepts. There's a lot of recs online that you can try reviewing.\n\nI personally really liked making my own versions of others' abstractions. E.g. at some point I wrote a program (mini search engine) that used my own version of the \\`List\\` interface with my own implementations of \\`LinkedList\\` and \\`ArrayList\\`. I also liked making a \\`Logger\\` interface supporting a \\`println\\` method that could interchangeably log to the console, to a file, to an encrypted file (with caesar cipher), and to a graphical window.",

And yes i will be following take u forward but I am a bit confused about the structure of his videos like do I have to watch videos straight up from the youtube as they are arranged or do I have to follow his tuf website and follow theory as per the questions. Can you please suggest me something on that.",

If you’re just starting out, I’d recommend following his YouTube playlists in the order he’s arranged them - he usually builds up from basics to advanced topics, so it’s a good flow for learning concepts step by step.\n\nOnce you’re comfortable with the basics, you can use his TUF website to focus on specific topics or practice questions. The site is great for targeted revision and for brushing up on theory before tackling coding problems. Some people like to watch the theory video for a topic, then immediately try related questions from the site—that’s a solid approach too.\n\nSo, in short:  \n- If you want a structured path, follow the YouTube playlist order\n- If you want to focus on certain topics or practice, use the TUF website to pick and choose. Good luck!",

More practically: imagine that these questions aren't created in code as part of an exercise/test but are simply read from a database. and another tool is used to insert the questions into the database. So as a programmer you have no idea how many questions there are or how to name them.\n\nIt makes a lot more sense to simply throw them into a list (the list of questions). \n\nIn your case because you run into exercises and example code, often people want to show you things you'll encounter in later life but run into the problem that doing the setup for these sorts of systems would distract you from the thing they are trying to teach. So they compromise.\n\nPersonally I would find it better to use a function that returns the questions (in your case). the function will return a list of questions and you can add in comments / naming of the function that it represents a lookup from file or database. that way you can practice working with abstractions / accepting data comes from another location (without needing to know exactly how it is put together)",

I also don't get why this is courageous and hard. That gives vibes like you're only doing this because you don't know what to do and don't want to work.\n\n\n\nWhat stopped you from learning until now? Everyone says the same thing about how passionate they are; but if you ever had a computer or even a graphing calculator then you could have learned.

And they always say it after talking about games.\n\n\n\nAgain, this is really the default thing to say. Someone wants to make games. They're \"passionate\". Never tried. They don't know what to do about their career. You could pick almost any 18-25-year-old boy and they'll say the same thing.\n\n\nThe point isn't really to discourage you but instead to encourage you not to limit yourself to the only thing that feels safe: games and internet.

I almost never set out with an idea how how many or what types of modules will need, I just come to points in the process where I'm like, damn that's ugly, or I realize that I'm re-using stuff, or this function is huge, let's throw it in a new file.\n\nOf course if you find yourself creating something where it's extremely obvious that you'll be using it all over, then sure, go ahead and proactively write it as a module from the get go and build it up as you go.",

Just endless pain and headaches and frustration. But until you experience some of that pain, none of the strategies to solve it really make that much sense. And when you're starting out working on smaller projects, often a lot of code organization is kind of optional anyways because you're not dealing with enough complexity for it to really matter.\n\nSo, like, sure, read about it. Think about it. But understand that what will make it click is getting your hands dirty in the guts of big, complex codebases.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that, although there are principles that can be applied, really needs experience and developing some *intuition* for the problem in order to be able to do well at it. Which is a *good* thing - it is the skills that are hard to develop except through long practice that makes programmers employable!",

        "body": "I think the easiest way to think about this is to think about what functions are actually meant to do. A function is a set of code that performs a specific task, and can be reused repeatedly. \n\nFor example, thinking of a simple calculator application that we want to be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. When we think about specific tasks that can be made into functions, it sounds like we will need a function for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing, as those are all specific tasks that we want to perform repeatedly. \n\nOf course, identifying functions gets more complicated for larger projects, but you don't need to know all the functions you could possibly need ahead of time. Modularization isn't something that happens completely up-front before you program anything, it's something that you will do throughout the programming process. For me what works is outlining functions I know I need at the beginning, then starting to write my program and looking out for sections of code that are reused multiple times. When I realize it is something that is going to be reused, I move it to a function. \n\nBasically, keep an eye out for things that your program will be doing a lot of. Any time you are seeing the same logic repeated, or have something that performs a specific task, those are good things to consider putting into functions. \n\nDon't worry if you can't identify everything in advance or feel like it's a struggle at first. That's part of the learning process and I promise, it gets easier the more you do it!",

In my opinion it’s similar in this way to object oriented design. I use a limited version of both in my personal projects and when I’m working on small teams.\n\nFor modularizing, you generally start with one file, and then at some point you break it into multiple files just as a basic organizing step. And yes you often make classes to encapsulate natural units, like a matrix class, a networking class, a class for the application overall.\n\nBut once you start going crazy with lots and lots of classes, and complex class hierarchies, you make it harder to make those fundamental pivots.\n\nAs a simple concrete example, an oop book might tell you a personnel management app should have an Employee class and from that derive classes for various types of employees, probably using intermediate classes, like a Manager class, from which you derive UnitManager and SeniorExec, all with their own classes. This might work out well in certain cases, if you’re lucky. But in my experience, just make the one Employee class and give it a “type” member. See how far that gets you before making a tree of classes, each probably in their own code file. And the same idea goes for overall modularization.\n\nI have a saying: Don’t divide and conquer yourself.",

We don't know what is going to change, but we know that change is inevitable. Maybe an API you depend on gets a breaking change, maybe you want to drastically change the way you display stuff to users, maybe you discover a major security flaw with how you're handling data etc etc...\n\nThe way we prepare for that is not by thinking about every possible scenario and making preparations, but instead by building systems that are flexible to change. One way you could achieve that is by following the [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID).\n\n1. Limit your modules to only one responsibility. ([example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON))\n2. Write your modules to be open to extension, but closed to modification. ([example](https://alexnault.dev/open-closed-principle-in-functional-typescript))\n3. Any substitute modules you write should not break the program. ([example: a square data object is not a valid substitute for a rectangle data object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle#Violation))\n4. Keep code decoupled from other code it does not need. The math module does not need to know about drawing boxes on the DOM.\n5. Depend on interfaces rather than specific implementations.

Stop trying to memorize syntax. Seriouslyy. Even experienced devs look stuff up constantly.

Before you code, explain out loud what you're trying to build and why. \n\n3. Build the same data structure multiple times but solve different problems with it. Don't just implement a stack. Use it to check balanced parentheses, then use it for undo functionality etcc. This builds real understanding.\n\nAlso, data structures in Java can be tricky because there's so much syntax to remember.

All developers forget the little bits from time to time, and it sucks because the code won't run without them, but it's just how it works. Our brains are not computers, so speaking computer languages, especially like Java, doesn't come naturally. When you were learning English, you didn't say everything correctly all the time either, and you still don't, but obviously you know English, and you can communicate your point well enough that everyone here, native English speaker or not, understands you. It's the same for Java, or any other coding language. You'll always be looking up this syntax or that function. Eventually, the things you're learning now will become second nature when you've used them in 50 different programs or functions. But by then, you'll be looking up other things you just can't remember the exact way to do. Don't stress about this part.\n\nBut if, even after looking it up and getting the code to compile and do what you want it to do, you're not proud of yourself, then you might want to consider whether this is the right career for you. Because honestly, I will spend 60+ hours on a bug sometimes, and I have literally thrown a party (a happy hour with coworkers) when I got to a different error message I hadn't seen before. The bug wasn't fixed, but I had made some kind of progress, because now I was executing a different part of the code, and that was worth celebrating. If you don't want to party when the code works right (or at least more right), then you are either taking it all too seriously, or you might not have the right temperament for Software Engineering.\n\nGood luck!!",

A 4 year degree moves through the material at a comparatively slow pace - I think everyone needs like 3000+ hours of study and practice to get \"entry level decent\", and university gives that to you over 4 years (along with a bunch of electives), but you *can* go through all that faster on your own. Someone who has the drive to do it all themselves and doesn't need any handholding can get competent faster. Their resume will be at a disadvantage, but these types of people compensate by doing things like starting their own business and the like - they don't need handholding or guide rails, so can succeed as entrepreneurs at least well enough to prove they have some skills.\n\nBut are you one of those people? Only you know that, but in general folks who come to reddit to ask \"Should I self-teach?\" are not the \"don't need any handholding\" highly motivated types who succeed self-teaching.",

        "body": "There are people who like the unknown and there are people who like the known. Those who like the known are those who prefer to live in a town where they are close to relatives and friends. The idea of going some place new where you have to make new friends is scary. Others will hop on a plane and decide to wander the Earth with no particular plan except to explore. They believe they will manage somehow. One is driven more by fear, and the other is driven by lack of fear.\n\nAnyway, it sounds like you want reassurances to make sure you know every step of the way where others would just jump in and do. You're probably concerned \"what if I get stuck and don't know what to do next\". You want someone to help you out. People may help, and that's great, but realizing that, ultimately, you have to look out for yourself is an important life skill. I myself fall into the category of wanting to know how I will do things ahead of time.\n\nBut, let's just go through some of your questions.\n\n**What should be my ideal roadmap or study plan to cover CS50 efficiently in this time frame?**\n\nTry not to worry about the time frame. The course is set up for ten weeks, but this is a Harvard course and as a college course, it's pretty aggressive to finish so quickly. I would budget twice the time, maybe twenty weeks which is about 5 months, but take all the time you need. You don't have to race to the answer. You may feel like you have to be efficient, but expect to be slow, and don't pressure yourself to move faster because you'll likely skip information you need by trying to \"keep up\".\n\n**How many hours should I ideally dedicate each day, considering I want to complete as much as possible before July ends?**\n\nYou've only given yourself 5 weeks. You are unlikely to finish unless you are either smart or cheat (you may think using ChatGPT is not cheating, but it is). The class already takes ten weeks for Harvard students, and you want to do it in half the time. \n\nSpending lots of hours, esp. on academic topics, is not always productive. There's this joke that goes \"if it takes 9 months for a woman to have a baby, then it should take 9 women 1 month each to have a baby\" which means that you can't speed up certain things. I mean, if you can spend that time and not go brain dead, then good for you. Give it a try. But most people find it hard to focus for more than about 3 hours a day. If you try for more, you'll need a break, and you'll have to be making some progress during that time.\n\nYou might get through the C coding part if you happen to be quick (so 5 weeks).\n\n**How does submission of problem sets and projects work?**\n\nI think you need to read this and figure it out. It is a bit elaborate involving using Github and setting that up. Harvard doesn't want to be in business of managing user accounts. There are instructions on how to do this. I would say, outside of the actual programming itself, it's this part that's kind of annoying. You just have to follow the steps carefully, that's all. I would probably suggest using their version of Visual Studio Code (assuming they still use it).\n\n**Are there any specific tools or software I need to install beforehand?**\n\nYou'll be instructed how to do this. This is the kind of question that suggest apprehension on your part. Read it, dig in, and figure it out. It's a useful skill to be able to work through problems.\n\n**Any extra advice, personal experiences, or tips you’d like to share would be greatly appreciated!**\n\nThe problem sets (which are the programming assignments) are challenging. I've taught intro programming and I would likely not give that level of difficulty to a class. In particular, CS50x uses more math than the projects I used to assign. Also, some projects are considered notoriously challenging. One is called Tideman. Usually, they have an easier version of the project and a harder one. You might opt to do the easier one.\n\nOne reason Tideman is challenging is the length of the description of what to do. Beyond that, it's hard to visualize the arrays to place the data. If C were object-oriented, it might be easier to understand (though still not easy).\n\nExpect it to be challenging. Don't worry if you don't complete the course in a month. You're expecting a lot, maybe too much. Any progress would be considered good. Try not to be disappointed if you only get through, say, 3 weeks of the course in the time allotted. You're setting yourself up to be disappointed.\n\nAnyway, good luck. Hope you get done as much as you plan, but even if you don't you took some initiative which is a positive attitude.",

I did most of the course's problems (Didn't make the final one, so no certificate to show) and even though I already had some experience with C(just as a student, I don't have any professional experience), Tideman gave me a few hours of thinking and stressing over.

When you call `super().__init__(side, side)`, it’s essentially telling Python to look up the inheritance chain and call the `__init__` method of the parent class (which in this case is `Rectangle`). This allows the `Square` class to inherit and use the initialization logic of the `Rectangle` class without explicitly referencing `Rectangle` by name. When `super().__init__(side, side)` is called, it sets the `height` and `width` attributes of the `Square` instance (which is `s`), because `super()` is calling `Rectangle.__init__` internally and passing the values to it.\n\nNow, in the second example, `Rectangle.__init__(self, side, side)` does something similar but directly. You’re calling the `__init__` method of the `Rectangle` class explicitly. Here, `Rectangle.__init__` sets the `height` and `width` attributes on the `Square` instance (`s`) in the same way, but this time, you’re directly referencing the parent class.\n\nIn both cases, the key point is that calling `__init__` on a class (whether via `super()` or directly) will set up the attributes of the instance. When you do `Rectangle.__init__(self, side, side)`, it sets `self.height` and `self.width` on the `Square` instance, just as if the `Square` class was directly calling `Rectangle`'s `__init__` method.\n\nThe reason this works, even though `Rectangle` is a class, is because `Rectangle.__init__` is a method that belongs to the class and can be called just like any other method. The instance (`self` in `Square`) is passed along, so it has access to the attributes defined within the method.",

All classes in python return objects when instanciated. `super()` returns what the documentation calls a \"proxy object\".\n\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super\n\nProxy objects are special. They are bound to a type and an instance of a type. When any method is called on them, they search the [method-resolution-order (MRO)](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-method-resolution-order) for this combination, and call that instead.\nThe actual call signature of `super`:\n\n```\nsuper(type, object_or_type)\n```\n\nTakes these 2 arguments. Usually, `type` is a class, `object_or_type` is an instance of that class. When called without argument but directly followed by a method call, these arguments default to the enclosing class and the calling instance.\n\nTherefore, let's break down what happens in the case you described:\n\n> super is a class therefore super().__init__(side, side) should create instance of the class super\n\n1. `super()` returns a proxy object, bound to the type `<class Square>` and the current instance of that class\n2. `.__init__` tells the proxy object: \"Search the MRO for this instance of this class 'upwards' for a method called `__init__`\"\n3. The search determines that the method to call is `Rectangle.__init__`\n4. `(side, side)` now calls `Rectangle.__init__` with `side` as the value for both arguments",

If you're familiar with the `sorted` function in Python you can solve this problem in less than five minutes, and it can be written in 1 dense line, or 3-4 reasonable lines.",

Maybe it's made that way to keep the black hats away.\n\nFor JavaScript, most likely the code has been \"minified\". The Web Developer Tools in most browsers can partially \"unminify\" this (i.e. they can restore the indentation to a sane default), but some things can never be 'unminified'. For example, the original names of the variables are lost, and all of the comments are lost as well. So it is also necessary to track down real JavaScript \"source code\" (i.e. unminified code) to learn how people are writing this.\n\nNowadays a lot of people also write TypeScript as the source code, which \"compiles\" (sometimes called \"Transpiled\" in this context) down to plain JavaScript. But again, the notation in the original TypeScript will be lost, and that stuff was written in the code for a reason --- so you've got to go to that source code and understand why it was written the way it was originally written.",

        "body": "Well there's two things here:\n\n1. If you need a game to make programming fun, then you're not interested in programming as a career.\n2. Some aspects of game programming are much harder than the usual fields of programming.\n\nI would say it's only good if they're already interested in programming and it focuses on the hard parts of game programming.\n\nIf the course focuses on how to make a game, then they'll learn how to make a game, not programming. Almost no game design courses teach any amount of programming.\n\nIf it's writing their own game engine or something, then it teaches a lot more.\n\nAlso you can't say \"learn to program\" and \"JavaScript\" with a straight face. It's sad to see the focus entirely on WebDev. What is the goal: do you want them to learn programming or WebDev? GameDev is not a good way to learn WebDev.\n\nIf you look at the CS50 course, you can see the order they go in:  \n[https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/weeks/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/weeks/)\n\nThey actually begin by having people make a game. But they basically learn no programming from it because it's using Scratch. I actually think that week could have been replaced with something better. Notice how they go all the way through an intro course and through Data Structures before they even start WebDev.\n\nI spent many years making games on Atari XE and graphing calculators. I went to a community college after that and learned basic programming. But a single Data Structures course was more impactful on my ability to program than all those years of experience combined.\n\nAlso when I tutored math, people always said the same thing. They hated math until they learned it properly, then they loved it. They were so happy doing it. Teachers focus too much on making things \"fun\" instead of making things understandable. The fun comes naturally when they're learning.",

        "body": "I have tried making some introductory programming curricula based on making games, as well as an advanced DSA course - not as \"game design courses\", but simply using games as the applications that the students had to build.\n\nI still think it is an excellent idea, and it works really well, especially because when writing a game, you naturally run the code over and over, and it is never exactly the same, so you constantly discover new issues, more things to learn. Whereas if you build a program to display a list of items from a database, the moment you got a list, you are done, and leave that part of the code. Also, when you make a game you feel like you've built something - and you are proud to show it to others, and let them play it. Whereas when you've made a form for entry into a database, well ... :)\n\nAnd I believe that you can learn any programming topic from writing games - there's almost no single algorithm, pattern or data structure that doesn't fit into some game or other.\n\nHowever, I've had some issues - mostly with students and especially other teachers not understanding what they actually learned, so I'll give you some of them as \"warnings\" - not warnings against doing it, but warnings about how it might be received.\n\n* Students have a really hard time transferring skills between writing different kinds of software - when they learned how to write games, they didn't understand how it could be used in database-applications, when they learned frontend coding, they didnt' understand how it could be used in backend, then they learned terminal-applications they didn't understand how it could be applied to web-applications, and so on. It is important to add other kinds of applications using the same patterns as they learned in the games - so they don't think that it is a \"games course\", but see how learning to code with games, is just learning to code.\n* Students are extremely scared of math - not just matrix-calculations, or trigonometry, but something as simple as ratios, converting a number between 0 and 1 to a number between 50 and 300 is almost impossible for them to grasp. And in games there's a lot of math. Don't be discouraged by it, just be prepared to spend A LOT of time explaining even the simplest calculations.\n* Some students actively dislike having to create or even obtain graphics and other assets. But on the other hand they don't like just being given assets and \"forced\" to use them - expect to spend quite a bit of time explaining how to prepare those as well :)\n* As games get a bit more complex, there is a lot of prep-work in building the level or setting up the code for input. I recommend re-using code throughout the course, and copying in earlier \"blocks\" from some games to re-use later, so the students don't feel like they spend all their time typing in \"platform code\".\n* A lot of programming students nowadays actually don't know that many \"simple\" games, so it might be necessary with a bit of games history as well, to teach them about top-down, platforms, scrollers, shooters, and so on. I was surprised at how few of my references my students actually recognized - even when it got to board games!\n\nBut otherwise, I think that it is a really, really good idea - and don't listen to the \"haters\" talking about how games programming and JavaScript isn't \"real\" programming! Every kind of programming is programming, and if something can inspire students to build more on their own, it is even better!",

That's fine - we all start at the same place.\n\n>I made a calculator that you can use your terminal but that's pretty much it.\n\nHow does it work? Can I type in 5 \\* 6 + (3 - 4) / 8, and it will give me the right answer, or is it more restricted than that? Can it handle fractions? Can it handle exponentiation? Factorials? Basic polynomial algebra? If I give it an unusual expression like 3 - (-(-2)), does it handle it as expected? If I give it a syntactically illegal expression like \"5 + \\* 5\", or a mathematically illegal expression like \"3 / 0\", does it handle it gracefully without crashing?\n\nThere's a **lot** that goes into building a calculator, and this kind of thing might be an interesting project.  If you're not interested in calculators, don't think of it as a calculator: think of it as \"teaching the computer to understand commands\". This is a whole field in its own right - tokenising, lexing, parsing, building syntax trees, Backus-Naur, and all that - and this is a (small but significant) step towards building something like a compiler. (As a side benefit, it will also make you better at understanding and reading certain kinds of documentation.)\n\nAlso: when you do this, you'll probably want to reuse your old calculator code, but you might find that extending your code to accept these new features is more trouble than it's worth, and you have to rewrite it from scratch. Don't be afraid of doing this, even multiple times if you have to - in fact, I think it's a really good thing in the learning stage. Implementing individual features is one thing, but learning how to structure large projects in a clean and modular way - so that you can swap out features, upgrade them, rewrite them without changing all the rest of your code - is a skill in its own right.\n\n>I saw a guy build a snake game that was cool.\n\nWhy not try building that yourself? Or Pac-Man, or Tetris. It can be in the terminal if you want - just redraw the board as a grid of characters every second - it'll look ugly, but that's fine.\n\nThat said, if you're feeling up to something a bit more of a challenge, then why not learn to use a library like [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)? That's a simple way of getting graphics onto the screen. Fair warning: once you start using external libraries, the difficulty **does** spike a little, because you're suddenly having to learn a whole new feature set that you know nothing about, with all of the syntactic difficulties that come along with it. In practice, what that means is you will spend a lot of time learning how to read documentation efficiently, which is also a crucial skill for a programmer.\n\n>I don't exactly know the full capabilities of c++ so I'm open to suggestions.\n\nLiterally anything a computer can do, you can do it in C++. Most operating systems are written in C, which you can think of as a very bare-bones version of C++. Most modern programming languages have compilers / interpreters written in C/C++. Most browsers and web servers are written in C/C++. \n\nThe main barrier here is not the capability of C++: it's the fact that even very \"simple\" software can be tens of thousands of lines of code, and you need to work towards that. So don't be afraid to rewrite things that people have already written before: they will be very valuable learning tools.",

The hash is intended specifically to prevent people from doing what you're doing: generating CNC files with \"unauthorized\" software. In that case the designers will have used something like an [HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC) (if they're competent) and you will have no hope of reproducing it without reverse-engineering whatever existing software generated the hash.\n\nIn the second case, reverse-engineering the system is almost always possible *in theory*, but *in practice* it might be very very difficult.",

At junior level, hiring managers look for people who can wire up the UI, make an API call, handle edge cases, write tests, and push a clean pull request. So nail the Android lifecycle, Kotlin basics, coroutines/flow, simple DI, and understand what Retrofit is doing conceptually: building an HTTP request on a background thread, parsing JSON, surfacing errors. That context lets you debug when something breaks without having to read OkHttp’s source. For theory, pick one component per week-say, how viewModelScope cancels, or how paging caches-and read a blog or doc; you’ll accumulate depth over projects. I still open Postman for quick endpoint checks and use Charles Proxy to watch traffic, but APIWrapper.ai saves me time stubbing flaky endpoints during local testing. Delivering working code and knowing where to look when it fails matters far more than memorizing every internal detail.",

Really, just go find a tutorial for your language, choose some stuff you want to work on and go there. Working on a project will teach you a lot and the knowledge will likely stick better. Once there, books will help you with getting more specialized knowledge, not otherwise easily available in any other forms. Although THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS.\n\nThat's my humble opinion as it is.

Also check out YC company job boards, reach out directly to CTOs on Twitter, and honestly just cold email smaller companies whose products you actually use.\n\nProject-wise, forget the typical todo apps everyone builds. Since you have an EE background, build something that bridges that gap. Maybe a tool that visualizes electrical circuit data, or automates some workflow you know engineers deal with. \n\nAbout internships, unpaid ones are tricky legally in most places, but if its a legit startup where you're learning tons and building real features, it might be worth it short-term. Just make sure you're not just doing grunt work.\n\nOne thing we see at Metana with career switchers like yourself, the ones who get hired fastest are those who can tell a compelling story about why they switched and what unique perspective they bring. Your EE background plus Python skills is actually a rare combo that certain companies really need.\n\nAlso, don't wait until you feel \"ready\" to start applying.

Check the network tab and check for a ***XHR*** or ***Fetch***, or you can even read the plain *HTML* and see if there is a *method=\"post\"* with some *inputs*). Depends on the login it can get harder or just *EZ* as fuck.  \nThen you can do it with an ***async***/***await*** function with a ***Promise.All***.\n\nSomething like this:\n\n`const page = await browser.newPage();`\n\n`await page.goto('https://yourwebtoscrap.com/login', { waitUntil: '`networkidle2' `});`\n\n`await page.type('#username', 'yourUsername');`\n\n`await page.type('#password', 'yourPassword');`\n\n`await Promise.all([`\n\n`page.click('#loginButton') ...)]`\n\n1- First problem -> If there is a ***Captcha*** \\-> You can solve with AntiCaptcha or other techs.  \n2- If you want to fully \"*automate*\" it, you can use a ***CRON***, with this you can schedule when to do something. With ***NODEJS*** you can use **node-cron**, and it looks like this:\n\n`cron.schedule('0 8 * * *', () => {`\n\n`console.log('Running scraping task at 8:00 AM every day');`\n\nBy the way, if you are using *Ubuntu*, you can check *Crontab* and take a look at it, cos it's pretty similar. Is the way *Ubuntu* schedule tasks for the *OS* (and you can schedule some scripts in Ubuntu's crontab, I did one for example to always commit something to Github once a day).\n\nIt's been a long time since I \"scrap\" a website, but I still think I can give it a try again. If you need some examples with *Node*, just tell me and I'll link the ones on my *Github*.\n\nHope it helps.",

They didn’t just throw facts at you, they used metaphors that hooked into emotionally salient narratives you already understood. They met you where you were. Docs almost never do that. They assume tabula rasa logic and ignore the emotional friction of learning.\n\nFor me personally, I can’t remember something if I learn it in isolation, like just reading the docs. I need to actually understand why I should use X or Y by thinking through what problems this solves. So instead of trying to memorize pandas functions, I focus on understanding what problem each one addresses. When I encounter groupby(), I don’t just memorize the syntax, I understand it’s for when I need to split data into groups and perform operations on each group separately.\n\nPeople think the software industry is smart because it’s lucrative, but honestly, most frameworks are born in corporate hellscapes, not classrooms. There’s almost zero thought given to long-term cognitive overhead, onboarding cost, or whether the tradeoffs even make sense outside the dev team that built it.\n\nWe don’t need more features, we need more epistemology. Teach people how to think through code, not just parrot API calls.\n\nDelete out of your mind “move fast; break things” a more mature ideology is “move slow; ask why”.\n\nAnd most importantly never give up!

The need for programmers will continue to increase for decades.  AI will not replace programmers any time soon (in fact, it's becoming clear that it enables more modalities for computation and we'll need more).\n\nIt's silly to me that we jump right to the notion of AI replacing programmers and don't discuss all of the types of jobs that use a subset of the total skills required to be a good software engineer.\n\nLogically, before you see a programmer wholesale replaced you'd have to see Translators/Court Stenographers/Draftsmen/Accountants replaced.  They do a subset of work that programmers do with deterministic rules and regulations (which we don't have).\n\nThere are so many canaries that need to die before we should be concerned.\n\nIt stands to reason, how can a human hope to control a tool when they can't understand the output?  You need LLMs to produce code that works 99%+ of the time, out of the gate, to hope to replace us, and/or have an extremely robust system of feedback loops plumbed back into the LLM with 0% hallucination.  We're nowhere near that.\n\nI love LLMs in my own workflows, but it takes my experience to get the LLM on the right track even on small workflows.  Even with specificity, I'd estimate that the LLM gets it right way less than 30% of the time, and it's my ability to debug and suggest fixes is what gets me to working solution.",

        "body": "Are you sure it's the manager? Last time I was in a hiring role, someone from HR filtered resumes and gave them to someone who then shortlisted the people I got to interview. I had to actually request access to the full pool in workday and start filtering on my own. It's also possible that you two aren't aligned on what qualified for the role means. It's very possible that none of those applicants are actually qualified and they're picking the ones they feel can learn on the job.\n\nI'm not sure where you are but I'd like to share something...A few years ago I was hiring for a test engineer. We wanted someone in the US city where the office was, where one of the company offices was or possibly remote. Out of \\~2000 applicants 1500 were not even in the US (all of them needed sponsorship which the post explicitly said wasn't available). Of the remaining 500, 450 didn't live anywhere near one of our office. Of the remaining 500 we determined that 200 weren't actually real or in the US. Of that last 300 only 20 had what appeared to be relevant test or development experience. So out of 1000+ applications there might be less than 20 worth moving on or who you actually could hire.\n\nIf you're pressed then try hacker news or posting a listing here if it's allowed",

Some are not though, it’s very hit and miss regardless of gender. Hiring is hard.\n\nI’m a woman and I’ve been a software engineer for 10 years. I am currently the only woman on my team of 14. My company is hiring right now and we’ve interviewed a bunch of people, many have been women. We’re super picky about culture fit, types of experience, and attitudes around programming though because we’re a small team so we have not filled this year’s three positions yet. \n\nI have been pleasantly surprised to see so many more women applying to these fields. There didn’t used to be very many of us out there. The ones we have interviewed were all quite knowledgeable and qualified, just in different kinds of software engineering than we need right now. We did get four in a row about a month ago, followed by a couple guys, and this job posting is in-office in a small city so there’s only so many applicants. \n\nI feel like 8 is too small of a sample size to conclusively say if it’s weird or not, especially if you’re at a medium-to-large company. I would talk to the manager about refining the screening process though if you’re not getting what you’re looking for. \n\nIf you do notice any strange behavior or comments from him about women in engineering, keep track and note the date. There are unfortunately people out there that do discriminatory hiring in either direction because they have strong opinions on what their team should look like, and also there are a few creeps in the world that want an employee whose rear-end they can stare at. Not saying your manager is one of those, but if you hear other comments or see other signs then it could be that. \n\nAs for the ratio, nobody really knows what it is right now. Everyone’s stats show different answers, and the younger women are more likely to have been exposed to programming growing up than most older women were. It became a bit more socially acceptable for your daughter to be really into computers sometime after I became an adult.",

Facebook, Twitter, Google isn't exactly sharing that what I can imagine is slightly better maintainable code to be ingested by AI. \n\nSo yeah, the code we are getting from AI is equivalent to a fresh grad making a capstone project. Yeah there's good repos out there with open source projects, but LLMs cannot tell what is good code from bad code. The majority wins. And do we think most of the code out there is good?\n\nGod, I just imagine some poor soul has consumed some manifestation of my public repo made 10 years ago and shudder.",

The models will never be perfect, but if we allow LLMs to indiscriminately consume any and all information, it's going to results in an endless feedback loop of robots talking to robots, eating each others' shit and feeding us the same... the current generation is is already trending towards lacking the skills to produce something on their own. Ive noticed that my own reliance on llms have watered down my skills and I've gone back to using Google (but it's so hard not to fall into the temptation of easy answers)\n\nOn the flip side of this, picking and choosing the content for an LLM can be equally as damaging.

And yet these solutions are repeatedly discovered to be aggravatingly restricting on what they allow you to achieve and fall way short of enterprise level software development. And the results are mediocre.\n\nNo-code & AI promise similar things, and that is the removal of expensive skilled labor.\n\nBut if \"anyone\" can do it, how much of a market edge can you really achieve? What value do you have to offer as a competitive edge if someone else can come along and vibe code a better version of your product in a week?\n\nCEOs forget, they don't hire software developers because they can do repeatative tasks, as if it's just data entry. Recruiters call them \"talent\" for a reason.\n\nThis is a note to aspiring devs as well. Don't be a robot. Anyone can learn to code. You need to bring something else to the table too, or you'll find yourself on the chopping block.",

        "body": "Go for it. IMO the toxicity of Meta is overstated on places like Blind, and Google's culture is worse than it used to be. It's true that Meta is overall more \"intense\" but what this really means is that people don't coast. Getting high ratings and raises is very doable, which is why everyone is trying to do it, and I wouldn't say that's a bad thing. The E4 -> E5 promotion is probably easier to get at Meta.\n\nThe biggest differences in my mind are:\n\n1. Meta is more customer metrics driven; a good project is a project that made the numbers go up. Whereas Google is more focused on alignment: if the senior engineers agreed your design was good, and your leadership thought it was a good idea, and you executed it well, then it was a good project regardless of what happens after. On the positive side, this means that at Google you can spend more of your time on risky, speculative things; at Meta you have to think about your time more like an investment portfolio, with some things you're pretty sure will pay off to \"fund\" your riskier ideas. On the negative side, as you advance in your career at Google you have to spend more of your time sucking up to leadership, because there is no objective way to determine whether your projects were good so it is more of a popularity contest.\n\n2. Google has better engineering practices, infrastructure, and documentation. This follows from Meta being an entertainment company; Instagram users will come back even if the app crashes sometimes, but Google Cloud customers wouldn't tolerate this. Things break pretty often at Meta. The downside of this is that you spend more time firefighting during oncall. The upside is that it's much easier to ship things. Code and design reviews are less nitpicky and there are fewer barriers to just doing things. It does mean that more knowledge at Meta is in people's heads rather than written down, so you have to build out a network of experts. There is more chatter and context switching as a result, although overall there are fewer meetings which is nice.\n\nIf you were someone who disliked the bureaucracy  at Google, Meta will be a good change of pace. They are both good companies to work at, it's all about what you value.",

Let's have Chad Jebity do it!\n\nThe result was this very large codebase that essentially creates deployment stages for every workbook that gets added into the pipeline and it iterates through a list to populate the data. It literally takes 20-30 minutes for me to run the pipeline and validate a change that usually takes 1 click in the browser.\n\nI've been trying to explain to them that this won't scale and will eventually have to get replaced, but trying to get them to understand Big O notation was like drawing blood from a stone.

That's true for other types of engineering, but unlike building a bridge or a car, in software the transition from \"development\" to \"production\" is continuous.\n\nInstead of thinking about that, orient yourself to the job the software is doing, and what specific problem its solving for people. Under that perspective, there's a minimal set of things you need to do in order to do that job. Most of development planning I do, is figuring out what is that minimal set of things we need in order for the app or whatever to be successful.\n\nThe difficult thing about software, and what will take years to learn, is to understand the tradeoff space between doing something fast that quickly solves a problem but might have a lot of tech debt, and taking more time to do something right, and having less tech debt or ongoing costs. There's no right solution, and in different business cases you'll want to make different tradeoffs.",

We have pyramids to build.\n\nMaybe you \"finished\" implementing Amazon, now you can expand into better user experience, you can improve latency on so when users click, things update faster. You can optimize infrastructure so your website costs less to keep running. You can build analytics to study user behavior and increase user dwell time/user spend/whatever metrics to target. You can build software to remove fake listings and illegal listings. Even keeping the lights on is non-trivial as you expand your user-base you'll have scaling issues, internationalization, need to deal with local tax law and compliance, etc.\n\nEven if you chose to sit on your hands the whole time and just keep things as-is you'll eventually be subject to externalities: compliance things like GDPR and CCPA (user data retention), or your business will fundamentally be disrupted as is the case with Google Search (ads) and ChatGPT changing the way users query internet.\n\nI spent the last few weeks literally writing document to define Q3 work.

There are a number of reasons why this could be justified: \n\n\\- another company or another division used the same tool that your company is using.   They were just issued a significant fine or regulatory finding because its use was ineffective. (more on this below)   Your CEO wants to avoid being tarred with the same brush.   \n\n\\- the CEO thinks too many people were aware of the use of sapience.   And therefore the investment wasn't paying off.  CEO figures to cut the recurring maintenance cost of the third party product and your boss has said they can build an in-house tool that will be just as effective. \n\n  \nOn point 1 you should be aware that regulators regularly share findings with each other.   So if company A gets a 'noted deficiency' the other auditors look for that in other companies. \n\n  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIt's also possible that your SVP is being defensive.

S/He's setting this up so s/he has evidence if the feces hits the oscillating wind generator. \n\nAnother way your SVP could be protecting themself is if they know there is some regulation or law that requires email retention or email monitoring.    They are proactively avoiding a whole series of audit comments and/or regulatory comments.  \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIt would be interesting to know the dynamic between the Board of Directors and CEO.   The Board should have a Board Member responsible for Compliance / Audit.     If you can identify that person you could send an anonymous email cc'ing the Board Chair as well asking whether they were aware that email monitoring was being discontinued.

        "body": "Before you entirely abandon this field, here are some things that might help.\n\n1,000 applications is intense. But applying online is also a saturated channel and an increasingly inefficient one. In the past 3 years, a bunch of recruiters got laid off, and according to our data, there are about 3X fewer recruiters working now than there were in the first half of 2022.\n\nAt the same time, the number of (non-spam) applicants for eng jobs has 3X'ed since the first half of 2022. I don't have numbers for how many spam applications companies are getting, but if I had to guess, I'd say that it's probably another 3-5X increase.\n\nSo, recruiters are maybe 30-50X less productive than they were a couple of years ago. Which, for you, means that applying online isn't the best approach.\n\nBefore you completely give up and switch to a field that takes over 10 years to start making money, try doing outreach instead. You can give yourself a deadline. Something like, \"If I can't get some responses by January 2026, I'm going to med school.\" And until then, I'd focus on trying to get in the door.\n\nSo, what to do? I'm one of the authors of Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview. We have a whole chapter on how to do outreach that includes some templates, and it's free: [https://bctci.co/free-chapters](https://bctci.co/free-chapters) It's the first document, and just go to Chapter 7: Getting in the Door.\n\nWhen you do your outreach, in the part of the template where you should mention something unique about you, try writing about how you were able to automate your job. I bet it's a good story.\n\nFinally, if you post a link to your resume/LinkedIn in a response to this comment, I'd be happy to review and share some notes. That said, you (and others in your shoes) probably don't need to spend lots of time on your resumes because recruiters typically scan them for brands, and either you have them or you don't. Anyone who tells you to spend a lot of time polishing your resume is probably selling snake oil.",

There's a lot of talk about tech being a boom-and-bust industry, but even to an experienced tech exec nowadays they've seen three busts:\n\n1. Dot com\n\n2. Great Recession\n\n3. Today\n\nThe difference with the first two is that tech (and especially web-based software + SaaS) has grown its talent pool significantly since 2008. One man's trash is another man's treasure. Once companies set in these Three Horsemen of the (Tech) Apocalypse (RTO, Offshoring, and Stack Ranking), those companies in the past would be seen as \"failing\" culturewise. However, in 2023-2025 the normal cycle of job changing was disrupted, so you have a lot of built-up dissatisfaction from people who want to change jobs, but can't find new opportunities. When opportunities arise at these companies with those qualities, the new folks may be arriving from something that was an even worse dumpster fire. A good example is GEICO. They fired swaths of their IT/SWE and have a 2.6 on Glassdoor. They are pretty much bottom of the barrel as far as large companies. However, if someone was working at Geico and transitioned into something like Amazon, they might find it a breath of fresh air.\n\nThe real problem at the end of the day is an oversupply of engineers. Fix the problem at the source and reduce enrollments.",

I wouldnt say he gunned for me but he was vocal on not enjoying working with me. \n\nThis guy was a higher level engineer who basically developed everything and went out of his way to make the code 100x better and refactored. But he also was the AH engineer who cut people off, wanted to get in arguments over any little disagreements and would go on rants for over an hour if someone dared to disagree. People def walked on eggshells for him. The thing was, I think he basically knew there was very little they could do to fire him. This was in FAANG for a product that had many big time customers. Even with his AH behavior, he produced results even in his sleep. In my opinion he was like what teammates say about michael jordan, he wanted it so bad he didnt care if he was an asshole about it. It sounds great in sports but in an office job, it doesnt sound as great. He would tell my manager how to do his job. I could tell my manager hated the guy too but just was complacent with him.\n\nOne time I worked with him on something major. I could tell he hated my work ethic. Im not saying I was perfect but I felt like I was getting a hand on the work at that point. When I was done, my manager decides to have a 1:1 to discuss my work with him and I basically get a list of what I could've done better. I accepted it and tried to improve on it. But guess what was in my next review session when I got underperforming, all the shit that the higher level engineer had said about me. I accepted some that I felt I could've done better but tried fighting the ones I felt were unfair. One that I remember the most was that there was a merge I did that had too many commits. I admit that it did have more commits but it was because the change we worked on had like 20 different iterations because everytime I wrote one change in, it broke something unexpected so it was a lot of trial and error. That one merge was an outlier from all my other work but it was used against me for the following year. I got Pipd shortly after.\n\nI saw the writing on the wall but I gave the company 110% and then I got fired early this year, a year after I worked with that guy. It definetley was the beginning of the end when that one higher level engineer. I dont regret it I tried respecting my work life balance and I knew early on the job wasnt for me.",

You say he is emphasizing your “poor work”, is your work actually poor? Did you get comments from senior engineers before you started coding? It sucks that you are getting singled out, but you might be working on particularly sensitive or critical stuff and that might justify a much stricter review process.\n2. If you think it’s unjustified then you could try and have a 1:1 chat with the person in private and try to figure out what the problem is. You should not assume malice, they might be very busy. If you made an RFC previously, you should be ready to say you solicited feedback early and these concerns never came up, and that you’re finding it difficult to make progress at the moment because this late feedback is asking for major overhauls. You’re hopefully looking for them to back down, or for compromise, and to figure out how to avoid this problem in future. I would also think carefully about what this person is likely to respond positively to if you want a positive outcome, much depends on the individual here.\n3. If they are being really obnoxious and unhelpful, you could always just tell your manager, and possibly start disregarding the more persnickety comments.

Side projects are very important and it shows that you enjoy / are interested in CS. \n\nSpeaking of, make sure before you go to school for CS I highly recommend doing some self learning and make something small. I know a lot of people who go to school for CS, spend the money and realize they don't like it mid-degree and switch OR even worse get their whole degree and not like to code. \n\nMake sure when selecting your major you aren't just picking something that \"makes a lot of money\" but also consider what you think is interesting. Then consider how you get there, and in many many cases you don't need a degree depending on what you decide. \n\nThe last advice I'll give is that college is always there. I get the impression you're younger, and from experience I think going to college right after high-school is one of the worst things about society. In the past going to college and \"figuring things out\" wasn't a big deal because it was priced very very differently. Now due to the cost of most colleges I'd rather recommend a new high school grad to spend time working and looking into career fields they find interesting.

Firms tend to dabble in an effort to think they cs save money and that staff are fungible.  What’s not fungible is learning and understanding of vestigial projects. Where outsourcing works is when the team is seen as another dev group and can solve projects entirely on their own without constant supervision from home office because staff have relocated there and the firm is invested for the indefinite future. Otherwise it’s executives dabbling with consulting groups that fail because they need to call in more staff to do what is being asked or write better requirements. \n\nRe - AI \n\nJust another set of tools that really depend on where they are sourcing more than anything else. \n\nThink of moving from paper to a computer in the 70s to do bookkeeping.  The general ledger was a legit book where inflows and outflows were recorded. I worked on wall street where funds would calculate their values and holdings at the end of day by hand. \n\n\nThink of a circular saw , if you don’t know how to cut 4x8 sheet of plywood well your just going to do it faster than a handsaw.

Issue was that managers would open it and walk away, causing others to be unable to make edits because the workbook was locked. I was asked if I could force it to close after a period of inactivity.  Sure - after ten minutes of inactivity it would save changes and close.  But, one of the managers totally screwed up their edits and those changes were saved.\n\nSo I was asked if I could prompt user to see if they wanted changes saved or not, before auto-closing due to inactivity. I pointed out that that would defeat the entire purpose of automatically closing it because, you know, *they’d walked away from it*. So I was told to auto close it *without* saving - except next I was told that on the first business day of the month, some of the managers entered data and would sometimes have it opened but inactive for more than ten minutes while they were working on it, and one had just lost their desired changes.  So could I have it auto-close after ten minutes of inactivity, without saving, unless it was the first business day of the month, in which case I should auto-close but save it first?\n\nAn. Excel. Workbook.  I had actual real work to do. I did it - I also got told I was being “difficult” when I asked if the managers could just be told to *close the damned workbook when they were done using it*.",

The remaining portion wouldn't matter as it would probably be same learning curve for everyone - even if someone is more suitable.\n\nThat said .. just be careful and vet all the details. Like ask them what stood in your interview. When will the role start? Why ? Any specific responsibilities they need to fill immediately? What is the reason for vacancy? What is the career trajectory and if the previous hires followed such trajectory successfully? How well funded is the team? Etc etc",

I know lots of teams that have much \"harder\" interviews but then the actual role turns into just doing dull, bite-sized tickets assigned by somebody else.\n\nSo my only conclusion is that a team's hiring practices are, at most, a relatively weak signal about the team culture and the nature of the work.\n\nI would not try to draw any strong conclusions from your hiring experience. Instead, I'd try talking to the hiring manager, talking to somebody on the team and asking questions to understand the day-to-day experience as well as the broader context around the team and the work. This isn't full-proof—I just left a miserable role at a company despite talking to multiple past coworkers who seemed happy there—but, with social questions, *nothing* is fool-proof.

That said, the military is no jobs program, when in you exist to serve, and that service is a sacrifice. If you want to fight, if you want to serve, do it, otherwise, you could easily end up worse off where you are today, in ways that will be difficult for you to imagine right now.\n\nTherefore, you need to try harder to make what you have now work. Expand your job search, hit pavement, look for roles outside of CS, be willing to move. You gotta hustle, and one way or another that's going to require a bunch more work that you are currently doing. Good luck!",

Overall, join because you want to join, not \\*just\\* because you want to try to get into CS. Not just because you want to join, everyone was multiple reasons, but at the end of the day men will be relying on you in your role, and your ability to bite the bullet and work harder for your boys is what matters. If you do it solely for your own career and everyone/thing comes second, life will suck for others, and as I've seen personally, men will die. If you do that, fuck you.\n\n2. There's lots of roles related to this field, particularly in the AF. Look into those.\n\n3. If you do it, and serve honorably, you will not regret it. Of all the good, the bad, and the ugly, and there was a lot of ugly, it's the greatest point of pride in my life and I'm thankful every day that I did it. I gained so much, both materially and non-material. \n\n4. Talk to actual vets/actives about it. Do NOT listen to anyone here who did not serve. My DMs are open. I was USMC infantry, but I have a lot of connections across fields and branches.\n\n5. It WILL help you in the job market. Good vets that get and into stem out have a great reputation of working hard, thinking critically, and being able to work under pressure. I was asked a lot in interviews about how my prior service related to my think critically and problem solve, as well as leadership roles. I always tied it into technical projects in college, but it gives you a fat jump in the game.",

I had a year of savings in my emergency fund. Unemployment is both difficult to get, doesn’t last long, and peanuts in my state compared to other states so it wouldn’t have really been much help to me.\n\n2. PIP terms were a month-long effort with goals that were realistically scoped larger than a month and also depended on the rest of the team for success. Resignation was an immediate two-week notice period but I was given the time to brush up my resume, prepare for interviews, etc. Not having to work my ass off for an extra paycheck to have two weeks of uninterrupted job search time was worth it to me.

A layoff for a company that staid in business, means that somebody didn't consider you part of the group that was worth hanging on to, while a resignation is still your own choice, and that perceived negative judgment never comes.\n\nI don't know this part for sure, but I believe there may be some kinds of background checks, like for those entrusted to very high-security operations, which asks explicitly whether you left voluntarily or involuntarily, and (again just spitballing) but I expect the check may not pass if the story doesn't match up with investigation, or if there are too many involuntary departures over a certain amount of time.",

I know somebody who spent 2 months at work before he was given anything to do aside from trainings. That was partially because it was a job at a bank and there was a lot of red tape, but also...just a super awful onboarding process.\n\nI just started a job recently, and my onboarding was kind of a mess too. HR person was on PTO and nobody picked up the slack. My manager eventually messaged me halfway through the day, but I had next-to-no guidance my first week. I just sorted my system out and noodled around company docs. Fortunately it's a remote position, so I just got to hang out and play videogames in the dead space. Not as much fun to do nothing all day when it's onsite. Sorry homie.\n\nIt sounds like you're doing the best you can. I'd ping your manager again just to check in and see where things are at, but not in a *needy* way. Just ask if there's anything you should be doing while you wait on the onboarding stuff, but I'd try to write the message in such a way that you are not concerned/bothered by it. Not a great move to annoy your manager on your first week, but it is still their job to...do something. Or at least let you know that this is how onboarding always goes.\n\n> he called me and we had a 3 min team chat where he said he would assign me an onboarding guide\n\nThis is the one thing that hits me weird. Was it *actually* 3 minutes? Not even 10? That's an alarmingly short intro call. If that's the case, I'd be prepared for him to be a very dont-give-a-fuck sort of manager. Ideally, that means your work life is chill, and not that everything is a scramble and you look bad because your manager doesn't do their side and throws you under the bus after the fact.\n\nI wouldn't sweat it yet, but there are a ton of managers out there who...need to be managed.",

After recognizing that, it's basic unwanted emotion management: Acknowledge the feeling and what it's telling you (this job is important to you), then let it go.  I find once I'm in flow, I'm fine, so it's just getting over that initial hump that takes effort.  You may have to try a few times to get past the feeling.  It's ok if this is difficult at first.  This is an important soft skill, and like all skills, it takes practice.\n\nIn my experience, it's actually really rare to be fired for performance unless you do like, literally nothing for months.  Usually it's some political game happening 3 levels above you that you have no control over, and performance is just the excuse they use to justify someone sacrificing their pawn to take a rook.  I have seen so many amazing engineers get fired for \"performance\" who were certainly out performing me.\n\nThe best way to protect yourself is to just be reliable, and get your work done.  You can't hit your target if you're watching everyone else draw their bow.\n\n~ Sincerely, a FAANG worker that has survived 3 layoffs (and probably a fourth, soon 😬)\n\nP.S.: there are two books that may help, though I've never read them.

You end up doing 70% of two jobs that require very different skill sets and I think the only way most people manage is to put in extra hours.\n\nOnce you’re beyond that level, I think your WLB actually starts to get easier because you’re no longer expected to write as much code.

And I did get a lot done. But the key thing is that my day-to-day was flexible, so I could adjust what I was doing and how hard I was working based on circumstances or even just based on how I was feeling. I got a lot done by doing high-leverage work and figuring out more effective ways to achieve my high-level aims rather than working long hours.\n\nBut that only worked because my manager was willing to trust me to make real decisions not just about how I was working day-to-day but also about what I was doing. I could go out, talk to people, understand their actual constraints and the interaction points between my system and other teams, then scope my work based on that rather than aiming for arbitrary deadlines or roadmaps. When you have the ability to just solve real problems rather than chasing output for the sake of output—and when nobody is trying to optimize your \"capacity\"—you can get a lot done without working crazy hours or burning out.\n\nOn the other hand, there are lots of teams and managers that do not operate like that. I've seen company planning processes that were clearly designed to put lots of artificial pressure on people and in those situations, yeah, a higher level role might be more stressful than a lower-level role.

Is working a LITTLE MORE than 40 \"killing yourself?\"\n\nI'm not software but I am a senior engineer of a different discipline in a different industry (chemical engineer, at EPC), and if someone was only ever \"working\" 9 to 5, we'd be suspicious that they were working sub 40 hours a week, 35-40 ish.  Given we \"bill\" every hour because we have to invoice and get paid for our designs by clients who want them, 40 hours on your time sheet means 40 hours of work.  Not... 35 + paid lunch.  You can and will get fired for that.  You're free to report 35 + 5 hours OH, but people would ask why this is the case.  I am positive I will be techsplained how software is different (yes I am aware, this isn't the point here).\n\nNot to get all Office Space Stan on people, but doing the bare minimum with respect to anything generally does not get you ahead.  9 to 5 and anything more being \"killing myself\" really sounds like 15 pieces of flare and no more.  This isn't going to be rewarded, and it can be difficult to make a lasting impact if the bare minimum is all you're willing to do.\n\nIt might be different in software, but senior around my parts implies a willingness to put in the work / time / hours when it is necessary.  Projects succeed or fail on the willingness of the senior leadership corps to do what is necessary.  Seniors are the critical force that holds the project together, that is their impact.  After that, whether or not you experienced WLB during this time frame will be by how well a project is run, project schedule, how well defined a project is... all of which conspire to define how crazy a project is.\n\nFor your case, it REALLY sounds like if you want that high TC, senior title, with ability to make impact, you're GOING to need to make peace with high pressure and hectic environments, and then critically, be willing to put in the time when it is necessary.  So if your current work DOESN'T require this extra time and extra availability, then you're likely golden.  Keep on going on.  However, are your coworkers experiencing stress, working early, working late, to get things done while you're over here working 9 to 5?  Are you complaining openly any time work requires deviation from this (don't do this if you are)?  If you're working 9 to 5 while everyone else is working 7 - 6 and drowning... then you're NOT going to get senior there.  You're NOT in the trenches with your team.  You'll have to quit and get hired as senior somewhere else (good luck with that in this environment).\n\nFor reference here... \"Projects\" I work on are 1.5 to 2 year affairs, the larger of which can easily be 1000-1250 FTE for factories/sites that can run 20-25 billion once tools are put in, with base infrastructure being between ~5-8 billion.  Error bars on these projects exceed the total cost of other megaprojects.  So these are huge... long affairs, involving many people.  My point is, that for the longer durations on this, they look and feel a lot more like traditional work.  People will remember if you put the bare minimum in or not and if the project suffered because people didn't go above and beyond.\n\nFor context, I am currently on a mega project, we can't add anymore staff because we don't have any, and the project would benefit GREATLY from 45-50 hour weeks out of our junior engineering core for a month or three to get caught up.  A few are doing this, and their scope situation is improving, but several others are not, and they're behind.  Whether or not this is recoverable, is an interesting question.  I'm not lead here... thankfully.  So we have this weird situation where everyone is drowning short term, and the group is splitting into people who make an effort, and people who do the bare minimum.  The career consequences of which won't be felt for years.  For what it is worth, engineering staff gets straight time OT on billed work, so 60 hours means a 50% increase.  It's our bonus structure to reward additional work.",

UCSD has a lot of students that will be going to big firms come this summer, and many of them will get full time offers. Being friends with those people will help a ton.\n\nFinally, you do have an internship. That research internship is something you can present as evidence that you are employable.\n\nFinally, I would wonder why you haven't taken any courses on things like OS, compilers, databases, etc. You know, core CS stuff. That might be something an employer might wonder too, why all your coursework is solely focused on Ai and ML. \n\nAs for the job search, I'm left wondering how exactly you went about that. Like, did you spend a lot of your time on LinkedIn? Handshake? In person recruiting events? Direct company applications? Indeed? There is some statistical evidence suggesting that some of these lead to jobs at higher rates than others(LinkedIn sucks for this, while Handshake and in person are a lot better).",

        "body": "Yeah man, that's absolutely way too much for a junior dev. You're basically doing the work of 3 to 4 different roles, PM, business analyst, dev, and client liaison. That's insane!!\n\nThe fact that you're handling client communications and requirements gathering alone is a huge red flag. Most companies wouldn't even let a junior dev talk to clients without supervision, let alone own the entire relationship.\n\nI've seen this pattern before. Companies dump everything on whoever's willing to take it, especially if you came from QA and they think you \"understand the business better.\" But just because you CAN do all this doesn't mean you should.\n\nYou're not crazy. This is definitely too much for a junior role. Either push back and ask for support, or start looking elsewhere. Don't let them kill your passion for development because they can't properly scope work.\n\nThe good news is you're getting exposure to a lot of different aspects of the business. Just make sure you're not sacrificing your mental health for it :')",

If the subject is making you go 'meh' in the first year, then it's hard to say what'll make you go from meh to 'wow yes' in future years.\n\nWhen I took CS, I was super engrossed and enamored by my classes.  While not every student will be quite like it, you probably need more than \"I've grown disinterested\".  My guess is your use of the online tools let you squeek by without understanding the material, which has done you a massive disservice.\n\nThis degree isn't for everyone.  If your next best option is history or polisci, I'd say you took CS because of the memes, not because of the interest or ability.  \n\nFor example, if I had to drop out of CS, I probably would have taken something in the sciences, like physics, engineering, etc.",

The less they need to critically think about the grading criteria the better in my opinion. You need to advocate for yourself, in all facets of life, because it is very unlikely that others will do it for you.\n\nIf you haven't done so, start keeping track of accomplishments throughout the year which you can point to as justifications for your rating. Even if they're small.\n\nI've even at times flat out said in my comments that I perhaps don't fully deserve the rating of 5, but since I felt I was on the cusp, I gave myself the nod because I need to advocate for myself. Be assertive but fair.\n\nNot all of this may apply to you if you truly feel that you are just middle of the road average, but you should still be your own best advocate.",

I'm also assuming (maybe this is wrong) that you are progressively getting larger features/tickets and writing longer PR's over time? If you're not that is not good.\n\n>or how to make the system scale,  perform better....\n\nWell you should be learning by just being in the room and being in discussions with those that are doing the actual work of scaling the system. That said, nobody in their right mind would be letting someone with 1.5 years of experience try to architect their system.\n\n> implement patterns\n\nDesign patterns really aren't that interesting. I would argue one of the big problems in this industry is people trying to overuse design patterns. Build something that works first...once that thing becomes annoyingly difficult to maintain you can try applying a design pattern.\n\n>decide as a senior engineer,\n\nYes no one is going to let you decide things. You are very junior.\n\n>That being said, I wanna still grow towards a more senior role, like a senior SWE or software architect\n\nSenior is hard position that is still a long ways off for you. A very fast promotion to senior would be 5 years. I've seen many people that were very good in their role take 10+ years to make Senior. I wouldn't worry that much about it. Keep working hard and keep asking your manager for bigger projects.\n\nAlso, enjoy this time because eventually you are going to miss it. Your job is low stress, nobody is really counting on you for anything, and you have free time. This will not last forever, you will have deadlines, many of them will be unreasonable. You will be asked to make hard decisions and then people will bitch and complain about it you for years afterwards when it doesn't work out. People will want things from you. Nonstop. You will have meetings, hours of them every day. Even outside of meetings people will want things from you. I literally have to go hide in a phone booth at the office to go heads down because people are always coming up to my desk to ask me things.\n\nSource: was Senior at Amazon and was also Staff at Google.",

You're trying to do everything at once and that's why you're advancing slow. Pick one thing and go deep for like 2-3 months. I'd suggest focusing on system design first since that's what'll get you to senior architect roles fastest.\n\nBut something most people miss is that you can actually grow within your current crappy role. Those support tickets? Start asking why they're happening. Is it bad error handling? Poor user experience? Scaling issues? Then propose solutions during team meetings. Even if they don't implement them, you're thinking like a senior engineer.\n\nDocument everything you fix and the impact. \"Fixed authentication bug that was affecting 15% of users\" sounds way better than \"did support tickets\" on your resume.\n\nAlso, start a side project that mirrors what you wish you were doing at work. Build something that scales, implement proper architecture, use modern patterns. This gives you real talking points in interviews.\n\nThe leetcode grind is overrated unless you're targeting FAANG. Focus on building stuff and understanding systems.\n\nOne more thing. Networking matters more than people think. We see this all the time at Metana with our bootcamp grads. The ones who connect with other developers, join communities, contribute to open source... they level up way faster than the ones just grinding tutorials alone.\n\nYou've got this, just need to be more strategic about where you spend that energy. Stop trying to learn everything and start building something real:)\n\nYour current job sucks but it's temporary. Use it as a stepping stone while you build the portfolio that gets you out.",

Asking about *why* you have to do that is spitting in the wind. You only have so much space for your resume, so why waste some of it on fleshing out skills that aren't relevant to the job you are applying for? If you do that, peopel are going to want to know *why* there isn't more verbiage that is *directly applicable* to the position. And that's why you get these questions.\n\nWhy don't people ask about TypeScript? Probably because it's the realm of front-end app development. It's a different ball game entirely from the types of jobs that want .NET or Python.\n\nThere is no industry rivalry between languages. Companies choose the language that best meets their needs and in-house experience. Only individuals play the \"your language sucks\" game, and for the most part that shit dies out before they hit their 30's.

Employers are expecting devs to be fully knowledgeable of their tools and languages, but also to use AI to quadruple their output. \n\nExcept, when you begin learning this stuff in 2025, it’s very difficult to force yourself not to use AI every time you get stuck, especially when your employer is expecting you to and their deadlines reflect that.\n\nTruly understanding programming comes from writing your own code from scratch, running into problems, and spending hours and hours nearly ripping your hair out trying to fix it. You can use AI to help understand small bugs or minor new technologies, but there is no substitute for building that foundation the hard way.\n\n**What should you do?** \n\nKeep using AI to get your intern work done, you’re already in and you’re doing your job. On the side, start really learning how to program. Since you’re already using JS, and it sounds like you’re going the web dev route so far, I recommend doing [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths). Start with foundations, then do the JS course. No use of AI allowed, at all. When you get stuck, you have to research on good ol’ google. After you complete even just the first project all on your own, you’ll feel so much more knowledgeable. Don’t drop the ball, make a weekly schedule and complete the entire course. \n\nEdit: As you learn more via your individual learning and projects, start incorporating this knowledge into your intern work. Start writing your own code as much as possible, lean less and less on the AI.\n\nOnce you’ve done that, you’ll probably have enough understanding to know what you need /want to work on next, be it PHP or something else. \n\nTo touch on your comment about REST APIs, this isn’t a language, more just a concept that you can get a general understanding of in just a couple days or weeks. The more you work with them the more you’ll understand. Again, do real research on this, take notes, and then experiment with making API calls in a personal project",

In recruiting this is often referred to as a \"pipeline\" posting or approach. \n\nI've shared some thoughts below regarding the information that you brought up in your post. \n\n\\----\n\n**Timeline & Cooling Off Periods:**  \n  \nRegarding your viability, six months is a relatively short 'cooling off' period and most companies prefer to revisit after 12 months. This is generally a better timeline for a candidate building meaningful skills/experience/knowledge. \n\n**Interview Process:**  \n  \nHaving an initial 1-2 part technical screening and 4-5 part onsite (six total) is standard, and your seventh interview round being a repeat round indicates that you did show some potential but likely failed in one key element (coding, design, or modeling). Sometimes this can result in a down-level, but that might have been the reason for the follow-up, to confirm if they should reject or down-level. \n\n**Recommended Approach:**\n\nRather than trying to frame things as \"this position has been open for very long and you should reconsider me\" I would simply check in and see if they have any new opportunities that you can be considered for, and perhaps share some of the interesting work that you have been doing over the past six months that might make you more qualified. \n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with a periodic check-in, and hiring volume can often change things (more hiring is better for candidates, less hiring often leads to a more challenging 'bar' for talent). I would still expect that it could be another 4-6 months before they reconsider you, though.",

In the beginning I did put some effort into it because the job market was terrible but whenever I hit all the things listed on the PIP they would say there are other areas I wasn’t hitting and that even if I hit everything on the PIP I still need to hit all job requirements. Essentially I would get fired no matter what. Okay whatever. \n\nHalfway (PIP was 5 weeks) they said I wasn’t meeting expectations of the PIP. I stopped trying and instead focused on interviewing elsewhere. By the end of the PIP I still haven’t found a job but was in later stages of interviews with a few places. I got offered a severence package of 2 months salary and took it to “gracefully” leave the company. I also filed for unemployment. \n\nFound a job 2 weeks into unemployment and now make more money, have a higher job title, and aren’t treated like shit. And in addition to severence I got a decent unemployment check since the start date of my new job was delayed.",

The PIP requirements are generally unreasonable and it serves as an easy way to get rid of an employee with a HR approved paper trail.\n\nThe second is poor employee performance. Managers will use this sometimes to give a struggling employee a second chance. Terms are usually reasonable although this could limit future opportunities with the company.\n\nThe third is a way to implement a quiet layoff or a stacked ranking system. This is often arbitrary and unreasonable as well but one's direct manager has limited or no flexibility in the implementation.",

The person was about to receive a very low review after pretty much getting mediocre to low reviews their entire career at the company. They would get strong feedback and then do a little better for a little while. They were flagged by hr as a candidate for pip and I couldn't really disagree with that so we put together a pretty fair pip and the employee took the offered severance instead. The other one was all stack ranking driven at a different company. At that time the bottom X% were put on pip or straight fired. My group had a guy we liked but his impact had clearly been less than others at his level. He went on pip, succeeded and eventually became a respected EM at the company. I've never worked a place where someone would use a pip to get rid of someone they \"didnt like\". Im not saying those places dont exist but I've never worked at one.",

Your team lead probably just wants you to build confidence before throwing you into the deep end, not because you suck.\n\nThe competition anxiety is real tho. When I was building startups, I'd see people constantly worried about being replaced by someone cheaper/smarter/faster. But something Ive learned is that average devs who can communicate well and understand business problems are actually gold.\n\nAbout the PM pivot tho, honestly, it could work. You already have dev background which most PMs lack. You understand technical constraints, can talk to engineers without sounding clueless, and you've got that project leadership experience.\n\nBut before you jump ship completely, maybe try focusing on becoming a technically aware PM rather than abandoning code entirely. At Metana, we see tons of people who started as \"average\" developers but found their niche by combining technical skills with other strengths\n\nAlso don't let imposter syndrome make you quit something you might actually be decent at. Maybe you're not the next senior engineer, but you could be a damn good technical PM who actually gets how software works.\n\nGive yourself more time to figure out what clicks for you before making the full pivot :)",

That means you're actually doing fine. Companies don't keep people around for a year if they're truly not cutting it.

The breakthrough usually comes when they start building real projects and connecting with other devs who share similar struggles and wins.\n\nYour current role is actually perfect for learning fundamentals properly. Enterprise environments teach you things bootcamps and tutorials never do, like working with legacy code, understanding business constraints, collaborating with teams.\n\nOne year in is still super early.

There is a reason you are a junior dev and not a senior dev.\n\nThat being said a few words of advice from someone who's been doing this for 11 years.\n\n  \n1. The fact that you can acknowledge this at all and care about it puts you ahead of the game. This was all of us at one point, myself included. I basically lied to get my first job because I was so desperate and then I had to deliver. What did I do? I wasn't the smartest person in the room but I was willing to work more than anyone around me. I worked nights and weekends, not every one but when I had the time, I was working all the time. You don't have to do this forever, but I would recommend this to any dev new on the job. Absolve yourself of the idea of \"work life balance\", cause if you wanna be good and you aren't naturally gifted, its not gunna happen. Don't get me wrong, I still played hard on the weekends when I had time, but most likely, you are young and have very little responsibilities and you need to take advantage of that. Yourself in 10 years will be on your knees thanking you.\n\n2. I had a great professor in college that told me something I never forgot. \"A great developer has read for 15 minutes for every line of code he writes\". You need to read. Read everything, read all the docs of all the tools you're using, know them front and back. Read books, clean code, clean architecture (these are terrible books btw but you need to know them), gang of four, anything you can get your hands on about programming, read it and know it.\n\n3. You need to be kinder to yourself. Believing that you can do it is 90% of the game. Instill some fight into your spirit and dig in. No one is going to advocate for you like you can advocate for yourself. Positive affirmations, whatever it takes, you have to believe you are capable.  \n  \nIf this shit was easy, literally everyone and there mom would do it. There is a reason it demands a premium in pay. I believe in you, you can do this, its gunna take some work, but you have an opportunity here to build a career that people would kill for. Make the most of it!",
