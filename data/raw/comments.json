What you're describing sounds typical, maybe even kinda good? Don't expect to find a job where you are free from dipshit architecture and handed up to date documentation of your data assets in day 1, maybe those roles exist somewhere but I haven't seen them.\n\n\nIf you think in terms of business value, I'm wondering if your org's move to the cloud was a bright idea. If you're not a fortune 500, a not-terrible on prem warehouse is perfectly adequate, and a better investment in data might have actually been to document what you have and work towards a medallion architecture just within the dwh, which would have given you the opportunity to systematically unpick the sources and transformations, embedding business logic and documenting it as you go. But dipshit architects with a vendor in their ear are far from rare, anywhere you go.\n\n\nIt feels universally accepted that if you're on prem you're not a real DE and execs and architects believe it's a fundamental truth that the cloud will unlock value. In your case it sounds like your org had a not-terrible thing going already, and fucked yourselves with a lazy lurch into the cloud that just lifted and shifted your existing problems.\n\n\nMaybe the question to ask is what it is that you like about DE. Today you've got big problems to solve and lots of business value to unlock, a management structure above you that's floundering and will think you're a wizard if you help them by implementing some common sense basics, and a pretty typical set of issues that will be familiar in any role.",

        "body": "Let me focus on data products. I have a data engineering background, and yes, these terms often get thrown into the buzzword bucket.\n\nBut I actually like thinking in data products. A little story time: Our team once had a major pipeline outage (fun fact: it was when we upgraded our Hadoop infrastructure to a new major version, what a mess 🤦‍♂️). Suddenly, everyone in the company understood our value, because they saw what broke when our tables and processes went down.\n\nUp until that point, I often struggled communicating our value to stakeholders. Then, during a sales call with a third-party company, they asked me, \"What are your data products?\", I heard it the first time and thought it was just management speak. But actually, it became quite a useful tool for me.\n\nWhile software engineers ship visible features, data engineers build invisible infrastructure. Our work powers decisions, reports, and systems behind the scenes. That makes it hard to demonstrate value.\n\nTechnically speaking, I'd define a data product as a composition of assets that, taken together, deliver a result with business relevance(!). Assets can be anything involved in the process: input tables, queries, processes, models, intermediate results, etc. If we're talking Airflow specifically (because this is well known by most), that means tables, Dags, tasks, everything involved in delivering the outcome.\n\nFrom a data engineering perspective, data products are a communication framework to make our work visible. Simple concept, but powerful for explaining what we actually deliver.\n\nFrom a management perspective, a data product is a measurable business asset with clear ROI and accountability. It's something you can point to during budget discussions, assign ownership to, and track performance against defined SLAs.\n\nHowever, not every table, task, or Dag is a data product, but it might be part of one. It's a good exercise to identify them by looking at: Business impact (if this disappeared tomorrow, would executives notice? Would customers be impacted?), orchestration complexity (we had a super Dag triggering lots of other Dags, that was a clear sign for a data product), and high-value consumption (multiple teams depending on it, feeding executive dashboards, etc.).\n\nLook at all your data assets, try to group them together as data products, and also learn what value those data products generate (e.g. what are the tables, reports used for? Is there any measurable impact like revenue, cost savings, increase retention times along the chain?). This will help you to communicate the value of your work, be it internally or when applying for a new job and it helps understanding what needs monitoring and observability.\n\n**Basically: When they work, they're invisible. When they break, everyone notices.**",

Depending on the size of the company and your relationship with them, talking to your boss’s boss is an option but could backfire if you don’t already have a working relationship there. \n\nHaving been on both sides, depending on how frequently you’re trying to get clarification/how it’s being done I could potentially understand the manager’s side. I’ve had employees who seem to reach out with questions whenever there’s any kind of decision that needs to be made or they run into any kind of roadblock, rather than trying to figure it out themselves first, and it can be draining when it ends up being a regular interruption. Ideally a manager wants to be able to point you in the right direction, answer your questions up front, and then generally let you do your thing. \n\n\nI think it’s also worth acknowledging the difference between effort and results. If I have an engineer who is “lazy” but gets things done without issue or automates things to make their job easier, and another that is always working hard but seems to struggle a lot, I’ll take the lazy one every time. \n\nNot trying to doubt what you’re saying or anything, just some things to consider. \n\nAll of that said, if you think your review did not reflect your actual performance, and the company doesn’t value you, then absolutely find a job somewhere that does value your talents. It can also be the case that your manager is incompetent or a jerk, and there’s no obligation to stick around.",

For a while I've been able to weight the proportion towards admin/engineering/come-architecture work because of some team changes around me, and seniority, I guess.\n\nBack to the blurry line, though.  If a data engineer \"does pipelines\"... WTF even is a \"pipeline\"?  Isn't it just input to output?  What's the output of a data engineer?  Varies wildly, I'd say.  Probably also very dependent on team makeup, like mine.  If output is data at a cleaned/\"silver\" state where an \"analyst\" or \"modeller\" comes in to then make it star schema or something else: well, for me in my place, that's not worth much.  50% value kind of thing.  Good for the self service analyst who wants to just get it into Excel.  Maybe you don't want to build enterprise reports with it, though, for example.\n\nSo, if a \"data engineer does pipelines\" is part of the definition of an engineer, and that pipeline involves extracting data from an SQL server or an API feed into some kind of staging area in a warehouse or data lake....  I repeat my thinking, that's half the job at best, and worth that much.  In that case we would do some general analysis of the raw/source data; set up some options in config/metadata; set up the automation; and that's kind of that bit done.

Business wants you to say ‘yes this is accurate’, then shit on you if they find something they deem inaccurate, it’s typical cover-your-ass where words like ‘accountable’ get thrown around - things can get spicy, but rarely get better. First Come up with a definition of what must be in place for you to ‘trust’ a data source - eg minimum 100 randomly sampled days over a 3 year timeline showing 0% variance from your ‘source of truth’ reports, maybe you need monitoring, referential integrity testing etc - whatever you think you would need to be able to say to them ‘yes, based on our definition of accurate, this is accurate’. Once you have that list, make a spreadsheet that lists sources, and which boxes on your ‘trust checklist’ they meet or not. This should be something you personally believe vs a list off the internet IMO as you need to adapt it to your businesses goals / quality thresholds. \n\nDepending on how familiar you are with the data sources, prioritize that list and have a discussion with management about why/what needs to get implemented. If they deny it, every time something wrong gets caught in production, make a note on that list of which data sources had problems because a feature in your checklist wasn’t implemented. \n\nThis makes things less emotional/loose and more working in quantifiable/tangible steps towards achievable goals - you do just have to hold the line on the pressure thing, keep discussions very black and white & honest about timelines business can expect - don’t fall into the trap of grossly underestimating just to keep them happy, those timeline bills come due eventually. \n\nGood luck!",

Different versions of Spark will occasionally change data types around for defaults and can make your life, well interesting, especially if you’re using SQL as well. More importantly, it’s faster.\n\nAlso, side note - the in-memory “advantage” had more to do with comparing against Hadoop map-reduce rather than Python itself. MR defaulted to writing every round back to disk before starting the next. This made things significantly slower than a similar operation in Spark. But that was 10+ years ago, and there were alternatives even then.",

It's better if you use a combination of standard approaches (column level masking with policy tags, row level access controls, authorised views) in my opinion.\n\nYou _can_ use custom masking routines in your column level security. This involves creating a UDF that operates on the column and decides how to mask it. To make this work, you need to insert suitable info into the column, so you'd need to do something a bit hacky:\n\n1. create a column in an upstream layer indicating whether a row's ID is present in your list of those-to-be-masked\n2. prepend some identifier to the column of interest if it's in a row that needs masking\n\n```\nSELECT\n    CONCAT(\n        IF(to_be_masked, 'MASKME::', ''),\n        valuable_col\n    ) AS valuable_col,\n...\n```\n\n3. Define your custom masking routine to strip the prefix and hash the value if the prefix exists, otherwise ignore it\n\n\nI think this would essentially get you what you want, but it looks brittle and is somewhat complex.

For example, our transformation layer uses a dbt ci similar to what is described in their [documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/continuous-integration) (modified for our specific workflow). Our consumers build either off of UAT or PROD, depending on the stage of the feature we are building for them. \n\nUnlike typical git workflows for stateless applications, our data engineers need to merge to each branch sequentially. It looks like this:\n\n1) Merge Feature to DEV - check if DEV Environment data passes tests\n\n2) Merge Feature to UAT - consumers connect their dashboards/scripts/aimodels to UAT environment and report back on what they need changed\n\n3) Merge Feature to PROD - once consumers are happy, we release to prod, which has some additional checks and needs a senior data eng to sign off\n\n  \nMajor downside of the approach we have not been able to resolve is that PROD/UAT/DEV branches will have a different commit history.",

If your team includes the DEs, AEs, and DAs then I could see there being a struggle to deliver some layers (medallions) to UAT but not others.

This matters more in a larger org, but dev can move ahead and work on features that are not ready to be UAT-ed. This allows consumers to do a more thorough job of validating, which I often think of as \"I need to go talk to so-and-so who knows the business more to see if these results look right\", and if so-and-so is busy for the next week then at least engineers can move forward on the dev branch.",

And if you need more, Cloudera provides private, on-prem, or cloud-based environments for running your data applications, workbenches, and ML/AI models, all while keeping your data and applications securely within your own premises (or cloud account).\n\nThanks for reading my sales pitch.

Meaning its not a a run-at-3-am cron scheduler, but instead events & rules on an aws event bus. So in this example the \"choosing batch\" does not automatically exclude the Event Driven part. Our glue jobs were built to process records in batch, but then we also went back and swapped out the scheduled runs with pub-sub events.... and all of this was done **without touching the glue code...**\n\n  \nBatch to streaming is a bigger effort to transition to. Scheduled to event driven is much easier, I do not mind using aws event bridge + step functions. Eventually I'll get around to refreshing quicksight data sets with the same pattern. \n\n\n\nThe use case we up against still does **not require streaming**, It's more about cramming a growning amount of ETL into the off business hours. This is becoming more of a need and less of a wish as complexity grows and threading needles with schedules no longer is practical.",

Almost all data pipelines I build leverage small micro-batches with event & temporal triggering:  \n\n   * Data streams into files on s3, persisted once either a time or size threshold is met.  Max time is typically 1-15 minutes, depending on the feed.\n   * Once it lands all further processing is typically event-driven leveraging s3 event notifications and parallel processing kubernetes, ecs, lambda, or whatever.\n   * If downstream apps need to run against newly-arriving files, they can subscribe to s3 event notifications for when they do.  These can also be translated to load timestamps & ids if the apps want to query the database rather than just read the s3 file.\n   * If downstream apps need to run against a certain newly-arrived period of data (ex: the most recent day/hour/etc) then a specific agent is responsible for periodically querying the data and is solely responsible for dictating when a given period is complete.  And then it sends out a sns message and apps can subscribe to that.\n\nThe net results is that it's extremely resistant to data quality problems from late-arriving data, it delivers data as quickly as it's economically feasible, most of the system is fault-tolerant and self-healing, and you don't have bloated daily processes failing in the middle of the night and lengthy outages, you deploy during the day, you know immediately if there are problems, and it doesn't take 8 hours in the middle of the night to know if the fix worked.",

If you have 4 worker nodes each with 8 cores you need to repartition or coalesce by 32 and the column you're partitioning on (assuming all the data for one partition can fit in the proportion of each machine so you don't get memory issues where the data either gets split or you get out of memory errors )\n\n\nThat way all the data for each write will be grouped on the one node you're using and each writer will just be able to write the full partition.\n\n\nYou get multiple files when spark is writing to one location from multiple writers , as it can't append columns , only write new files ",

Much easier to maintain, can be unit tested using duckdb or polars, etc. Can write dynamic for loops over your time buckets to simplify the repeated features that just change 1 dimension. You also get the benefit that you can write your features once and switch query engine later as needed, which brings me to #2.\n\nFor #2, SQL Server is not going to scale well for what you’re trying to do. I think a better columnar query engine would work better especially for wide datasets like your features. If you use Narwhals for #1, you can then test out some others including Polars and duckdb that don’t require any special infrastructure beyond installing a Python package. You may find that by doing your heavy joins in SQL then dumping to a file/in-memory, these other query engines are better suited for generating the features.",

Either of these are almost used across different domains for DWH. \nRemember, Snowflake is easy to pickup since it does all the background work like cluster mgmt, micro partitions where as Databricks has slightly uphill learning curve since the users need to learn resource and cluster management, partitioning, etc. \n\nIn data engineering world, both AWS and Azure are heavily used. Companies that has web based application tend to use AWS from my past experience. In US, both AWS and Azure are popular. In Canada, have seen more of a Microsoft shop across.\nNot many companies use GCP in data engineering world. You can start with either AWS or Azure and cloud skills are easily transferable from one cloud to another, with just a few differences. ",

Many companies are not big enough to have a team dedicated solely to EDI, but I have seen a lot of companies outsource it.\n\nAs a DE, I’ve only worked heavily in EDI at one company, but that’s because I was the “go to” tech guy for just about everything. I basically setup up the field mappings to our ERP, did some testing with vendors/distributors, and handed off to the respective department. That department then owned the process from there.\n\nEDI could be a nice to have on your resume if you come across it in the wild, but I don’t see a lot of companies asking for it for DE roles.

First DE assess the DBT code, snowflake way of handling features, then back to the data model.

You might need a mild-prescription pair of glasses for screen work. \n\nI have one eye very slightly short-sighted and the other very slightly long-sighted. It doesn't affect any other part of my life and I CAN read my computer screen just fine - nothing is blurry etc. \n\nBut if I don't use my glasses for a normal work day, then by the end of the day my eyes are really tired and struggle to keep the screen in focus. It's nothing to do with lighting, font sizes etc. It's just that my eye muscles are working to bring the long- and short-sight discrepancy back in line; they can do it for a few hours but like any muscles they tire eventually. So I wear my glasses all the time when at my desk - and still feel fresh at the end of the day.",

We packaged it and exposed it through a FastAPI endpoint. It was deployed on k8s with a load balancer for horizontal and elastic scaling. The main app called the endpoint with the payload and we answered with a float (the score).  \nUsing FastAPI background tasks, we sent asynchronously the payload, timestamp and score as a JSON to S3 (we could also have published it to Kafka). Then, a small ETL orchestrated by Prefect imported the JSONs into ClickHouse. The API was capable of answering the request in \\~100ms. It was fast enough for the small product we had back then.\n\nComing back to Flink: I believe that for usecases that requires statefulness, it is indeed the best solution. You could also use Spark, even though it will very likely be slower. Another good fit is TImeplus/Proton (waaaaaaay easier to setup than Flink, the tradeoff being the flexibility on the choice of the pattern).",

I think that is ideal to get started with local development, as it also creates a basic Airflow project structure for you, where you can add your DAG. If you are on mac, just install it via brew install astro, then make a new directory for your project and run:\n\n    astro dev init\n\nAnd afterwards, run the following command to start your local Airflow environment:\n\n    astro dev start\n\nI would not recommend switching to Airflow 2, there are enough pragmatic ways to get the latest version running. If you still have issues, please share a few environment details and the actual error.\n\nHave fun 🫶",

One day you will want to add unit tests for the transformation, for corner cases, etc. and having logic in pure functions (functions that takes DataFrame and return DataFrame) will simplify things, because you won't need to mock i/o, but can just write tests.\n2. Move configuration logic away from transformation logic. You can create a singleton \"context\" class or an abstract class for the \"job\" and re-use it everywhere. When I say \"configuration\" I mean things like partition dates, input schemas or s3 paths. Again, it will simplify both maintenance (anyone who wants just to check a path or a config do not need to dive into transformation logic) and testing (you can test config and transformation separately).\n3. Do not write a very long chain of pyspark transformations, it is really hard to read. Instead separate logical parts into small functions. Simplify reading the code, transformation and testing.\n\nOverall: the main benefit of using PySpark DF API over SQL is that you can benefit from all the Python tooling for working with growing complexity of the codebase (functions, classes, imports, objects, tests, etc.). So, such a migraton, imo, makes sense only if you are going to use this benefits. In other words, you should start thinking about your ETL as about the software product and use the correspondence best practices. If you just convert SQL to DF API calls it will be much worser: you won't use benefits of DF API, but you will suffer from downsides of DF API.",

Not to discourage you, but my two cents if you're main goal is maximising TC, I'd say getting into IT isn't worth it. No one knows, but my guess is you're path of maximal TC will be to stick in traditional eng and eventually transition to management. That will probably pay off better in the long term and be easier then trying to move to IT/DE.\n\nIf you do want advice on moving, I made the transition through self study. What I did first, and my recommendation is to start with cs50 which is Harvard's free into to computer science course. I think it's worth doing even if you end up studying a master's. If probably also recommend casting a wide net for data or software engineering, especially look out for embedded engineering which might be a good niche giving your background. Good luck again!",

However, I pretty much made my living undoing the work that people like this did. I don't really have the bandwidth to get too involved, but if you want to DM me and connect, I'd be happy to review whatever approach you get recommended by said freelancers and give my thoughts.\n\nIn all data projects, the most difficult part isn't so much the technology, but rather understanding the inputs and outputs. To hire a freelancer or get some better feedback from us here, you'll need a comprehensive list of all the platforms you want to source data from, the available methods of extracting that data, where you want to send it, and how you want to interact with it. For example, do you just want to run consolidated reporting from the various platforms you've mentioned? Do you want to push data from one into another?

The Backend and Tasks seem to be the main expansion of your transactional data, so your processing bottleneck will hit there first. I don’t think your CMS and Docs will expand on an exponential scale compared to the other 2.\n\nExplore docker, kubernetes and Airflow, then see if you can have your ETL/ELT processes organised for them to be running in parallel or sequence. I’m not too sure cost-wise if it’s cheaper to run via EC2 instances or directly using the services directly in cloud (Google Composer). Use airflow to produce an aggregated table so that the BI reports pull the required info quickly.\n\nFor the 60 man organisation, ask yourself if the staff are well versed to write their own queries, or are they excel-dependent. Can they write their own views? But also subject this to some form of approval before running it directly in the database. A SELECT * will incur costs to the moon very quickly.\n\nYou need to assess if transformed data is sufficient for now (data warehouse), and considering transitioning to a data lake after when you are integrating data from other sources.\n\nI hope that offers some direction for you.

I will keep the advice general and vendor-neutral.\n\nYou are on the right track. What you are feeling now is the natural boundary of relying on complex views in OLTP Postgres for BI and cross-system logic. The good news is that your data volume is still small, so you have a lot of cheap, simple options before needing a heavy architecture.\n\nA very important point: you do not need to move out of Postgres yet. One of the biggest cost-effective wins is to stop running 20-join views and instead materialize those transformations into tables on a schedule. Postgres can easily serve modeled fact and dimension tables for years at your size. And even in a warehouse or a data lake, you end up materializing tables anyway, so this work is never wasted.\n\nIf you eventually add a warehouse, S3 + Athena or Snowflake are both very cost-conscious. You are already on AWS, your data volumes are small, and both fit the medallion pattern cleanly. Athena is extremely cheap (5$ / TB processed). Snowflake gives more predictable performance on small workloads. If you are comfortable running your own infra, ClickHouse on a single VM is one of the strongest low-cost OLAP choices and works well for real-time dashboards.\n\nWhatever platform you choose, keep your transformations in SQL. At your scale, you do not need Spark or distributed compute. Most transformations and even ML feature engineering can be done in SQL. Use Python only where absolutely necessary.\n\nA big structural improvement is to model your Backend and Camunda data properly once. Instead of repeating joins or routing everything through a massive consolidated view, create clean fact and dimension tables in Postgres or the warehouse. This will eliminate most of your current performance limitations.\n\nFor ML and RAG, storing curated datasets as Parquet in S3 is ideal. Cheap, flexible, and compatible with all downstream tools.\n\nFor ingestion, modeling, scheduling, and lineage, you can keep things simple by using a single unified tool. Bruin can pull from&to Postgres and APIs, run SQL transformations, and give you lineage and a catalog without stitching together multiple systems.\n\nIf you prefer a more modular setup, dbt plus a scheduler (Airflow, Prefect, Dagster) is the standard alternative.\n\nAt your stage, a simple setup is enough: keep everything in Postgres with materialized tables, or store raw data in S3 and model it in Athena or Snowflake before sending it to Metabase and saving ML datasets in Parquet. This keeps costs low and gives you a clean foundation for BI, ML, and RAG.",

Primarily used SQL and Alteryx with some tableau data viz sprinkled in. Here I started dabbling with API integrations to help automate aspects of my job because I hated the “manuality” of it if that makes sense. \n\n -> \n\nData Engineer (current) $125,000/yr + 10%-20% bonus potential.

I used the fundamentals of economic thinking to guide how and why I learned technology.\n\nIn 2025, you barely need more than CS50 level coding skills and a few personal projects to get started.

One meetup was a presentation by Ericsson VP and a UT Arlington professor and they shared a case study on Ericsson investing in their employees who have that domain knowledge but have little to no experience in data and AI or CS. They trained the employees and shared the results of the program. They stressed the importance of domain knowledge in this field... not many data engineers come in with that business and contextual knowledge, which may lead to low retention and motivation rates. \n\nYour multidisciplinary background is valuable. Being able to understand the economics context with the data you're working with is critical. Me, I have a communications master's degree-- pivoting after 15 years of media related work. And despite not having a CS background, my background is a strength because it's important to communicate your findings, translating technical terms to layman's terms, and convincing the stakeholders of the business value (or risk if you're advising them against certain actions). \n\nMy advice is to find local meetups, career fairs, mixers etc. and make in-person connections. Ask questions to not just people in the data engineering field but in other aspects of business-- the accountants, the recruiters, the managers, etc.",

Your job becomes tied to the collective outcome of your team, and managing people, which can be more challenging than writing ETL pipelines sometimes.\n\nYou mentioned you're completing your SWE degree, and have concerns about your growth due to lack of a manager/repetitive job process.\n\nI'd start asking myself:\n\n1. Do I still want to grow my technical skills? If I become a manager, would this hinder my time capacity to juggle both technical projects and managing people at the same time.\n2. If I become a leader - what kind of leader should I be? Should I stay technical and handle 50% of the implementation, or focus more on the high level architectures and strategies of the team.\n\nI'd also encourage you to discuss your concerns with your CDO - since he has more context on your situation. Communicate openly about your goals, and create an actionable plan on how you can achieve them.\n\n>Should I explore an alternative career trajectory, such as transitioning toward a Data Scientist role?\n\nOnly consider this if you're interested in Statistics/Quantitative projects. A big part of Data Science is story-telling and communicating results to business stakeholders.\n\nI personally stuck with DE because I love the software part of the job; building pipelines, optimizing Spark jobs, managing AWS/GCP costs etc.\n\nMost people don't realize Data Science has more to do with communication than technical - that's why many Econ/Social Sciences people do well in data science (not talking about MLOps or hard core data science PhD jobs of course)\n\n>What critical internal questions should I ask myself to ensure I make the most informed decision about my future path? \\*Should I ask for a salary update? of how much? 15%?\n\n15% raise is reasonable for promotions or \"very good\" performances. In general, single digit raise for non-promotions is normal. Double digit for promotions, exceptional or new job.\n\nFor salary negotiations, I'd start with having a X number, where X is the highest you'd want. Then ask for slightly higher than X. Also have a number Y which is the minimum salary you would accept,\n\nDuring salary conversations, try to center the conversation around your future responsibilities at the company, and re-defining your current scope of job to match that new salary.\n\nHope this helps!",

This will populate an object in the Databricks catalog that allows you to query/explore the DB as though it were a native table. Downside is that performance can be rough as you relinquish control over the query in favor of a simpler interface. Spoiler: this is using JDBC under the hood\nRelevant docs: https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/query-federation/sql-server\n\n\nThere are other ways (sqlalchemy for example), but these two options have worked well in my experience.\n\nIf you're pulling multiple tables from the same db, set up a class or set of functions to allow yourself to reuse them for any datasets you need to pull. This way your workflow can read like a series of simple steps ex: get_max_cdc_column, fetch_new_data, add_metadata_columns, write_to_delta.

Use something CDC-aware to land data in a “raw” zone (ADLS / Blob) and let Databricks just do transformations on a shared cluster / job cluster.\n2. Or use Databricks directly, but centralize it: one or a few pipelines per DB, scheduled jobs, and a shared compute / serverless SQL warehouse, instead of one pipeline = one cluster.\n\nThe confusing bit with Databricks “Ingestion Pipelines” is they’re optimized for their own Auto Loader + cloud files, not as a general CDC platform, so you end up with lots of tiny jobs and infra to babysit. For heavy SQL Server CDC, a lot of folks offload that part to a dedicated movement tool, then just point Databricks at the Delta / Parquet that shows up. Estuary does this pretty cleanly: MSSQL CDC -> Delta in near-real-time, and then your analysts just read Delta from Databricks without each pipeline spinning its own compute.\n\nCouple qs to narrow it down:\n\n* Are you okay with “near real-time” (seconds to minutes) vs strict real-time?\n* Do you *need* Databricks to own the ingestion, or are you open to using a separate CDC tool and keeping Databricks for transforms / AI only?\n\nI work at Estuary, so take that into account.",

It also puts a bunch of extraneous load on your servers and db (we've seen APIs be taken down because they were being scraped aggressively for BI purposes).\n* you can let your customers download CSVs. Like the first option, this will take work on your side to support and operationalize. The upside is that it's a pretty well understood pattern. The downside is that your customers might get annoyed quickly because this is a manual process: if they want data with any kind of regularity, they'll have to do this over and over again.\n* you can upload the data to an S3 bucket (or other object storage like R2 / GCS) and let your customers read it there. This is similar to giving them access to a database that you own, but gives you better cost and load protection: they'll be using their own compute to read it so it's less likely they'll blow up your bill by reading the data (though they can rack up big egress fees if your dataset is large).\n* you can share data directly to your customer's database or data warehouse. The upside is that the data shows up directly where they're ready to consume it, and they have to do zero work in order to get the data. It's also much more secure than letting them access your database directly (for example, they can't take your database down by accident by putting undue load on it). The downside is that it can be more or less cumbersome for your team to implement, depending on whether you build it in house or use existing tools. If you decide to use tools for this, assuming your data exists in places other than that RDS instance, you can leverage some of the native sharing functionality of some data warehouses (eg Databricks' Delta Sharing, or Snowflake's Data Sharing). Alternatively, you can use a vendor like us ([https://prequel.co](https://prequel.co/)) that will let you write data from your database instance directly to your customer's db / warehouse regardless of what stack they run.\n\n*Full transparency: we're a software vendor in this space.*",

Even though your old systems are completely shut off, the legacy data still remains accessible for audit-related requirements.\n* **Security**: Your obsolete systems are often vulnerable to numerous security threats which can compromise your entire IT infrastructure. By decommissioning legacy systems, you can ensure that your existing infrastructure is secure and protected from any unwanted breach.\n* **Sustainability goals**: By downsizing your old system, you can significantly reduce the energy consumption required to run the obsolete systems, contributing to your organisation's sustainability targets. \n\nApart from these significant advantages, another important factor to keep in mind is that you can also outsource your **legacy** system **decommissioning** requirements to a professional expert. One such partner that I came across on LinkedIn is TJC Group. You can reach out to their decommissioning experts to address all your system retirement concerns.",

It's because many people who know how to do IT-type stuff are incredibly good at doing those kinds of things. What they are generally terrible at is communication, for example explaining how some library or other works.\n\nGood succinct explanations would make even the most difficult technology accessible to all. \n\nThink about Amazon Web Services. When I started to look into it a few years ago I became really depressed because I thought I had suddenly become stupid. It was almost impenetrable. Now that I know something about it I find myself asking, \"Would it really hurt AWS to write just a few pages – just two, for crying out aloud – that tells beginners what the hell the whole thing is about?\"\n\nI have just bought a book on Terraform. It's good but only because I already know about Terraform. Documentation is similar. Too much of it is written by people who think that everyone understands things already. In which case, why do they bother writing the documentation in the first place?",

I had to learn to observe negative space, proportions, values, and all sorts of details that I wouldn’t have even noticed if I hadn’t trained my brain to think that way. It is a completely different way of thinking (and seeing the world) from programming. Switching between the two ways of thinking I found to be incredibly difficult and mentally exhausting.

Do what's important by yourself, use AI for everything else.\n\nFor example, if someone is trying to practice if-else and loops by making a hangman game, the logic of the game is important and thus it's relevant to do by yourself. Meanwhile, I see nothing wrong in using AI to build a GUI to make it feel like a proper game.",

It’s pretty easy to go to C++ with an uunderstanding of C, but hard to come back to C when you’re accustomed to things like vectors, stdlib functions and so on.\n\nI urge you to have atleast a minimal amount of pure C programming in low level fundamentals like memory, containers like arrays and so on. You can continue using C++, but you’re still being abstracted away from low level, just that you still have an option should you choose it.\n\nBy extension, learn a tiny bit of assembly as well. It’s generally impractical and isn’t seen as a general use language, but it comes in handy some times. Not to mention the theoretical understanding you develop in learning to use it, and a few discouraged programming paradigms that it makes you use like goto. It makes you think in interesting ways.",

Add Git, Linux, and CMake early, and after each topic, build something small, a console app, a mini game, or even your own data structure implementation. That’s where real learning happens. Once you’re comfortable with the fundamentals, you can always switch directions later, but trying to mix frontend and C++ from the start will only slow you down.",

        "body": "I did a career switch also when being 28. From logistics to CS. Logistics was fine but it did not fascinate me. Messing around with computers, experimenting with viruses (at one point my laptop was full of malware), camping our computer classroom during secondary/high school studies - all of that was interesting for me. So, I went for a degree and I never regret it. Started Bachelor studies when being 28. Graduated when being 32, and then followed it up with Master studies in Cyber security. And working as a junior software developer at the same time.\n\nSelf-study will not take you far. You do not know what you do not know but what you should know. While in a university professors know what you should know and make you to study it. Even when you do not like it. Yes, you can google \"X roadmap\" or something but this only touches the main topics not tells what exactly you have to learn in it. You can also pick some online bootcamp course, but this only teaches you the very basics that usually is not enough to get hired.\n\nWith self study your portfolio will be much more generic. You'll be copying the tutorials you are following, writing meaningless calculators. While university studies will introduce you into much more complex topics and also will give you more variety ideas that you can turn into projects. Either as part of your course studies, as part of hackathons, part of the computer club or robotics club or such that you might join, or as your Bachelor thesis project. \n\nAlso, you'll learn all the theory that comes handy later on. Online tutorials and bootcamps show you how to write a functioning simple prototype but they do not tell you why to do it the way you are doing. And often they leave out all kinds of things that will be needed during your work as a software developer.\n\nAnd then there are connections. All your course mates, professors, computer club mates, they can later on help you with finding a job. Most of your course mates graduate and get hired. Some of the professors already are working in different companies while also part time being lecturers in a university. People can give you referrals. You'll get none of that as a self-learner. \n\nNow, to the downside of doing these studies: you won't be able to study full time and work full time at the same time. Either your studies will stretch over to 4-6 years, to lower your study load, or you'll have to lower your work load. I was working with 50% load and studying full time. And I run out of all the free time. Sometimes my flatmates (I shared an apartment with other students) found me sleeping in the middle of my notebooks. I feel into sleep while studying. \n\nAlso, it can cost for you. Where I am from, university studies are free for our citizens. Well, free as long as you are passing your exams and not failing some course. Retaking a course will cost. But in other countries it can be that the studies fully cost money. \n\nI will put it so: how will you stand out as a self-learner from the crowd of university graduates, vocational school graduates, and junior developers changing their company? Why a company should hire a self-learner over a guy who has a degree? If you can figure it out for yourself, then sure, go with a self-study. But if you do not have a strong plan to have an advantage over degree holders, then go for a degree.",

I would take a look at Business Analyst or Data Analyst career with your background. If you’re in Sales now, I’m assuming you’re good at communicating, persuasion and maybe how business works. Translating tech talk to something simple so that stakeholders can understand is essential. You don’t need to be super techy to be a BA, you need to be organized, communicate clearly, and able to move the “needle-over” on projects consistently. Not saying this is an Easy job whatsoever, but it is fulfilling and can be learned. Data Analyst make data digestible to stakeholders so that they can make informed business decisions. Good luck",

With stuff that clearly comes from an AI: needless comments, helper methods that make no sense, deleted parts of unit tests / integration tests, unnecessary visibility modifications (making a method public when it has absolutely no reason to be public), using full-path dependencies in a code (instead of using \"import this.is.some.package.dependency\" they use it as \"var this.is.some.package.dependency = some value or initialization\", etc. Stuff that serves no purpose or is even dangerous (deleting functionality to \"fix\" tests).\n\nWe have just rejected such PRs when the PR makes no sense. If it is a small code smell or such, we let them change it. If it is a nonsense, then we reject it and tell to rewrite the code. \"IDK\" is not acceptable answer to comments that we add.\n\nThere have been also some complaints that we do not accept such PRs and the task stays unfinished because of taking too much time in the code review phase. But then we just escalated our concerns to our managers. It is their responsibility to talk with the managers of other teams for them to deal with their developers. Inside our team we do use AI tools but we also share both pros and cons with each other to teach the whole team to not fully rely on an AI and to not permit AI-generated code that does not first pass the review/criticism of the developer himself. \n\nWe also are using SonarQube tool for checking some of the more common mistakes in coding style and such. The person who is pushing his PR has to fix these findings before even forwarding the PR to somebody for a review. We will not consider a PR that has unfixed findings from SonarQube and from one vulnerability check scanner.\n\nAlso, the PR has to have a good test coverage (measured by another tool). Adding a feature without tests that verify its functionality, that also is not an option. The coverage % will drop and is visible from the PR.\n\nI'd say that first talk with these bad actors. If talking does not work then escalate it to your manager. And just reject such PRs / do not approve these. Set merge rules to prohibit a merge without an approval. So they can't even sneak pass your unapproved review.",

I've worked with plenty of indie teams of the latter, and the skill/experience level of the programmers that you find in those are very low. It's usually someone who just started learning game dev after watching a tutorial video on YouTube. Sometimes, you find someone who already knows how to code because they're a CS major in college or something. It's almost never an actual experienced programmer, because they're usually not out and about looking for unpaid or rev-share work. \n\nIt's one of the main reasons why I stopped working with other programmers on projects. I can code the game by myself, and I team up with artists, composers, etc., to cover the skills I'm not good at. Finding a good programmer out in the wild is like finding a needle in a haystack, and the bad ones just slow down the team. Even when someone says they have several years of experience, you have to take it with a grain of salt. I worked for a studio with a dev whose LinkedIn showed 3 years of game dev experience, but he didn't understand the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms. He wrote a path finding algorithm that took 3-7 seconds instead of the 40 milliseconds it should have taken after I fixed the bug. The bug? The GetNeighbors function was iterating over every tile in the game board (several thousand of them) to find the neighboring tiles each time it was called, instead of simply retrieving a stored list of neighbors or using a constant time method like adding/subtracting 1 to the X, Y, Z coordinates.  \n\nIf your studio is actually paying people, your studio needs to re-evaluate what they're paying for. If it's a team of volunteers, just let go of the unskilled programmers.\n\nI also hope that your studio isn't trying to build a MMORPG that's supposed to have thousands of players all in the same server interacting with each other in real-time or something along that line. If the project is over scoped to a degree that's challenging even for AAA studios, it's very unlikely that your studio will succeed with a team of volunteers who have no obligation to stay on the project. I've seen plenty of those from the numerous \"idea guys\" that frequent the collaboration channels on game dev Discord servers.",

Tone back the anxiety and dread and allow yourself to rest a little, making bits of progress. Follow their request. Be more communicative. \n\n\nIf you were there for that long, they likely won't be firing you if you maintain a positive attitude, check in more, and ask for advice. \n\n\nIn fact, you could probably slow your progress to an absolute crawl, but they might not care if you're really great to be around and look as if you're working hard.\n\n\n.\n\n\nDon't devolve yourself into a puddle of stress and anxiety. When you talk to your boss, don't have every conversation be about how stressed you are, how you're feeling down, etc. \n\n\nInstead, hold it in and be chipper. Instead of, \"I'm so stressed I don't know what to do can you help me?\", ask \"hey, I got done with that task you gave me! Am I progressing alright? If you need to me to speed it up, I'll be right on it!\"\n\n\nIf they tell you're great with some little nitpick, don't speed up and stress. Thank them for the feedback and maybe throw in a nice comment or two. \n\n\nIf they say you can pick up the pace a little, don't speed up and stress. Instead, \"Got it! I'll get right to it! Do you have any advice for me to help me along, perhaps something to focus in on?\"\n\n\nThey might give advice or direct you to your coworkers.  \n\n\nWhen you talk to your coworkers, don't be down, sad, and anxious. Let them know, \"man, I've been making so much progress but that imposter syndrome is vicious. You ever get that feeling?\" \n\n\nIf they're open to it, ask them what they've done to overcome it and how they progressed. You can spin negative things in a positive light through tone, word choice, and body language. \n\n\nYou can also throw in, \"I finished that one task, for some reason it was an absolute doozy! Still. I'm sorry for getting in a bit late. Would you have some advice for being more effective next time?\" to whoever assigns the task. They may already say it via their response, but you can also slip in a question about their expectations for the time frame and how to speed up your workflow to match it.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nStop judging yourself based on your own inflated metrics. Don't judge yourself on other people's behalf. Let them determine whether you're making good progress (like your boss said) or not.\n\n\nAs long as you actively *show* people you're improving, then they'll be lenient towards you. You don't show them by sitting in a corner by yourself stressing. You actively talk to them, keep it positive, don't reveal how seriously stressed you've been, and slowly open *them* up for advice and help. See what they're feeling, their thoughts, and their processes. Ask for their advice on your current work, your plans for progress, etc. Don't overwhelm them, but give them little bits to bite at while you're allowing them to speak a lot about themselves and their work/feelings. Make sure to let them know how great their advice was after you've implemented it.\n\n\nIf you present yourself as a good listener, pleasant to talk to, open to feedback, and always seeking advice, even if your progress is a small fraction of the speed it is now, people will *feel* like you're working harder than ever before, even with missing tasks dates. That's the beauty of perception. ",

If necessary then participate in the next team event and just have either one on one talk or one on X talk. Either sit down with them in a sauna and just sit in that hot place and talk with everybody. Or, if you are drinking alcohol then drink with others. Or something else. Point being: be in a relaxing environment and just talk with people as fellow people not as your team mates. Talking helps. Little ranting helps. They will tell you how they see it. Just bond with your team not grow distanced of everybody.\n\nBut coming back to your work then it is absolutely normal that you won't be on the same level as everybody else after being a junior just for 5 months. Forget comparing yourself with mid-level or senior-level developers. They are mid and senior because they have a whole lot of more experience, knowledge and skills. And they gained it with time. They also were juniors once. They also were slow, once. And even there is no point to compare yourself with other juniors. Every junior has a different past. Some juniors got a degree. Do you have a degree or you have a diploma or neither? Some juniors participated in computer clubs and such, during their studies. Some have been coding since a kid/teenager because their parents were in the IT field.\n\nCompare yourself only with the past you. Did you learn anything new during the sprint (or, if your team is not using sprints then during last week/month)? If you did, then well done. You are only competing with yourself. Not with others.\n\nAsk your boss if the time estimate in these tasks is taking you into consideration or the time estimate is how majority of the team members should be able to finish it in time. Let's say the time estimate is 3 days. Is this 3 days what your team mates should be able to do it in given time or is this 3 days also what a fresh junior should handle? Ask him what will happen when you deliver your task one or two days later. Depending on a project it can be that nothing happens. Some projects are quite agile. Client is fine with waiting some days more. Other are public sector projects where the government and ministries are setting fixed deadlines that can't be changed. Perhaps you delivering your stuff one or two days later, as a new junior, is totally fine. YOU must talk with your boss over this.\n\nYou are not expected to work off the clock. This can give wrong idea to the boss. Perhaps they should put more days or story points to the estimate when going over the tasks in the backlog. But when you are working at the night or something then they will not see this (unless you push your stuff, then pipelines will leave a mark behind). Work 8 hours a day. For the better or for the worse. You doing overhours WILL start affecting the quality of your tasks. Right now you are freaking out over a bug. The next time you might blow up their test environment or something. Because of being too tired, from working more than 8 hours. Stop working more. Get rest.\n\nBugs happen. This is why QA and/or developers testing the product exist. Even mids and sometimes senior developers have a bug in their code, a missed business case. Or a client asks something to be changed. You have to write tests to your functionality. Then test locally. Then test in your team's testing environment (if it exists). And after that pass it on to your team mates (QA or just other developers). They will do a code review and will do the testing. It is a normal process flow. Especially as it was a small bug. That is fine.\n\nYour boss is right. You must communicate more. If you are stuck then ask for help. Tell what you tried, what did not work out, where do you think the issue is (or where it is not). And people will help you out then. If you feel that you are running out of hours then talk with your boss. It is his job to ask more hours from the client or re-prioritize tasks. But when you are not communicating with your team and with your boss, then nobody can help you.",

Learn how to code without AI, re-learn the basics and start from scratch because that is what its going to take. Do it in your free time so it doesnt immediately affect your work. Pick a stack and stick with it, i suggest picking something you have already worked with because you will already be familiar with it.\n\nDo some small projects without AI, just using your problem solving skills, documentation, and stack overflow if you need. You will still need to identify a problem, identify multiple solutions, and decide which solution is best applicable to your problem. \n\nYou wont git gud tomorrow or next week. Itll take time but you need to put in the work and stop outsourcing to AI. AI should be an assistant not a crutch.",

Writing completely new code is rather uncommon too.\n\nFor example, a lot of AI programming is being done in Python. Because there are communities using Python, there's not a great push to move that to, say, Rust or Gleam.\n\nYou fall into the trap many beginners fall into.

It would help to know alot about the local population nearest the target location, their timing, methods, patterns...

It is their job to guide students and people who want to start their studies in given university.\n\nBut going purely by a guess then better pick software engineering. It should cover more than just a development. Because real life software development is not only writing code but more than that. Software engineering curriculum should be more relevant.

Non-IT people (HR, managers and such) are investing more into AI tools because they think that the AI is better than a human developer. And they are not hiring juniors that much. As a software developer I say, the current AI is performing perhaps worse than some junior developers. Yes, it can generate code but it requires a constant overseeing. Or it will generate nonsense that a)does not compile, b)deletes existing functionality, c)introduces bugs, d)does not cover all the required use cases.\n\nWhen the bubble will pop then there will be again more openings for juniors.

Its possible the examples it provides are both correct and also helpful for that particular student for that specific example and at that particular moment in the students educational arc. But its likely not. The student needs to be a really dedicated autodidact to make sure they follow up throwing away the example and re-implementing it without help, or making similar examples without help. But when learning, the generation of \"similar examples\" is by definition beyond the ken of the one that can't generate the first example\n\nIn the cases where it helps, it seems to help by accident and quite at random, and more often just lead people in a very unhelpful direction",

It's like a riddle. And you will get your solution at least a little wrong, every time, for as long as you're a programmer. And then you have a new problem: figuring out why your solution is wrong.\n\nThis isn't a problem. It's just how programming works. If you are easily frustrated by this, then the solution is either to just keep learning and practicing and doing problems until it doesn't bother you as much, or else find a new hobby with fewer built-in frustrations.\n\nRegular practice is key. There are lots of good problem sets out there. For Python, I'm a fan of the Exercism tracks, although they can be a little unfriendly for very new programmers.",

Use what you learned, automate something, build a useful little app that makes your life easier.  \n\nIn this moment i’m learning python, but i really hated the dependencies and setting up the venvs and the testers and testing. So i went a little deeper to really understand that part and automated it. So now if i start a new project i run a makefile and it sets up the venv, main dependencies, linters, and a basic unit test. So i can start a new project or tutorial without worrying. While i learned a lot about dose parts. Next up ( i’m a devops engineer ) is setup the same thing for a basic CI/CD to eventually get my python code up into docker on my local homelab. These things i spend about 20/25% of my time on, i learn something for my job, i learn more about python and in the meanwhile i make my own life easier.\n\nMain get away is, enjoy the process!

Burnout does not really happen when it’s fun, it mostly comes from forcing your self to do things X amount of time while not enjoying it.",

You don't need to learn every single thing from all of those areas, or even from a single book. Just being familiar with the core ideas / basics helps a lot. Then slowly study more of those books and topics as time goes by.\n\nBut here are some of the best programming books that were popular already back in the 1990s:\n\n* The Art Of Computer Programming series of books (Donald Knuth)\n* Design Patterns (Gamma, Helm, etc.)\n* Anti Patterns (Brown, Malveau)\n* Refactoring (Martin Fowler)\n* Pragmatic Programmer (Hunt, Thomas)\n* Introduction To Algorithms (Cormen, Leiserson)\n\nThose should get you really far. And the more you test everything you've read and learned from the books, the faster you'll become good at what you do. So don't wait to try out the ideas from those books. Try them out when you're reading, if possible. Pick a project or two and develop them from start to finish. You'll learn tons that way. Only reading doesn't get you very far. You have to design and implement something larger.",

Like when you play tic-tac-toe, you both see the actual board with Xs and Os, and you imagine how the board will look once you place your next mark.\n\nThat is also how software works, there is some sort of output, if not explicitly graphical or visual, at least observable in some way, and there is an invisible internal representation, that you can't experience, but that the program \"knows\" and uses to decide its next move, or determine who won. \n\nAnd in both games and programs there's input that manipulates the internal model - often with very different results, depending on the previous state of that model.\n\nAnd of course, games have rules - often you follow an actual algorithm when playing a game, or at least you have some fixed pattern of steps to perform, and there is, if not an algorithm, then a fairly strict way of determining a winner or loser, or if the game should continue.\n\nAnd most important of all for learning - there is a lot of repetition in games, both as a player and a developer you are iterating a lot, gradually improving, and always trying various combinations. So often you work a lot more with a game than any other program you are creating, you actually enjoy playing your own game, and try to beat it - whereas with a CRUD system for Student administration or a Car Rental, you'll just build one feature and get quickly on with the next one as soon as it seems to work sufficiently.\n\nSo there are a lot of similarities between playing games, creating games, and building programs.\n\nAnd they are often fun to create and use!",

Functions can be given other functions as arguments which makes this quite a bit more powerful than it sounds at first.  \n\nBy all means learn useful OOP, but also learn functional programming concepts.

Go with Python for its clean syntax—check Codecademy's free module or Python docs to build easy classes, say a Car with drive and honk methods. Java's good too if you want stricter rules; Oracle's tutorials are free and solid.\n\nOnce that's down, build projects to make it real,a text RPG with inheriting character classes or a bank app with transaction types. Use Replit for quick setups and GitHub to track and learn from others. Do a couple projects monthly; that's where OOP clicks, not just reading.\n\nFor deeper stuff, grab \"Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design\" for its visual take or \"Clean Code\" for practical tips. freeCodeCamp has interactive sections, Coursera's Java OOP course from Duke is structured well, and YouTube spots like Corey Schafer show examples clearly.

I very much recommend that for a -very- deep dive!\n\n  \nIf you are more into data structures than user interfaces, taking a deep dive into the **Collections framework** in Java is another interesting example of using OOP!\n\n  \nAnd of course, there's always the option of building your own game - like e.g. **a simple text adventure**, with objects representing items, rooms and characters, using inheritance and polymorphism to give different items either similar or different attributes, and letting objects communicate, like hitting an enemy with a weapon could happen as the player-object calling a hit-method on the enemy-object with a weapon-object, and the enemy-object then asks the weapon-object how much damage it would inflict, and subtract from its own health.

        "body": "Well, when you have solved the performance bottlenecks of the network and the database, then you just need a programming language that isn't slower than those two. I guess that anything developed in the past 40-50 years should be fast enough.\n\nRegarding scalability - what do you mean? Scaling the number of users, the number of requests, the frequency of requests, the number of services involved in each request? Scalability isn't just a word you can slap on the entire application, you need to be more specific. Also, it has more to do with the chosen architecture than the programming language - every language can scale to billions of objects without issues.\n\nWhat should the AI do? And why is that part of the REST API? There is usually no AI in REST, on the contrary, REST is (mostly) supposed to always return the same responses to the same requests - something AI doesn't really do.\n\nAnd finally - what do you actually mean by \"build my own REST API\"?   \nEvery single time you create an application that accepts HTTP requests, you kind of \"build your own REST API\" - it is literally just accepting requests and returning responses. Are you perhaps confusing an actual application with the interface to talk to it?",

You get good scalability with this approach: nodejs's Cluster functionality lets you run multiple long-lived server processes in parallel.\n\nIt also offers robust database connection pooling, which helps with getting good performance under heavy concurrency.\n\nBy the way, you need to choose a language, a server stack, a database, and a web framework, not just a language, for a project like this. \n\nI suggest Typescript, nodejs, Linux, PostgreSQL, and either Express or Fastify.  If you really want to scale up to black-friday volume, take a look at the HAPI framework. I worked with a guy who supported high-volume production with that at Walmart.com, and he spoke well of it.\n\nMy suggestions. Other people obviously have other suggestions.",

        "body": "I got into software engineering in my 40s, with no college or connections in the industry, and coming from a radically different sector (brick and mortar retail). ngl it's definitely hard mode getting your \\*first\\* job, but after that first one you're basically indistinguishable from any other candidate.\n\nMy journey in a nutshell: I was a self-taught programmer who'd never met another software engineer in my life. I quit my old job to move to a major tech hub (this was before I had kids -- it would be much harder to do this now) because, you know, you should go where the money is. And by \"move\" I mean \"sleep on the floor of the one guy I know in this city\".\n\nI was very quickly disabused of the notion I'd get hired as a software engineer because 1) I had absolutely no worthwhile experience to speak of, and no one is hiring you off a portfolio.\\[0\\] 2) I was objectively unqualified, which I can now say with the benefit of hindsight. I wasn't competent enough to understand how actually incompetent I was.\n\nAfter sleeping on my friend's floor for a scary six months of unemployment and failing to get hired as a software engineer, I changed my approach from \"What can I do to get someone to hire me as a software engineer?\" (because that clearly wasn't working) to \"What can I do to get on a path that will allow me to take meaningful steps toward my goal?\" and this basically unlocked everything for me.\n\nI made lists of what I deemed the \"right\" companies to facilitate my growth. These were:\n\n1. Companies that were smallish but definitely growing. Successful startups or just post-startup-phase companies. Places like this, you're going to get asked to flex out of your zone all the time, and internal mobility is very high relative to the Googles or Metas of the world.\n2. Companies where software engineering was in the DNA of the company: whether it was a strong engineering brand, or the customers were engineers. I wanted to become a software engineer, so I wanted a place that had software engineering top of mind (ie not like, a photo-sharing app or dog-walking-as-a-service or whatever).\n\nAnd I guess (3): a place where my past background might be at least slightly relevant, to leverage in some way the value of my past life.\n\nAnd from there I made it my goal to get \\*any\\* role in one of those companies. I would have taken a role in the kitchen.\n\nI got hired as a non-technical customer support agent at what was the dream company on my list. And I spent the next few years proving to them that I am awesome and capable of bigger and better things, and after a few years transitioned internally to a software engineering role, which I would have ABSOLUTELY NOT ever been considered for as an external candidate, largely because I was not competent to do the job. It's much, much easier to become competent while you're inside the house. When you're on the outside, you're largely flying blind and it's very very easy to waste energy. Inside, you will get \\*precise\\* intelligence about what you need to succeed.\n\nAnd I've been here ever since. Dream job.\n\n\\[0\\] unless it's literally insane or you are some major tech influencer / Techerati Twitter / library-maintaining celebrity / etc",

I had done courses and written projects, but were talking a website for a darts leader board (no auth or devops or security) and a heap of courses basically reordering arrays and finding numbers who’s sqrt is a prime in On.

I failed that task before I moved on to another and eventually figured out how to read debug logs and just got on with it. \n\nFast forward 6 years, I’m pretty solid with what I do.

Break everything down in to small manageable tasks.\n\nAnd those memes where people say “don’t touch this code because it works and no one knows how/why” are bullshit.

When I realized my college had left too many gaps, I joined the Boston Institute of Analytics, and the mix of personal attention, resume-building guidance, and actual career support made a real difference. \n\n\nThat structure is what helped me turn scattered learning into something job-ready and eventually get placed as a Decision Scientist at LTIMindtree. If you want a clear path, pick a few trusted resources, build steadily, and don’t underestimate how much a good guided program can accelerate your progress.",

Their intent would be clearer if they'd called the function `toggleAutoPlay` too.\n\nYou don't need the if statement at all if you use code like this:-\n\n    let intervalId;\n    \n    function startAutoPlay() {\n      intervalId = setInterval(function () {\n          const playerMove = pickComputerMove();\n          playGame(playerMove);\n        }, 1000);\n      document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').innerHTML = 'Stop';\n      document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').onClick = stopAutoPlay;\n    };\n    \n    \n    function stopAutoPlay() {\n      clearInterval(intervalId);\n      document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').innerHTML = 'Auto Play';\n      document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').onClick = startAutoPlay;\n    };\n\nInstead of checking state variables and branching, you just make the click event point to the right code block in the first place,  Personally I'm not a big fan of the choice to put the looping function inline either, there's a lot to be said for a few extra lines of code and the additional clarity.",

In the `else` statement, it stops autoplaying.\n\nWe don't know the state of `isAutoPlaying` at the time someone calls the `autoPlay()` function. It's initialized to `false` but that will change over the course of the app running. `autoPlay()` isn't called immediately. We don't actually see *where* it's called in this code, but my bet is it's tied to a button click event. So when the app starts running, it's `false`, and then the first time `autoPlay()` is called it will call the first branch of the `if` statement and set `isAutoPlaying` to `true`. The next time it's called, `isAutoPlaying` will be `true` and run the `else` branch instead, resetting `isAutoPlaying` to `false` again.\n\nQuick edit: The statement `!isAutoPlaying` doesn't actually change the value of `isAutoPlaying`. The value doesn't change until it's explicitly set with an `=` sign. It's just flipping the value in that one `if` statement.",

There were always questions I had no idea about, even after all those years, or things I simply hadn’t used in a long time and couldn't remember anymore.\n\nSo I started creating my own flashcards, for example for JavaScript, and printing them out. After two or three months of learning in my free time, I knew the answers to all the questions I had prepared. I passed nine out of ten interviews (meaning I answered all their questions), and I think about half of the companies ended up offering me a job.\n\nBased on that positive experience, over a year ago I built an app with flashcards and quizzes for developers to prepare for technical interviews, and now a few thousand people use it. Most flashcards are free (about 70 percent across 30 categories), and the subscription unlocks quizzes, which also help track progress more effectively. Of course, all of this was before AI appeared. Today it is much harder to even get an interview invitation and there are far more candidates applying for each position, so in my opinion it is even more important to be well prepared in order to stand out.\n\nIf you’d like to test your knowledge, let me know.

So, it is clear you're already getting better at coding.\n\nOne hint I will suggest, always keep the older versions of your coding efforts. Because then you can compare the versions and you too will see and understand how much you are improving.\n\n**Now to your question.**\n\nWith the current code structure, it is difficult to create an enum and then switch on that enum value, meaning it is time to write a new version of this code.\n\nYou could achieve this result using a `map` and an `enum`.\n\nHere is information on how to use a map: [https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map.html](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map.html)\n\nTo do this you would create an enum:\n\n    enum class Months\n    {\n      Summmer,\n      Autumn,\n      Winter,\n      Spring\n    };\n\nThen declare a map to map each month to an enum value:\n\n`std::map<std::string, Months> months;`\n\nThen you just load the map:\n\n    months[\"January\"]  = Months::Winter;\n    months[\"February\"] = Months::Winter;\n    ....\n    months[\"December\"] = Months::Winter;\n\nNow you can use this map to get an enum value for any user input and then switch on that enum value.\n\nBut make sure you also cater for the case where the user input is not found in the map.\n\nAlso consider making the map lookup case insensitive.",

The reason people will give you advice to write the engine instead of a game is because the more \"I do this so it magically works\" you let into your coding the less you can build on what you learn.

Getting general programming knowledge from just programming anything is very valuable, though. It's also hard to get programming experience if you're not interested in what your building.

UNIX pros will have no trouble typing the above command, but after a few times of using it they will probably start to hate it. New users, of course, will be lost trying to type the above.\n\nImagine your program worked like this instead:\n\n    ./my_awesome_program -o my_output.txt my_input.txt\n\nIn general, that's much easier to use, for newbs and pros alike. But of course you'll have to write at minimum some code for processing the arguments (see Python's argparse, for example), and code for opening input files, opening output files, checking for errors, etc. However, such code is definitely reusable across projects, though, so once you've written it once, you can and should reuse it in many different such command-line tools, not only to prevent code rewriting, but also to enforce \"consistency\" in your CLI apps.\n\nBTW, even for programs that accept input parameters by naming files, it's a popular convention to also allow an option to read from standard input. This is particularly useful if the input the user wants to process comes from another file. Typically this option is called \"-\":\n\n    ./some_other_program_that_produces_output | ./my_awesome_program -o out.txt -\n\nSo in that way of calling the program, the output goes to out.txt, and the input comes from standard input (specified by the - argument for the filename), which we can see comes from some other program (but your program should not know nor care about that). Python's argparse may have an option and/or example for handling this as well (see the manual).",

That's what I did on the mobile website I built: \n\nhttps://sea-air-towers.herokuapp.com/mobile-app-shortcut \n\n👆🏼 That mobile website works on both desktop and mobile phone. No need to have an Android app in Kotlin, an iPhone app in Swift, and also a desktop website. One thing works across all platforms. Less work. Also, the user doesn't have to wait a while to install something from the app store the first time they use it. \n\nBut yeah, I personally generally only need something to be a mobile app when it has like 3D graphics, like a videogame. If it's just pages and text a mobile website works fine. As another person said, if you really, really need a mobile app that you download and install from your phone's app store, you can use Apache Cordova after you built the mobile website and just plug your existing website code (HTML, CSS  JavaScript) into Apache Cordova. Heck, you might even be able to get away with just a Progressive Web App (a PWA). See: \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app",

The front end's entire existence is built upon what your back end provides it. You will need to make available what the front end needs, which often involves knowing a decent amount about front end development. \n\nE.g. You're working with a server-rendered app and the front end suddenly needs some back end data globally available. You *could* create an endpoint and have the front end devs request the data from the back end when the JS runs. But... you just sent the page to the client, and it's a single context, right? So you could just render some JS into the page to define some global data, avoiding the unnecessary round trip, and tell front end devs they have the data already. (I'm not saying this matters per se, just an example of some knowledge of front end helping you make a back end decision. There might be reasons you *want* an endpoint instead).",

I don’t care if a backend dev knows the intricacies of flex box or what browsers css-grid works in, they should know that giving the UI a huge garbled mess, and telling them to just sort and filter it all out in the UI, that’s not only a jerk thing to do, it’s MUCH slower to do almost any of that in a browser on a 5 year old phone than to just do it on the server (could also be a vulnerability based on what it is).\n\nAs another person said however: if you do have to make a change in the UI, you should know what you’re doing, within reason.

But the more mutable state you have the more bug-prone you inherently are and the harder it is actually parallelize your program, not to mention that people are undisciplined and leak internal state everywhere anyway…\n\nAnd as the video you saw points out OOP=Inheritance+Encapsulation. And inheritance is in general kinda pointless… Composition is better mechanism of abstraction and parametric polymorphism/parametric types (think of C++ templates) are way better way of code reuse, there has been at-least million PLT texts written on this topic, they aren’t that hard to find either. So that’s why in lot of people say that OOP is essentially just a method of encapsulation.\n\nAlso as someone in this thread pointed out, everybody defines OOP bit differently, for what’s it worth I recently saw this definition and kinda liked it: ”compile-time hierarchy of encapsulation that matches the domain model”",

        "body": "Object Oriented Programming is based on an ideology, whereas Functional Programming is based on mathematical principles. I'll tell you right now that FP is consistently smaller, faster, easier to maintain, and scales better than OOP. You REALLY should focus on FP.\n\nThe principles of OOP do not cause OOP, they come out of OOP as a consequence. So you can use abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance as standalone idioms, or in other paradigms - Functional Programming has all these things, too - and you can still completely miss OOP.\n\nOOP is all about message passing. It's also known as the Actor Model of computation, which you might want to read up on. There's an old tome called Theory of Objects you might want to track down and read, you might want to Google Alan Kay and Carl Hewitt. You might also benefit from dabbling in Smalltalk for a bit - Squeak is a modern implementation.\n\n---\n\nIn OOP - you send messages to objects, and the objects decide ENTIRELY how to handle that message.\n\nYou do not call `car.accelerate();`, you instead create a message, \"I wanna go faster\", and you pass that to the driver, and the driver decides what to do with that. MAYBE they accelerate the car, maybe they maintain a more consistent speed by moving to a less busy lane, maybe they take a shorter route, maybe they're already doing everything they can and have to ignore you.\n\nJava doesn't have a message passing interface like Smalltalk an C++ do, but you can build something - make a `Producer` and `Consumer`, both derived from `Runnable`, that share a `Message` queue. In Smalltalk, message passing is a language level construct. In C++, it's standard streams.\n\nYou are giving the object - the actor, autonomy and agency. You are not giving up control. You don't need to command the object what to do and when to do it; it's your object - you built it, you designed it, you've just relocated WHAT and WHEN to somewhere else in your design - when you construct the object. Want a more aggressive driver? Give it more aggressive characteristics as a part of it's construction parameters. Now when you pass it messages, you know it will drive as predictably as you have prescribed.\n\nObjects have no public interface beyond the message passing interface, maybe some necessary boilerplate per your language. You don't GET or SET anything - members are implementation details. You don't push or pull information, you can send it messages with new information, or you can submit a question or query and maybe get a response. Normally objects are constructed in terms of other objects. A car that is accelerated - you don't QUERY the car for the speed, the transmission sends a message to the speedometer, which could be a text output, it could be a widget, an analog device, a HUD...\n\nSo in OOP, you assemble this graph structure of objects as your nodes and message channels as your edges. Your inputs are a source, a monitor, a motor controller, a log file... These are sinks. Things in the middle of the graph can be both sources and sinks - you can make objects that produce their own messages, consume messages, and produce other messages as a response. Perhaps a motor controller is producing heat, speed and power consumption on its own, but also responds to control inputs to speed up or slow down, and acknowledges it received the request.\n\nI dunno, use your imagination.\n\nOOP is GREAT for graph theory, which means it's great for distributed systems. Bjarne invented C++ because he wanted to build network simulators (could have just done it with a matrix - linear algebra is great for solving for networks), but its performance is quite damningly limited. It's ability to scale is also limited - you can scale your graph horizontally all you want, but eventually the size of the network becomes the most limiting factor and you can't get additional performance.\n\nYou can abstract any problem into the OOP domain. That doesn't mean it's a good fit. You can make a text character an object and pass it a message asking it to capitalize itself. This is how Smalltalk works, since everything is an object. But consider the overhead... OOP, Smalltalk presumed a smart compiler, an investment in the paradigm could make the object oriented nature compile out, leaving optimal machine code behind. I don't suppose that's flawed, but it would be an investment in this unique programming paradigm. You're basically trying to get the paradigm out of the way so you can get back down to the lambda calculus formula of computation that the program should actually be.\n\nSo in any of these languages, you can create User Defined Types, as classes certainly are, but that doesn't make them object oriented. Without that autonomous agency, without message passing, it's just more imperative programming, where you're taking direct, explicit control of what happens, when and where.\n\nAnd think about it, once you have an object that accepts messages - you have abstraction aka complexity hiding; you don't know how the object is implemented and you don't care so long as it behaves as it should in lieu of the message. You have encapsulation, which is that bundling of state and functions, aka you can build it internally in terms of stateful behavior. You have polymorphism, which is the ability to interchange any object for any other and they each decide what a message means to them. And you have inheritance, which is an implementation detail, but gives you type hierarchies for when that is sometimes useful.\n\nYou weren't TRYING for any of that, but you get it for free.",

Most users have a surplus of compute available at any given moment, but that extra cost adds up quickly for bots.\n\nFor example, lets use factorization as this compute. The server can take a list of prime numbers, and select 'n' random prime numbers from that list (repeats allowed), quickly compute the product and send it to the client. The client then needs to factor the product into it's prime factors and send those back to the server, which is a lot more work than computing the product.\n\nThe tricky part there is finding hard enough problems to meaningfully deter bots, but not force users on potato (crappy) computers off your site.",

This would help you to expand your learning of other tools and frameworks at the same time. Since it's building a portfolio, I would really urge you to learn accessibility from the start (screen readers, keyboard nav, contrast).

They aren't built into a language because many programming languages are intended to be available to write programs for more than one OS/platform, and including a GUI library would make the language's library quite large.  GUIs for the various operating systems can also behave significantly differently, with different philosophies, so making a standard GUI library that works with everything would be fairly complex and not very practical.\n\nSome developers write command-line applications (without a GUI), so for those reasons, language designers typically choose not to include GUI capabilities directly in a programming language.",

Like in the beginning, there was just the console terminal, and people had to write programs that moved the cursor, colored parts of the screen, wrote text on the screen buffer.  Then framebuffered graphics cards became a thing, and then all of a sudden there were window managers and bitmaps, but the languages pretty much stayed the same. Libraries of course helped create an interface between the language and how data was represented visually.\n\nThere will always be a separate layer between the general purpose language and the UI. Also, people have different ideas of how a UI should be represented. For example, the Win32 API lets you call the OS layer to draw windows, buttons and style them according to the OS, but that means you can't use your program code as-is on another platform like Linux.\n\nLibraries like GTK and QT attempt to solve this problem by creating their own API, which calls the underlying OS to create some of the OS-layer objects like windows, but does the rest of the display stuff itself, in order to have a consistent cross-platform experience.\n\nSo most language rely on separate libraries or frameworks, like C#/.NET having WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) that is Windows-only, or AvaloniaUI which is cross-platform, and MAUI, which is... well...\n\nThen different libraries have different ways of abstracting the layout, so WPF uses XML or rather XAML, Kotlin has it written as code.",

There are frameworks for building GUIs with imperative code, but they're not great to work with. \n\nDeclarative languages, however, are great for building GUIs. For example, HTML.

I'm seeing that you're systematically doing things instead of just \"given this, give me this\".\n\nI'm just worried that your first instinct is to ask AI about the error instead of going through the code first or using the error logs. If you use AI last, that's fine. But it is very important for you to not use AI as much as possible as early as possible as it sounds like you're just learning Java for college.\n\nI suggest that you review the fundamentals again. You can even use AI to create a guideline for you. Just double check its output for accuracy. Then you learn how to debug. Then once you get the fundamentals down, you can go with more complex lessons like OOP, Java-specific things, etc.  You'll know you understand it enough when you start paying more attention to what AI outputs, and you go \"wait, why is it done this way instead of this?\".\n\nAlso I haven't mentioned it yet, but people would agree that another method to learn faster is to find a mentor or ask in Reddit or Discord communities. I don't really know any Discord communities, but I know Java enough, so feel free to ask me questions in the DMs. I'm good to help whenever I'm available.",

Debugging code is where you actually start to build your diagnostic muscles.\n\nAny programmer will have tales of woe of the time they spent hours, if not days, hunting down something as trivial as a badly declared variable.  However, that suffering will have made them better programmers and probably taught them innumerable things they didn't realize at the time.\n\n> I ask AI what I can do too make the program better.\n\nWhile an LLM can barf out code that does stuff, it achieves this feat by stealing all available code from programmers it can find.  Fixing code is something an AI does far less well.  They will, of course, offer suggestions with complete confidence; which is kind of worse.\n\nComputer generated code has always sucked.  Now it's more clever about it, but a human can still put the bots to shame.\n\nA \"better program\" is also rather subjective.  Do you want clearer, faster, or smaller, all of which tend to fight against each other.  It should be what you think is better.  The more you program, the more of an idea you'll have of what your \"better\" is.  The AI's idea of better should not be yours.",

That function name can then be explicit about what that part does, making the whole code more readable).  \n- Things will come with practice. Don't think of yourself as unable, or dumb, or whatever. It will come, just keep practicing and learning and doing, make your own life easy when you can (for example, good variable names, again, is a way to make your life easy).

So your HealthComponent is a generic piece of code that provides ANY actor/node/object with a health variable, and all  the functions to take it away, give it back, and otherwise modify it. Then you keep creating components, and at the end of the day, you have a really quick and modular way to apply concepts to a new type of creature, or object.\n\nOOP is the idea of inheritance - you create a base enemy class, then a spear enemy that inherits from the base enemy, and a bow enemy that inherits from the base enemy.",

The number of keywords and the total amount of syntax is smaller than most languages, so even compared to pure JavaScript running outside of any environment, JavaScript has twice as much syntax.\n\nBut my guess is that you're not comparing apples to apples. When you say you look up documentation for JavaScript, are you talking about looking up DOM APIs like addEventListener, querySelectorAll, and so on? None of those are actually part of JavaScript, they're part of the web platform which has tens of thousands of JavaScript APIs. Or if you're on the backend then you've got the thousands of APIs in Node.js, Express.js, and whatever else you're using on the server side.\n\nSo if your JS code is using the web platform or Node.js but your C program is \"pure C\" that just reads and writes files, for example, then it's not a fair comparison.\n\nI'll bet that if you write C code for a Linux kernel driver, or a GTK+ or Win32 GUI application, for example, you'd look up documentation just as much as when you write JavaScript.",

Talk through the problems presented to you and ask questions to clarify whatever you do not understand. When I am doing technical interviews these are the three main things I am looking for. I want to see that your are comfortable in your environment, that you communicate well and you talk through problems (your thought process).\n\nApproach this part like you are in a meeting with colleagues working through a problem together. Ask questions if you have them and talk through your thought process as you solve the problem. Even if you know the answer straight away and can just type it out, talk it through as you type with your team mates (the interviewers in this case) to let them know what you are doing.\n\nRemember to stay calm and be as comfortable as you can. It is just a meeting between co-workers.\n\nInterviews are a two-way street. You are interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you. Ask questions about the work environment, process, how work is assigned (jira, etc), how the team knows what to work on (is there a product owner), and what the typical workday looks like and whatever else you think you need to know to make a go/no-go decision.\n\nAs far as the programming part goes, try not to stress too much. There is not a lot of time so you won't be building anything crazy. Unless they said it will be long. You know theory so definitely talk that through as you solve the problem. I am looking for problem solving skills more than I am looking for typing skills.\n\nWork on the stuff on the list they gave you. Practice in your IDE.\n\nI hope this helps.",

I don't care much about the code, I care that you understand and can talk through the problem and the solution. He was talking while writing the comments and the code. Writing out his thoughts and working through it together in comments is really where the solution happened. It became a typing exercise from there. Do this.\n\nNow for the interviewcoder part. I did not see that it helped him that much. This guy understood the problem by talking it out with the interviewer. They worked together to figure out the requirements. Implementing the solution was a typing exercise at that point. He was copying the solution from the tool but he could have been doing the same by translating the comments.  \n  \nI think being very generous to the tool it maybe helped him 10-20%? The other 80-90% was the interviewee's knowledge. He had to understand the solution the AI tool presented in order to talk about it the way he did. Like I said before, I don't care that much about the code. If he could not talk through the problem and the solution that is where I make the decision.  \n  \nI would recommend knowing your stuff like this guy did rather than relying on a tool like this.",

If just looking directly at the requirement, it seems like the minimum parameters would be the item number and location to be delivered to. It does make sense to also parameterize the \"1 hour\" part assuming folks using the API would be interested in other time frames, too.\n\nI think I prefer /centers as the end-point, since presumably a list of that resource is the return value, and the rest as query parameters treated as filters. They could even be nested as filters to make it explicit. Or they could have filter added to the query parameter name.\n\nI would not do it as 2 queries without knowing more requirements that would justify an API like that. You'd want an API like that for various reasons. But without any reasons, you may as well just make the API as friendly to the user calling it as possible. 1 call is certainly more friendly than 2. It's also almost always more performant, though I wouldn't worry about performance without a specific reason to.\n\nSince it's your API, you can of course require the user to pass the item ID in. Since the requirement is so open-ended, I would just assume the user has an item ID, unless there's some reason to think they don't. If you don't have an item ID I'd change the end-point to /items and add a search query parameter.",

The requirement you posted does not say \"query item availability from a specific center\" so the two step process means you would have to individually query every nearby center.\n\nAlso, you're querying item availability, not centers, so I don't know if using `centers` as the main resource is a good idea.\n\nAnd assuming this is a REST API, it's generally not a good idea to have two resources following each other like `centers/inventories` (you would expect to first specify a `centerId` like `centers/{centerId}/inventories`).\n\nSo we don't want repeated resources and we don't want to query by individual centers. Where does that leave us?\n\nMaybe \n    `GET items/{itemId}/availabilities?deliverTo={}&maxTime={}`\n?\n\nThe `Availability` entity could include things like Time, Center, etc.\n\n> do you think it is okay if we require the user to provide IDs of the entity they are seeking as query parameters?\n\nYes it's expected that they would know the id of the item that they need more information about",

And if I do, do I install for example vs code inside it so I can build the program?\n\n>Q2. lubuntu is just one distro of linux and any serious distro aimed at users will be valid to use. All it needs is make, cc and nasm to build.\n\nGotcha! Ok I assumed if I don’t use what OS they use in the tutorial, that I’ll hit tons of roadblocks since my OS is diff from the tutorials code and directions  right?! Or are you saying whatever they do in their tutorial, as long as it’s a Linux distribution?",

Is one more likely to be successful than the other?\n\n>A2. It says to use \"your favourite Linux system\". If Lubuntu 18.04 is not your favorite, use something else. A modern Ubuntu version is a good choice since the instructions are written with Ubuntu in mind.\n\nBut they say they use Lubuntu and I thought compilers are OS/Hardware specific, so by nature, if he is writing it on Lubuntu, doesn’t that mean everything he writes is built specifically for Lubuntu and won’t work even if I use another Linux distribution?\n\n>I would suggest not trying to do this directly on macOS until you've done it on Linux (even if emulated on macOS). ",

I mostly agree with you but having been in the industry a bit longer, maybe I can offer some perspective.\n\n\n- \"more than a year\" is not that long, especially to see the fruits of your hard work learning the trade. I think it's pretty normal for it to be overwhelming in the beginning, too.\n\n\n- don't stop learning new technologies just because there are new ones coming out every other week. The opportunity cost of switching technologies is pretty high for a company (depending on how deeply integrated it is) so chances are in your career you will sometimes work on stuff that is not bleeding-edge, and having learned a varied set of tools is likely to be if use eventually. Not to mention you will start seeing patterns at some point, which will make you grow as a dev\n\n\n- AI: sure this is transforming the profession in many ways, but try not to over-rely on it as a junior. Some things have to be learnt the hard way. Never keep going if you don't understand what you're doing. It's fine if it's AI or not your idea, but take the time to understand it first. Challenge it if you can. Also yes, many investors and execs would love to completely replace developers with AI, and this is making the market more difficult for junior developers. But if we want seniors tomorrow we need to train juniors today. I mean not everybody agrees with this but it is an argument worth making in my opinion (in interviews, etc)\n\n\nAnyway I hope this helps. This is just my two cents, I'm sure others will have other ideas",

Writing software is easy, once you figure out what you want to make, you can bang it out pretty fast. LLMs make this part even faster, which can be nice, especially when I have writer's block.\n\nBut.\n\nI have to go back and read through everything it wrote, make sure it works properly, make sure it caught all the weird edge cases specific to our codebase, make sure it matches our coding style, make sure it's going to be reliable, make sure it didn't hallucinate. I usually end up having to rewrite a decent amount of the LLM generated code.\n\nThis sucks because reading software and auditing it is much harder and more intellectually draining than writing it.\n\nFiguring out what you need to write is the bulk of your job, understanding the specs, understanding the context of your changes within your codebase. Making sure all the weird edge cases you know are handled. Writing docs. Coordinating with other folks on the team.\n\nTo get good at that, you need practice, and you need to write stuff yourself, and you need to see it fail yourself. I don't think it's going to actually replace me or you any time soon. I could be wrong, I wouldn't mind retiring early lol. So far, it's been years of threatening to take my job, but no real progress towards that goal.\n\nThe job market is tough right now and companies are blaming AI for layoffs they would have carried out regardless. Tough hiring market at the same time as AI does not mean one caused the other. And so far the companies that actually did lay people off to replace them with AI have ... re-hired everyone a few weeks later.",

Most are just a promise that someone has touched upon basic data structures, algorithms, database concepts, and programming in one or two languages.\n\nIt doesn’t guarantee they write good code, maintainable code, performant code, or code that even meets requirements. It doesn’t guarantee they can design a database schema or design a system, or even that they understand what a message broker and event streaming platforms are, much less how they fit into a system.\n\nIt’s always been like this, though, and AI hasn’t really changed anything about that dynamic. Sure, I can design a spec and pop it in the magic Copilot machine and get code that’s close to correct, but I still have to spend time paying attention to what it’s doing and checking its output, while with most junior engineers I can reasonably expect after the first couple months of their career that they didn’t just hand me a pile of dog shit that appears to do what the requirements are asking, but actually falls apart the second I run or test it.\n\nFor now, it’s just a shit economy, and hiring is going as you’d expect it to in a shit economy. In addition to that, software engineering is no longer the golden ticket everyone acted like it was in the 2010s to the early 2020s. More people have been trying to enter that career, and demand has not kept up.\n\nCombine this with a shit economy and it’s no wonder most CS grads are doing anything but software right now.",

A few of them were obvious showstoppers which meant they hadn’t touched the code at all for five of those “day for day slip!” weeks. It was schedule drama to cover their own issues. \n\nThey did this nine times in a row before they found one bug I hadn’t already fixed and created a tagged release for. Every one before that was known bug, upgrade to 2.0.4 or later to get the fix. I think we ended up with a 1:11 ratio. By then the API was fixed and the test coverage was high so it was mostly performance or security fixes. \n\nEventually everyone in my division caught on to what a clown car they were. Lots of eye contact and eye rolling during project status conference calls",

Use chatgpt to help you write a base one and then use it some more to tailor your resume and cover letter to the specific opening. They likely are using AI tools to scan your resume so fight AI with AI.\n\n-Apply for hybrid positions. There's too much competition for remote jobs. You are competing with the whole country and possibly the world. \n\n-Use your network. Ask literally anyone you know. You never know who has a connection. The guitarist in my band works as an accountant for a financial accounting company who develops all their software in house. He ended up being my referral and I would never have known about this company otherwise. And he obviously isn't a developer or technical at all.\n\n-Be confident in your interviews. Let your personality come out. You don't need to know all the answers but you can always draw on past experiences to at least relate to \n\n-I didn't do any leetcode (or any coding at all) and was mostly asked about my skills, history, projects, and experience. Idk if I got lucky or because it was a senior position or what. But anyway make sure you can tell your story and sell yourself. \n\n-Don't forget the interview goes both ways. Think of some questions to ask about the team or the company and flip the script on them. Make them sell to you. It's an old sales tactic. At the very least you'll have more information on where you are potentially going to work and if it's really the opportunity you want. A good interview should feel more like a conversation than a grilling. I walked away from a couple of companies just because I didn't like how they were conducting things (showing up late, acting kinda adversarial, etc). Anyway it's your interview too.\n\nIdk. Your mileage may vary, but I didn't have a problem finding a job. I didn't really see what everyone was saying with the bad market out there and everything. I never would have known the market was supposed to be bad if I haven't been on the Internet. I ended up beating recruiters away with sticks toward the end of it.\n\nGood luck!",

I actually see it as something of a badge of honor and a sign that you’re a good person (I know I’m patting myself on the back by saying that). Many get trapped in a filter bubble and think everyone loves tech and they’re doing something special for the world. It’s almost kind of cult like. People who become skeptical of tech usually have broader social circles I’ve noticed. Many of my friends have burned out from tech in the past few years and had to discover themselves. Even those still working in tech seem broadly indifferent \n\nI’d recommend getting a job at a medium sized company making a very practical product. Basically something you can explain to a non technical stranger with a quick sentence. “I make an app for selling movie tickets” or something. It tends to feel a lot less tech-y than “I work at the latest AI startup making cloud infra for machine learning” or whatever buzzwords",

At medium to larger size orgs there tends to be a split after senior where you decide to either continue advancing as an IC (with titles like staff, principal, architect) or go into management (with titles like manager, director, senior director, VP, CTO). As a result staff or principal engineer wouldn't be considered management. As these titles are in the IC track.   \n  \nThis can be important because if you say you want to be an architect or staff title but are talking about management you may be sending mixed messages to gatekeepers. I was surprised about your post title and then the contents of your post weren't about jobs that are commonly thought of as being management. They may think you don't know what you want. Or worse they may think you aren't experienced enough to know the difference and set your application to the side.\n\n\\> my manager keeps saying i'm \"operating at the next level\" but when i apply for staff or principal engineer roles, either internally or externally, i hit a wall.\n\nYou will have to be honest with yourself here as we can't evaluate you. But if you are struggling in the behavioral and system design rounds it doesn't sound like you are there. You shouldn't be struggling at all in a behavioral at any of the titles you've expressed. Those titles have a lot of coordination with other stakeholders and you should be able to breeze through them for those titles. Likewise system design is also a fundamental task for those titles. If you are struggling then that may mean you haven't worked on complex enough tasks for them to feel comfortable hiring you with that title. Yes interviewing is a different skill, but it's just as important for getting the job. Yes sometimes the interview is harder than the actual job.\n\nIf you have skip level meetings I'd highly encourage you to talk to your manager's manager about getting specific with what \"strategic thinking\", \"broader impact\" and \"working on communication\" means to them. Strategic thinking to me would be forward thinking about the feature not just how it's used right now but how will it be used in the future, should it be architected a little differently so we can get future wins for free. You may already be doing this, and what you really need to work on is how people perceive you. If you aren't explaining your thought process to your boss then he may not realize that you are doing \"strategic thinking\". You should be doing this in 1 on 1s.   \n  \nSometimes using the phrases they care about can work too. I know it sounds dumb but when they are filling out a review and you've been consistently talking about strategy for a project to make sure it has impact can go a long way. Broader impact tends to mean impacting multiple departments. If you are already doing that it might be code for you getting more visibility within those departments when you work in projects that impact them. That could be scheduling meetings to ensure the technical requirements will fulfill their needs. Yes product is usually involved here, but product isn't technical and may not make optimal choices.\n\nIt should also be noted in some companies they have to have a business need for the title you want to be promoted into. You simply operating at that level isn't enough justification.\n\nLastly, the market is utter garbage right now. You are competing against a lot of other people. Some of those people have been laid off from major companies. You really need to stand out.",

It may help the conversations to be less “vague”. Frankly, if your manager is unwilling to read the book, or any book on the topic, it’s very unlikely you will find an internal staff+ position.

Hell, I was.\n\nBut remember, graduating with a CS degree equips you with a tool belt that goes much further than just being able to write some JavaScript. Unfortunately we can’t all be on here posting about how our big name company is giving us 225k a year or whatever. BUT! You are definitely still employable.\n\nTo my new grads out here losing hope: the outlook may be discouraging but the tough people outlast tough times. There is a lot of crazy stuff happening in the world right now that unfortunately does affect the current parameters of your situation, but these are temporary circumstances. Remember, your degree is literally based on problem solving.\n\nMy last suggestion is to open your horizons a bit, which I’m sure you’ve done already. There are a lot of companies that aren’t specifically the “big names” we see here, but are big names in their own industry. This is also how you find some neat niches to grow your specialities in. Right now, you should be open to anything. You just want your foot in the door— any door. Except for doors with red flags. Always run from those. GIS is a really cool industry that never gets talked about on the main stage. Do with that information what you will.\n\nNEVER GIVE UP!",

Ended up working multiple 80 hour weeks due to management being bad so I decided to return to school to get a CS degree. The thought was if I'm already working crazy hours, I might as well get paid more. Then my old utility field started blowing up due to electrification of everything and I received multiple offers on linkedIn for 40-50% pay bumps (after a 2 year stint not working while going back to school). Left my CS program with about a year left due to class timings and now I have a great work life balance, much higher pay, fully remote and I can use the programming skills I developed to automate a lot of my current work load. Ended up working out well for me. \n\nFor those that are curious, the utility industry is a good place to be right now. Whether that's Civil/Electrical/Mechanical or even some CS cyber security degrees. You likely won't get the 250k+ pay packages or stock options, but 100-150k for 3-4 years of experience in the right positions is not unheard of.",

Downturns just are more in your face about it. \n- Nothing is permanent. Have a great job? Cool. Enjoy it. It can go away tomorrow. Unemployed? I am so sorry. It sucks. Just keep working on your skills and applying to everything. \n- Luck is a major factor in literally everything. You could be the best specialist in your field and can't find work. You could not tie your shoes and make $500k a year. Just focus on what is with in your control and not how the dice lands when you roll it. \n\nI suppose the other thing is be careful with online reading. Specially this sub.

The problem was that the intended way of using a library scaffolding tool was to properly design a schema, but nobody did that and instead used a escape hatch feature of the scaffolding tool to blindly autogenerate a naive API, and the implementation caused all sorts of problems for the \\~300 services that used these bad libraries. And to make things worse, this was a \"cancerous\" type of technical debt, aka the number of bad libraries kept growing over time because people kept using the scaffolding tool the wrong way to create more and more bad libraries.\n\nFixing it was a colossal effort, involving a lot of automation to do the migration heavy lifting and also a lot of manual code changes and manual testing, impacting a ton of teams. It took more than 2 years to clean up the mess.",

The second thing, was exposure to SWE systems ideas, networking, distributed systems, compilers, embedded systems: just he distributed systems knowledge alone has made a huge difference.\n\nThat said, if I spent the same amount of time (more than 2000 hours) doing projects? I probably would have learned more. The only issue with that, is that the courses push you further than what you might do on your own. For instance, I'm still learning CS, ML, and math concepts, I'm just not spending 20 hours a week on it.\n\nOne additional point: I already was a PhD dropout when I got my MS CS, so I had research exposure, knew how to make arguments with data, and didn't really need help with research or academic skills, it was really the content that helped the most.",

Hypothetically, If you join and stock price rebounds to 1 year ago price, then it is 60+% upside. In that case, your RSU may be worth 40k per year instead of 25k.

There’s also a personal element to it - is the new position going to have you doing new stuff? Why did you interview in the first place? \n\nHere’s my story navigating this in the last year:\n\nPersonally, I successfully did a counter offer with my firm (very large). I had to show my offer letter to confirm the number and had to basically do a review to ‘justify’ it, but not only am I still here, I even switched teams with no issues internally. \n\nThe external offer I received came from a position I was reached out to about on LinkedIn, and I took the interview as practice to make sure I’m on top of my interviewing skills and be on top of any subjects or topics relevant. It was NOT to leave. \n\nHowever, the offer I did end up getting was too good to pass up, and I would have been an idiot to pass on it. I was open about this to my manager - I didn’t want to leave, but I’d be an idiot to say no - and they wanted to keep me enough that they worked with me to get a counter. The counter almost completely matched it, and I’m having a good time where I’m at.\n\nI don’t know if I’m the exception, but hopefully that helps. Honesty paid off here the most for me personally, but just remember that no matter what, you’re taking a risk if you accept the counter offer. I’d be prepared for anything.",

        "body": "Most AI performance measurements are not credible, and growth in that sector is not sustainable because of the costs of the underlying infrastructure. Neural networks don't scale very well, and the explosion in their usage from 2010 onwards was basically only enabled by improvements to GPU hardware.\n\n\nThose improvements have plateau'd, both due to shortages of silicon, and due to how little headroom there is to make hardware breakthroughs at the moment. We've basically hit the point of diminishing returns for the everyday consumer and for business use of LLMs and GPT systems.\n\n\nWith that in mind, I can't predict the future, but for the time being, LLMs and GPT systems are *a convenient excuse* for the layoffs required in the post-COVID recession conditions. Businesses don't like to scare their shareholders and stakeholders by saying \"the market sucks and we shrunk\", so they spin it as \"we adopted AI, so the 40% reduction in forces is actually 40% efficiency!!!\" LLMs and GPT systems also took off right when crypto startups needed an exit plan and a way to unload *thousands* of GPUs.\n\n\nSo you'll need to prepare to job-hunt in a very large recession, and the AI / ML sector is currently experiencing a hype bubble. Obviously, some of that hype is totally valid -- they are fantastic at classification problems that don't have formalized training sets. But, a lot of the hype is business people and end users not quite understanding the shell game going on. And there's plenty of grifting because people think they'll be able to sell their \"bottle imp\" before it's too late. LLMs and GPT systems will remain, and they're *really* cool. But not $10B+/year cool, and in 10 years it's **astounding that they are no closer to AGI than when they began promising it \"next year\"**.\n\n\nAs a new grad, you'll need to keep yourself sharp until you get your first role in the industry. And when you do, **have a backup plan because juniors are the first staff to be laid off when money gets tight**. Don't be too proud to find part-time jobs to pay the bills for the year or two finding CS jobs can take in a competitive market.",

There really hasn't been anything new in the software world (outside of Gen AI) in quite a while, and what has been done before is quickly becoming so saturated, that there's not a whole lot of reason to make more of it. Software has eaten the world, but it turns out the world was not as big of a meal as what was once thought.\n\nFor example, you see posts like \"wow Gemini 3 can make a threejs game!\" or \"look at this fancy UI GPT-5 made!\" and they are for sure impressive if you are completely unaware of how commonplace it is for people to make stuff like that since well before generative AI took off.\n\nLook at [Deepmind's game examples](https://www.youtube.com/@googledeepmind/playables) on Youtube, you have:\n\n1. A very basic dungeon crawler in threejs\n2. A starfox-like\n3. A subway surfer clone with a pirate theme\n4. Astroids\n5. A space invaders clone\n\nAll of which are impressive if you've never made them and have no clue how to, but none of which are new or innovative. People have no new ideas and AI is exacerbating that issue because if it has been done before, eventually an AI can be trained on the output and imitate it.",

All they can do is mash together bits and pieces of what they've seen humans doing.  \"Auto-complete on steroids\" is very accurate.\n\nFwiw, I'm a self-taught developer of about 30 years, with popular open source projects, some CS education, and lots of professional systems experience.\n\nAny \"AI Benchmarks\" should be taken with a huge grain of salt.

If a product doesn’t do well but the engineering team did a good job, they will likely be fine, but the pm likely gets fired.  On the other side if a product gets crazy successful, the PM is probably going to advance faster.",

There’s limited real desire and opportunity to get to those levels.\n\nTo be a “true” senior you need to be leading the team and product in all technical aspects, training others, and being “the man” on the team. That requires a lot of dedication, and frankly, down right hours on the keys at the desk that most people aren’t willing to put in.\n\nMost teams will end up with their senior engineers being the longest tenured engineer on the team or someone rotated over from another team who was either a rising “true” senior engineer or more likely: just one of the longer tenured engineers who is backfilling another person’s position. Most engineers with a senior title are mid level engineers who haven’t left.\n\nTo be a “true” staff engineer, you’re doing everything a senior did, but expand that across team’s through your entire department. Now take the hours you invested in your original team to be a senior, and multiply it by number of teams (roughly). That’s way too many hours for most people to want to invest to reach this level. Even after you make it to this level, your desire to stay here might wain and while your titled a staff engineer because you were performing at that role, a few years later you’re essentially a senior again because you don’t want to keep investing the hours.\n\nI quoted “real” everywhere because titles mean different things at different companies and the lower the max TC a  company offers: typically the lower the bar is for a higher title. So I wanted the focus to be on what the general-ish expectation is at each level.",

It is the most widely known MSCS program, because of its great price and typical program ranking. Many recruiters are aware of the lax acceptance rates (reported to be +80%) and that it is essentially a degree mill. There are many folks with near limited CS experience who have taken a couple of cc courses and enrolled within the program with hopes of breaking into the industry, slapping on the school name onto their resumes.\n\nIt is certainly cheap enough for a try, especially when the closest alternative is an overpriced bootcamp. How many GATech MSCS resumes (online part omitted of course) do you think recruiters see nowadays? There are plenty of people straight up spamming applications with GATech MSCS on their resume without even having taken a single course yet.",

You're not them, you can make the sacrifice that others wish they could make.\n\nAlternatively, you can also consider fields outside of CS, like a civil engineering master's, electrical engineering, computational biology, chemical engineering, or even law school to pursue tech patent law (most patent lawyers studied stem, not pre law), etc etc.  tons of fields.

Most graduates who can actually build something from my school do not have issues landing jobs. Is it their dream job out of college? Most likely not, but most start out between $63K and $90K. Not horrible at all compared to most other majors. But again, this is an anecdote.

Regularly consult with people about their strategies and use your school's services. This should get you pretty far.\n\nIf your preferred field is something like SWE, really hone in on programming through building up projects and software, even if it's by starting off with cloning things. You can even start learning right now. Do a little bit every day beyond what your curriculum is teaching, even if it's like 30m to an hour. Try to get internships as early as your first year (even if you don't know anything). It's okay if you don't get any or fail interviews, because that in itself is valuable experience. You can learn what to do and how to rework your processes.\n\nAs long as you're making moves beyond the curriculum, you should be pretty set. Be realistic about what's needed to get into your desired field, and go full throttle. Don't be afraid to think outside the box.",

Sometimes be careful what you wish for. I worked 50-60 hours weekly for a few years and still felt like it wasnt enough. \n\nIm not saying this will be your experience, but again you are running the risk that you may end up in a really toxic team as opposed to a team where you know the work and have some repoitoire with the team. If you are going to risk it, do it for a job that will pay you life changing money in a way. 10% for me isnt life changing especially in this career. \n\nPut it like this, if you make 80k a year 88k isnt that much of a difference. If you make 150k a year, 165k isnt that much of a difference. It's extra money to play with or invest but again, is it enough for you to risk maybe the next few years being hectic and stressful?

If you believe you are experiencing WLB (Keep it to yourself and please do not broadcast your great manager to bad managers) and treat it as just a temporary hallucination that you are experiencing that will fade away soon to those not in the know.\n\nNow with that in mind there are some really great managers in the company that actually do try, keyword being try to establish a real work life balance within reason.  Unless this is being pushed from the L8 and L10 levels it will be very hard to sustain long term by an L7 as they all eventually fold under the executive pressure cooker as they try to make it to L8 themselves.  Only then can they and do they have real power to enforce WLB in their org.\n\nFor yourself you will need to set hard boundaries and never become a yes person for too long or you will be crushed due to taking on more work than you can actually do.  I've seen it happen so many times with the courageous happy faced yes people, then 3-6 months in they are burnt out and depressed because they are way overdue on their projects that they agreed to do and management is holding them hard accountable for it due to work being in motion.  \n\nYou let things slip then you get dinged for bias for action, ownership, and deliver results which massively dings your ratings (max HV1, maybe LE) then if it happens again in the next quarter you are put in focus, pivot, and then your done for.\n\nSo if you want to flip the coin, do it for the work experience.

Staff and above focus more on why.\n\nAs a staff, it's my job to become deeply intimate and opinionated with the product or platform I am paid to improve, as well my company's technical roadmap. From there, I need to form solid business cases as to what technical work is most important for my team, defend those with SLT or C-suite leadership, and then set up my seniors for success in the execution of that roadmap.\n\nAs a senior, it's your job to become deeply intimate and opinionated on the problem that's put in front of you, likely a project from your staff dev or manager. The business case is already made at that point, and your staff dev has likely proven the case with a poc of some sort, so you need to lead the execution of the solution. \n\nBecome an expert in leading solutions E2E as a senior.

They kept telling me on a very superficial basis what is to be done but no one actually helped solve the problem. I tried my best, doing all nighters but I couldn't do it.\nIt broke me, the part after it is worse so please just beg and ask anyone you can for help. Show desperation.

There is lost time people could be doing real work. Online assessments cost money. They have no real reason to give anyone benefit of the doubt, especially when they have tons of candidates. \n\nYou have to remember there is an imperfect human being on the other end. They might be doing a ton of work, being harassed by recruiters to give candidate feedback. They could be pissed off and just decide people are rejections for petty reasons. Or they might have spent time and made a subjective decision. \n\nBest thing to do is forget about it and move on. ",

        "body": "Yeah, I usually see them as MLOps Engineer or Data Science Engineer, though they can also be listed under more generic AI/ML Engineer, or even occasionally as Data Scientist, depending on the organization. But there's absolutely a career to be made in the space.\n\nCandidly, I find that ML Engineering as we're discussing it isn't really an entry level role, but more something that a software/data engineer or data scientist will lateral into if they have an affinity for it. While as an ops/deployment person you won't need to have the same familiarity with the statistics/math as the data scientists and researchers putting together the initial proofs-of-concept and models, you're going to need enough familiarity to be able to sense check things, collaborate effectively with the research side, and, from time to time, optimize the approach without negatively impacting the model capabilities.\n\nKey skills include traditional software dev, including the usual system design, engineering, testing, etc., with a few other things. For embedded, there's additional nuances around programming on custom boards, signal processing/cleaning, and to some extent hardware tinkering, and for cloud/forecasting stuff, parallelization and distributed computing comes up with some frequency. Some of the more relevant challenges I see day-to-day are around model instrumentation/tracking metrics, managing cloud costs, runtime, and wrangling tech debt that inevitably spawns as the model pipelines keep changing.\n\nI'd personally want to take a software engineer with a few years of experience working in the cloud, or someone who's done some lightweight embedded stuff, and get them up to speed on the ML-relevant side. I could probably take a data scientist and do it, but I've found that most professionals that grow up on that side have pretty terrible programming skills. It's easier to beat data quality and validation into an engineer's head than to get someone up to speed on formal engineering, I find. Though if our nascent ML Engineer is bad at math and logic, their career in ML will probably be pretty short lived.\n\nEdit: For LLMs, I think that there isn't much reason (apart from political organizational reasons) to have ML/DS teams responsible for applied LLM implementations and deployments. You'd think that people who should notionally be familiar with the math would be more clear-eyed on what these models can and can't do, but that doesn't seem to be the case--so in my mind, there isnt't a reason to bother having a data scientist involved in the implementation from a technical standpoint. Any decent engineer should be able to integrate an LLM into the broader system with some thoughtful design and extensive testing.",

What helped me was having a couple of technical internships and some hands-on experience I’d been building since high school. It wasn’t anything crazy, just enough to show real interest and that I could learn the technical side.\n\nYou don’t need to be a heavy coder for roles like data analytics, business analytics, or pre-sales. What matters more is being comfortable with the tools, understanding the concepts, and having a few solid projects that prove you can actually do the work.\n\nThe market is rough right now, so having something structured behind your transition can make a difference. I’m doing a master’s in a tech field for that reason. It’s not required, but it helps add credibility when you’re coming from a non-technical major.\n\nSelf-learning absolutely isn’t a waste of time. Just make sure you pair it with projects, certs, or anything that makes your skills clear to hiring managers.",

I make good money working on a silly little CRUD app. I would love it if my company took it further and developed some sort of vision - but we have users, we are profitable and I can pay my bills.

If I were to do a personal project, I would build something that I want to build that addresses something I care about - and if other people found it interesting and used it, great, but I would 100% ignore any requests to build stuff that I don't care about, or are too difficult, etc.\n\nThat's what a lot of personal projects are like, and the problem is that most jobs just do not work that way - you don't get to choose the path of most fun and least resistance. \n\nNow, mind you - those personal projects are still good in their own way because they allow you to showcase your more pure technical skill. But from an overall \"how will this person do at this job\", they miss a big chunk of it.\n\nWhen I see someone who built something that was clearly based on a user request with real-world, annoying ass constraints? That's when I'm really interested. \n\nI think an app built for doctors kinda fits that, because that's not a group that is going to use something for unimportant stuff. So if you're going to get users, you're going to have to be able to handle annoying shit that most people don't want to deal with (e.g., HIPPA compliance).",

I'll paste what i told someone else in the comments. \n\nMy wife is an oncologist at a large hospital, and I'm always surprised to hear how inefficient so many things are. This started as something she asked me to do for her, and it just kept going until it became obvious that doctors in many specialties would love to have access to it. In fact, at her former hospital, there were employees whose sole job was to manually do what this app does for all patients in the specialty. So one full-time worker per 10 doctors or so. \n\nSo, I have around 15 users at the moment all in  one speciality, in one hospital. I'm expanding on 4 other hospitals at the moment because of my wife's connections and friends etc. They will also be in oncology.

Learn Python and Postman at least. I think those will be useful for the foreseeable future. Knowing Java and Jmeter, at least last time I checked, was *really good* in some niche situations if you needed to validate data being put into a SQL database. Like, one of the best tools I've ever found for specifically that, which is weird since it's nominally a load testing tool. It's was also surprisingly easy to write your own plugins. That was a few years ago now, though, so I don't know if anything better has come along in the mean time.\n\n\nKnowing a bit about how http/networking works behind the scenes is also a good idea if you do any appreciable rest or network testing. If you're going to be working with that sort of thing at all you really don't want it to be just a magic black box to you. I don't see networking going anywhere either, since the cloud is a thing. I interviewed a guy for QA one time and while I was talking to him I realized that he had a fantastic amount of knowledge about networking and network protocols. I suggested hiring him based on that and told him later that he was underselling himself on his resume because no one else I'd ever interviewed had ever demonstrated the level of networking know-how that we were just casually chatting about.",
