We thought SQLMesh might be that thing, but now I'm leaning towards something like [Kedro+Ibis](https://kedro.org/blog/building-scalable-data-pipelines-with-kedro-and-ibis)\\+[BSL](https://juhache.substack.com/p/the-boring-semantic-layer), and/or higher level abstraction that can be AI-native, with built-in best practices.\n\nI'm confident in the future of open source data transformations because of two things:\n\n1. **Existing users are fine.** If and when Fivetran tries to monetize dbt to the detriment of its users, the community will almost certainly **fork** dbt-core to maintain its openness (gratis+libre) for the longterm. However, the investments from the dbtLabs folks will almost certainly slow down or stop. Which means dbt may be staleware in a few years.\n2. **Necessity is the mother of invention.** The acquisition alone is reason to inspire others to build higher-level abstractions that don't inherit dbt's innate weaknesses. *(Does anyone really think dbt+Jinja was the ideal solution?)* The next generation of transformation solutions should accomplish more with less code, and with semantic metadata baked in.\n\nI've built three dbt clones in my career, two of which were *before* dbt itself launched, and one of which was successfully [patented](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10846284B1/en) during my time at Amazon AWS. I am eternally thankful to dbt because it was the first CI/CD-friendly transformation tool to reach critical market share. The dbt team proved to the world that \"transformations as code\" is viable and that data pipelines are not incompatible with SDLC best practices.\n\nThe future has been changed for the better because dbt exists, but dbt is neither the only solution nor the best solution for the problems data engineers face today and tomorrow.\n\nThere will be more and better solutions on the horizon. üòé",

If the setup delivers value (aka if we shut it down how desperate are the people) it opens up more budget. As someone said here, saying no becomes essential. Or better ask why they need this data, what actions are they planning to derive from it. Ask them if the metric they ask for is dropping by 20% what are they planning to do.

AWS really dropped the ball in this regard, at least when I first evaluated their Redshift driver\n\n  \nEDIT: Oh, I see it's still binding to the ODBC driver. Well, it's still nice that it appears to be distributed with mssql-python so becomes an implementation detail rather than something the user has to explicitly set up",

The good days by far offset the bad ones, and I‚Äôll realize that there are plenty of essential skills and experience that I bring to the table that typical CS profiles bring less of: e.g. engineers tend to ‚Äòtunnel‚Äô into technical problem solving and often struggle to zoom out and grasp the broader domain context. I have experience in multiple business process domains and in financial management, which in turn drives (executive) decision making. If you don‚Äôt grasp that, you can design fantastic technical solutions, but won‚Äôt ever get top down support to fund and execute against them.\n\nSo, we can all learn from each other and together we create success. In my spare time I dig into my team‚Äôs code and do engineering training/certifications to learn more about that space and better lead my teams by asking better questions. \n\nI cannot judge whether you‚Äôre too far out of your depth in your current role, or whether you‚Äôre simply suffering the discomfort that actually indicates that you‚Äôre in the ‚Äòlearning zone‚Äô.

You'll learn by shipping stuff.\n1b - Yes learn DBT\n1c - Don't think about it just ship.\n\n2a - Get a solid, easy to expand ETL/ELT service going. Adding more data to your DW should be *easy*. When non-data people come to you with \"oh I wanted to see X data that's not on the DW\", you should be like \"oh I'll get it there for you\" and within a few bizdays it's there. Have an ELT/ETL layer that's simple and easy to expand, and this sort of interaction will happen.\n\n2b - You should be chilling in your spare time, you'll learn all you need by working on building the stuff that's just beyond what you can comfortably deliver right now. Progressive overload. Don't settle, but don't try to reach for the moon right away. Build yourself a ladder first.\n\n2c - Just build stuff, and when the subject come up you say you're learning data engineering on the fly, out of necessity.\n\n\nIf you're doing any sort of data-related study in your spare time, I recommend the more theoretical, foundational stuff. Kimball's data modelling, Klepmann's Data Intensive Applications, SICP. This sort of mind-expanding work that makes you stop thinking about code (trees) and start thinking about systems, data transport, semantics, read/write patterns (the forest).",

If you don't consider how you want to manage Infrastructure in this new world you get to great my advice would be look at a reference architecture for a lake house on AWS. Ask your company to send you to re:Invent in December take hands onlabs for building data lakes (avoid any sales sessions just do hands on labs) you will come out with a better idea of what to do. Also take a BASIC terraform course. It will make everything better. It will be confusing at first but ChatGPT/Claude will get you most of the way there. AWS + Python gives you A LOT of options. IMO DBT is kinda shitty. SQL ETL's are ass, because you cannot really unit test these things effectively. Focus more on python (it will get you 90% of what you need for most use cases) look at serverless event driven architectures, less work less thinking long term but you need to monitor that shit and make sure the SPICE FLOWS! Postgres is fine. Your use cases determine your data persistence. If you don't have a lot of data don't over complicate shit use and RDBMS + Python, geter done.\n2. look back at 1. I personally don't think much of DEs that focused on DBT or Databricks they usually don't know much....sorry to say that but it's the truth. I want coders. I want people who understand distributed systems. I don't care if people know Redshift of Snowflake as long as they understand what those systems are...MPPs. That's abstracted from most DEs. It means Sr folks have to learn ya some shit about an MPP like redshift and snowflake both great infra but they cost and abstract aspects of what's going on under the hood. They are not a golden hammer. Look at the use cases. Postgres on aurora can bang out A LOT of DE use cases. Don't buy a destroyer class ship to manage bass fishing :D\n\nb. pyspark is a good thing to pick up. Understand when you want a python script v a pyspark script to run a job. Understand shit like Airflow and how you split compute from your orchestration layer. Airflow is not an ETL it's orchestration. ELT work and computer is done on other infra like an AWS lambda. As you go further focus on microservices, apis, event driven architectures stuff like that. \n\nc. AWS tools are legit DE tools you just gotta look at the right shit. Get a cursory understanding  these AWS servies (timebox yourself to a few hours  total here) EventBridge, Kinesis, Manage Ariflow, managed kafka, lambdas, glue, redshift. aurora(postgresql). Athena.  You can solve pretty much all problems with these with out really managing much infra. I can count on one hand the number of times my serverless systems have died in production....AWS went down  each time :D.....that was a long one DM me I am an old hand. Happy to answer questions.\n\nPS avoid Pandas unless you are working on small scale stuff it's a fucking huge package with way more stuff than you need in most cases. That said it's super convenient to bang out small tasks on small contianers.",

Ideally, this should be an exact replica of production in order to address the exact challenge you raise.\n\nTo ensure that your code changes aren't breaking things, you should have some sort of data unit testing framework as well. The way I typically tackle this is to have a tiny, but representative, csv of data for each source table. Key tables (marts, facts, entities etc.) throughout my DAG also have csv files of expected outputs. When making code changes, run the sample source data through your pipeline and verify that the output table still matches the contents of your csv of expected results. Or that the updates you've made to your csv of expected results are indeed what emerges from your DAG.\n\nA big part of my dbt evangelism arises from the fact that implementing the above is quite handy when using dbt. But it's also doable regardless of your stack if you take the time to build the framework for it.",

In the modern data world partitioning should be approached with the following mindset: read patterns (increasing read performance by partition pruning), data distribution i.e. your partitioning should make sense in terms of how you organize the data in files AND partitions (avoiding small files and data skew, but also creating enough optimal sized files so you can parallelize reading), and considering your deployment/compute sizing so you can actually take advantage of the things you can do in parallel and scale accordingly (again has to do with how you organize your data in files). \nAlthough partitioning is a tool you can also use to ‚Äúgroup‚Äù and ‚Äúlabel‚Äù your data, like you mentioned, - e.g. being able to reprocess a subset of your data based on a label (processing time) - I would discourage you from using it like this. You have other tools for this purpose that will not hurt performance in the long run. Use partitioning as intended: a tool to distribute your data to ensure performant reads and scalability.\n\n2. If you don‚Äôt need an immutable bronze data use a lakehouse format straight away like Iceberg and do updates/merge. Optimize for copy-on-write or merge-on-read based on the volume of your late or dupe data. Do proper table maintenance for healthy filesizes and valuable snapshots. (This equals to SCD type 1 btw)\nIf you need the raw data, you can do CDC in an extra column or in a side table. Just like in a regular DWH. You trade downstream performance for history granularity. (This is SCD type 2+)\n\n\nNote: Iceberg/Delta/Hudi are gold because they bring SQL and data warehousing back to big data.\n\n3. Look at 1.\n\n\nFor idempotency you can also implement watermarking or something with the snapshoting/tagging/branching features of your lakehouse format. This ‚Äúmetadata‚Äù can carry the same information that you want to implement with the ‚Äúprocessing time‚Äù partitioning. These are all small things that can help you, but ultimately idempotency and deterministic behavior should be achieved on the data pipeline level with whatever tools you have. Don‚Äôt sculpt your data to make your life easier when coding data pipelines, shape it to make it friendly for the consumers.",

Event time is not immutable, meaning that any event time partition can have late arriving data. Are you suggesting that i reprocessing all the partition in every dbt run? I don't think that is practical.\n2. I have a CDC pipeline using debezium, how does using something like an iceberg sink connector solve the challenge? I don't think the iceberg sink connector supports upserts. Again you are suggesting that i partition the tables being written by the sink connector by event time? Isn't it more practical to read only new events in every run.¬†\nI appreciate the through answer from you, thank you.¬†",

        "body": "You need to build what's called a \"data pipeline\" for this. \n\nThe basic idea is that:\n\n* Transactional databases, like Postgres, and the table design for software backend databases are not optimized for analytical workloads.\n* If you intend to use that data in your dashboards, like you mentioned, you would have to do a lot of joins to denormalize the data.\n* Analytical usecases benefit heavily from denormalized data.\n* The idea is that you do the denormalization before the data gets to your BI tool, such as your existing Postgres database or an analytical database like BigQuery, Snowflake or whatnot, and create \"data models\".\n* These data models would effectively prepare the data to be consumed easily for analytical purposes, such as replacing foreign keys with actual names, calculating metrics beforehand, etc.\n* You can build these data models as database views, each defining the data model without persisting the data. From your BI tool's perspective this'll be as if there are denormalized tables, but when the tool queries these tables the view will be executed.\n   * This works if your data is small, but it gets harder to maintain, debug, and scale for larger datasets.\n* The more maintainable alternative here is to build a \"data pipeline\":\n   * The pipeline would get the raw data from the production systems, as well as any other external systems you need data from.\n   * Builds data models using SQL and Python and persists them into the database.\n   * Your BI tools then connects to the modeled tables instead.\n   * This allows the queries to be more efficient and faster, since the data is pre-calculated.\n   * This also makes analyzing this data easier in BI usecases.\n   * The added benefit of this is that if you want to use a different BI tool tomorrow, or if you need to use this data in some other way than a BI tool, such as jupyter notebooks and python scripts, then the data is also usable for that.\n\nThere are a bazillion different tools that allow you to build data pipelines. In your case, it could be as simple as starting with a few views on your Postgres database, and see how it works. Once you run into performance issues or any other trouble, you can consider persisting the data with a proper data pipeline.",

If you want a super simple solution that scales as your needs grow, and does not become overly complex, use declarative data flows. There are three options in the market today - (1) dynamic tables in snowflake, (2) delta live tables in databricks, and (3) tabsdata that also does ingestion.\n\nGiven that you are just starting out and may not be in one of the big data platforms, try tabsdata. Alternatively, try duckdb for creating a denormalized fact table but you will have to go back to creating a pipeline between your data source and duckdb.",

If you want to sell yourself as a consultant, make sure you have the experience to know what you're doing. Then all other questions (how to do it, how to scale, how much will it cost) solve themselves.\n\nIf you don't have the experience and you want to learn at the cost of the client, make sure to tell them upfront. Otherwise you're building something that won't fit their needs, and that won't be able to adapt to their future needs. Something like this wouldn't sell, even if it's free.\n\nI would recommend joining an established data team as an junior employee or consultant for 2 to 5 years, until you've mastered one niche in the field. You might need to pitch as a data analyst instead of a DE, because DE is typically not seen as a junior-level job.",

It has its own specific table storage optimizations such as distribution styles and sort keys. It is designed for data warehousing and BI.\n\nAthena is newer (2016), and solely a query engine (based on open-source Trino by default, or Spark), so you need to manage the data storage in another tool, such as S3.

Although it doesn't mean you can't use Athena for transformations, I just would not bet that it will be cheaper than Glue (serverless Spark) for production ETLs. The design of interactive query tools is usually made to be faster in exchange for more resources consumption, which may not be the best trade-off for production ETLs.\n\nRunning Spark on EMR may be a cheaper way to run distributed SQL transformations on AWS, but then you have to deal with EMR cluster management.",

A big advantage of this is structure, everything looks the same data is captured in a uniform way and simplifies your life a ton. Depending on your size this can start as simple parameters but may evolve into some kind of log class that you pass as a parameter. \n\nWord of warning stay away from template files.

Many companies go down the Kimball because it can be easier to process but delivers less long term value. When I create a DW, I use Inmon (in 3NF) for the core layer and Kimball (stars and other data products) for the semantic layer. The stage area I keep looking like the source systems. Inmon gives you more flexibility to add data products down the line and has a much better likelihood for them to be aligned with each other. All semantic data products should be created from the core layer and don't try any shortcuts. Shortcuts are a very good way for your users to lose trust in your DW.\n\nA word to the wise. In the near future, you are going to wonder (or be asked), \"Can I just join two stars through a dimension table? The answer is yes. It is called snowflaking but down that way lies trouble for lots of reasons.",

No way around it as it is the nature of the beast. I think you are dealing with a smaller amount of data (<1GB).  JSON format is also slow. You are running into an old, solved problem. ETL can be expensive. It is one of the main reasons that file based looks so attractive (but is actually data on beer goggles).\n\nLet me share a way that has dealt with this issue. First, and most important, how are you using the data? This is the key question and will be the reason for your upstream choices. This should be used to guide all your choices. See which final format fits your SLA and performance needs best. See how I am moving to objective and not subjective reasons?\n\nThe final form has to also consider flexibility, expandability and scalability. Have at least some good assumption on these so that you can use more information to make the case.\n\nBTW, ETL is just the homework you have to do in order to get the data into the final form. Until it is queried, data has no value. Zero. That seems obvious, but you would be amazed the number of people that don't understand this.\n\nIs your boss also the data architect? If he is, going against him may not be worth it. There are tradeoffs you will have to consider in your employment.\n\nYou are at a point where it sounds like you are on the edge of a pissing match and you aren't prepared.

That way you end up with more clarity on which column goes to what.  And optionally, you can prefix each column name with the role play if that works best for your reporting tool.

If you're okay with a short downtime then you could even just drop and recreate the Postgres table. You could probably just use CSV files so you maintain native support for the Postgres commands.\n\nThe memory consideration on the server is, IMHO, a bit ridiculous for data this small; sounds like a problem you'd have in like 2004. Just do whatever you need; seriously doubt there will be issues with memory unless the server is really underpowered.\n\nBTW, an `updated_at` column in the source is exactly how this situation is typically handled so then you can store a \"high water mark\" (last update datetime handled) so you know which new records to import when your job re-runs. That's a major problem if that field is invalid. If you can talk to whoever is managing the mysql db, tell them to stop updating every row, if possible, as that seems like a mistake or at least an anti-pattern.

The method of computation can be optimized, meaning a rewrite or rearchitecting is needed. This is when there's a fundamentally better way to create the data product, like using a different approach to solving the problem, or a different storage or processing engine.",

They said you get throttled, and then I walked them through a hypothetical which clearly showed that F64 is unlikely to work for us. We run 100s of workspace and cover multiple clients over multiple sectors globally.\n\nNot even 2 hours later, one of my clients who have moved over to Fabric (not sure of their capacity, but probably F64, since that is the flavour MS lead the pitch calls with), started having issues with dashboards and my analysts just sent me laughing emoji saying 'we where just talking about this...' and included a screen grab where you could see their dashboards where timing out because of capacity limits.\n\nAnyway, previously the enterprise option would have been great, and we would have gotten that, but that is a different story...\n\nFabric, personally, not sold on. At the point it becomes effective, you are dumping more than $100k a month on it.\n\nJust not worth it IMO.",

I inherited a Synapse environment, struggled with all the weirdness of it for a couple of years, and then found Microsoft changing directions (again) on their home grown data stack, to Fabric, without any real clear guidance or easy way of migrating.\n\nSo I didn't. I just setup my own stack using Azure's base resources(basic storage accounts, containerized and function apps, Azure SQL, data factory for orchestration) that were less likely to be discontinued every few years and then let the business choose what BI solution they wanted to move to.\n\nIt ended up cutting our costs to like 1/4th of what I had projected it to be at if we would have migrated to Fabric. At the time, there was no migration plan for users of older Synapse to Fabric and it was going to be a re-implementation for us anyways.\n\nWhile I wish Microsoft the best with Fabric, if it's anything like the product model they had for Synapse, it will be dead in like 5 years too. Synapse utilized many of Azure's base resources all linked together, but their development was forked and specialized to Synapse - so they're not 1:1 migrations. To further add problems to this, based on feature requests we made and escalated support tickets to engineering, the development of those forks were done by a small overseas team that basically had no bandwidth but bug fixes. Which is why the actual number of features implemented in Synapse past its first year were non-existent, and why everything was so quirky in it.",

You want to be conditioning your brain to long periods of mental focus on complex things - you're working out your brain just like a powerlifter goes to the gym to build muscle. Getting someone else to lift the weights for you - or getting AI to solve problems for you - actively works against what you're trying to do.\n\nAnyway, you absolutely can learn without AI and you'll learn faster and better without it (AI is good for tricking people into thinking they've learned something when they really haven't).

I played through all of [https://nandgame.com](https://nandgame.com) and that really helped since after you play through that you have built a computer from scratch. I also later found the game Turing Complete on Steam, playing through that would make you understand all the low-level things.

Courses in hardware description language, electronics and Assembly (and C/Assembly) and \"embedded\" as they call it probably good to really be able to reason about things.

Here's how you should think about it: **The snake is a queue**!\n\nEverytime it moves, a new position is added to one end of the queue (that is the head) and the last position in the queue is removed from the queue (that is the end of the tail). Except when eating something, the tail is not removed. So you don't change the position of the head, you \"add\" a new head in front of the snake, depending on the direction it is moving.\n\nUse an actual Queue data structure if you can - that makes everything easier. And if not, then at least abstract the queue for the snake-body, so you don't have to worry about the array-index of head and or tail when building the game.\n\nHope that helps - good luck with coding it now!",

Because sometimes you want a loop that iterates using a counter variable, and writing a FOR-loop makes it so much easier to write and read than using only IFs and GOTOs.\n\nOkay, so why do some languages also use while-loops in addition to for-loops?  Because sometimes the logic you want to implement is clearer as a for-loop with a counter and/or current element, and sometimes the logic is clearer as a loop that continues *while* a condition remains true.\n\nSome programming languages allow the use of an *until*\\-loop, a loop that keeps running *until* a condition is met.  An until-loop is functionally equivalent to a while-not-loop, so why is there a need for an until-loop?\n\nWell, it's not that there's a specific *need* for it, it's that sometimes the logic is clearer when you realize that a body of code needs to be repeated over and over *until* a specific condition is met -- or that the body needs to repeatedly execute with the goal of causing that condition to be true.",

It paid well even then, but there wasn't even the notion of, \"anybody could do it\". The assumption, quietly, is that you were born with it or something.\n\nThat wasn't true, but it was more true than we treat it today.\n\nAnybody can learn how to write software. It's not even really that hard. It takes time but it is only hard in the sense of \"learning a foreign language\" is hard, not in the sense of, \"winning gold at the olympics\" is hard. Put enough time in, and you'll get there.\n\nWhat some people are \\*born\\* with I think, is the kind of mind that finds this stuff compellingly interesting. Not everybody working on open source is doing it so they can put something on their CV. Most aren't. Most just enjoy solving the problem.\n\nIn 2025, I have now started to advise people that if this is not you, if you don't actually have this interest and are instead just looking for comfortable, well-paid employment, think carefully. This would have been a great move in 2005, and a pretty good one in 2015. In 2025, I think it's probably a mistake.\n\nI don't think it is the end of the profession, but the golden age, sadly is closing on us. Software is a lot of people's 'default bet' for something to do with their lives that might give them a comfortable existence when they don't know what else to do.

It was fun to think about how to solve the problem, what kinds of things I'd want the app to do, and then write it. We decided that we'd have a web interface for adding/deleting items, and then QR-codes embedded in the box labels so my wife could point her phone at a box and \"see\" the contents.\n\nMy daughter, a comp-sci sophomore at the local university, helped me code and debug it, which was also a really fun father/daughter experience. We're currently in the middle of adding the 40 or so boxes from our storage room to the inventory. When we're done, we'll be able to find stuff (Funny story, while opening boxes to add items to the app, we've discovered stuff we'd forgotten we had).\n\nI work in tech, but I am not a programmer.

C++ is an older language and probably provides a better understand of some concepts like memory management and resources. Java is typically used for more full stuck development positions, while C++ is generally used more for embedded systems. Do either one of them interest you more than the other? \n\nThings to consider:\n\n* Is it one or the other or will you be taking both eventually? If both take the C++ one first since the lower level concepts may be easier to learn before you've learned the higher level concepts. If you can only take one programming class ever, I think the concepts in Java are more important to modern programming. \n* Do you know anything about the teachers? All things equal I'd pick the class with the better teacher. A good teacher makes it more engaging to learn.  \n* If your a CS major or need to take later classes, which class will be more important to your next ones? If you need to take Java 101 and then Java 102 then opt for Java, but if you're going to be an EE and never take a programming class again then maybe C++ is the better choice. \n* Which one sounds more appealing to you?\n* Are you more interested in embedded systems and high perfomance computing (C++) or modern applications and web development (Java)? \n\nFor me personally, the concepts in C++ were useful to learn, but I've very rarely had to worry about things like memory management and performance in my jobs.",

Rarely can you get all three at once.\n\nObject-oriented programming and functional programming are approaches for managing system complexity. With OOP, you're defining components as \"objects\" with specific functionalities so that you have a system-wide vocabulary for what things do. Furthermore, by making things modular, you limit how much you have to fit in your head at any one time in order to change the system.\n\nWith functional programming, you're trying to isolate state to as few places as possible and keep all your functions throughout your system simple and deterministic, so when you're writing a function you have a finite number of ways that function can behave and it's simple to create, write, and test.\n\nI have met very few engineers who understand why OOP and FP are desirable. They just follow them dogmatically because they were taught them in college and don't know how to do things another way. Furthermore, they often do them wrong. They think simply using functions is FP or just defining boilerplate objects is OOP without actually writing coherent modules to reduce system complexity.\n\nIf you'd like a more robust discussion on this, my favorite book on the topic is \"A Philosophy of Software Design\" by John Ousterhout. Hope you found this comment helpful.",

Most people might answer just the question of being a software engineer and not address the technical artist part.\n\nThe question is what kind of programming does a technical artist need to do. You may or may not have good ideas of what that entails.\n\nIn general, it helps to have a college degree in CS or software engineering to be a software engineer. The credentials of getting a degree show, to an extent, that you have accomplished something challenging. Whether you're any good at the end is debatable. Some turn out great. Some can't recall much of what they learn. Even so, the paper (degree) is worth a lot.\n\nBut it costs money, takes time, and can be challenging, especially if you already have a career.\n\nSome go to bootcamps, but you need to do some research. They turn to go too fast for some and they are expensive, but not as much as colleges. These typically last 3-6 months and is basically full-time (like a 9-5 experience).\n\nYou can get a Master's degree in software engineering if you have an undergrad degree in something. Some masters degrees don't require any prior programming knowledge (some require a CS or equivalent degree, so you need to do research).\n\nAlso, you could try asking /r/cscareerquestions or perhaps some reddit closer to your experience.",

Consequently money was flowing in an unnaturally free and cheap way across the economy since.\n\nSince then, interest rates have gone up, money has become tighter and more scarce, and the \"party\" is coming to an end so to speak.\n\nWhen money is tighter, consumers spend less, businesses hire less, people invest less, people are more risk averse, etc. The economy as a whole starts to slow down.\n\nSo startups that were once being flooded with money by investors throwing everything they could at anything resembling \"tech\" suddenly see their investments dry up. Mid-sized businesses can't get loans. Companies aren't willing to spend as much money on advertisements, so sites like google, instagram, Facebook, etc. see their revenue go down. Consumers buy less products on Amazon.\n\nSo everyone stops hiring, and then they start doing layoffs, which means people have even less money to spend on stuff, and the cycle continues to plummet downward into a recession.\n\nAnd that is what we're going through now.\n\nAre there some jobs being made obsolete by AI? Yeah, probably. But that is a secondary factor. The \"crash\" following the \"high\" of reckless monetary policy is the primary reason the economy is crashing now, in tech as much as everywhere else.\n\nHope that helps you.",

There's no reason for OOP other than to make it easier for humans to work with code.\n\nIn my opinion, the most useful purpose of OOP is to let you establish rules, so that somebody working with your code can't accidentally use it wrong.\n\nThat's why it's so popular at large companies. Someone can design a class and give it a very simple public interface. They can then trust that junior engineers can safely call the public interface and it will work correctly.\n\nSimilarly, it can enable someone to extend an existing well-written class and customize its behavior while ensuring the core functionality still works.\n\nWithout OOP, it'd be much easier for lots of people all working on the same project to do something wrong or break something.\n\nSometimes the goal is to enforce rules for yourself! Even if you're the only one working on a program, OOP provides a way to organize it and help keep you from accidentally using your own code the wrong way.",

Like, people are still arguing over what this term means to this day, and they refuse to agree on a concrete definition.\n\nTypically though, OOP is, unsurprisingly centered around the idea of \"objects\"; encapsulated bundles of data, and methods that can interact with a given instance of said data. Under an OOP framework, a program is simply various interactions between different component objects.\n\nIn a Tamagotchi, you have a 'pet', that gets fed 'food' that you buy from the 'store', and keep in your 'inventory' until needed. The 'pet' can have different 'states' that effect its behaviour - states like \"hungry\", \"happy\" or \"dead\". All of these are displayed to the user of the game by a 'game window', and specific information can be managed by a 'settings manager'. You get the gist.\n\nMany people argue that OOP has proverbial 'pillars'; \"encapsulation\" (keeping related fields and methods bundled together in classes), \"inheritance\" (objects can inherit behaviour of other objects), and \"polymorphism\" (use an interface, dummy), but that's another question, and whether some of them matter enough is again, in contention.",

Other examples could be networks, distributed systems, embedded systems, or computer graphics. Basically any class where your homework is largely writing code. Many classes could fall into this category or not depending on how they're taught. For example, some compilers courses will have you write a compiler and others will just teach the theory and test you in it. Check the course before signing up to make sure it is not too theory heavy.\n\nThis is how you learn programming fundamentals, by learning how other people solved hard problems and then reimplementing the solutions yourself. For example, instead of learning about software design in an abstract sense, just learn about operating systems. You'll learn all the OOP principles. Separation of concerns, modularization, polymorphism. And what's even cooler is you'll learn it all in a language that isn't even OOP and then you will have an aha moment when you realize OOP is not the foundation.\n\nIf you have extra time to study, spend it doing the optional challenge exercises or questions on your homeworks/labs or join a team building a project. If you are stuck, go to office hours and ask for help. Take advantage of the resources and expertise available to you. Professors have connections in industry, if you stand out they can help you or they might even employ you directly",

This leads most (nearly all) new programmers to learn a wrong lesson: That learning programming languages is hard. It's realy not.

They might have slightly different keywords and implementations, but that's just the surface layer. Once you know one of them really well (I mean really well, like understanding and being able to explain WHY thing are the way they are, and how they work under the hood) you can really write in all 3. \n\nFor Backend developent, you can basically choose what you want. C# and Java are better than C++ (in this specific case), many people also like Python or JS, Ruby, Go, PHP or rust.

If you have to switch to language \"Z\" you have to start at zero again.\n\nFar more important than tutorials once one is past the fundamentals is to work on your own, without tutorials. This is how to *really* learn programming.\n\nThe repo you listed is not too bad, yet, you should probably use it in a different way than intended: use it as inspiration, as guideline and then develop *your own* implementation.

Most of the tutorials you find online are articles on blogs or YouTube videos, and they tend to cover some specific topic. In order to get the big picture that you need when you're learning a new language or large framework, you'd need to read/watch dozens of those types of tutorials, often from multiple authors, and try to synthesize general knowledge from that hodgepodge of specifics. I'd avoid any book with the word \"cookbook\" in the title for the same reason.\n\nWhat you want when you're learning a big topic is a big, comprehensive source that was built to teach that larger topic from soup to nuts, so you take a well-planned path through all the material you need and get a single, coherent perspective. To me, that mostly means getting a good book and working your way through it, but courses like the ones offered online by Stanford, Harvard, etc. would also work well.",

In practice, the compiler will enter `main` and move the stack pointer some offset; this space behind the stack pointer will go back to the end of the stack frame - the stack frame contains the information of where to go when `main` returns. This is the space allocated for the local variables. For you, that'd be about 4 bytes on a typical dev machine. So when `value_giver` returns, the memory for the return value is already allocated, and the compiler will generate machine instructions to write it into this stack space.\n\nIf you're curious, you could pick up a book on writing compilers, and function call conventions, virtual registers, register allocation via graph coloring, caching and swapping, virtual address spaces, and all sorts of fun theory put into practice.\n\nTypically compilers will generate machine code that all the local variables are allocated all at once, so this code:\n\n    void fn() {\n      int x;\n\n      // Stuff...\n\n      int y;\n\n      // Stuff...\n\nThe stack memory will look like:\n\n    [fn frame][x][y][stack pointer]\n\nSo even though `y` comes into scope later in the function code, all locals were allocated at once; it's just less work to do it this way, and the memory for `y` is inaccessible until the machine code that uses it comes into scope. Compilers don't have to do it this way, and the C standard says effectively nothing about machine code generation. C is a high level language that targets an abstract machine. The compiler projects that abstraction to the actual machine.\n\nAs far as C is concerned, `a = 25` because that's the code you wrote. How it's realized depends on the compiler and the target architecture that is going to execute those instructions.\n\nTo blow your mind - Charles Babbage designed the Analytical Engine - a purely mechanical clockwork digital computer. He never did get the funding to build it; some private investor spent millions of dollars and commissioned his earlier Difference Engine to be built, and it was completed and put on display in a London Museum for 2 years, before being brought into his private collection. All the Difference Engine does is compute logarithms.\n\nBut the Analytical Engine was digitized and simulated - and it fucking worked. Earlier analysis of the design has shown IT IS Turing Complete, and it was indeed designed to be a general purpose computer. So being Turing Complete means it is exactly equivalent to your computer you're using right now - just mechanical and slower. This means YOU CAN write a C compiler for the Analytical Engine and compile this program for it, and it would run. The gears would whirl and turn, and move in lockstep, and the output would be as you expect.",

In reality this is optimised, but in a very simple stack based system you just return the execution to where the function was called and then the assignment copies the value on the stack. The return type defines the width (how many bits/bytes) are on the stack. After that the next function call will write to the stack, overwriting that value.\n\nThe stack, CPU registers, and pointers that control program execution and function calls make it all work. \n\nThere's a pointer that tells the CPU which instruction to execute next. That's the \"Instruction Pointer\" (IP). It can \"jump\" to where a function and and then \"jump\" back when the function returns. The pointers can just be on the stack because stacking those addresses makes it easy.  \n  \nSince it uses a stack\\*, it must know where on the stack the function has to work with local variables.

It‚Äôs very far away from web-dev, but the other day I had to throw together a simple dashboard for some telemetry we are collecting. \n\nLearning programming is a long journey, with many different paths to take. My opinion is that any kind of programming experience is good, even things that might seem unrelated on the surface.\n\nHowever, all the companies I‚Äôve worked at (both small startups and large corporations, in Germany or the US) are only looking for candidates that have a masters or PhD in a relevant field.

Well no one is going to hire a backend dev for example with 0 years of experience and handle them critical data.

That way, you can implement each bit one by one. \n\nOnce your sections are working individually, start combining them through API calls. \n\nGraph things out if you need visual guides. Visualisations can help. Create UML diagrams, design your database tables, draw connections between your components to plan how they will communicate between each other, read documentation and forums like Stack Overflow, etc.\n\nYes, this will take trial and error. There is no skipping that. It's a necessary part of learning. Take a step back. Go back to the drawing board if you have to and plan out what you need to do.",

This means trying to be as solid as you can in the basics, admit the stuff you don't know, and ask them questions that make it clear that you understand that they know more than you, and you are interested in learning from them. If they are the kind of place that will expect somebody in your position to already be an experienced professional developer, they wont hire you.... and you will have dodged a bullet.",

You need to understand how to build your own project, so by watching beginning videos, you can see how arrays, loops, and functions come together.  As you go along, think of ideas for your own projects, like maybe build a calculator with HTML/CSS, then work the functionality, and with a calculator, you can make it more complex as you learn more.  Figure out how to make things functional.  I mean, you can build a webpage that looks like a blog with HTML and CSS, but how do you get comments to post for everyone to see, then allow replies?  Do you know how to do that?  That could be a project, to give things action, to make them work.  Add functionality.\n\nFurthermore, I would look into intermediate courses.   O'Reilly has a couple intermediate python courses and one of them has a live instructor.  I've been thinking of signing up for that, but haven't looked into costs.  I used to be a member and it was like 600/yr.

Each pipeline runs turbo build --filter app-name and only deploys when its paths or shared packages change. Use feature flags (LaunchDarkly or Unleash) to hide unfinished modules so you can merge to main safely. For shared code, keep packages private and link via workspaces; add Changesets to version only when you actually need a publish, otherwise just bump internal packages and let turbo‚Äôs cache handle rebuilds. If you truly need hard isolation but one domain, use Next.js multi‚Äëzone or Azure Front Door path routing so /community, /registration, etc. point at separate app artifacts.\n\nFor APIs across apps, I‚Äôve paired LaunchDarkly and Azure Front Door with DreamFactory to auto-generate secure endpoints over shared databases without writing boilerplate.\n\nTL;DR: monorepo + per‚Äëapp pipelines + feature flags; multi‚Äëzone if you need stricter deploy isolation.",

After that course, I felt like I can built stuff that's really helpful for me. And that's what I did. Been programming for 13 years now. \n\nIt's definitely not about being smart. Programming is really one of the easier concepts in a CS curriculum. And Python is especially easy. I was taught Java at first (which I'm glad about). But I think you also need to either be wired to think like a programmer or you need to learn it. You will learn to think more analytically and you will learn how to solve problems. Or you will find out that that kind of thinking is just not for you.\n\nMy advice is: Just stick with it. If you can find any joy or interest in programming, then stick with it. It will click some day. If the whole experience is just a drag to you, even after trying for months, that might mean that it's not for you. Also: Don't do it for the money. If you don't enjoy it, you'll be miserable.\n\nBTW: I barely passed my introductory programming course. But once I finished the practical course in the second semester, I was an A-B student when I came to practical programming courses. They were always interesting and I always got some sort of satisfaction out of it learning new things and solving problems. Most of the time, I was the one pulling the group. So, don't worry if it's hard at first. Because it is. It might click some day, but it takes a lot of practice! You have to sit down and write code. A LOT! Don't skip any homework. Write and practice as much code as possible.\n\nBut I also have to ask: What kind of CS MASTERS needs to give an intro to PYTHON? That's nuts! How did you even get into the masters without a CS bachelor?",

        "body": "If it makes you feel better, this is a field where you constantly feel like you're not smart enough for it.¬†\n\n\nYou basically get comfortable at feeling dumb, feeling lost, and failing repeatedly. Learn to allow yourself to experience these things without negativity or devaluing your self-worth.¬†Being comfortable with that opens up your mind for everything else. That way, you won't feel discouraged for doing extra research or taking longer than others to figure things out...or you could just ignore that and stress out 24/7 üòè\n\n\nWith that said, a lot of programmers are obsessed with the idea that learning it must be really difficult; if you can't do x thing in y way, then \"you're not cut out for it.\"\n\n\nI find *that* ridiculous, just like I find the method to teach you for loops a little odd.¬†\n\n\nDon't be afraid to take a few steps back and look up introductory courses to x concept and asking for a lot of guidance if you're stuck on something.¬†\n\n\nIf you wind up going further down this path, remember this - building usable programs is really important, even if they're very basic to start.\n\n\nMy curriculum failed to even suggest that. We've never even built a basic calculator like you are now. This led to my growth in programming being at a near plateau for 2 years.¬†\n\n\nI learned theory, syntax, and basic concepts but never actually trained the most important aspect of a programmer - solving problems. A programmer is a problem-solver who uses tools (languages, functions, etc) to solve them.¬†\n\n\nThat's why many people emphasize solving the problem with writing out diagrams, pictures, words, etc, then turning that into psuedocode you can easily follow.¬†\n\n\nHere's a simple way breaking the problem down would look like:\n- If I receive 2 numbers, let's say 6 and 2, what would the end result be? 12?¬†\n- How would I get from my base numbers to get to 12 while only adding? Adding by 2, 6 times?\n- How do I make my program loop by 6 times?\n- How do I make sure I correctly add 2 each time in that loop?¬†\n- How do I see if my end result is 12?\n- How do I replace my numbers 6 and 2 with variables?¬†\n- Would I get the same result assigning 6 and 2 to those variables before the loop?\n- How do I get user input to achieve the same result?\n\n\nSo on and so forth. Maybe add some psuedocode to give a basic idea of how it would flow in code.¬†\n\n\nBuilding a bigger program would follow a similar process. Whenever you break down a problem but get stuck on breaking it down further for x, y, z reasons, that might be a good indicator of searching up a little more about x, y, and z.\n\n\nHope that helps! I'm a fellow beginner, so you might even be building something I find difficult right now lmao.¬†",

A country suffices. \n\nFrom a central EU and USA perspective: \n\nA degree is not 100% necessary, but makes the entire process of finding and keeping (good) jobs a lot easier. If you want to go this route, taking all general STEM classes you can get before will help. \n\nA computer science degree will generally give you good basics, but you will be expected to \"self learn\" programming along the way. You will probably get taught the basics for programming as well, but everything beyond that is incidental. Programming is to computer science as masonry to an architect. This is the slowest route, but you will be the most well rounded, and able to go into basically any field (inside of IT) you want to specialize in. \n\nA software engineering degree locks you out of very few things: Theoretical CS research is the only thing that comes to mind, but I am sure there is a little more. It mostly has the same basics as a general computer science degree, but you specialize in how software works, is made and programming a lot more. Theoretical CS and other possible specializations, like Bio/medicine and programming, physics or IT-security will be ignored more. If you know that you want to be a programmer, this is always solid. \n\nIn some countries you also have vocational training as a programmer, you can treat this like a Software Engineering degree, but shorter and with less prestige. \n\nThen you can go the self taught route. Here it's even more about a good portfolio, to prove oyu are able to work, and good networking. You need connections to get anywhere, because you need to give people a reason to even consider you an option. Normally the degree does that for you (to an extend, networking is also important if you have one) \n\nCertificates are motly completely useless in my experience. This will vary greatly throughout different regions and specific fields, but when we did technical evaluations of new candidates, we just ignored any certificates. The only thing we looked at was education and prior experience, like a portfolio or earlier jobs they've had. I know now, that in some countries they hold quite a bit more value, and that's why it's important to say where (approximately) you will be looking for work, once your education is done. \n\nIf you want to know where to start for self learning, there is a quite well written FAQ section in this subreddit (right hand side of your screen on PC, you will find it on mobile as well) with a list of places to start, very well laid out and explained",

Could this be the solution to what I'm trying to do?\n\nIt could be sufficient for your purposes, but more of an alternative to using React. Likely the technique you're looking for is what we call templating. It's also what SSGs use.\n\nI'm not personally familiar with react so I can't give an exact answer for your situation, but one common type of templating is [jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/), where you can have a template like `hello {{name}}` (which you should be familiar with from basic string interpolation), and logic like `{% for name in names %}hello {{name}}{% endfor %}`.\n\nStatic site generators essentially use templates to produce static HTML that you can serve to people through stuff like github pager, a simple Apache webserver, etc. Usually it involves some setup in terms of theming and what you want headers, footers, etc to be, and then you can do stuff like add blog posts written in Markdown with minimal effort.\n\nYou can find static site generators in pretty much any language. Some commonly used ones include\n\n* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (Ruby)\n* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (Go)\n* [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) (Rust, but more special-purpose)\n\nSome of the ones I've used include\n\n* [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) (node.js)\n* [hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) (Haskell)\n\nYou can find [a list of SSGs on jamstack](https://jamstack.org/generators/). There's 370 of them currently, some general-purpose, some special-purpose. Given that you seem to have some experience with node.js you could have a look at 11ty to see if it seems to cover your needs.",

In my case it was building an encyclopedia - based on the entry title in the url, it would grab information about that entry from the backend database and populate the template's title, description, etc, with that information.\n\nAnyway, I don't know enough about React to say exactly how you would do it, but it might be worth looking into seeing if the router you're using has any kind of dynamic routing as an option and go from there.",

Store event data in a DB/CMS with fields like title, date, backgroundColor, theme, and a blocks array (e.g., hero, speakers, schedule). Your EventPage maps blocks to components, so ‚Äúunique flair‚Äù is just data. For SEO, compute meta tags from the fetched event. Prefetch the event on card hover or intersection to keep it snappy.\n\n\n\nIf you want SSG, Next.js works well: pages/events/\\[slug\\] with getStaticPaths to build popular events, and revalidate to keep them fresh. You still drive layout from metadata, so special cases don‚Äôt break the system.\n\n\n\nFor backends, I‚Äôve used Hasura for instant GraphQL on Postgres and Supabase for auth/storage; when I needed REST from an existing SQL DB without writing controllers, DreamFactory auto-generated endpoints and docs.\n\n\n\nBottom line: build a single data-driven EventPage under a dynamic route and let metadata handle variations.",

If I hired a brand new senior developer with 20 years experience, I would expect them to start by asking questions about this stuff. \n\nBeyond that, devs are often proud of their codebase, and enjoy the opportunity to talk about it.

Communicating with mentors is also important as they sometimes don't know about your difficulties. They will definitely help and guide you to the best of their abilities.",

Flask lets you make a simple website to view and edit data, and SQLite can store everything in a single file. You will need a backup plan for the database, but it's simple and doesn't require a server.\n\nIf multiple people need access at the same time, you will need a server and a proper database. Node.js lets you run JavaScript on the server to handle multiple users. A NoSQL database like MongoDB is easier than SQL for beginners because you don't have to plan tables and relationships in advance. You can just add new fields as you go (Useful if they later need to add random stuff they forgot to mention). An online database just means the database lives on a server everyone can access, but it requires hosting, security, and backups. There are generous free tiers but it adds complexity.\n\nFor now, start small with Flask and SQLite on your own computer as a demo. Focus on the key features, tracking animals, medications, and volunteer logs. Once it works, you can think about scaling it with Node.js and MongoDB if more people need access or using something like Pymongo to keep using your Flask app instead of redoing it in Node.js.\n\nWhat you are building is a basic CRUD app with a form to add new animals and a table to view them. It's simple enough that an AI could probably build it for you. If you want to learn, use AI as a tutor or guide so you don't get lost. Keep it simple. Adding too many features will make it take longer to finish and harder to maintain later.",

You'll need basically all of them. Take classes, read articles, whatever, you need familiarity with many algorithms. Graph searches are going to be your bread and butter. After that, familiarity and practice is important. Working through old competition problems, reading other people's solutions, etc. Regular practice is #1. Beyond that, collaboration.

One of the best ways to keep motivation in my opinion is building something that solves a problem you have, because the drive to solve a problem is what makes programming so insanely addictive and fun. Solving a problem you have is the most rewarding and motivational thing I've ever experienced programming. So, try it out, don't wait for motivation just think of something that annoys you and build a solution. For example, I didn't like having to go to so many different sites to compress and convert different file formats so I made my own website that converts and compresses audios, videos and images in one simple place and that is one of my favorite projects because it really showed me that motivation doesn't come from waiting around or watching courses, but from solving problems, coming up with something to make and making it.\n\nStay consistent by practicing and by making mistakes, keep yourself in that loop of frustrated about why your code isn't running but then you figure it out and you're really happy, that loop of dopamine will make learning fun and addictive for you. And when learning and problem solving becomes addictive that's when you start building the software you dream of building, because you start to realize that nothing is too difficult you just have to put in more work.",

This technology isn't used much nowadays, but it's relatively easy to understand.\n\nIf you're writing a custom webapp backend, then you can use any server-side templating engine that you want. A template engine can allow one HTML fragment to include others, and it can also allow more dynamic substitutions. Many beginners use Python along with the lightweight Flask web framework, which uses the Jinja template engine.\n\nIf you're dedicated to using Java, you can use servlets and JSP pages (kind of old school) or you can go with a more modern framework like Spring, which supports a variety of template engines.\n\nIf you want to use client-side rendering with JavaScript, you once again have lots of options: React, Angular, Svelte, Vue, ...",

String it together. Test the performance etc. Then do a second pass where you design and create good code boundaries/interfaces.\n\n\\- Getting the interfaces right alongside the above.\n\nGood, necessary abstractions with simple interfaces make it easy to add and change code later, and easy to write minimal (integration) test code. It's very hard to get right, so developers who can are worth keeping happy IMO!",

Using docker's built-in private networks comes pretty close to the behavior of having a bunch of unmanaged low-end switches for your purposes. \n\nIf you don't need to run a full desktop/GUI environment, you can install a minimal server OS to make a host system out of an old laptop with ~8G RAM and a 1gHz CPU, then install docker on it and easily run a dozen containers on separate subnets simulating low-usage apps, clients, backend services, etc.\n\nThe fact that the other commenter is using VMs instead of containers is why on a 8-core system with 64GB RAM he can only be comfortable running \"up to 8 concurrent\" servers.",

Every single failure teaches you something. It teaches you how not to do things, which is equally important to knowing how to do things. Also, it improves your experience.\n+ *Is it fear of inadequacy?* - Well, we all were there at some point in our learning.\n\nJust think about some small project and build it. If it doesn't work, figure out why and how to fix it. This is the best way to learn.\n\nDon't look at others' scripts/skills - they have way, way more experience than you have. Once you get the amount of experience, you'll also be there.\n\nYou need to gradually level up your skills through projects where you start small and simple and ramp up complexity and scope. There is no other way. \n\nNot a single programmer was *born competent, or even decent*. They all worked hard to learn.\n\nThere is no reason for fear. This is completely irrational.\n\n----\n\nYou already have a project in mind:\n\n> generating a list of pin names for input and output of a design once i feed it through an excel file for example....\n\nOkay, let's take a look at this:\n\n+ You need an Excel file - so, you need something that can *read* excel - for Python, this would be something like OpenPyXL - check it and check the documentation\n+ You need to do something with the file - that means loops conditionals, variable assignments, maybe string manipulation, etc. All things that you know already - you just need to combine them\n+ You need to output the generated new data - in what format? Text file? CSV? JSON? Excel? - depending on that, you need different tools - research them.\n\nThe whole thing starts by formulating your requirements. The more detailed you formulate them, the better.\n\nThen, break the large idea down into small units - open the file, read a line - process a line - write the output - repeat until there are no more lines\n\nThat's way too coarse - further breakdown is necessary - open and read are okay(ish) - processing needs much deeper drilling into - since you haven't told what you need to do with the data and in what format the original data is, this is up to you to figure out - last writing to file is also okay(ish).\n\nGo deeper and deeper - break things down, rinse and repeat.\n\nOnly if you do that, you will get a deep understanding of what you even want/have to do.\n\nThen, start working on implementing your parts - one after the other.\n\n---\n\nGood luck!",

You'll probably still wanna learn some JS, HTML and CSS eventually too just to make a nice fullstack project. Also SQL. If you want to do data science/ml based stuff learn Python. If you want to do games, quant, embedded, learn C++. Maybe C for embedded first. If you want to do Linux and like low level tooling learn C, maybe experiment with Rust in a few years. You don't have to do any of these things you just need to do one of them. Of you are unsure, rest assured that most computer science students will learn only C++, C or Java in their 3 year degree and they tend to end up with a basis of knowledge that allows them to pivot to whatever they want later when they decide that.

        "body": "Write an HTTP server.\n\nHTTP is a text based protocol, and you can get away with just implementing GET and POST - and you don't even need the whole thing - you can just ignore authentication, for example. You generate an HTTP response IN TEXT. It's all text. That's the point of this exercise.\n\nSeriously, don't overthink it - it's not hard. You're not writing a complete web server, you just need to read text from a stream, figure out what message type you got, and service it.\n\nYou can write main in terms of `std::cin` and `std::cout`. What makes standard IO so special is that you can use the `netcat` command to open a listening socket on port 8080, and launch an instance of your program - `netcat` will establish the TCP stream for you, and redirect all IO to your program's standard IO. So here you're coding against `std::cin` and `std::cout`, and in reality, it's coming from a TCP socket over a pipe across the network.\n\nNow you can just hit the localhost loopback device with a web browser on port 8080, and your program just reads `std::cin` to process the GET request, and you write back a payload with the most barebones HTML that says \"Hello World!\" in it. Or maybe some JSON, or XML, since both those are transport protocols - you can just write it raw, you don't need a template engine that processes JSON or anything like that.\n\nBut you could... If you get ambitious...\n\nYou can also use `telnet` or `curl` to interact with your little server and see a more raw view, or the developer tools built into the browser - whatever those do...\n\nAs for your code, OOP is message passing to objects, so you can implement a couple message types:\n\n    class GET {};\n    class POST {};\n\n    using request = std::variant<GET, POST>;\n\n    std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, request &);\n\nThe stream operator will start to parse out the HTTP request, determine the request type, and then create the corresponding variant type. This makes this stream operator here a factory method. Once you get as far as knowing the message type, you could defer to the message type instance to populate itself from the stream:\n\n    class GET {\n      friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, GET &);\n    };\n    class POST {\n      friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, POST &);\n    };\n\nYou'll probably want a response message:\n\n    class response {\n      friend std::ostream &operator <<(std::ostream &, const response &);\n    };\n\nTo make an object, you make it streamable:\n\n    class http_server: public std::streambuf {};\n\nIf you want to parse text, you overload a couple things:\n\n    class http_server: public std::streambuf {\n      int_type underflow() override, overflow(int_type) override;\n    };\n\nAnd you can plug that into a stream:\n\n    http_server svr;\n    std::iostream ios{&svr};\n\nYou can make a number of these, for being different kinds of processors and handlers and stages that all perform steps. Messages move content, objects do work. This is OOP in C++. This is why Bjarne invented C++, because he wanted more control over message passing, and he wanted greater type safety than either Smalltalk or C. Streams are the interface - and frankly you can bypass the stream implementations almost completely if you're messaging internally in your application - you don't have to serialize to text all the damn time. There's a lot you can do with OOP if you think in terms of objects and messages.\n\nI demonstrate these principles in past posts of mine, I spend most of my Reddit time answering C++ questions on Reddit, so look up a couple of my past examples.\n\nBut if you can implement objects and message passing as OOP intended, I think you'll show your professor something he's almost certainly never seen in his life. MOST people can't even tell you what OOP IS, because they've never seen it themselves, before. Encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism? These principles are NOT OOP, they just come OUT of OOP. These principles exist in other paradigms, too. You've got polymorphism in everything from imperative programming to functional programming, for example. Most C++ code is C with Classes because people don't know what they're doing - garbage in, garbage out. I've spoken to other developers who understand OOP, but in 30 years I've never actually met one in real life, never worked with one. I've worked with a Windows 95/DirectX/COM co-author, I've worked with the former maintainer of the Intel Fortran compiler (and that's a big fucking deal, since it's used on all the worlds supercomputers), and I've shown them this stuff, how Bjarne writes code, and they've never seen anything like it before.",

        "body": "Under the hood, the compiler generates a virtual table. Vtables are not explicitly required by the C++ spec, but it's how all the compilers do it. This is a static table of function pointers - each abstract class and derived class has it's own table. Your instance points to its table.\n\nSo then, if you have a `B` instance, but through type erasure you only have an `A` pointer, then calling a method will undergo a lookup so the correct implementation is called.\n\nMaybe.\n\nThe vtable only contains entries for `virtual` methods. In your example, the only entry in the vtable of both `A` and `B` will be for `print`. You didn't make `~A` virtual, so when you `delete a`, the compiler doesn't know `a` is pointing to a `B`. The compiler only knows the non-virtual interface presented to it through the `A` type.\n\n---\n\nIf you google OOP in C, you can find tutorials for building objects in C, including modeling inheritance, and polymorphism. The object code generated by this exercise typically matches the C++ equivalent exactly. The first C++ compiler - CFront, was originally a transpiler to C.\n\nSo why not just use C? Because the two languages have different type systems. C++ grants you much more type safety - and type safety is more than just catching errors; compilers are theorem provers, and they use type information in order to optimize more aggressively. C and C++ are both high level abstract languages, they're not high level assembly languages. It's not about what machine code they generate.",

If you know that you will never extend the class or you know that it will never be destroyed via a base class pointer, then maybe not. There is a cost to making that first function virtual and you might not want to pay it. If you have other virtual functions already then you probably should go ahead and make the destructor virtual.",

It fixes some issue but causes others. So, the best option would be to use the suggestion by [Total-Box-5169](https://www.reddit.com/user/Total-Box-5169/) and turn up the warning levels to let the compiler catch this issue.",

        "body": "If you‚Äôre looking to get back into programming and want something practical that you can tinker with, leaning on languages like Java and C# (.NET) is a solid choice. Both are mature, widely supported, and have a lot of libraries that can make building things like a hotel PMS or a roster scheduler much more manageable. Java will give you platform independence, so you could run your programs on Windows, Linux, or Mac without much hassle, while C# and .NET are extremely well-integrated into Windows environments and offer rapid development with a lot of built-in UI frameworks. For your particular projects, SQL is going to be almost unavoidable if you want to store reservations, employee details, or scheduling data efficiently. Learning to combine either Java or C# with a relational database like MariaDB would cover most of what you need, and it‚Äôs exactly how most professional systems handle persistent data.\n\nFor the hotel PMS, even if you already use Opera Cloud, building your own simplified version can be a great learning experience. You‚Äôll get hands-on insight into the data structures and workflows behind reservations, room management, and billing, which will inform your understanding of what a full-scale system does behind the scenes. For the roster builder, the challenge lies more in logic and rules enforcement‚Äîhandling days off, labor law restrictions, and employee availability can be complex, and practicing this in code will improve your problem-solving skills more than anything else. You could start simple, storing employee information and preferences in a database, then gradually implement more advanced scheduling algorithms as you learn.\n\nHere me out though: some of the most efficient POS systems ever made weren‚Äôt built on top of an operating system at all‚Äîthey were written in assembly language. By coding directly to the hardware, developers could squeeze out incredible speed and reliability, especially in environments where every millisecond counts, like retail or hospitality checkout systems. Modern frameworks make development faster and easier, but looking at those old systems is a good reminder that understanding what‚Äôs happening at the low level can make you a much stronger programmer, even if you never touch assembly yourself. It‚Äôs all about learning how things work under the hood, and how your high-level code translates into actual performance. This also saves a ton of money on client end systems as the hardware doesn't need to support a full operating system since you've built it to be application specific. You wouldn't use a pc for what you can do with a 5 buck Arduino.\n\nIf you're willing to learn a new language though, I'd recommend c++ as you can compile it for any operating system.",

It's long enough to see people \"discover\" ideas that were already here and then charge forward on them instead of looking at the history of what happened to them the first time they came around. And it can be a little exhausting learning a language that is 95% another language except they replaced all the `$variable` interpolations with `${variable}` and this one uses MODULA-inspired instead of ALGOL-inspired syntax. Or yet another way to wrap SQL. Or yet another way to abstract HTTP.\n\nSometimes, legitimately good new ideas come along. Package management is pretty great. I appreciate algebraic effects (although back in the day we just called them \"hooks\" and got nasty with them). Linters and opinionated formatters are a good call. But our whole discipline has a \"not enough historians\" problem and we have a tendency to get all shiny-eyed over a new framework or language or protocol that is a lot like one that came before except it didn't learn the lessons that one learned when it hit usage, so we get to make the same mistakes again.\n\n(Beware learning Common LISP; you will see the inspiration for a *lot* of features and be grumpy they don't work as well as they do in LISP. ;) ).",

        "body": "Yes, it is overwhelming. C++ is more complex for multiple reasons:\n\n* It's relatively old as far as programming languages go, it dates back to the 1990s. It predates all modern build tools and package managers.\n* One of the primary reasons people pick C++ is to build platform-specific code. Not the only reason! But it means that a standard cross-platform solution for writing C++ just doesn't make a lot of sense for many people is because the whole reason C++ is being used is to build code that's tightly tied to a particular operating system a lot of the time.\n* There are multiple widely used C++ compilers: GCC/G++, LLVM/Clang++, and MSVC are all extremely widely used and relevant. They're quite compatible but not perfectly compatible. Some important projects can't be compiled with all of them. They don't support the same set of platforms.\n* Due to the lack of strong cross-platform IDEs, many C++ projects support command-line builds as their primary solution. IDEs can still be used, but they're not primary.\n\nAs far as advice: first, I'm assuming that you want to learn C++ as a pure language and that none of the stuff you want to learn is platform-specific. In other words, I'm assuming that your goal is NOT to, e.g. write a Windows GUI application. If so, then you need to specify what types of platform-specific code you want to write, because the advice might be different.\n\nSo if you just want to learn C++ as a pure language, you've got a lot of options. Which one you prefer is really a matter of personal preference.\n\nIf you use Windows as your primary system now and you want to keep doing that, Microsoft's Visual Studio (e.g. Community edition) is an excellent choice. It's full-featured and \"batteries included\". Not the same as VS Code, which is a totally different product.\n\nAnother good option on Windows is to install WSL2 and use a fully open-source toolchain: use your text editor of choice, install gcc, cmake, and a bunch of command-line tools used on Linux.\n\nOf course, if you're interested in Linux, that's a great choice too. I don't think it really matters which distro you pick. On Linux, every developer tool you could possibly imagine can be installed with one or two clicks or a single command. You can go from a fresh install to a working developer environment in literally minutes, compared to hours on Windows.\n\nThe downside of Linux is that you might be much less familiar with the GUI, and it might not support all of the games, apps, and hardware that Windows does.\n\nIf you have a Mac, macOS is fantastic - it gives you nearly all of the developer tools you'll find on Linux, plus all of the other sorts of apps you need for everything else in your life like on Windows (and unlike Linux). As a foundation you can use gcc or clang, plus cmake, and then optionally use various code editors combined with command-line for building and running. Yet another option is Xcode, Apple's IDE. While Xcode is primarily used for Apple's languages and to build apps for Apple platforms, it does have C++ support.\n\nOne option is VS Code, which works on all of those platforms. However, I wouldn't recommend it as a good starting point for C++. VS Code is NOT a \"batteries included\" solution, it's a blank slate and you have to install plug-ins and configure everything to support any language you want. Some languages are easy. C++ is not, if you're new to it. You basically need to already have a compiler and build system installed and working, AND you need to understand how to configure and troubleshoot it, to get it working with VS Code.\n\nHope that helps.",

The former is the IDE that comes bundled with the build system, the compiler, the linker, the debugger, the editor, the latter is VERY POORLY named and is just an editor with a plugin interface, something more appropriate for intermediate and advanced developers who want more control over their tools and configuration. You still need a compiler, linker, debugger, build system, and standard libraries, AND you'd have to configure them...\n\nSo in VS, you'd use the wizard to configure a new, blank Win32 Console Application. In the Solution Explorer window, you'd right-click and add a source file, and you're off to the races...\n\nIf you're on Linux, that'll likely be some `dev-tools` package - and it's PROBABLY NAMED `dev-tools`, and then that'll get you `GCC` and `make` and all the basics you need. Then you can pick whatever editor you want. I agree it's a little bit too much freedom to begin with. I like Vim + You Complete Me, but you would probably find that modal terminal editor to be archaic with a near vertical learning curve, but it's often preferred by advanced developers. Your editor is NOT C++, so don't get bogged down in it. Learn some programming first, and then at some point, once you work through your programming book, then you might consider working on your workflow, which means experimenting with tools. Vim is scriptable, and that includes the host command shell directly - so you can extend your local editing to span not just the local system, but the whole of the internet and all it has to offer you, if it made sense to do so.",

A 90 minute take home, a virtual technical, and a virtual behavioral. Only their final rounds are in-person.\n\nThat said, I definitely expected this. Just like companies work arrangements are mostly going back to how they were pre-covid with hybrid being the most common, followed by 100% onsite, followed by remote being the most rare. Interviews are the same way. In-person worked. Not only is it a way to prevent cheating, but it's significantly easier to read body language, and to get a better vibe of a person (in *both* directions, this benefits the candidate to judge the interviewers) when you're in-person.\n\nIt's also not that expensive for the company. The final round can be expensive-ish to fly people in, like Google's doing here. But pre-covid something that was common before the final rounds was to have candidates early in the process drive out to a proctored test site to do their \"interview\" there. There's thousands upon thousands of test centers *globally*, you just drive out ot one near you. I've done it before, it was pretty easy. Local proctored testing is very cheap.\n\nI think this was inevitable. The rise of AI just sped things along a bit.\n\nAnd to those who haven't done in-person interviews before, it's ***way*** easier to whiteboard out a problem in pseudocode and another person in the room, versus doing it in a real IDE via typing where all your syntax needs to be right with people staring at you on camera.",

There were still a decent amount of devs in their late 30's/40's. There was one guy who was I think in his 70's, maybe even 80's. He didn't need the money at that point in his life, he just liked working. He wasn't a manager and didn't have a fancy title or anything, just a regular IC.\n\nI've worked with tons of older folks throughout my career. I wouldn't say it's \"extremely rare\" at all.

        "body": "Man, let‚Äôs be real, the job market right now is ridiculous. There‚Äôs a huge gap between the skills companies actually need and the number of people already trained and looking for work. So you end up with fewer openings and way too many applicants, and let‚Äôs not even talk about how low the salaries companies are offering these days. It‚Äôs not just tech either, people are getting degrees in fields like anthropology or psychology, and unless they go all the way to a PhD, they‚Äôre stuck in an endless loop of not having enough experience. The good thing is your degree is still super relevant to today‚Äôs needs.\n\nI think you should get your resume in front of as many people as possible. Find companies in your area where you‚Äôd actually like to work and reach out to people in the departments you‚Äôre interested in. Tell them your situation, ask if they know of any openings, and see if they‚Äôre willing to help or give some guidance. It‚Äôs not a guaranteed solution, but it really does increase your chances. If you‚Äôre open to remote work, check out [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/); it shares a simple but effective way to send your resume to hundreds of companies.\n\nAnd don‚Äôt forget, all the jobs you‚Äôve done to get by still matter. Every bit of work experience teaches discipline, problem-solving, and perseverance. Those things count more than you think. Keep moving forward and use everything you‚Äôve learned so far to your advantage.",

        "body": "I got laid off in 2002 (end of the .com bubble).  Like you I thought finding a job wouldn't be hard, after all I had 4 years of experience at that point and jobs were handed out like candy in '98 when I graduated.  I took 3 months off just like you, even spent a good chunk of my severance like an idiot.\n\nI spend the next 9 months looking for a job, I was out of work over a year. I ran out of cash, and I was 30-40k in debt on maxed out credit cards. I was borrowing money from friends to make the bills work and out of unemployment checks.\n\nMy old company (the one that laid me off) called me up, they had an ugly project and were looking for current/ex-employees who had reputations for putting in the hours/work. Wanted to hire me as a contractor, I negotiated an hourly rate, and hopped a plane to chicago, worked remote there for over 9 months, nights/weekends... 80+ hour weeks.  That hourly contract rate paid off all my debt, paid back my friends, got me a new car and a nest egg.\n\nThat contract paid me more in 6-9 month of work then they'd have paid me if they'd just kept me employed during the year I was laid off plus the 6-9 months.  It was silly. They hired me back full time to save money.\n\nAbout 8 months later I landed a job in my dream industry and happily walked away from them.\n\nPoint of my story? It's rough. Being laid off sucks. We can all make mistakes. You may have to do things you don't like to recover. But you can and will recover given enough time.  Hang in there. Do what you have to do to make ends meet.\n\nEdit: I should add since then I've \"lost my job\" to layoffs several more times in the proceeding years. Though thankfully have had a stable run the last 12-13 or so.  I learned my lesson, I keep a large nest egg, try to make sure I have a years worth of bills saved up and accessible.",

It's not worth it to suffer through a semester where you're not learning anything.\n\n\nThe good news is that there's no end of supplemental resources you can find for whatever topic you're studying. If you can't understand your professor, it's definitely an unfortunate waste of time to be in lecture, but as long as you know what skills you're supposed to be developing you can get there on your own.\n\n\nAlso, some of those professors are better in office hours. I can zone out to the lecture of someone who's hard to understand, but if it's 1:1, they have to go at your pace, so you can have them repeat or rephrase until you're satisfied.",

I‚Äôm just trying to hold onto what I have.  I spend $0 more than when I made $250k.  I‚Äôve had the same house since I was making under $200k/yr.  The only thing it changes really (for me) is just not ever worrying about money, which is highly valuable on its own.  \n\nIf I never passed $300k I think I would‚Äôve been perfectly happy.

So, in all, not that bad, but very frustrating and time consuming. Back then Meta, Amazon, Google and Microsoft had all just laid off 10K employees that week each, so it was impossible for anyone to get a new FAANG offer.\n\nIt‚Äôs difficult, but keep trying and work hard - I have faith good things will come :)",

I learned a whole, whole lot, though mostly on my own in terms of technical stuff, but a lot on the business side from being in such a small and early company.\n\n\nIt's not for everyone, but contrary to most other comments, I see it as a great opportunity because instead of sitting down and trying to figure out a project to work on to practice, learn, and solve problems, which is hard, you actually have that part taken care of. You're also basically on the weeds immediately of figuring out things like cross-functional communication and collaboration, prioritization of value generation vs maintainability based on expected impact and necessity, autonomy and ownership etc...\n\n\nHence, why its the \"senior junior\" situation. You speed run learning some senior skills while potentially missing out on some of the more mid-level things like adhering to team styling, some knowledge gaps that come from needing to ship and not having the time or team for learning more about developing in a mature project, learning about choosing when to apply design patterns etc...\n\n\nThose things tend to come about from a bit slower of a pace where engineers can be deeper on engineering rather than making sure market fit has been established, runway is secured, and good enough is more important than scaling and maintaining due to the rapid nature of changing demands.\n\n\nBut, as I said, that isn't for everyone which is okay. It also qualifies you much more towards startups/early/growth since the dynamics and environment, as well as associated skills and knowledge, aren't the same as more matured process and product. So it can be a little harder when trying to transition to something else, but I think its excellent experience to have.\n\n\nI feel like it may be easier to go from startup to mid+ than the other way around. Just my thoughts.",

What I would do in that situation instead of waiting is, reach out to that team you are waiting on, ask if they can at least agree on the structure of the JSON. Then vibe code a fake API so you can build out your front end. \n\nBasically find any way you can to move forward without ‚Äúwaiting‚Äù.

I'm at a pretty low-stakes job and I could probably do this until I retire. However, I've got a direct report who's constantly on edge because he watches tech influencers who push the doom-and-gloom narrative. I keep having to tell them that this isn't San Francisco.\n\nBut you can see other professions, namely white-collar service jobs like nurses and educators, who are absolutely burning out right now.",

Living at work, sleeping there, working through weekends, 60-70h weeks were seen as a sign of passion and loving your job rather than dysfunction. That was not the norm in most careers.\n\nSecond, LOTS of passion in this industry. Or at least, there was. Any industry that attracts passionate people who love the idea of the work has problems with burnout.\n\nThird, it's a type of work that many people find they really put themselves deeply into. You have to defend your ideas, work as part of a team, take ownership. You are seen as an expert, a go to person. You have special knowledge no one else has. All of that further encourages people to go all in.\n\nFinally, for a long time the MONEY you could get at the top of the field was insane. But also random. Working harder and making yoru company succeed could be the difference between a nice middle class life and being a billionaire. No doctor is thinking they might be the next Bill Gates if they work just a LIIIITLE bit harder.\n\nHuge parts of the industry have no problem with burnout. But the parts that DO have a REAL problem with it, and are VERY visible.",

And I might have a days worth of tedious work that I know how to do mixed into all that but the rest takes active learning, stressing/sweating, asking around etc. and that‚Äôs exhausting. And frequently, it could be your fault or could be zero percent your fault, you do something wrong or have to go back and start a part all over and some MBA thinks you‚Äôre underperforming because someone at their old company with a totally different process and set of standards accomplished something remotely similar, maybe, in a little less time‚Ä¶\n\nI find even doctors, tradespeople, other engineers and frankly just about every other job has a LOT more autopilot work.

Owners want to maximize their own profit, so it is in the owner's best interest to pay the worker as little as possible, and to work the worker as long as possible. This is made worse by the fact that profit under capitalism actually tends to fall over time, since capitalism is quite good at making things more efficient it tends to overproduce things in the long run, devaluing the products it produces, meaning often the only way to squeeze out more profit is by squeezing the workers.\n\nThe workers in IT fields are well paid (still much less than the actual value they provide to the company), but work long hours, frequently more than full time, in order to meet arbitrary deadlines and push profits to an extreme. This work is highly mentally taxing contributing to burnout. Additionally globalization, outsourcing, and complacency due to high salaries makes demands for better working environments difficult.\n\nedit: To make things worse, since the 2010s tech companies have been relying on an extremely loan heavy monetary strategy due to low interest rates which actually requires profits to grow exponentially in order to pay their loans back, but this strategy is beginning to falter due to problems like \"running out of people on the planet to sell to\", and \"2% higher interest rates to combat hyper inflation caused by tech company speculative circle jerking\", and \"loans coming due\". Workers are getting squeezed even harder as such.\n\nAnyway some drunk stinky german guy figured out all of this in the 1800s in a long winded economic treatise on commodities.",

I love the field because I started out as really liking UX and design, but just found I wasn't as good at that as I am at the engineering side of things. My growth to senior was a bit slower, but that's often more a result of what projects and mentoring you get. Unfortunately, a lot of teams will have one, singular FEE. So that means you have to reach out beyond your team for mentoring. That was the best part (for me) in working at big tech; i had plenty of sister teams I could cross-mentor with to upgrade skills.",

Around the time front end frameworks started to become a thing, the company I was working at began asking people to choose between front end and backend, and I went front end.  In my experience, there are a lot of roles out there where most of the work is on the front end, but knowing enough about the backend to add a simple endpoint is valuable.  If you want to move from front end to backend, those roles can make a good gateway.\n\nI find that there are a lot of interesting technical challenges to be found on the front end, and that if you focus on solving those, there are lot of great opportunities for more senior front end roles.  But, you have to be very intentional about focusing on problems of performance and architecture.  If you get caught up in building forms or even focusing on interesting UX components, your job stays very small.  But, it doesn't seem like that sort of work is ever fully going away.\n\nIt's worth noting that the top architectural roles at companies tend to be held by people with strong backend experience.  If you want to design full systems, you are unlikely to get there until you also get some solid backend experience under your belt.\n\nI went from a full stack role with a front end focus into management.  I've managed a mix of full stack engineers with a front end focus and pure front end engineers.  Being more front end focused does limit my options for management roles a bit because there are some companies that want highly technical managers with lots of experience across their stack.  But, it's not so limiting that I can't find opportunities.",

I'd say from the beginning. CompE grew out of EE as a specialization in the 90s. Every CompE job will hire EE especially if you dump electives in CompE, but not the reverse. None of the EE work I did would interview a CompE. EE degree broadness is its strength. Power plant work? Power always needs EE/ME/ChemE.\n\n*But really, the reason EE is better is because of insane CompE overcrowding*. Same problem with CS. [Sort here](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market#--:explore:outcomes-by-major) by unemployment. Factoring in difficulty, CompE probably is the worst degree of all. Where I went, expected time to graduate is 4.0 years for CS, 4.4 for EE and 4.6 for CompE.\n\n***\n\nI can give specifics. I went to Virginia Tech when CompE enrollment was 3x smaller than EE and the job market looked equally good for both. Not anymore. [Check out](https://web.archive.org/web/20240813115247/https://ece.vt.edu/undergrad/enrollment.html) our degree and enrollment stats. CompE is twice EE's size now and there are not 6x the jobs from 15 years ago.\n\nAlumni surveys sent 6 months after graduation show CompE with 15% lower chance of unemployment and way higher graduate school rates (read: didn't find job). CompE job market is competitive as hell and the squeeze is worse if you aren't attending Tier 1.\n\n***\n\nI'm not saying everyone abandon CompE. If you have to-have to work in hardware then get the specialized hardware degree. Or if you can't handle or hate the ludicrous EE math, very little of which you will likely use IRL. I used 10% of my EE degree. CS is an easier CompE degree. Maybe your internship odds are better with a higher GPA.",

Now I can throw some config options in a CMake file (For C/C++ projects at least) and generate installers for all the major platforms in a way that's fairly straightforward.\n\n\nIIRC there were a lot of third party installers that you could pay for, all throughout the 90's. They promised to build robust installers in a fraction of the time it would take you to build one any other way. There are probably still some old projects on sourceforge that use some proprietary installers. I still try to avoid installing anything from sourceforge due to the persistent rumors that installers from there frequently (always?) bundled malware. Most of the old projects on that site have migrated to more reputable git-based companies to host their source.",

I think in most cases management does not even know what \"quality code\" looks like and just relies on SWEs to do their job.  Now SWE \"talent\" comes in to play and most companies are not hiring big tech company level SWEs since they cannot compete with total compensation.\n\nI've worked on safety critical medical devices at private non-tech companies in non-tech cities, think dialysis machines, for my 15+ year career.   These companies have mature processes as they have been around for 30+ years. The devices we created were safe and had FDA approval, but the codebase was real spaghetti in many areas.\n\nMost of the time it came down to SWEs just working within the existing code base.  They don't really care about pushing for refactors unless it was absolutely necessary.  SWEs were not intentionally sabotaging the project.  They did the best they could with the skills they had.  Management doesn't complain about code quality so there is no issue from these SWEs perspective.\n\nThe SWEs at the majority of companies are not grinding DS&A or design patterns trying to get in to top tech companies.  They can code up features that do what they need to do and that's about it.  These companies are not trying to compete with big tech companies as they cannot come close to matching total compensation.\n\nThey try to sell themselves to SWEs in different ways, but it just attracts SWEs that:  (off the top of my head)\n\n* don't know the value of their talent\n* meet the companies bar, but would not be talented enough to get in to big tech companies for big pay\n* late in their career where they are financially secure to coast in a job\n\nSo this is a long way of saying, yes it's pretty common in the industry to have production ready code that is poorly designed.  I would even wager that is the expectation and not the expectation when you look at the industry at large and not a small slice like only big tech companies. \n\nI'd bet even if you went to look at some codebase at google there would be SWEs that say this is poorly designed we need to refactor.  Most of the time the refactor is now worth it and as a SWE you take it as a lesson learned for the next time you do the same or similar thing.",

I concluded it was way too complicated for what it did because it relied upon a convoluted ECS implementation to serve the frontend for no discernible reason (SPA , no server side rendering, never will need it given it's internal tooling with no need for major performance focus). I implemented a much simpler / cheaper way of hosting it as static content in S3 and ran it in parallel in dev as proof of concept.\n\nI spoke with our engineering manager who agreed it was a preferable approach and now we're integrating it to reduce architectural / build complexity.\n\nMy point being, don't just take tickets to solve the immediate problem. See if you can solve the upstream problem too. My initial ticket was some version bump needed of a dependency for security reasons but the underlying problem was that we were managing unnecessarily complex infrastructure to serve up a basic SPA frontend. I solved the version issue by just adopting a simpler deployment approach but I learnt along the way and got kudos from our engineering lead for improving a process.",

This confidence comes from several sources depending on your environment and your team/org structure:\n\n1. Knowing who knows what. At large companies with lots of knowledge silos, this is probably the most important bit. Most likely, the unfamiliar bits of the codebase is also owned by them, so if you need to make changes there, you'd have to get their buy-in anyways\n2. Knowing how to find what you're looking for - both in terms of the codebase tooling (e.g. if you guys have a bespoke code search or repo management layer) as well as a high-level idea of how things are generally organized (and this usually goes back to #1) and how to trace through the difference packages, as well as relevant documents or memos that have documented relevant design discussions and decisions\n3. Having the (un)earned confidence that things will go well - I actually think this is the most important aspect. Most of the time, it's easier to just assume that you'll find what you're looking for and not fret too much about the task.

I'd actually experimented with Motif while I was working at my first job, so I had bit of an advantage there.\n\n\nTheir code actually generated three executables and shared a header file which declared 400+ global variables -- ALL the variables used in the application, pretty much. There were multiple places where global variables were mirrored -- another variable was created that duplicated the intent of an earlier variable. I was unable to determine if this was because they forgot the other variable existed or they weren't sure they could change the variable safely because some other function might need it set to a specific value at some later point. Probably a bit of both. This meant that you'd have to find the variable that was shared between the various functions of the code you were working on right now and insure that you were changing the right mirrored variable. You'd also have to hope that those changes wouldn't break some other functionality of the application. And yes, that was every bit as bad as it sounds.\n\n\nI went in with a philosophy of never adding another global variable to the code unless it resulted in the removal of at least two others. They were unwilling to do anything major with the code and everyone in that building got laid off a bit later, before I had a chance to really get it under control. Hopefully that entire code base was simply deleted after that. That abomination should not have been allowed to continue past that point.\n\n\nI'd say I'd seen worse code over the years, but only a couple of other cases I can think of where I'd actually define the code as \"an abomination.\" All the code that I would describe as \"an abomination\" was developed by developers who clearly didn't know what they were doing in the least, because \"Global variables bad\" was something they were already teaching in college in the early and mid 80's. I wasn't in college in the early 80's, but I had books from that time.",

Most companies are only going to do what they have to legally to accommodate, and no more. Once they know you have something, there will be a target on you, since they‚Äôll know that they can always replace you with someone who doesn‚Äôt have issues. Legally it can be difficult to prove medical discrimination but it‚Äôs worth taking to a lawyer about your situation.\n\nGetting let go is not a negative reflection on you or your worth. It just means it wasn‚Äôt a good fit. It will be hard, but try to see this as an opportunity to find something that will be better for you. Good luck.¬†",

It‚Äôs a testament of faith that they have you doing that while they right their stack.\n\nContainerization, Deployment and CI/CD are valuable - these skills make full stack engineers, and prepare you to work in environments that are far better than large company software feature factory lines.\n\nHave patience, and use this time to learn things that others wouldn‚Äôt even bother investing in you to learn.

Many people build careers through certifications, strong portfolios, internships, and practical experience. What matters most is demonstrating that you can solve problems, learn quickly, and contribute.\n\nIf you enjoy programming, it‚Äôs worth thinking about ways to keep doing it without burning out. That could mean continuing your degree at a slower pace, taking a break, or focusing on building projects and internships that align with your goals. Leadership and managerial roles come later, and they often care more about results and experience than the exact degree.\n\nHonestly, there‚Äôs no perfect answer. Try weighing what will keep you motivated and learning while protecting your well-being. Even switching to a more flexible path can get you where you want without feeling trapped or behind.\n\nYou‚Äôre not ‚Äúless than‚Äù anyone without a degree, what matters is what you DO with your skills and opportunities.",

The others had kind of sketchy reviews so I thought $120 wasn't crazy.\n\n  \nI might because the interview place is in a small town that you can't even fly into. You have to fly into a nearby bigger city. For example, think flying into Atlanta to go to a small town in Alabama like Auburn (went to school there so have experience in situations like this). So I most likely will need a car to get from the airport to the hotel. They do say there's a shuttle. So I could take that, but since it's a small town I'm worried about relying on Uber/Lyft if they're scarce. They said they'd cover that too so it may add up anyway.",

I really like my new team and have come to gain their respect and trust over time. I have been performing well over my current job title for a long time now and It‚Äôs been an extremely frustrating experience all year to constantly be led on and be on this low wage honestly. I felt unmotivated and dejected at times, since I was working really hard at work to provide value etc.\n\nAnyway I was supposed to receive a promotion at the beginning of the year and have STILL not got it, it‚Äôs been getting stretched out for months on end. We are supposed to get it this month but we are now going to get an increase to 31k which is lower than what several other devs that are objectively much much worse than me are getting. All you can do is find a new job honestly, I have two final stage interviews lined up this month and will take either of them for a lot more money. TLDR: My company has been screwing me and other people over all year with our pay and now have two final interviews for a lot more pay lined up. All you can do really is go out in the market and get what you‚Äôre worth. I‚Äôve been applying so much, it‚Äôs a big time sink but worth leaving a company severely underpaying you.",

        "body": "I started out as a FE dev and became a BE dev. Now I don't even want to touch anything FE, although I'm technically full-stack I'd only write BE on my resume. Backend code is always much cleaner, simpler, and easier to debug - but it requires knowledge of certain things you don't often think about as a FE dev.\n\nHere are my 2-cents of everything you need to know to be a GOOD BE dev.\n\nFirst of all, you need a general understanding of the internet itself. How it works, and why it is the way it is. You need to know what HTTP requests are and how they work. A BE dev is not a network engineer, but you still want to know what ports are, what UDP and TCP is. All BE development establishes connections to someone or something (most often databases, but depending on the product it could be establishing connections peer to peer or in any other way)\n\nAfter that, you need to understand that backend code is not like FE code. The same design and architectural patterns don't make sense. It helps to think of BE code as a series of completely isolated scripts that a computer will be processing. It doesn't run on a client, it's not available to a client, users have no idea what that code is and they will never see it or directly interact with it. In the simplest context, think of a simple user registration form. The frontend has some inputs it captures, and then it sends it to the backend for processing. The backend then does all of the work to make that registration actually happen with those inputs - which is most often inserting rows to the database.\n\nYou need to understand and be able to work with databases, you need to be able to read and write SQL. I can't think of any BE position where the code is not interacting with a database. In many instances, that's ALL the code is doing - interacting with a database.\n\nYou need to understand and be able to manage remote servers and web servers. Familiarity with unix.\n\nSecurity is a concern in BE development for sure, but generally common sense will go a long way and people often think some kind of over-engineering is required to have something secure. Have a properly secured server, with correctly set-up file permissions, whitelists, and firewalls. Don't set anything public that shouldn't be public. Don't store files or sensitive data in weird places. Don't store sensitive data like passwords in plain text. Don't install random packages and libraries that you're not 100% confident in and have a genuine use-case for. Don't work out of a system or computer that's potentially compromised. All validation must be properly handled in the backend, what the FE does is irrelevant in terms of security. Don't have any method someone could exploit to fire off code or SQL on your system. Use services like Cloudflare to help with spam reduction and bot detection. Keep all software/packages regularly updated (including the OS the server is on), and finally keep logs of everything including errors, accesses, requests, etc. Regardless of the scale of a product or application, if all of the above are met, the product will be completely secure from a BE perspective.\n\nOverall, I'd say there is a lot more power with backend development than there is with FE. There are more job opportunities for it, and there are just more things you can do in general. The code you write is not just something to be used exclusively for a client's UI - it can be used for quite literally anything, from the world's most complex sorting and filtering algorithms to data analytics to machine learning to whatever else. Lastly, I'd say the beauty of backend code is once it's written, it's made to last forever as long as the computer running it is still on. It's not subject to the change of forever-changing things like clients, npm packages, and designs. In other words, if someone wrote the backend script for a user registration form in 1990, it would be just as valid code as one made today.",

Demand for this skill set is infrequent - most projects that involve this kind of work are usually advertising/marketing related and are typically contracted to web design agencies or freelancers in the field. On rare occasions larger companies may selectively recruit a few of these roles but career-wise I don't think it's very viable long term unless you have the right connections and can distinguish yourself with a strong portfolio.\n\nI personally think working as a regular frontend developer is a much more preferable position to be in in terms of career progression and compensation. That being said however if you're passionate about this then you should continue to pursue it inside and outside of work whenever you can - often times in your career you'll stumble upon opportune moments, so having the right skill set at the right time can definitely lead you down a desirable path!",

Your average postdoctoral researcher is earning on the lower end ~$10-20k/yr less than a CS undergrad working a run-of-the-mill product/service focused engineering gig. The gap is probably bigger for lesser known University-backed labs. Go check the finances for any of the big research shops; 501(c)(3) financials are public record. And there are a very, very small number of private sector R&D focused roles by comparison.",

        "body": "I see the \"AI is going to take over the field bro\" everywhere so I'll focus on that. Most of the people saying that won't see this anyway, but I hope it helps you.\n\nThere's so many arguments that prove that AI won't take over the field any time soon.\n\nI have tried to use AI to do my job and it's not very helpful at all. Not even much better than using google, an nowhere near help from a junior dev. No coders are losing their jobs because of AI, any layoffs or reduction in offers is because of the economic cycle (the inflation we had a while ago, that is now reduced. every time there's extra money printing from central banks that is later reduced, the economy gets bad). The \"junior devs have less jobs because of AI\" is just literal journalists saying that or youtubers etc, I don't even know.\n\nBut that's not why, because, after all, it is improving. If we don't take into account any information on what the software dev job is like, or on how AI works, then (without that info) it seems plausible that it would take over the field in a few years. However, from knowing both how AI works and what being a software dev is like, in order to take over the job it' have to be something completely different. Like some science fiction level of super AI that can do anything people can do. And knowing a bit about how AI works (not much, but much more than people saying those things), that's not going to happen soon, I don't think they can do that with a transformer neural network, no matter how powerful computers get or how much they improve on it.\n\nNot because \"someone needs to supervise the AI\" or because \"managers are bad at explaining what they want\", but because, in order to code for an application, you need to have a lot of ideas in your mind, understand a goal, and the way everything you're doing on different modules of code and different technologies contributes to it. Even junior devs. Aka you need real reasoning. Idk if you noticed but chatGPT will never tell you what is it that fundamentally matters from what you asked and should be separated from the noise, offer an actually new way to look at things, or point out something important you're missing. Because that's exactly what it can't do, as it takes going beyond just finding words to say that suit the input, and actually having thoughts behind the words. It doesn't \"hallucinate\", it lies because it doesn't even know what it means that something is true or false, and just says the truth more often because it's repeated more on its training data. And I think an AI that could do that is science fiction at this point.\n\nThe shortage of software devs (high prices in the market reflect a shortage / low offer for the demand) despite the \"learn to code\" trend is not due to any license requirements, it's a natural shortage, and is because coding can't be learned by repetition like most skills. Meanwhile, demand keeps increasing. And if the \"AI will take over bro\" dissuades people from learning, it will become a bigger shortage.\n\nI'd say go for it. Can't go wrong. AI will not take over it, not many people can do it, demand keeps increasing, and it's a very comfy job with remote work. The \"day in the life\" videos are unironically true in my experience, although some take it too far, but overall that's daily life in this job. But first see if you like coding, because that's like the main skill even if you want to do cybersecurity / machine learning. If you try to code and find that it doesn't make sense to you or you can't really learn it (many people are like that), or find it hard and don't enjoy it, I'd say don't study that.",

Honestly, Data Analysis can feel ‚Äúeasier‚Äù to break into in the short term, especially if you focus on tools like PowerBI, SQL, and Excel, because the barrier to entry is lower than mastering a full frontend stack.\n\nThat said, the demand for Data Analysts isn‚Äôt necessarily higher... it‚Äôs just different. Companies often hire fewer analysts than developers, and the pay/roles can vary a lot depending on the industry. If you enjoy analyzing data and presenting insights, it could be a smart pivot to land your first role, build experience, and then decide if you want to move toward software engineering later.\n\nAnother option is to keep targeting backend roles only, maybe small companies or internships where they don‚Äôt expect full stack knowledge. Either route can work. It really comes down to what you enjoy and what skills you want to grow.",
