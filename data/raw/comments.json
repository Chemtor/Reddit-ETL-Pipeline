I had experience on paper although over time I never really improved.  It goes without saying this was well before the advent of AI and also chemistry is a field where all of the answers aren't on Google.\n\nOne of the reasons I wasn't improving was because I didn't like the field I was in.  I didn't have passion to improve and felt like I was entitled to more than I actually deserved just because I had X years of experience on paper.  In the meanwhile, people who were much younger and less experienced came in and were smashing it purely because they had drive, passion, and a desire to improve.\n\nLost my job during the 'rona pando, attended enough interviews for a chemistry job and didn't get any offers even though I felt the interviews went well.\n\nI thought I was a great chemist who was underappreciated.  In reality, I was discovering in real time that I was a subpar, disgruntled chemist at best.  Thought I was faking my way through the interviews, getting all of the technical questions right, but in hindsight, none of it mattered because even though I knew all of the answers, there's no point hiring somebody who doesn't want to be there which is the energy I gave off subconsciously.\n\nOffering this as an alternative perspective because sometimes the answer isn't necessarily trying harder.\n\nParaphrasing although a famous MMA coach once said that there are a lot parallels between life and your style of fighting.  Loads of people in the martial arts community start trying to emulate their favourite fighters without considering that style might be unsuitable for their physiology, essentially training on \"hard mode\" by doing something they aren't designed to do instead of putting energy into discovering their own style.  Life is similar - people try and obtain success or financial freedom by copying others and wonder why they have to work so hard to achieve so little compared to the person they're trying to emulate, essentially being on hard mode by their own design.\n\nWe are all designed to do something well and it is up to us to find what that is.\n\n>How did you push through? Or did you change direction?\n\nI have always loved computers and technology.  I changed careers to DE.  Much happier now.",

You don’t want to make sure your 300 billions records are unique every time you add a new row.\n\nBut the concept of unique identifier should be introduced into almost all tables. That unique identifier is normally a surrogate key. Surrogate key are unique identifier derives from other fields. For example a md5 hash of the concatenation of 4 columns. This give you a unique identifier.\n\nWhat’s great about surrogate keys is that they are not random. You get consistency in any systems, if you migrate to another platform your surrogate keys are still valid and that’s very powerful. \n\nAlso you can reproduce the same results over and over again, which is not possible if you use a UUID generated by another system for example.\n\nThen depending on the tool you use you can validate the uniqueness of the fields yourself. \n\nThere’s some reason you might want to do this yourself and not the system like you would have in a normal db and is that because you can have multiple time the same records or a different version of what you consider the same records.\n\nSince the DW is for analytics you might want to analyze those different records which are not unique in your raw layer but could be in your marts.\n\nSo it’s a powerful thing to let you control de uniqueness of the fields yourself.\n\nObviously if you don’t manage it you’ll probably end up with a lot of duplicates. But since the DW store all your data it’s better to avoid having the constraint on inserts and give the users more flexibility. Because he might need all version for what he is trying to achieve.\n\nTLDR; yep a surrogate key should be something you have in all tables (when possible)",

(~3YoE, more in data space as a non-engineer, so view my comments through that lens however you will).\n\nTesting is a problem, yes. Especially when you work with things that are closer to ML, that have testable behaviours that only manifest when working on a huge dataset with specific patterns. This is not an intractable problem, though. You still can factor your code correctly and cover with unit tests as much as you can, and write queries for ongoing data quality monitoring (a good data analyst will be a very important ally in this activity). For more complex stuff, talk to your platform/infra/governance people about having a \"sandbox\" environment - prod data but all the sensitive parts masked. \n\nNobody understands the complexity? That sounds like your org needs more \"less technical\" people like analysts, not less. And yes, you as a DE need to be in touch with them, because they will be able to tell you what to expect of your data.\n\nPeople questioning numbers when they don't match vibes? Honestly that sounds like something a data product manager/owner has to tackle. As an engineer, all you can do is deliver data quality assurance, and point to that. After this it's with the PM/PO to sell the value of the team's work.\n\nVersion control issues? Yes, that happens when an org has a lot of DAs/DSs with more science/business background. I think the will to do git appears after one or two incidents when someone does a breaking change that nobody had a chance to review, or accidentally deletes some script on some server somewhere. If your data team is subsidary to technical leaders in the org chart, I think they're usually sympathetic to the idea, and you can go through them to push git adoption. You can also smooth things along by writing a \"git for dummies\" document for your DS/DA. No need to deep dive into advanced features, just teaching them commit/push/pull and merge requests should be enough. Do make sure your main is protected in all your repos, though.\n\nStuff outside of your control, but you have to fix it? That exists, yes, but I don't think that's unique to DE. Don't backend devs in microservice-oriented companies deal with the same problem?",

You are getting confused by marketing terms and, unfortunately, that is by design. \n\nI think you can spot me what a database is. That's pretty straight forward. A data warehouse is just a very, very large database. There are two different database areas, operational and analytic. They are characterised by the SLAs you have on the data. Smaller databases are normally used for operational because you need fast response times. In analytic, the response times aren't normally as critical but they handle quite a bit more data; much of it historic. In a perfect world, if you could do both with the same system, you would. The problem is the cost to do them all in one. Of course, these are gross oversimplifications but it gets the idea across. In addition to the database component, the surrounding data ecosystems are different but they have many commonalities.\n\nData Lake and Lakehouse are both marketing BS. Nothing more. The same is true of \"medalion architecture.\" It is an attemp to make the standard three tier (staging, core, semantic) into to something different by giving it a new coat of paint. Someone noticed that you can store quite a bit of extra \"stuff\" in the staging layer beyond what the database needs. Of course, the marketing folks thought that needed a new name. I think we are at the point now where we just keep adding buzzwords to the names. It's like a technical pin the tail on the donkey. The latest is \"now with more AI!.\" \n\nA data ecosystem is a complicated enough of an endeavor without all the confusion that is being pushed on it purposefully. I haven't even started in on Inmon, Kimball, Stars, Snowflakes, the various normal forms, ETL/ELT, etc. Good luck on your journey.",

But they don’t replace hands-on work. So the best learning path combines both: read to understand the concepts, then build mini-projects to apply them. For example, try building a pipeline that pulls data from a public API, stores it in a cloud bucket or local database, and runs some transformation on a schedule. \n\nWe have a lot of interactive courses, so feel free to check out our site and browse! \n\nAnd finally, don’t get overwhelmed by the tool soup.

Spent a year there until a big reorganization occurred. We moved to the cloud, data science became its own thing, a data engineering team got stood up. I initially moved with data science, but it was clear my skills did not mesh well except for the data engineering, but they wanted to move all DE work over to the DE team eventually. I took that opportunity after just over a year in that position. \n\nOn day 1 with the DE team, we were building stop gap solutions. I spent that time getting really good with pyspark. I already had a large background with pandas, so pyspark was very easy to figure out. From there, we had consultants build our long term data platform while the full timers worked on ad hoc requests to keep the business moving and start making a name for our team. During this time, I learned I was really good at programming business logic and transformations. I was not nearly as good at ingestion or tools outside of databricks. \n\nEventually our SAAS integration started, and I was working directly with consultants. I was well out of my depth, but I learned the process pretty quickly, patched some early holes in my technical knowledge, and got rolling. \n\nI learned that I was really good at functional programming, but pretty bad at DevOps and way out of my league in OOP. \n\nNow, I'm working on a project to rebuild our data platform to one easier to maintain, more flexible, and moves data faster. I'm focusing more on architecture, but making sure that these new consultants are training my team and me every step of the way. My manager assigned me as lead for this project. \n\nMy manager wants me to train to become an engineering architect. Whereas I'm a decent engineer with a lot of potential to grow there, I am kinda a natural on all things architectural. So that is how I'm leaning now.",

As with all dev work there's a fair amount of \"it depends\" to be had in any situation, but I can't see where this level of normalization would ever be useful inside a data warehouse.\n\nI think people pursuing this behavior have lost sight of the \"why.\" The Star Schema model was originally created during an age with storage was the scarce resource so it was important never to store duplicate data. Nowadays, storage is so cheap it's practically free so it's compute that we must optimize for. Having to do dozens of `join`s to gain context on every record certainly doesn't support that. \n\nUsually, I practice some form of what you might call \"Star Schema Light\" in the silver layer where I create tables around business entities. So all the 'user' dimensions would be in one table (and it would probably have a companion SCD table), all the 'session' dimensions in another etc. Then these can be  `join`d and de-normalized in gold to expose to BI tools as needed while analysts can still have some flexibility by using the silver tables. \n\nHaving said all that, be careful. Myself and two colleagues were recently fired for suggesting this very thing and pointing out we shouldn't administer Snowflake like one would on-prem Oracle.",

That's how transactional databases are supposed to be. A star schema is a denormalized schema (it breaks the rules of normalization, 3NF).\n\nYour use case doesn't look very \"star schema\" to me as many to many relationships should be rare. Another way to reword this is that the UserTag entity is a fact table. You could add a date / calendar dimension to this fact and this would allow you to see how many users one tag have, which users have which tags... It also depends on how \"fast\" these tags are attributed. Could they be considered an attribute to the fact? It is hard to decide without having a closer look at your use case and the data.\n\nRegarding the surrogate keys. You don't need them on all dimensions. You need them on SCD2 dimensions, and not all dimensions need to be SCD2. You also need SK when combining data from different sources into one single dimension, and they don't have a common key.\n\nRegarding the project... 20 people working on one single star schema, 2 years. That's insane. Do you work in insurance? It sounds like something massively overengineered which goes against the premises of dimensional modeling: easy to query.",

Assuming your whole team is fundamentally competent, the frequent late nights suggest someone is promising too much and/or failing to manage expectations. The bad news is that can happen anywhere. But if it's the norm, then it's probably time to move on and parlay the recognizable name into a better role.\n\nYou can definitely find consulting companies that take quality of work more seriously. I don't know how to vet them besides just talking to people in similar roles. When you do, ask about the sales process, the role of vendor partnerships (this can almost singlehandedly determine your technical focus!), how they go about scoping, how satisfied clients generally seem, etc. If you get engineers to answer those questions, that will shed a lot of light on the kind of environment you might be stepping into (which is tightly linked to the kinds of clients your sales and marketing people are able to reach).\n\n(Edited to add: If those discussions make it sound like that firm is bent on pitching solely AI everything these days...huge red flag. Obviously I'm speaking from my own biases here, but IMHO it's a recipe for perpetual scope change at best, and completely unrealistic expectations at worst. Too many un-serious people selling to other un-serious people who are spending still other un-serious people's money for no clear reason. Naturally, YMMV.)\n\nBy way of background, my data career has been solely in consulting. It's been about 10 years at a couple of relatively small firms (in the 100–200-person range) so I don't know what things are like at much larger ones. I have worked in-house before but in a very a different field. Overall, I'm satisfied with my career path, but it has its drawbacks, especially if technical learning is your *top* priority.\n\nThere have been long periods where my technical skills stagnated. Once I've reached a certain degree of experience with our bread-and-butter projects, most of the work is on the business logic and requirements side, not the technical side, since I've probably done it a dozen times before.\n\nObviously I'm always keeping up with developments from vendors we typically use (and what's new from others to some extent)...but it's not like I'm frequently taking on entirely new kinds of projects. That's not a bad thing in my book! All those less- or non-technical skills are extremely important. What's more, even if selling the same solution repeatedly isn't the most technically exciting, it's one way to keep increasing your effective hourly rate.\n\nGranted, my favorite clients have been smaller ones (like a few hundred staff members or less) who need all kinds of random data things solved. Sometimes that does require unfamiliar technologies, which are often equal parts fun and frustrating at the same time. But those more open-ended projects, where I'm sort of the \"data guy\" on call, are inherently less specialized, and often less lucrative as a result.",

Are you going to write a new pipeline to do that, or edit the existing one and re-run on the same input data?\n\nAnother example I didn't see mentioned is data size. Your pipeline might be written such that it extracts a delta of changes in the input db table and writes them to the output. This is because just copying the whole table every day is too expensive, and the changes are expected to be small, so could instead use a smaller machine. Now what do you do if the processing logic changes?\n\nOf course there are solutions to write a pipeline such that it handles both entire data and deltas, but those solutions always depend on the specifics of the input. It's often much easier (faster) to have a 2nd pipeline for full reloads, configured for a bigger machine, etc.",

But it works more or less the same as those hackthon coding test, it is also easy to cheat, even the question is a well crafted one, as long as the candidate has a very close friend who is a good developer. (Yes we do see cheating in this kind of coding test, basically, the hundsband help the wife). But for hiring a senoir or even intermediate dev, this is ridiculous. All employed seniors have tons of work to do,  no one will spend more than 4 hours on this kind of test, especially, there will be hours of interveiw coming up potentially. Also we will be careful to not helping the hiring company solving their problem. Thus it is more difficult for us to finish an assignment (I assume you will give serious difficult take home assignment in this scenario) without helping the hiring company to solve their problem. I would say, if you are a junior dev, take it, learn the new knowledge, if you are a intermediate to senior dev, just pass by, don't spend time on it. Meaningless, the one who review you result might be even less experience than you and give a false judgement and decide to not move forward with you.",

        "body": "Alright, this post can make good use of additional clarity.\n\n\n- Is primary_hash just a fancy way to say ID?\n\n- I hope you understand the implication of hashing, because in this context it is a trap, and you’re jumping right into it. First, order sensitivity: {a:1, b:2} and {b:2, a:1} can spit out different hashes depending on your algorithm—hope you’re normalizing inputs. Second, collisions: no hash is truly unique, so your primary_hash or payload_hash could, in theory, screw you over with duplicates. Third, compute cost: hashing big payloads (especially JSON blobs) chews up CPU. For large datasets, you’re burning cycles when a simpler key or checksum could do the job. Also, good luck debugging when someone tweaks the algorithm. Do stick to lightweight identifiers or deterministic keys unless you’re solving world hunger.\n\n- Your source system just yeets full or incremental loads at random? You're really telling us is just a coin flip? Scour their docs for a pattern—there’s got to be one. If it’s truly a coin flip, build a check (like record count or metadata flags) to detect load type. Then branch your logic: full load = overwrite or merge, incremental = append or upsert. A simple if-statement saves you from nuking 95% of your data.\n\n- Why the urge to slap a boolean is_current on everything? Your UPSERT logic already yells “this row’s alive!\". Regarding your last_loaded_ts: you just called it business_ts few words before!\n\n- Detecting deletions always come down to one of two. Check if the source emits delete events (docs, again). If not, periodically poll for IDs and just IDs. Another news: although a row is being deleted from the source system, it's not mandatory you have to delete it as well: just flag it (aka soft deletion). Overall, if you can ingest incrementally and poll for just IDs, you are saving money and drastically simplify the process.\n\n- Data retention: S3 (or Fabric’s storage) is dirt cheap for raw data and time travel queries (i.e., SELECT * FROM table VERSION AS OF '2025-01-01') have been invented in the 90s. If storage costs creep up, archive old partitions to cheaper tiers like S3 Glacier. Keep Silver/Gold lean for business logic and aggregates—don’t make them history dumps. Set a retention policy (e.g., 1 year hot, archive the rest) to balance auditability and your wallet.",

        "body": "one of the classic medallion architecture pain points! The delete logic with incremental loads is a nightmare we see all the time.\n\n**For the incremental vs full load problem:** Your boolean flag approach is on the right track. What works for us is having a `load_type` field (FULL/INCREMENTAL) alongside `is_current` and `last_seen_ts`. For incremental loads, we only update records that actually appear in the batch - never delete based on absence.\n\nThe trick is tracking what constitutes a \"complete picture\" at the source level. We usually maintain a separate metadata table that tracks when each source last did a full refresh, so we know our baseline.\n\n**Storage and history management:** Bronze is the wrong place for long term history imo. We keep maybe 30-90 days in Bronze for reprocessing, then archive to cheaper storage. The real historical tracking happens in Silver where you can be more selective about what actually needs versioning.\n\nFor cost control, consider:\n\n* Partition by load date so you can easily drop old data\n* Use Delta's time travel for short term history, separate archive for long term\n* Not everything needs full history - focus on business critical entities\n\n**Quick pattern that works:**\n\n* Bronze: Current state + recent changes (30-90 days)\n* Silver: SCD Type 2 for entities that need history\n* Archive layer: Compressed parquet in cold storage for compliance\n\na reference of 3 tier architecture: Bronze, Silver, Gold layers: [https://cdn-cednl.nitrocdn.com/ZIEpBLjPiSWpOcIdsSTlIdzcQJzKTmWw/assets/images/optimized/rev-21cfb01/www.datatobiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Azure-Medallion-Architecture.png](https://cdn-cednl.nitrocdn.com/ZIEpBLjPiSWpOcIdsSTlIdzcQJzKTmWw/assets/images/optimized/rev-21cfb01/www.datatobiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Azure-Medallion-Architecture.png)\n\nWhat kind of data volumes are you dealing with?

More important here when uncovering risks is getting a diverse set of perspectives as it just makes a stronger argument to have you, SWE, and DevOps bring forth risks and expected extended timelines to handle them.\n\nOnce you have these well researched requirements, you then \"Iterate\" by going back to that initial champion who thought it's \"easy.\" You say something along the lines of \"I walked through the idea from a data perspective, as well as brought in XYZ teams. There is definitely excitement, but we uncovered a couple areas that I would love your feedback on in respect to tradeoffs.\" Here's the key, YOU DON'T DIRECTLY TELL THE CHAMPION WHAT TO DO (all caps because it's that important). Instead you provide them with a series of three paths forward with various tradeoffs for speed, robustness, and technical debt. You then let the champion decide AND OWN THE DECISION.\n\nCongrats, you have now turned into a partner for this champion who is not only enabling their idea, but also looking out for them to make sure mitigate any risks!\n\nThe next steps are \"Build\" and \"Evangelize\" but I won't go into those as they are outside the scope of your original question.",

Based on what I've understood so far, this is definitely at least a few weeks of work for my team, because we'll first need to crank the wotsit then analyse the doohickey, before we can build the XYZ itself.\n\nIf applicable, you also need to make the distinction clear between how long _once the project starts_, and the lead time _before you can start the project_. How you do that depends how projects/work items are prioritised at your place, but make sure to set expectations that the work isn't going to start right away, unless of course it can. \n\n**If you do this well, after enough repetitions, the \"easy\" people will learn more about how things work and probably won't say it any more.**\n\n### footnote\n\n(1) Honest doesn't mean as low as possible. Include padding for uncertainties, include time needed for adequate testing, documentation, etc. Honesty does include communicating the error bars on the estimate; I like Uncle Bob's approach of providing three estimates, a worst-case, best-case, and likely middle-ground. Honesty also means not being more precise than justified: eg \"a few weeks\" is better than \"3 weeks\" if you don't have enough information to be really sure it's 3 weeks.",

Some code-heavy DEs might be able to to it, but most of us are using SQL or dbt or something like that. Traditional software testing does not work for us. We have to think differently. \n\nThat pedantic message aside, we can take the concept of unit tests and apply to data engineering. We need three things. \n\n1. Known input state (What data are we reading)\n2. Work (Query, task, function, something that transforms data)\n3. Know expected output state\n\nDbt and SQLMesh do this with their own concept of unit tests. I'm sure other platforms have their own solutions. If you want to roll your own it is fairly simple in theory.... \n\n1. Create known data that shows the characteristics of what you want to test.\n2. Run the portion of your pipeline that you want to test.\n3. Compare the output to the expected output. If it matches you are good. \n\nThis is not that hard in small pipelines, but very difficult to maintain in big pipelines. Imagine a SaaS company with 10 subscription plans and negotiated contracts.

This makes it easy to write unit tests where you pass mock inputs into transform functions and compare output to expectation. From there you just get better at breaking down these transform functions to make it easier to write unit tests for. You can also write your runtime data validations as functions in the same way and write unit tests for those to make sure they catch bad data.\n\nThis separation of transform code and connecting/reading/writing code makes it easier to abstract and consolidate the latter and write integration tests for those.\n\nSo in your hypothetical “process_data_to_silver.py”, assuming that’s an etl task will likely not need much unit tests of its own. It’s simply importing a dataset processing function, passing it inputs, and then publishing the output. You’ll be confident it’s processing and validating as expected because the function itself is covered.",

One technical project manager I worked with was pursuing one, but he left before he finished it.\n\nThe reality is CFA is an extremely difficult certification, each level has a sub 50% pass rate and the only reason you should pursue one is if you want to become a person who professionally is allowed to give investment advice or directly manage a portfolio.\n\nThe technical problems we solve don’t require that intimate knowledge of investment vehicles and financial planning, so anyone hiring for technical positions would far value technical aptitude over whatever CFA would bring to the table. Even people who worked closer to the business side (product management, business systems analysis) didn’t have CFAs. Some management did, C levels definitely had it, except for technical C-suite who held PhDs instead.\n\nImo spend your time on something else, and working at a place like that is really not as difficult as you expect, but your best path in would be going to a good school, doing well, interviewing well and living nearby. And I really found the work soul draining, you work to make rich people richer and have to wear a tie every day. People there drink heavily after work too.

A lot of folks in data look to deepen their finance knowledge, but the CFA might not be the most direct route if your goal is to stay in data engineering.\n\nCFA is a serious time and energy investment. It’s incredibly valuable if you’re aiming to become a portfolio manager or financial analyst who makes investment decisions—but for a data engineer, the overlap is limited.   \n  \nMost technical roles at places like Citi, JPMorgan, or Bain don’t require or expect a CFA. What they *do* value is domain familiarity: understanding how financial data works, how to build pipelines for it, and how to surface insights that support the business.\n\nA more practical route might be building out your finance knowledge in parallel with your engineering work. Things like:\n\n* Learning how to wrangle financial data (from market feeds, statements, or transactions)\n* Building dashboards for KPIs like revenue, risk, or portfolio performance\n* Working with time-series forecasting or valuation models\n\nThere’s strong demand for data engineers with finance context—it’s just more about hands-on skills than credentials. If you're interested, we’ve got some finance-focused tracks that lean technical: Python for Finance, Financial Modeling in Excel, and Financial Analysis in Power BI. They can give you the right foundation without going all-in on CFA.\n\nThat said, if you’re considering a career shift toward investment roles or product strategy, the CFA might be worth it—but it’s rarely a game-changer on the engineering side.",

The goal here is to make sure you accomplish something, have a defined finish line and don't just resell them back the same used car they were driving with a new coat of paint.\n\n1. Make sure there is total agreement as to WHY you are doing this. You need this before you use any brain cells on the technical or tools side of the house. This needs to be in writing and preferably signed off by all stakeholders. None of these reasons will be technical. They will all be business oriented. This step needs to be very well documented and agreed on. Don't let anyone push you to rush this one. I usually take 3-4 weeks for this. Sometimes it takes longer. These are all of your project success criteria. Why was a decision to replicate what you already have made? The longest path to anywhere is a shortcut.\n\n2. Now that you have that, figure out WHAT they don't have that they need. Every single one of these needs to tie back to a WHY. If it doesn't tie back to one, discard it or update the WHYs and get sign off again. I'm talking reports, dashboards, messaging, etc. Do not start coding yet. This is also where to start to identify if you have the data to achieve these items. Don't limit yourself to the current state of affairs. I cannot emphasize how important it is to tie these back to WHY items. \"Because we've always had them\" is not a reason.  Validate existing data products to see if they are sufficient or even needed. This is where you start to clean house on all the crap that data warehouses collect.  \nThis stage will also start to get you thinking about the relationships between the types of data. Not a data model, but a bit higher than that in conception.\n\nNothing up to now has been technical but these are by far the most important parts of the projects. It will be very tempting to jump into the weeds, don't do it. Your post already suggests you are starting at the wrong place.\n\n3. Now you can start to design the data warehouse. I would start with the data model. Figure out what type of model you need. Don't take what is already there unless it can be heavily justified. An operational data store is not the same as a data warehouse. You don't get too many opportunities to do this in any one company.   \nThrow away all of those marketing terms. They won't help you.  \nA traditional three tier DW has never steered me wrong. Activities, like data cleansing and data standardization, tend to happen as you move the data from one tier to the next. Stage is used for landing data. I tend to make my core in 3NF and any data products (stars, materialized views, etc.) in the semantic layer. You do not need to have everything built out before you start using it but do have as much as possible planned out and written down. \n\nGenerate regular deliverables to the business and be able to show how they address the business needs you identified in step one. If they can't be tied back, ask yourself why you are building them. This is a VERY high description of how you refactor or initially design a data warehouse. It may seem overwhelming but just break it down into chunks and always be thinking about the future. These things stay around a long time.",

Get your view definitions under version control on GitHub then use GitHub actions to push them to postgres when you make updates. If performance starts to become an issue, then look into an orchestrator as you might need to start materialising these into actual tables.\n\n- make sure your view definitions are under version control. Look into dbt to make this easier to manage.\n\n- on data viz, sure you can use tableau but I personally have found it a bit clunky when I've used it in the past and it can get very expensive. Recently started using Sigma computing - less pretty dashboards but I think way easier to use. But honestly if you use one of the usual suspects (Tableau, Power BI etc) management can't really blame you. I don't really know anything about Kibana but if that's working for you why reinvent?\n\n- on natural language querying - your job on this is to NOT implement anything and find a diplomatic way of telling management it's a bad idea. If they insist you try it, look at setting up AI agents where you can constrain their behavior to running queries you predefine, and prompt it to say 'i don't know' if non technical users stray out of those guardrails. I know the Google genai and openai APIs both have functionality to do this kind of workflow.\n\nGood luck",

Down the line some new usecases will require cross-client insights, some new developments will benefit all the customers at once, and you'll thank yourself.\n\nIn terms of the architecture, it sounds like SQL-only stuff might not fit the bill here. I would suggest:\n- land the data in your dwh somehow\n- run transformations in SQL as much as possible, go with python where needed.\n- stay off of Spark, I don't see any benefit here for you, it is a complicated piece of software that is not even modern at this point.\n\nFor individual pieces, you can either go bit by bit, e.g. one tool for ingestion, another for transformation, orchestration, etc. There are quite a lot of good alternatives, e.g. Fivetran + dbt + airflow. I suggest taking a look at [ingestr](https://github.com/bruin-data/ingestr) for ingestion stuff.\n\n[Bruin CLI](https://github.com/bruin-data/bruin) could also fit the bill here since it is like dbt, but does ingestion, transformation with SQL and Python, orchestration, quality, and governance. It is open-source, you can run it anywhere you'd like.\n\nHit me up if you'd like to chat, sounds like an interesting problem you are tackling. Good luck!",

Developer/Team/Enterprise are all tiers within dbt Cloud, and yes, the semantic layer for PowerBI is Cloud-only. Fusion is a feature within the Cloud product.\n\nHere's the thing though: we were on the Teams plan and everything was fine until we hit 8+ people. Then dbt Sales basically forced us into Enterprise tier. The initial quote? $300/seat/month on a 3-year contract. Even after heavy negotiation we only got it down to $220/seat/month.\n\nFor context, that's $26,400/year for 10 people, which feels pretty steep for what's essentially a task scheduler running on top of open-source dbt.\n\nIf you're just getting started with the engineering side, I'd honestly suggest sticking with dbt Core + your own orchestration (Airflow, GitHub Actions, whatever). The semantic layer is nice, but probably not worth $20-30k/year for a small team. You could build your own metrics layer or look at alternatives for way less.\n\nJust something to keep in mind as your team grows. The jump from Teams to Enterprise pricing is brutal.",

There is supposed to be both a free cli version (registration required but no cost) and the premium version through the cloud or premium cli.  \n\nYes semantic models are gated behind the premium license.  They also are sort of limited in that you can't build a full model with multiple tables, each semantic model is 1:1 with a dbt model, which is one table or view.  If you use an obt data structure then you are good.  If you have a star schema or something like that that you want to represent semantically then it doesn't work.  We wanted to to do a PBI on top of dbt thing too, but ultimately just built a big model in PBI because it did what we needed it to.  There are a few other options out there right now like Cube and Snowflake just released a few options if you use that platform.

Our tech is oversaturated with buzzwords and abbreviations for no good reason.\n\nSo I've read the article and I find it very interesting. I agree with many points, especially about idempotency. And I also have a few questions:\n\n1. From my experience, layered data platforms aren't made only for the sake of business. Materializing intermediate datasets with pieces of business logic can be necessary to maintain good cost/performance ratio. Especially when the data is big, and your ETL system can only handle data increments in a timely manner. At the same time, proper naming convention and an appropriate architecture (Kimball, DV) makes the data easier to navigate. Does this align with your vision, and if not, why is your way of doing things better? Or is it?\n\n2. Implement all transformations as pure functions - it makes me think you're advocating for ETL process instead of ELT (aka using compute engines like Spark for data transformations). I make this assumption, because implementing pure transformations using sql is much more tricky, and people with expertise in sql, but no expertise in OOP may struggle to do it consistently. Even tools like DBT require careful model design to achieve real idempotency. With this in mind, don't you think having all transformations as pure functions is too costly?",

We do create intermediate tables.   Sometimes, with QA results, we just store intermediate transforms (we do almost all work in SQL).  We tend not to keep those intermediate tables around unless necessary. The key idea is that a single end-to-end process governs the flow from raw data to final output. That’s the critical point. While this process may technically generate multiple intermediate layers, each additional customer-exposed layer incurs overhead in terms of time, governance, documentation, and support questions. And they are rarely used.   So the real question becomes: why maintain extra layers at all?  \n2.  We mostly do SQL, with occasional Python when we have to ingest some strange format.  It's mostly ELT.  So are all our functions pure?   No. We tend to group code together to perform tasks such as creating a dimension. If we create intermediate tables, we clean them up immediately at the end (and the start, checking to see if they are already present before deleting them).  So it 'pure' without using SQL language, supported but replaced with a culture and code review.  I think that tribal knowledge without language support makes it more challenging.",

At the column level you can use Cortext to generate descriptions of every column on a table in one swoop (which our power users love).    Similarly, there is a nearby UI to generate the name/value pairs known as \"Metadata Tags\" such as \"Requestor\", \"Owner\" (or whatever object tags your business deems necessary).    Under the hood, Snowsight is using ALTER TABLE to create and alter these descriptions and tags which means that the user-at-hand needs a role with OWNERSHIP of the involved objects. However, passing around OWNERSHIP privs is very challenging and frightening to us.   Frankly, I'm surprised Snowflake created these slick UIs without bothering to create a new, safer METADATA\\_MANAGEMENT role to go along with them.",

The analysis was spot on, and included a note that what the framework implements an exclusion rather than inclusion rule.

If the schema changes or more columns are available, *as I remember it* you get a warning/error, that something has changed in your profiling. Not the actual change I think. But again, not sure.\n\nAs for point 4, it generates a report that you manually have to click on and open. Actually quite nice overview in the automatically generated reports with stats on all your metadata in your profiling. It is annoying that you have log in to a different system to see them, but you can extract the metadata through the API if you want to collect it in your regular data warehouse and do your own reports.\n\nBut it is expensive.

Talking about your example, I would split them up, keeping one change per changeset. Also, createTable and createIndex should not be considered a single operation. It is very common to create indexes sometime after the table is created. e.g.. Create the table, ingest the data, then create the indexes.\n\n2. Again, I would not keep them in the same changeset. Having the CREATE OR REPLACE clause helps make the change idempotent, but the function and the trigger are still two different objects.\n\n3. I believe in this case, you should add a rollback for the trigger.\n\nAgain, as I mentioned earlier, I don't have experience with Liquibase, and I'm aware that following the guidelines strictly can make everything more laborious, so please take it with a grain of salt. I don't think you should be so strict if you are creating the database from scratch, for example. In that case, I would develop changesets to create multiple foreign keys and indexes, for example.

For example, Warp is benefiting greatly from the OS caching disk data:  \n\\- Cold reads (from disk) hit around 5GB/s  \n\\- Warm reads (from cached pages) can hit 200GB/s+\n\nCurious how large you're thinking? If a single column fits within memory (say <32 GB) this should run extremely well on repeat queries on similar data (eg when a dashboard is loaded). The data used so far is \\~100GB per example (individual columns are a fraction of this).\n\nIt's not designed for truly massive datasets (> TBs) yet, that'd require NVME raids and/or distributed nodes. I've tried to keep it small so it's cheap to run (I suspect a lot of cloud users are paying more than they need to for their small/mid data sizes). However, def keen to learn more about what real users expect!",

I suggest reading some database literature; definitely room for innovation and quality of implementation improvements, but no need to reinvent all the theory. \n\nAnd there's different philosophies of design (\"in memory\" or not, distributed or not, etc, etc).\nSome (many) algorithms degrade poorly when the amount of data is larger than the system's available memory. It's not just about the size of data; it's also about whether there's a performance cliff (or a point where you outright start failing).\n\nYou're not wrong, a single machine can do a lot. One of my colleagues posted this recently: https://datamonkeysite.com/2025/07/21/does-a-single-node-python-notebook-scale/\nSingle nodes have gotten very powerful. But then again, smalk workloads don't always stay small. Having room to grow is good too, as is not having it be \"works on my machine\".\nI work on a distributed, autoscaling OLAP database engine (Fabric Warehouse) that's capable of efficient single node execution, or scale out, depending on what the query needs. So I'm not necessarily convinced one really has to choose between small scale efficiency and being capable of going distributed. But at the same time, you've already got a huge project on your hands as it is. \n\nIt's a very interesting space, with lots of hard problems and competition. Good luck!",

There were arguments to be made for separate - the data volume of these use cases is lower than our analytical workloads, and so Azure Functions/Logic Apps could be sufficient. However, then we would need to use a non-Databricks orchestrator, which would be a bit annoying for some of the multi-step operational workflows. Doing it in Databricks meant that all of our data jobs live in one place and are orchestrated through one set of tools, regardless of whether they’re operational or analytical in nature. Databricks Asset Bundles have been great for us in this regard, in terms of allowing us to define our job configurations as code. \n\nOnce we got past that, we came back to the medallion. We landed the operational data in its own schema in our bronze catalog, but rather than moving it to “silver”, we created an operations catalog that serves as the use-case layer for all of these operational pipelines. They’re still sourced from bronze, and in the future, we might source analytical “silver” tables from either the bronze or operational catalogs, but this approach has been working well for us.\n\nWe leverage Databricks secrets (backed by Azure Key Vault) for all of our connection secrets, and give our service principals READ access to the scope in each environment. We have also modularized our code for SFTP/FTP into a helper library so we don’t have to maintain the same logic in each pipeline. We try to stick to asynchronous patterns for our downstream writes (e.g. we drop off a file somewhere and some downstream system picks it up), but if we had to, we could also make a direct API connection and write our data that way. We just haven’t really had to do that for our use cases thus far.",

By passing a few secrets to our helper class, the helper handles the rest and supports both key and credential-based auth. It saves us from having to write the same 30-40 lines of code in each pipeline, since we can instantiate our connection object with a single line of code. Our class also has prebuilt functions for getting/putting a file, checking a hash of a file against a previous version, and a few other operations we have found helpful.",

Cheap storage lets you keep whole history for replay.\n\nEach night run a compact job with Spark or any lake engine. It reads yesterday’s tiny files, writes a handful of big Parquet or Delta files, then deletes the fragments. Big files mean faster scans and less metadata load. Create a lake table on top of those compact files and partition by the field you filter most, usually `check_in_date`. Too many partitions slow things instead of helping.\n\nFlatten and enrich data in a second pass, then load it into a serving database like Postgres and put indexes on hotel\\_id, date, guests. The lake stays the single source of truth, the SQL db is only for fast API reads. If something breaks you just replay from the raw JSON folder and rebuild everything.

So if I'm at a point that I want to productionize my prototype the codebase is mostly ready. \n\nTwo other points would be metadata. I almost always want to record when the record was fetched, as the time series makes it easier to observe patterns or know when a job wasn't performing correctly so I can disregard it's responses. Like maybe the hotel returns cheaper prices for future reservations on Mondays than on Saturdays. Or if my request was made with an apple device identifier vs a windows one. \n\nLastly performing any updates to data is easier in a DB. Plucking attributes from inside the json to it's own column for filtering/indexing is simple. Or while processing each new batch of data I can perform a ranking to generate an SCD2 type table of differences with lags can help reduce storage over time (ie have a record for each change rather than a record for every request). \n\nI generally never use sqlite anymore and use duckdb as I like it's datatypes more. I mentioned sqlite as I think more people have heard of it.",

If you can, well placed prints/logs/LED blinks can do the same thing though (bonus for not changing what your code does other than side effects or timing)\n\nAnd really, 500 lines of code should probably be broken up into smaller routines so you shouldn't have to tackle it all at once, anyways.\n\n> 2.

What you do is make a list of tasks. If you can't think of how to solve the task, you split it up again. If you can't solve the individual parts, you split those up again. And again.\n\nYou wanted a way to 'describe it in English', and this is possible. You distill the core of the problem by focusing on what you want to do and the nouns in the problem description. You must first clearly state your problem. For example:\n\n- Problem: \"I want to know how often a word appears in an array of words and write this to the screen.\"\n\nDistill the core:\n- array of words\n- count how often\n- word\n- write to screen\n\nTo do this, I need:\n- An array of words (so I must define this).\n- A way to keep count (so I must define some data structure for this).\n- A way to look at each word in the array. (Thus I need a loop to pass by each word in the array.)\n- A way to decide if I already counted the word before (if yes: increase counter; else add word and set counter to 1)\n- To Write the result to the screen\n\nSimple code (pseudo; language is not important yet):\n```\ndefine array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana]\ndefine keep_count = object\n\nfor every word in array_of_words {\n\tdecide if you counted the word before\n}\n\nprint_result(keep_count)\n```\n\nNow you have the array of words, and a way to keep count. The thing you didn't work out yet was \"decide if you counted a word before\", so that's what you do next:\n\n```\nif word is in keep_count {\n\tincrease counter for word by 1\n} else {\n\tadd word and set counter to 1\n}\n```\n\nSo now you put that solution into the previous block of code:\n\n```\ndefine array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana];\ndefine keep_count = object\n\nfor every word in array_of_words {\n\tif word is in keep_count {\n\t\tincrease counter for word by 1\n\t} else {\n\t\tadd word and set counter to 1\n\t}\n}\n\nprint_result(keep_count)\n```\n\nThen refine it a bit:\n\n```\ndefine array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana];\ndefine keep_count = object\n\nfor every word in array_of_words {\n\tif word is in keep_count {\n\t\tkeep_count for word: increase by 1\n\t} else {\n\t\tkeep_count add word: set to 1\n\t}\n}\n\nprint_result(keep_count)\n```\n\n\nAnd you're done. You've written your program. Now you only need to translate it into the language you are using. A large part of the starting year of a computer science education is actually learning to do this, starting with small things like this and increasing the scope of the problems you're solving. Alongside this you'd learn about often-used data structures and algorithms.\n\nRepeat this again and again for years and years on end and you'll get good at it.\n\nThis is a skill that can be learned, but not in \"Javascript bootcamp\". The above is programming; \"javascript bootcamp\" is writing code in Javascript. That's trivial compared to actually thinking up the solution.\n\nYou always start with a problem, which you'll break down in smaller and smaller parts (where each part can be a function, which is also broken down into smaller parts), and in the end you'll be left with a (very long) list of tasks to do.",

Making use of tools that are magnifiers are really only going to help experienced software engineers. You can’t amplify nothing and expect that to go well. College assignments are designed to be bite sized and have rails. We design them so most students can figure it out and learn. Of course AI can do an ok job at those. Your classmates are losing the chance to learn how to learn and believe me, look at what tech looked like in 2005 and see if you don’t agree that the one skill you need to get in college more than any other is learning how to learn things on your own so you can adapt. If you are so dependent on a tool, that you cannot do anything without it, and you cannot problem solve or think for yourself, then why is someone going to hire you. What value do you bring.

        "body": "If AI can write code, it can run a company.\n\nIf there's ever a point where you lose your engineering job to AI, everyone in almost every industry that touches a computer will.\n\nCurrently AI writes dog shit code and the people that love it write dog shit code.\n\nThe issue with the job market right now is that the economy is absolutely fucked and particularly the CS industry. A lot of venture capital dried up post covid and the value of the american dollar was cut in half almost overnight.\n\nThere's also billions if not trillions in AI startups that haven't even turned a real profit yet. That money invested in AI isn't going into proven tech like solar, wind, electric cars that are a future trillion dollar industry.\n\nSo it's really convenient for large companies (like amazon, meta, and microsoft who all have gigantic investments in AI) to say they layed off 20k employees because \"AI could do their job.\" If that's true, show me a video of AI doing all the coding and customer service. I don't believe it.\n\nThese companies are probably tightening their belts in a bad economy, pinning it on how awesome their AI investment is doing, framing it as profit and saving money, boosting their stock price. And when interest rates on loans go down, they can hire everyone back.\n\nA lot of these companies were also \"benching\" people. Hiring top talent employees just so that they don't go build a competitor product.\n\nRealistically they probably laid off a ton of benched talent and other people they didn't need. The economy is awful so it will be harder for them to find a job. There's less access to capital so they probably won't be able to find investors. They can blame it on AI, watch their stock price shoot up. Save a ton of money on paying humans, and make their minimum corporate loan payments.\n\nMeanwhile your classmates are drinking the AI kool aid that startups have been pumping out for decades.\n\nIf an LLM can code better than a fresh graduate, there will be no reason to hire young computer scientists. I doubt your friends are thinking this far in advance.\n\nThat said, there are tons of papers on how LLMs and ML are close to the limit on how effective they can be. I think all large AI companies summed together are taking about 1 Great Britains worth of power to run. That's an insane amount of energy. Elon is using coal to power Grok which is mind blowingly stupid. It's causing health problems in the surrounding community near his data centers.\n\nI think every time you want a significant improvement you need an order of magnitude training data increase, as in add another 0. 1b > 10b > 100b > 1t. One trillion is 1 thousand billions. It's not just a big number. It's a number so big that there may arguably not be enough data to train it at a certain point.\n\nWhen AI trains on data that AI generated it fucks itself and starts outputting shit. This is a theory as to why so many giant LLMs like claude and chatgpt are getting worse. One reason might be that the nicer version is behind a paywall, but the other is that these llms might be consuming so much AI generated text that it's degrading them permanently and there's no real way to separate human from AI generated content on a platform that has billions of users.\n\nYou may actually get to watch an entire industry enshittify in under 5 years, which is pretty cool IMO. It might be a once in a lifetime event.\n\nAdvances tend to be S curved in the sense that you logarithmically increase a plateau of improvement, and then you get a material advance in conditions or approaches that allow you to exponentially increase towards another limit. Vaclav Smil's book on growth is basically like reading the back of a screwdriver but it's great at illustrating this point. It's almost a law of progress given enough resources.\n\nRealistically AI will increase, but it's largest limitation is energy consumption and training data requirements. These two things are kind of inherent in ML from what I understand and a lot of what people are doing to improve ML is incrementally improving it.\n\nMy theory is that there will be a new AI paradigm that will be cheaper and require less input. Remember your brain can pitch a baseball, play chopin, cook a 5 star dinner, drive a racecar, and fuck elons mom and it only runs on the amount of power it takes to run a lightbulb.\n\nMy recommendation would be to recognize that your friends are idiots, the hype is a smokescreen, and to just get good at coding and pass your classes. You will more than likely struggle more than your peers in school. As the problems get harder, you will struggle less and they will struggle more. And when it comes time to get a job you will be extremely rare in that you can actually code and your peers cannot. It will probably be easier for you to get a job.",

This is all very valuable.\n\n\\> What can I actually *do* with these skills? Is there any career path that values competitive programming? Or should I just start from scratch with web dev like everyone else?\n\nWell, new flash for you. There are essentially no applications out there that are not fundamentally web applications. Today anything that is user facing is either a mobile app, a game, or a webapp. Every other kind of development are essentially in support of application developers. Why do we make operating systems? So that we can make applications to run on them! Why do we make databases? So that we can make applications better. Why do we make AI models? So that we can use them in applications.\n\nSo should you learn webdev. Yes, you absolutely should. Because most applications will be web apps. Now you don't necessarily need to be extremely good at it. Especially if you are going to work in more inner layers of computing. But no one will take you seriously if you don't seem like you can cobble up some application up.\n\nI personally never really do front end work. I hate it. But the easiest way to share what you do is to set it up as a webserver of some kind. I tend to focus on the back end pieces where most of the interesting computation happens.\n\nWhat should you do? Where should you go? I don't know. It depends on what YOU want to do. But it seems to me that you want to solve deeper problems than making a cute applications. And good for you, I hate that shit too. How are you going to get a ob, well, you are going to need to find  company that does this kind of work. You need to figure out what you care about and what you want to do.\n\nThere are plenty of database companies. There is plenty of work in server administration, cloud, and infrastructure. There are plenty of needs in AI, model, development, optimization. There are plenty of jobs in various kind of data mining. We still need compiler people. I had a student hired to write kernel modules. There are a lot of \"systems jobs\".\n\nTo qualify for them, you need good system understanding.

But you probably have a high paying job by then so jokes not on you if you can keep it. \n\nNow companies that aren’t at that level giving out Leetcode style interviews, fuck them. Ask me about my day and give the job to your ceos third cousin and be down with it.",

There are many ways to do things. If you try to learn everything, you'll have a shallow grasp of things - pick a stack you like, even if it isn't the most popular, and learn the heck out of it by building apps, from the basic up to the advanced.",

        "body": ">Is there any career path that values competitive programming?\n\nNo, competitive programming teaches you how to write unreadable and unmaintainable code in a very small context. \n\nCompetitive programmings only benefit is learning how to write algorithms in the most efficient way possible which is great, but when you've got a team of 5-10 other developers working on the same code base, the last thing you want is your code to be difficult and hard to understand. In 90% of the jobs out, saving 10ms of execution time isn't a goal (unless your in trading software for example).\n\nI'd much rather have someone who writes clear, understandable code and help them understand performance than the other way around.\n\n>I don’t even know where to use the problem-solving and coding skills I built up\n\nThe reason why is the problem solving skills you learned are not the problems you face in the real world. You figured out how to write some algorithm in the fastest execution time possible and out in day to day life people are writing integrations to make 2 systems talk to each other, aggregating data from 3 different databases into one export, building API's with infrastructure that scales based on user load.\n\n>Or should I just start from scratch with web dev like everyone else?\n\nYes, its what is in demand and jobs are looking for. You are more than welcome to say \"well i don't want to learn web dev\" and attempt to land jobs on old stacks no ones taking (like winforms) but if you limit yourself to just c/c++ your options become even smaller (game dev, embedded dev...etc) as a new grad.\n\nThere are backend, front end and full stack roles. Look at whats in demand near you but i imagine you'll see more full stack/backend than just dedicated front end roles these days (At least i do in my area).\n\n>Anyone else been through this? How did you figure it out?\n\nIf you enjoy programming and building stuff, you should stick with it and learn a more marketable skill within the domain. Meaning, look at pluralsight, udemy for courses that peak your interest or seek out a mentor in your area or online to help guide you towards a path that will result in a career.",

        "body": "I've tutored coding for almost 10 years (both as main job and as side gig). Here's some of the things I found from students who were in similar situations (1 hour a week schedules).\n\nI saw a comment below that said to teach them ABOUT the world of programming and computing, rather than actual programming, and I think that is the way to go given the constraints. That being said, here are some opinions/advice for IF you have to go through the programming route:\n\n\\- Language Choice: Don't use Unity if they aren't going to be doing things on their own time. I tried with a student once, who specifically asked for it. The result was that nothing got done, and nothing was learned because there isn't enough time to understand concepts without homework / self learning. Sure, he could memorize some scripts, and make something move, but at that point, is that really programming? I eventually convinced him to move to Python.\n\n\\- I would center my approach around the concept of \"how computers work and how to think systematically\". If you make the content of the class enjoyable, and make the learning fun/interesting, then they will want to do more on their own time. Instead of making a curriculum around \"how much can I get them to learn in this time frame?\" (As other users have said, that is no where near enough time), make it be \"How do I get them to learn a few cool stuff and develop an interest in wanting to learn more?\n\n\\- The above point is why I would pick something like python, or even html/css/javascript (yes, 2/3rds of those aren't \"programming\" languages). The reason being the lower hurdle of entry to getting something they can make working, and they can see they made. I used to believe that if someone wanted to learn properly, start them in C. Nowadays, my viewpoint has changed to \"Start them in python so you can hook their interest with a lower bar of entry, and THEN dump them into a language like C#/Unity/Language of choice once they understand the basic concepts and are interested in the next steps\". Heck, if they are interested in AI, staying in python is great.\n\n\\- You said you tried before and it was too confusing for them. I don't know how you explained it, but I'm going to give 2 extreme scenarios as an example. Look at this from a students point of view. \n\n  \\- Scenario 1: You go to class, you need to either learn what int main(int argc, char \\*argv\\[\\]) means, or be told to memorize and learn it later. The former means needing to learn functions, args, arrays, return types, and more. The latter is encouraging not critical thinking. After that, you do printf(\"Hello World\");. Then you need to learn what compiling is, and how to run the program. All that for Hello world.\n\n  \\- Scenario 2: you go to class, you type print(\"Hello World\"), and it shows up on your screen the line below. You made something. Your teacher can now introduce concepts one at a time, each with you making something. For example, maybe you introduce variables next, and create a Hello, name. Then functions, and create a print\\_spam. So on. Since I was tutoring, I was able to tailor projects to each student's interests (Instead of random number generator, I can do random kpop member or something), but for a classroom, it should be more generic, and maybe more open ended as a project.\n\n\\- Going to say this point again: with so little time, The best curriculum in my opinion is one that gets them interested and learning how to think critically, rather than one that dumps as much info as possible that they may or may not retain.",

You can always learn what you need to about other areas on the job, but if you decide you like front end stuff, dive into it and do it strategically. Maybe ask an AI what front end frameworks are in the highest demand right now… pick one, like react, and learn it well. \n\nThe sooner you can start contributing something to a team, the better.

For example:\n\n    put(stderr, \"x = \");\n    put(stderr, x);\n    put(stderr, \"\\n\");\n\n> The type of the argument determines which \"put function\" will be invoked for each argument. However, this is too verbose. The C++ solution, using an output stream for which `<<` has been defined as a \"put to\" operator, looks like this:\n\n    cerr << \"x = \" << x << \"\\n\";\n\n> [...] The idea of providing an output operator rather than a named output function was suggested by Doug McIlroy by analogy with the I/O redirection operators in the UNIX shell (`>`, `>>`, `|`, etc.). This requires operators that return their left-hand operand for use by further operations.\n\nSo basically, the stream operators exist to allow a convenient and concise way to output multiple values.\n\nIn modern C++ you could accomplish the same goal with a variable-argument function using templates, but early versions of C++ didn't have the advanced template features needed to make that work.",

The function that you pass to Promise constructor (executor) is running on the same UI thread so you don't do anything computationally heavy there, instead you can use Web Workers to emulate browser apis off ui thread code execution. While scripts are loading they're parsed but they only execute when the script is fully loaded and parsed, so heavy scripts would delay the web site users from being able to interact with the web page elements.  \nIf you want to reference elements in a web page via JavaScript you need to make sure that the <body> is fully loaded, otherwise you will get an error that you can't get elements by that id or class etc. You can also put the <script></script> at the end of the <body> so that when JavaScript will be executed it will know for sure that the body content is loaded. relative url references that you pass to (\"fetch\" for example) aren't relative to the JavaScript file itself but by the html page that loaded that script.  \nThere's primitive types (numbers, bools, strings etc) and object types { } (Dictionary with special abilities)\n\nLearn the old way to make classes first, with function as a class constructor, function.prototype as a prototype object.

I’ve also been using Codefinity, and I totally agree it’s a solid platform for beginners, especially if you're starting from scratch or looking for a structured way to learn Python and other programming skills. What I appreciate most is that it's very hands-on. You can write and test your code in-browser without needing to install anything, which makes it super convenient for people who don’t want to mess around with IDEs right away.\n\nIn terms of beginner-friendly platforms, Codefinity definitely ranks up there. The lessons are bite-sized, which helps with consistency and reduces the feeling of being overwhelmed. I also found the AI assistant to be surprisingly helpful. It’s great for quick explanations when you're stuck or just need something reworded. That kind of interactive support is something a lot of other platforms don’t offer, especially not at this level of integration.\n\nHowever, the pricing model is a bit of a downside. Like you mentioned, it’s not very transparent upfront. You get into the lessons and then suddenly find out about a subscription. I think they could do better there. And yes, some of the early Python lessons are very basic, which might not be ideal for those with prior experience. But if you push through the first few modules, the content does become more challenging and engaging.\n\nWhat I’d love to see from Codefinity is more intermediate and project-based learning paths especially for things like data analysis, web development with Python, or real-world app building. That would make the platform not just a good starting point but a long-term learning tool too.\n\nFor anyone searching for a Codefinity review, wondering if Codefinity is good for beginners, or looking for online platforms to learn Python, I’d say give it a shot just go in knowing the pros and cons. It’s especially helpful for people who like learning through doing, rather than watching endless tutorial videos.",

I’ve been testing out Codefinity myself, and I think it’s a pretty underrated option for learning to code especially for anyone starting out with Python or just dipping their toes into programming. If you're searching for an honest Codefinity review, here’s my take:\n\n✅ **What I liked**:\n\n* The platform is clean and beginner-friendly. No need to install any software—you can code right in your browser, which saves a ton of setup time.\n* The course structure is well-paced. Lessons are short, interactive, and easy to digest without feeling overwhelming.\n* The built-in AI assistant is a nice touch. It’s not perfect, but when I got stuck or needed something explained in simpler terms, it actually helped me move forward instead of getting discouraged.\n\n🔍 **Things to be aware of**:\n\n* As others have mentioned, the pricing model isn’t super transparent. You’ll probably get into the learning groove and then be hit with a subscription prompt, which can be frustrating.\n* The early lessons might feel *too* simple if you already know the basics. It starts very slow, but it does pick up and get more practical.\n\n🎯 **Why I’m using Codefinity**:\n\nMy goal is to learn Python for data analysis and later move into web development. I’ve tried platforms like Codecademy and Udemy in the past, but Codefinity has been the one that’s helped me stick with a routine. The gamified elements and instant feedback really help with motivation.\n\nOverall, if you're searching for the best platform to learn Python for beginners or wondering is Codefinity worth it, I’d say yes with a few caveats. It’s great for building foundational skills, but you may eventually need to supplement it with more project-based or advanced content from elsewhere.\n\nCurious to hear what others think have you used Codefinity for longer than a few months? Did it help you move into real-world projects or jobs? Are there better alternatives for learning Python step by step?\n\nLet’s make this a helpful thread for anyone researching Codefinity reviews or trying to choose the right coding platform in 2025.",

It's a normal human behavior to want to only focus on what you enjoy with creative hobby.\n\nThe reality is at some point in your life you're going to need to make money. You probably can't sustain your hobby forever, just doing whatever you want. Think of it like playing video games, sure you can say \"I only want to do what I find fun\" and sit in your room and play games all day. You can also sit in your room and program side projects all day. At some point you have to face reality, and find a way to make money and have some kind of success in your life. This is usually painful - a job you get programming will rarely be the same kind programming you enjoy doing as a hobby. When you get a programming job, your job isn't to make aimless side projects, it's to solve problems for the business using your skillset.\n\nProgramming is a specialized skill and having a degree helps get your foot in the door, and many companies require one. I know it's painful / annoying / stressful / frustrating right now, but that's irrelevant. Dropping your major now would be short sighted and impulsive.\n\nLast thought is your priorities might change laster in life. You might what to buy a house, car, something expensive, start a family, or support someone, or have some life event that forces a larger amount of responsibility on you. Finishing your degree helps future proof your ability to make income and might make that time easier when it comes.",

Heads up, this is probably going to sound more like I'm trying to give you therapy than anything else.\n\n**Step 1:** Validate yourself. *It is totally normal to struggle learning this*. It's a hard fucking topic, half the resources online are dogshit, and significantly more than half the people you meet online trying to talk about it are probably going to call you dumb and/or lazy. You're not. You're allowed to struggle, and in time you'll come to learn that failure is positive; but I full appreciate that it doesn't look that way right now.\n\nI'm a senior dev and data scientist. I've dropped out of multiple degrees. There are some leaderboards on leetcode-esque sites where I'm in the top 100 in the entire world. Sometimes I make mistakes that a child would laugh at.\n\nThe struggle is just part of the journey, and comprehension will come with practice and time.\n\n**Step 2:** When your mind is settled and ready to be curious/compassionate, think back to that feeling of \"my brain automatically tells me that I don’t understand what’s going on\" - what's *actually* going on there?\n\nWhat's going on is your brain throwing up barriers; an anxiety response, not necessarily a cognitive one. \"It's better to stop trying than to risk failure\", or something along those lines. I bet you do know a bit about programming. I bet you could tell me what a variable is, how to make one, probably what a function is, and so on. Remind yourself of the things you *do* understand and try to connect them to what you're currently struggling with.\n\nWe beat anxiety by breaking things down into tiny little pieces until they seem surmountable. We win by starting very very simple, and going very very slow, if we have to. Every time you don't understand something, every time that \"I don't get it\" response pops up, *stop struggling*. Tend to it. Take a breath. Talk it through with yourself - break it down into the smallest, silliest subproblem you can. Address just that one tiny subproblem. Didn't work? Break it down even further. Take a break the moment you feel like you're making negative progress, because that is a real threat in these kinds of situations.\n\n**Step 3:** The real outcome we're looking for here is a mindset change, because (as much as it sucks) coming up against frustrating or overwhelming problems is just a part of doing programming. It's tempting to think \"how do I avoid this?\" but it's more productive to instead think \"how do I process this and learn from it?\" - because it is gonna keep happening.\n\nWhen your brain wants to say \"I don't get it\", try to reframe: you don't understand *yet,* you're still in the process of learning. What tool can I use to get past this obstacle? How have I managed these situations before? Am I hammering my forehead against a wall here; and if so, can I change strategy rather than getting more upset it isn't working?",

Learn the wrong way to do things too, it'll help you figure out the right way to do things. Write shitty spaghetti code. You'll improve over time.\n\nTry something simple like building a number guessing game. Add features to it: make it so you can select a difficulty which sets how wide the range of numbers are. Implement a limited number of guesses. Etc etc.\n\nTake what you learned from that and do something more complicated. Try making a shopkeeper for a fake rpg game. Add items to buy. Make them have descriptions, and a cost. Give yourself an inventory. Give yourself a wallet. Make it so you can list items in the shop. Buy said items. Maybe use CLI-style commands to buy the items. Make it so you can buy multiple at once. Add ways to earn money. Make them more complicated. Eventually turn it into a playable CLI game.\n\nThere's just so many ways to learn how to code that are better than staring at tutorials all day. Learn how to think like a coder first. When you have all these requirements/constraints, sit down and think about how you might write code to make it happen. Look up how to actually do that thing you need. For the guessing game, clearly you need a random number, lets say between 1 and 10. Look up how to generate a number between 1 and 10 and store it. Look up how to get user input. Look up how to compare values. Look up how to let a player guess again if they are wrong (aka how to loop). Etc. Figuring it out yourself is ALWAYS better than following a tutorial.",

It shows you're not giving up, and that's a mindset you must keep if you really want to become a programmer - especially a good one.\n\nIn general, experience > degree. I'm not a CS graduate myself - I actually studied chemistry - but I've still found my dream job writing code. It's absolutely possible.\n\nBecoming a good programmer is so much more than just hitting keys and shipping code. You'll need to accept the endless grind. In the beginning, everything feels exciting and kind of easy. Then reality hits. And honestly? There's barely any course out there that truly teaches you how to think like a developer - the pattern recognition, the problem-solving mindset, the \"sixth sense\" for asking the right questions.\n\nThat said, not studying at all is a bad idea. You don't want to end up without direction or skills that can support you. But studying doesn't have to mean going to university. I'm from Germany, and here many young people start paid trainee/apprenticeship programs for around 3 years to learn a profession. Maybe something like that exists where you are too?\n\nIf university isn't an option for you - especially if it's expensive or forces you into debt for something you're not passionate about - then yeah, don't rush into it. It could become a trap.\n\nGiven your situation, there's no guaranteed path. But if I were you, I'd try to find a mentor - even if it costs money. Good guidance can save you a lot of wasted time and effort.\n\nAlso: besides programming and avoiding university in your city, what else interests you? Maybe you can find some creative crossover - tech isn't just web apps and games. There's a lot of space to combine different passions.\n\nWhatever you decide, don't just think about the next year. Think in decades. It's your life - build something that lasts.",

No. They could just give you array construction and indexing and leave writing methods like map(), reduce(), join(), forEach(), find(), and so on up to each programmer.

Spending an afternoon learning how to use your IDE's debugger will save you hundreds of hours later.\n* Trace the execution path systematically - step through your code in the order it actually runs, not just how you think it should run. Use the debugger's \"step over/into\" functions or add print statements to follow the flow and catch where logic diverges from your expectations.\n* Use 'Rubber duck debugging': explain your code line by line to someone (or a rubber duck). You'll often catch the issue while explaining.\n\nDebugging - like programming - is systematic. Don't approach it like guesswork, but like a detective or scientist: observe the symptoms, form hypotheses, test them one by one, and let the evidence guide you to the root cause.",

You open the hood of the car, and start randomly doing stuff, hoping the problem will go away.\n\nDo you think that's a solid approach to fixing the car? Would a real mechanic do that? No, they would try to figure out what the problem is. Of course, being experienced, they have a series of tests they can do to isolate the problem and the confirm it is the problem, and they have an idea how to solve the problem.\n\nIn a way, you need to do the same. Randomly changing your code is not going to fix it just like randomly doing stuff to a car engine won't fix it. You need to understand your code.\n\nBecause I've taught beginners, I've seen this \"I do random stuff and hope to fix it\" before. Why do beginners try this approach even as they would admit, it won't likely work.\n\nIt's because the code looks daunting. If I say, tell me what each line of code does, one step at a time. Be the computer. Do each step. To a beginner, that seems like crazy slow. It would take forever to do that (even though they wrote the code). Random fixes is a lot quicker. Do something rather than do the right thing which is slow and tedious.\n\nOK, so some steps.\n\n**Determine why you think your program is broken**\n\nI've had students who tell me their program doesn't work. When I press them, and ask \"what's wrong\", they just say it doesn't work.\n\nWhat they really need to say is, \"I think this is wrong because when I put in value X, I get answer Y, when I expect Z\". Those three parts are key. What input (X) did you use? What answer (Y) did you get? And what answer did you expect (Z)? \n\nThis is the first step to debugging. Why do you think it's wrong?\n\n**Try a smaller input**\n\nThe next step is to put in the smallest input that causes the problem. Sometimes, we'd give students some sample inputs that were pretty lengthy. Their code would break, but it was hard for them to figure what was going on because the input was so lengthy, they didn't know what part was causing the problem (imagine the input is an array of numbers).\n\nThe first step is to see if it can handle the smallest input possible (say, an array with one element).\n\n**Test your functions**\n\nA smaller version is to test functions. Determine\n\n* what are the input parameters\n* given certain input values, what are the output values\n\n**Write more small functions**\n\nInstead of writing one big `main()`, break things up into small functions. Then, you can test each function.\n\nWrite a comment for each function and give some sample inputs and expected outputs for that function.\n\n**Test as you go along**\n\nDon't write all the code with no testing, then test after you wrote all that code. This won't help if the code is already written, but can help in future coding.",

I figure that at this point, people will look at the work I've done and what I can do, because I've had a decade to produce things, but perhaps if I hadn't made anything yet, it'd be much more helpful to indicate I had a vague idea of what I was doing at least.\n\nSome members of my family like that I have it for some reason, but personally, if I could go back, I wouldn't bother.

        "body": "You have to remember that these terms and design patterns were formed during programming's adolescence. At the time these words were coined, Fortran and COBOL were the dominant programming languages, and they were extremely barebones compared to the modern versions of those languages. It's hard to fathom just how much we take for granted with modern programming languages today.\n\nIn terms of encapsulation, folks were mostly just proposing what we now think of as modules or classes. Basically, the idea boils down to creating public facing APIs that do not expose their inner variables. I like [this source](https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/1-object-orientation/01-objects/02-encapsulation/) which quotes from some of the originators of OOP-- Dave Parnas and Alan Kay. \n\n> Parnas and his peers pushed for not just hiding the data, but also how the data was manipulated. By hiding these implementation details, they could prevent programmers who were used to the globally accessible variables of early programming languages from looking into our code and using a variable that we might change in the future.\n\nBarbara Liskov is another big name in the OOP world, and [she covers encapsulation in this fantastic paper](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/barbara-liskov/data-abstraction-and-hierarchy.pdf)\n\n> For abstraction to work, implementations must be encapsulated. If an implementation is encapsulated, then no other module can depend on its implementation details. Encapsulation guarantees that modules can be implemented and reimplemented independently; it is related to the principle of “information hiding” advocated by Parnas [15].\n\nThose three formed the basis of all modern OOP concepts. They are the definitive sources. I think much of the confusion comes from the second wave of folks who implemented the popular languages and who each definitely went their own way. Because their languages are so popular, their opinions are almost equally valid despite the fact that they all disagree with each other on minor things.\n\n- Bjarne Stroustrup\n- James Gosling\n- Brad Cox\n- Bertrand Meyer\n\nAs a side note, when discussing design patterns, there are a few definitive sources:\n\n- [Design Patterns](https://www.javier8a.com/itc/bd1/articulo.pdf) by the Gang of Four\n- Pattern Oriented Software Architecture, most notably volumes [one](https://daneshjavaji.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sznikak_jegyzet_pattern-oriented-sa_vol1.pdf) and [two](https://archive.org/details/patternorienteds0000unse_u5t3)\n- [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZoranLi/Books1/master/Patterns%20of%20Enterprise%20Application%20Architecture.pdf)\n\nHowever, most of those were written over twenty years ago, so [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/) is a good resource for putting these concepts into a modern context.",

I haven't really heard about people extracting data and editing the code though, just playing the games with the ROMs..\n\nIn some cases, it sounds like you can save (AKA \"dump\") game cartridge ROMs directly on a console and save them to an SD card.  For instance, for a Nintendo 3DS, I found [this guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide/dumping-titles-and-game-cartridges.html).  For older systems,\n\nTo look at the code though, you could use a disassembler and load the ROM into it - but it would only show you the assembly language instructions; you can't extract the original higher level code (i.e., C) from that.  Reading assembly code and understanding what it's trying to do takes significant effort, as it's about as low-level as you can get.  And if you want to make changes, you'd modify the instructions and re-assemble it (it doesn't get re-compiled like a higher-level language does).",

I know it's cliche and it's difficult to find projects to make, try and build things that are just html css and JS  \n\\- Learn what a library is. Learn NPM. Install a few libraries and play around with them\n\nOnce you get to that point you can start looking at objects - requests - async stuff. Contact me then and I can help you with that.\n\nBest of luck. You can do this.",

I don't want to say things aren't bad - they are - but things are **always** bad in one way or another. Tech-related jobs have been in constant flux for at least decades, Your aim should be to make yourself as employable as possible **even as** the world changes around you, which it will continue to do. The best way to do that is to avoid jumping on bandwagons and to learn the solid skills necessary to adapt. You are already doing that with your engineering degree.\n\n>Should I start learning Python just to keep up with everyone?\n\nYou should start learning Python if you're interested in it, and not if you're not. Python is a great tool. But also, not everyone will be a Python dev in the future, and **not** learning Python frees up valuable time for you to do something else. (You can also learn Python later if you want to. What's stopping you picking it up at age 50 if you need to?)\n\n>Any advice or roadmap would mean a lot right now.\n\nMy advice is: everyone's roadmap looks different. Yes, you should work hard - but whether that means \"get a paid job\" or \"aim to get a high grade\" or \"learn Python\" or \"learn French\" or \"brush up on your maths\" or \"do some volunteering\" or \"learn interview skills\" or one of a million other things depends on you. All of those things are good, and different employers will value different skills, and no one person can do them all.\n\nYou also shouldn't forget about the rest of your life - family, friends, relationships, hobbies, rest, eating well, sleeping well, etc. No point in being the most skilled engineer in your company if you burn out at age 30, or have a heart attack at 40, or regret not starting a family at 50, or whatever.\n\nIt's a lot to juggle.

There'll always be somebody who knows more/more successful/earn more etc. Just focus on yourself.\n\nDon't force yourself to learn python just beacuase other so it. It won't be good, I mean you will probably find that boring and it will just discourage you.\n\n\n\nAnd to answer your question:  \nI remember long-long time ago as one of my first project I created a calculator in html+js. It was interesting to see something in a browser which was actually running. Then I wanted to know more. One project which I still don't know after like 20 years how I was able to pull of was a keylogger on Windows. I learned a LOT about C/C++ and Windows internal calls, how to \"hide\" it in the background etc. I still have that code. (I might have used it on a school computer and might have got myself a social media invitation for a long-gone site.)\n\nJust try to do something for yourself, it will give you motivation and when you finish you'll feel accomplishment.",

Add stuff, if it breaks, oh well, start over, delete the whole loop and write it again and start testing new stuff out.

To me the hardest thing in my program was understanding the \"thought\" process behind solving problems with code. A great way to practice this for me was actually playing the game Human Resource Machine on Steam. It forces you to \"think\" and \"problem solve\" in a way that is really beneficial to coding.

The computer doesn't really care about how many variables you use.\n\nIt is much more tricky to write code other humans can understand. This doesn't really matter in this toy problem, but becomes quite important in larger or longer-term projects.\n\nFor humans, giving names to things matters. It can be worth pulling outoart of a computation and assigning it to a variable *just to give it a name*. In this sense, variable names and function names serve a similar purpose to comments, but names are easier to keep up to date as the code evolves.\n\nHere is how I as a very experienced programmer would refactor that code if this were a production problem (untested):\n\n    import re\n    import sys\n\n    EMOTICONS_TO_EMOJIS = {\n        \":)\": \"🙂\",\n        \":(\": \"🙁\",\n    }\n\n    EMOTICONS_PATTERN = re.compile(\"|\".join(re.escape(e) for e in EMOTICONS_TO_EMOJIS)\n\n    def _emojify(text: str) -> str:\n        # see https://stackoverflow.com/a/2400577\n        return EMOTICONS_PATTERN.sub(\n            lambda m: EMOTICONS_TO_EMOJIS[m[0]],\n            text,\n        )\n\n    def main():\n        for line in sys.stdin:\n            print(_emojify(line))\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n\nThere are a couple of fundamental differences that you might find distracting – using a replacement table instead of `str.replace()`, or transforming all input instead of prompting for a single line. The regex related stuff is a fixed pattern for applying multiple replacements to the same string.\n\nBut for the purpose of this discussion important observations are:\n\n* I think `_emojify()` is a better name than `convert()`. Converting *what*?\n* I decided against introducing additional local variables. They don't seem to add anything. In particular, naming a value just to immediately return it doesn't tend to provide much useful information to readers.\n* No comments like \"get input\". Comments are useful for providing information that's not visible in the code. If an `input()` function is called, I can already see that we're obtaining input. The thing that would benefit from a more detailed comment in my version would be the regex stuff, as this is highly non-obvious for people who don't already know this pattern. Unfortunately, this pattern has no name, but it has a canonical Stack Overflow answer.",

In a larger function body, you might have loops etc., and you can negligently change a name that elsewhere you've been assuming represents its original value.

Their greatness was born in the gym with repetition.  Find a process that works for you and hammer it in with repetition.

Now, it depends greatly on what your project is, but in a typical project there's just a few scenarios where you'd use recursion. The fundamental one is when you're working with a hierarchical data, especially with arbitrary number of levels (so a tree topography basically). This can happen with stuff like tables (where row can have sub-rows) or file system.\n\nI would personally try implementing a flattening function (i.e. turning a list structure where there's a few top level elements to begin with, but each can have some children, of which each can have some children..) and the output should be a flat list of elements (flat list of all parents and all children, of all levels). When you're done you can move on and you'll probably forget about recursion for a long time. Also, keep in mind that most conventional (i.e. not purely functional, like Haskell) languages are not necessarily built to deal with recursion natively, and using recursion can cause stack overflow (due to every call being put on stack, instead of simplified/ignored, like a language natively supporting tail-call recursion would).

I have written code and felt \"that's not working\" (from a \"I'm happy with this\" point of view) and then either refactored it or rewritten it. Sometimes you have to write code that doesn't work to point you to the code that does. You get better at your initial stabs as you gain experience. But that is a crucial part of software development - you will often face having to choose from a number of different possible ways to do things, and having more experience helps to whittle down the possibilities. But it takes time to gain the experience, and making mistakes is part of it.\n\nAnd sometimes, the different possibilities don't really favor one over the other. Or which one you choose is dependent on the context more than the specifics of the code itself. There are no simplistic answers.\n\nIn terms of recursion, I rarely use it. There are problems that are naturally recursive, and then there are those you could try to force recursion onto. But it rarely makes sense in the latter case, especially if you run the risk of blowing up your stack when the problem gets too large.\n\nWith recursion, each time you recurse, you get a new context. Every time you make a call into the function, that function has a new \"environment\" that can differ from the caller's one. Recursion really works well when each of those contexts is different, and you need to return to a previous context at some point - and if you weren't using recursion, you'd have to track the state yourself, often as a queue or manual stack.\n\nTraversing a tree, for example, is a good case for recursion, since as you're processing the children, you need to remember where you were, so that you can go back up when you reach a leaf. A recursive solution handles that for you automatically, as exiting the function takes you back to the previous context. The recursive process automatically tracks the different transitions down and back up the tree.\n\nIn the case you have above, though, where you're just building a list, you don't gain much from recursion over iteration, as you don't really have anything to \"remember\" at each step. The context changes, but you're not really *coming back* to anything after that can't be handled by simple variables (no stack necessary).\n\nI'd say: hang in there and keep working through problems. It will get easier, as you'll develop instincts for when to apply different techniques. And the best way to know which techniques to use is by having tried the wrong ones - making mistake. It's part of the process, so don't be afraid of goofing things up. Right now, writing software is your own sandbox. Experiment. Play. See what works and what doesn't. Fortunately, there's no harm in smashing a sand castle design that didn't work out and trying a different one.",

I can relate to your feelings about feeling a bit lost and frustrated from my own time leaning but I can assure you that if you keep studying to build an understanding you will keep improving. Right now you're stuck with all these separate pieces of a puzzle and you're finding it hard to see how they all fit. At times you will manage to fit some together and as you connect more pieces it will get easier and easier to find new connections. Focus on the fundamentals and try to have some sort of own project at the side that you can tinker with on your own when you feel like it.\n\nMy own experience - I found it hard when I had gotten my degree to structure and design code. Like you I felt frustrated and a bit lost. We had very briefly talked about the concept of Clean Code during one of the courses without going in-depth at all so I ordered and read the book. I found it to be extremely helpful and taught me structure and a bunch of common patterns and idioms when writing code in a very straightforward and helpful manner.\n\nLastly - if there was something that I wish the school had focused more on to prepare me and my fellow students for the real world, I'd wish we'd gotten more time to work with how online services talk with each other, what protocols do they use, how is information exchanged, request/response etc, as well as how you work with web/appservers etc. It was all very hand waved and the only server we had to setup was a light-weight Firebird local server to host our SQL-dbs.\n\nSo, personal opinion - focus on learning the programming fundamentals, read Clean Code, and check out how apps communicate with each other and get som practice doing that. Good luck!",

I know plenty of people in the field who did CS and SWE, and similar. It's barely a specialisation really. You will most probably discover that Software Engineering and Cloud Computing undergrad degrees share some kind of \"common first year\" with straight Computer Science degrees and about 10 other \"degree pathways\" at your university, to ensure everyone has the basic knowledge required to move on. After that period, at the beginning of each year, you'll get asked to choose some modules in addition to the core modules totalling the credits for the year. This is the \"specialisation\" aspect. Different degree pathways are just different module choices each subsequent year, which is why many universities allow you to switch between degrees before you get to modules that are only available on certain pathways (essentially change your degree title and pick other modules).\n\nWhether or not you will be ahead or behind your peers depends not solely on your degree pathway, but also on how well the *contents* (what you study) aligns with what you would like to do for work. You don't mention this (even though it should be the biggest factor in your decision) but assuming you want to be a Software Engineer, neither CS nor SWE will give you a large advantage over the other, and the module choices available are likely to be very similar. I've never personally met a Software Engineer with a Cloud Computing degree, but this doesn't mean much, as much of the content is likely to be very relevant.\n\nYou won't save any time, they're the same length. Feel free to skip any work experience years if you're confident in your ability to land a job. Use your best judgement.\n\nNote also that employers rarely care deeply about the exact degree title. \"Computer Science or similar relevant degree\" is common to see on job ads. They do often (not always) care that you get a 2:1/2:2 or above. Nobody regards 3rd well. I'll add from personal experience that I've had certain professional opportunities that were only open to people with 1st at undergrad, a full decade *after* getting the degree. You don't know what the future holds so make the most of it. I'm glad I did and richer for it. If you look at how your university calculates your final classification there's often an alternative formula that counts your first year marks (they award you the best mark using all formulas typically), so don't believe any nonsense like \"first year doesn't count\" etc. It might, depending on specifics.\n\nEdit to add: **A-levels are not 'instead of' a degree.** **No employer is going to pay much attention to your A-levels alone, and having an undergrad degree is preferred but not a hard requirement, to directly answer the title question.** You just need to take the A-levels that meet the requirements for university courses you're looking at. The requirements are listed on their sites. They usually either don't care about specific subjects, or list one subject they require you to have studied at A-level, possibly with grade requirements.",

I'm selling it for low prices, and if you are interested (I am a teen web dev and could use any support I can get to improve my courses), I would really appreciate it.

And if its the latter, consider thinking about what are you really curious and passionate about. \n\nI spent 7 years studying law and 6 years working with it. It's always been easy for me, I got highest grades in school just by reading a paper 30 minutes before I needed to talk about. Never had my notes with me, it was laying clear in my head, always ready. But law is something you need to be passionate about, always digging and thinking about it, even at home. I on the other hand spent 6 years clocking out at 6pm and it left my brain until the next morning. Everyone thought I was a beast, always coming to me for the advice. I did in couple hours something that other's struggled with for several days. Everyone said I was soon to be a big deal. I was bored out of my mind. And when the opportunity presented itself, I left everything and never looked back. Because the thought about changing career was far less scary than the thought that I have to do this for the rest of my life. \n\nNow I'm getting ready for my first job in tech. People telling me I'm pretty good too. Because you can get good at anything if you put your mind to it. But this time I'm actually curious and digging. And never bored.",

I don't have a desire to learn something without a purpose. If I am not going to use it, it's likely that it won't be a good use of time as the knowledge will likely erode over time unless it's used.\n\nSo I guess I would say that if you're looking to expand your knowledge, put yourself in a position where you need to learn something to do your job if that's your goal. That being said, if you're happy being very efficient at your job even if you're not growing your knowledge then that's ok too. It depends where your job is in your list of priorities. If you go this route though, you might want to occasionally, learn something new to see whether you're still capable of learning something pretty easily.",

I will emphasize that at this level you will definitely feel underwater. you still get that sometimes especially when using brand new things, but for example if I make something with plain java and standard libraries I will NOT be feeling like that even in an ambitious project\n\n\nunlike what some comments are suggesting, there's no avoiding this and you simply have to push through ",

Who know, maybe even real API keys that found their way into the codebase somehow.\n\nThat means, that we should still know fundamentals. Not sure what you meant by low-level stuff, but learning definitely will not hurt. Just make sure to apply your knowledge in practice and build something. That will improve your understanding of the material and help it stick in your memory for longer. Don't be afraid to reinvent the wheel for the sake of deeper understanding. At the same time, try to build something new, useful and challenging to really stress test your skills and \"level up\".\n\nThe difficult thing is to focus on cultivating the right kind of skills and fundamentals. There is just so much to learn and to know. I don't know the answer either, besides the obvious: learn 1-2 programming languages well enough, learn data structures, pick a framework, know network protocols (at least HTTP), maybe OAuth, maybe cybersecurity fundamentals could be useful. Yeah, take this with a grain of salt. I actually started reading \"Structured computer organization\" by Tanenbaum. That maybe useful for low-level and system programming, i guess?\n\nThat said, I would suggest to give these AI tools a try every once in awhile if you haven't done so yet. Just to see what they are capable of.\n\nI shared your hesitation at first. Then, I tried it recently and found it quite useful for generating boilerplate code and writing tests. No agentic stuff, just multi-line autocomplete mode. That way, you still are in control and can immediately review the suggested code snippet, but it saves you a lot a hand-typing.\n\nAs for the AI, I am not gonna be a judge of whether the hype is justified or not.

Also, depending on what kind of tools you’re building, you might want to check out Gadget. It’s not a systems language, but it’s great if you ever want to take your automation and turn it into a backend or API without building the infra yourself.

If you store those books in a list, though, you have to check every single book to see if you have `Harry Potter` in your collection. Instead, you can put those books in a `set`. Books in a set are stored in piles. Each pile contains all the books starting with the same first two letters. So, to check if you have `Harry Potter`, you go directly to the `Ha` section. You don't have to go through the entire library.\n\nNow, let's say you only want one copy of each book, and you are given another copy of `Harry Potter`. You go to the `Ha` section and check for `Harry Potter`, if it is there, you just toss your new copy. If not, you add that copy to the `Ha` section.",

We call hash(\"Hello World\") and it returns the hash for that string (lets just say it is number like 66457). Then, we use that hash to determine the index the string belongs in, in the list. An easy way to do this for this example is to use the modulo operator. So say, our set implementation has 10 \"buckets\" (each bucket is an element in the underlying list), we can do 66457 % 10 = 7 so we place the string \"Hello world\" in index 7 of the underlying list(i.e. we place it in bucket 7).\n\nThe core idea here is that we never had to iterate through the list of buckets, we derived the index from the value \"Hello world\" itself. We dont have to look at any index other than index 7 for duplicates because (assuming our hash function is deterministic), \"Hello world\" *always* maps to index 7.\n\nHowever, there is a problem. Say there are 10 buckets, but we input 20 elements. Since there are more elements than there are buckets, its inevitable that some buckets will have multiple elements in them. Because of this, it is actually true that we have to do some iteration to find duplicates. If there are multiple elements in bucket 7, then we have to search the bucket to check if \"Hello world\" already exists. I'm not completely sure datastructure python uses to represent buckets though, if its lists then yeah there would be iteration but technically it could be any data structure.",

Python's hash tables use [open addressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_addressing), so the function needs to try multiple slots until it finds either an empty one or an existing object that's equal to the one being inserted. \n\nSets are fast because on average, this loop will terminate after a small number of iterations, *if* the hash function gives random-looking output *and* the fraction of occupied slots in the table is not too large. In order to make sure that second condition holds, the code calls [`set_table_resize`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/setobject.c#L253-L330) to rebuild the table with a larger number of slots whenever the table gets too full.",

If you’re just building up skills though here are some tradeoffs to consider:\n\n- Web development has kind of forced its way into everything now. Knowing JavaScript is kind of like speaking English: it may not always be the most appropriate language to use but because so many people speak it you can kind of get around anywhere with it. Websites? Desktop apps? Mobile apps? Backend servers? Robots? You name it and there’s probably a way to do it with javascript.\n\n- Web development, however, is all very high level, meaning there are several layers of abstraction between the code you write and what’s actually happening down on your system hardware. A rarer and more valuable skill set these days is knowing how low level systems work, because without that knowledge, you’ll never really be able to understand how to write performant code. It also offers a lot of perspective on why things are the way they are in high level languages, which can be useful from time to time. C++ is still considered pretty high level but since it’s an extension of C there are more low level concepts to there to explore. At the very least it lets you interact directly with the operating system as opposed to JavaScript which runs in its own isolated environment inside your browser.",

        "body": "TTF fonts don't contain the right kind of information to do what you want. A TTF contains curves representing the *outlines* of characters, [like in this example.](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/101761/the-description-and-interpretations-of-truetype-font-points-and-curves) If you click that link and look at the diagram of a lowercase letter `a`, you'll see that it consists of two closed curves: one defining the outer boundary of the letter, and another one for the \"hole\" inside the loop. \n\nThere's no straightforward correspondence between those outlines and the pen strokes a human might use to draw a letter that looks similar. (For instance, a lowercase `t` consists of a single outline but would be drawn with two strokes. A capital `H` has one outline and is drawn with three strokes. An `O` has two outlines, and is drawn with only one stroke.)\n\nFor the kanji diagrams you're talking about, somebody had to manually draw each character's strokes in a vector graphics program. This data was released for free by the [KanjiVG project](https://kanji.sljfaq.org/kanjivg.html) and now lots of other websites and apps use it.\n\nA bit of googling turned up [this project](https://github.com/brownvc/decoupled-style-descriptors) for the Latin alphabet. It includes a dataset with letter strokes from a bunch of actual people's handwriting, plus a data-driven algorithm to generate new variants by interpolating between them. You might find it useful as a starting point.\n\nOnce you have the strokes, animating them is fairly straightforward e.g. by varying the SVG `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` properties over time.\n\nP.S. In principle, you could imagine using various computational geometry algorithms to extract the [\"skeleton\"](https://scikit-image.org/docs/0.25.x/auto_examples/edges/plot_skeleton.html) of a letter in a TTF font, and then try to reconstruct a set of strokes from that. But getting something that works reliably and gives good-quality results would likely be a very challenging project, IMO. Certainly much more difficult and time-consuming than just redrawing the letters by hand.",

This feels like a python kinda project, but it also depends on your familiarity. SVG fonts is a bit more of a rabbit hole than I'm gonna dig into right now, but this feels pretty feasible, although you might need to make your own font to get the strokes and directions to what you want.",

You'd then animate the percentage from 0->100%.\n\nYou didn't mention what platform you're on, but on web Snap.svg has the `getSubpath()` method which can perform that operation, and on native, Skia has the `SkTrimPathEffect` API that can do the same. There are likely other libraries out there that have an implementation of a similar API.\n\nIf you're interested in how this works, typically the input Bezier spline is chopped up into a bunch of tiny linear segments, which have very simple closed-form length and interpolation computations. To get the overall length of the spline, sum the length of the tiny linear segments. To get a % length of the spline, grab all the tiny linear segments up to that % of length.",

It does a lot of stuff automatically for you. It's a necessary part of any tkinter program.

Balancing your time spent working is important; too little time, and you will lose motivation because you think you're going too slow. Too much time, and you will get burnt out. Treat it like an extra curricular which you should hold yourself to account for. Doing it like that will naturally allow you to manage your other responsibilities without burnout or loss of motivation.\n\nFor good project ideas, pick a hobby and build something that could contribute to it. For example if you like bird-watching, make a program that lets you record different birds you see. I recommend working for half an hour a morning when you have time and you feel fresh, or if you don't have time then, half an hour in the evening to wind down.",

Including here.  **This sub has learned nothing from history.**\n\nWhen oil prices are high relative to extraction costs for extended periods of time, petroleum engineering ranks SWELL.  When prices sit at commodity levels above extraction costs, petroleum engineering ranks dwindle fast within 2 years.  The median petroleum engineering graduate becomes UNEMPLOYED.\n\nIn the boom times in the 21st century, petroleum engineering grads were walking out of school to 20 offers in the 195k-225k range with a large bonus potential.  They'd go bust their ass many many hours a week out in some rustic environment somewhere.  There was all kinds of \"what should I specialize in\" conversations like should I do wireline, or logging, or MWD, or be reservoir side, or whatever.\n\nAnd then POOF.  Prices fall... extraction costs rise, and that project you were paying the PE 225k to babysit no longer makes money and STOPS.  STOPS.\n\nPetroleum engineering had 2600 +/- BS grads (and don't forget several hundred MS students too) in 2017.  Less than 600 now, and what looks to be about 600 in 2024.  7 years to fall.  Using the broad numbers you posted, this is like the 100,000 CS grads in 2025 becoming 23,000 by 2032.\n\n**Does this REALLY make petroleum engineering look attractive to you?**  A major that's seen 80% drop in enrollment in 7 years because the industry cannot support its graduates?\n\n> With the massive datacenter boom, this is pretty hot right now.\n\nDatacenters employ so few people once built; you can build 100 more of them, and they're still a minor player.  Design of datacenters is mostly electrical, mechanical, and structural engineering, there might be ONE or TWO IE on a major datacenter design project.  Hell there's going to be more architects than IE's.  If you want to WORK in a datacenter, good luck.  If you want to DESIGN datacenters, electrical, mechanical, or structural.  I literally work for a company that does MANY data centers for companies we've all heard of, and I am a chemical engineer.  I LITERALLY WORK HERE, and for $1,000,000 I couldn't get on a data center project.  Mechanical, electrical, structural, and architects, or GTFO.\n\n> These engineering fields: Nuclear, naval...\n\nGAH... horrible.  Do not study nuclear engineering.  You do NOT do what you think you do.  The nuclear side of the nuclear world is a solved issue and even a large new nuke plant requires very few nuclear engineers.  I do firmly feel that there will be a nuclear renaissance in this country as people figure out that nuclear power is safe and can help with a lot of power issues in this countries, I am very excited for this, and actually personally would love to get in on the action given I live close to one of the major SMR players main office.\n\nHOWEVER, in a new nuke plant... the majority of engineering design hours will be spent by mechanical engineers, structural engineers (which come out of civil), electrical engineers.  If you want to work in that industry, THOSE are target paths.",

There's also another $12000 a year going in medical insurance and other 401k stuff.\n\nSo realistically his take home is under $10,000 a month. Of course it is still a huge number but let's take a look at the expensive side. \n\nA 100 sqm apartment in those locations is around $3000-$4000. About $1000-$1500 spent in groceries and eating out. Another $500 in utility, phone, Internet and other membership.\n\nSo from that $18,000 they have no control over at least $12,000 - $14,000 of expenses. They can only decide how to spend those $4,000.\n\nBut if they're working at meta, the WLB is so crazy (40-45h needed to meet expectations) that that is a good chance that those $4,000 are just sitting in the bank or in the stock market.\n\nThese days it is incredibly hard to get this job but hard work and perseverance definitely get you there. You need to solve 1500+ LC questions and ace your behavioral interviews. \n\nYou get asked two questions from those 1500 and you need to solve them within 40 minutes. That is a good chance that if you haven't seen that problem before you're not going to solve that in under 20 minutes and therefore you will feel the interview.",

I can confidently say that I know when you're cheating. Software Engineers are not Actors, and they ALWAYS make stupid mistakes in how they answer a question when they have the answer as opposed to when they're working it out. In cases where I can't, you probably didn't need the tool anyway because you would've got it eventually. It's also very telling because you don't see it in any other job role. I interviewed a set of executive assistant candidates for a GM, and even in role-skill exercises, the cadence of answer, the breaking down of a problem, all is very similar. If it's a SWE and they're cheating, they're getting it right immediately, are unable to describe a solution (and then immediately turn into a CS professor), or they can explain something perfect, but cannot tell you any other way to do it - even when another approach is taught hand-in-hand and is basically a pair with a given algorithm.\n\nYou would be shocked at how common cheating is. I'd say maybe 5-10%, with more new grads cheating than experienced hires. I've even interviewed people that have so blatantly cheated that they've either quit an interview mid-way despite getting the answer \"right\", because they couldn't explain an if statement or why they've structured a for loop in a specific way (it's a for-each).",

A really successful small firm could die in a month if they were to lose two contracts back-to-back. For the huge companies, any sign of work slowing will often result in teams being let go. They're usually done silently, but in this case it's likely to be more noteworthy because layoffs and offshoring are popular right now. From a business perspective it's good, because it makes you look efficient. After all, if everyone else is doing it, it's fine, right...\n\nIt's also worth noting that in contracting firms, a LOT of people might be classed as technical/service staff when their job is essentially a PM or AM role, basically tracking work, making sure the client is happy, etc.\n\nFinally, this is my own personal perspective on contracting, but the idea that a contracting firm will have any advancements in AI is utterly laughable. It's not even a skill issue, but one where work will need to be billed to a client, and there's no fucking way that TCS is billing someone for the time taken to mess around with AI issues. Contracting firms often believe that they're at the forefront of technology, but my experience of subcontracting for TCS was arguing with a PM because I had written unit tests and they viewed it as \"unnecessary work we will not pay for\". When I pushed back, their response was \"well, it should work first time\". It's an environment of shortcuts, and while they probably love the idea of AI doing dev work, it'll end in tears without any shadow of a doubt.",

The recruiter said I wouldn’t have to worry about COBOL. Then I got into the interview and the hiring manager asked how I would interpret COBOL code if I needed to on the job.

You network so over time, your \"brand\" (you, your work, etc) increases in value.\n\nThen later, when a company wants to fill a role, employees with connections will typically refer people from those connections first. This gives those candidates a significant advantage in the market.\n\nNetworking also builds a repertoire of trust.\n\nIt's much much easier to land remote jobs with a good network, since the gained trust can be converted in to more flexible working conditions (since companies will have an easier time trusting you to get your work done).",

Whatever process we used to use, you can call it Waterfall or something else, GANTT chart based projects… they had a very different progression.\n\nYou’d have long periods in the beginning of a project where you’d read and write documentation, do planning, research, exploratory code. Then things would ramp up, and you’d start getting the real work done. Towards the end of the project, the deadline would loom, and the real problems would start to appear.\n\nYou’d enter “crunch mode”, which truly sucked, deeply sucked horribly. This could go on for a month or two. Eventually you’d launch and settle back into the beginning phase of a new project. This was a HUGE relief. Then you’d do it all over again.\n\nSounds bad? Well enter Agile which aimed to solve these problems, supposedly. How? By turning everything into a constant drip of 2 week sprints. Every sprint is a deadline. It’s all a micro version of the old way, you never get into the massive crunch time (maybe), instead you trade it for a constant, unrelenting stress. It never lets up, not for a second - and you spend your entire career this way.\n\nIt’s far worse.",

So all the commenters are suggesting that you should not have attempted to negotiate at all. Which is stupid.\n\nThat having been said, I've never seen anyone negotiate an offer up more than 20%, so asking for a 50% increase was unreasonable, even though the initial offer was unreasonably low. It would be up to you to decide whether $35K would be worthwhile while you search for another job. Many people say it's easier to get a job offer while you have a job, but I've had much more success spending 40hrs/wk job hunting than spending 40+hrs/wk working and then another 10-20hrs/wk job hunting. Of course, I'm only able to say that because I'm no longer broke so you do what works for you.",

Try to find a niche that you can learn more about than anyone else. Is there a part of your job processes that feels like toil, or takes a long time, or nobody seems to fully understand? Spend some time trying to improve that thing. Research alternative tools, try to write documentation (the kind you wish were there for you right now), see if you can reverse engineer it.\n\n\nYou will probably get stuck early on, or feel like you're missing some fundamentals, but that's okay. Ask questions when you can, and keep chipping away at it. Eventually, when you have something that you think is an improvement over what's there (probably won't be all that hard to get to that point to be honest) you can let it be known that you've created a new resource or process, and get some people to review it. Chances are good you'll end up being a go-to person for that thing in the future. You'll have very experienced devs coming to you for help/advice/best practices in that domain.\n\n\nFrom there you'll probably incidentally pick up a lot through the process. You'll recognize things in the codebase as being in some ways similar to the thing you took ownership of. You'll get a request to integrate your thing with some other unfamiliar thing, and then you repeat the process until you understand that thing really well too.\n\n\nBit by bit, you'll start feeling pretty confident. \n\n\nSource: my own experience, feeling like a bad developer for many years and then having my confidence grow as a contributor once I figured out this mindset",

There will be winners, losers, and companies that were just along for the ride during AI. Have you been looking at switching companies rather than switching fields? Not every company has the same view of AI as your current company. You're probably suffering from burnout, from the mix of surviving three rounds of layoffs and how unpleasant your current working environment has become. \n\nOut of curiosity, how much have you been thinking about this switch? \n\nPart of why I mention this is that other fields aren't necessarily better. Nursing comes up often in this sub, but if you ever look at the nursing sub, they are pretty miserable there. They are understaffed, and we're just 5 years off from a pandemic where lots of nurses were dying.\n\nI saw a video recently that said Private Equity firms were buying out plumbers in cities. Once they've bought out enough, they will drop their rates to put the others out of business. Then, they'll drive rates up. There are a lot of fields going through change right now. \n\nI'm personally in the camp that AI will be another tool we use, and there will be blowback when the bubble eventually bursts. It's just not sustainable, and eventually, there will be callout for actual results. Then all that money being invested will have to be invested elsewhere.",

It's not walking into a tech conference, exchanging business cards, and aggressively shaking hands. It's not cold messaging people asking for some awkward \"coffee chat\" even though you both know you're just trying to milk them for a job.\n\nThat feels fake as hell because *it is* fake as hell. But it's also not networking.\n\nOur network is made up of our *friends, family, and colleagues*.\n\nThat's it. So in order to \"network\" you expand upon 1 of those 3 categories. The family category's tough to expand, you're kinda stuck with it. The colleagues one you expand throughout your career as you work with people. The people you've met and worked closely with in college also count as colleagues (even if they're *both* friends and colleagues). The professor you saw weekly in office hours, or the TA you had a good connection with are colleagues.\n\nThe \"friends\" category is by far the easiest to expand. You expand this category by.... making friends. That's it. There's nothing more to it. They don't need to be technical either. Someone working in sales is able to refer someone to SWE. They're character checks for the company, not skill checks, that's why they still interview you. Hiring unknowns off the street is risky for companies, because character-red-flags are easily hidden and don't come out for months. Hiring someone that an employee they already like is vouching for is significantly safer.\n\nThe reason meetups are so commonly suggested is because getting into a room with a bunch of people that all have a shared interest is a great way to *make friends.* If you go to those thinking you're gonna get a LinkedIn connection, you're not going to make any friends *or* connections. Go into those because you're interested in X, and the friends will follow. Doesn't need to be technical either. Go to a rock climbing meetup, go to a model train meetup, hell, go to your local dive bar and buy a stranger a drink and get to chatting. I've made life-long friends that way.\n\nThe bad news is none of this is a quick fix. Making friends takes time. We're not disposable one-time use napkins that you toss in the bin as soon as you get what you want from us. If you form a *genuine* connection with us, over the course of months, we'll refer each other because we want to, and we're doing so becaues we're friends, not because we're using each other.",

Also I think finance also likes people with a more academic background since they do a lot of advanced mathematical analysis for trading strategies. \n\nSo if you just want to be building apps then maybe drop it? If you want to do something that requires at least a masters like ML/AI, data science or something more math focused then it could be worth it. \n\nIf you decide to stick with it you should apply to national labs for internships and you can probably get those internships pretty easily as a domestic graduate level student. But to “seal the deal” you should really get into research",

It was great for years, I’d work overtime occasional to hit certain deadlines but for the entirety of this year, working overtime nearly every day has become the norm. I got “promoted” into a tech lead position with no title or pay increase. I bright this up with my manager and got the ole “it’ll be a good thing to bring up during the next promotion cycle” seven months from now.\n\nSome new “can’t miss” deadline nearly every week “, weekend releases, insane pressure. Team clearly burnt out and getting short with each other, it’s just sad.\n\nI’ve been lucky enough to get many interviews and it’s brutal. 6-7 rounds per company, really positive feedback, just to get to the end and be told they ended up hiring someone else with years more experience. If people with 10 YOE are having to down level to take SE2 and SE3 roles (I don’t blame that at all) I’m not really sure what to do at that point. \n\nWork will always be work to me in some ways, but I did genuinely enjoy my job and showed up with positivity every day. At this point I’m fully burnt out and looking for any exit I can",

I'd go so far as to say it's only a matter of time at every company.\n\nIt's a very common pattern for management/upper-management to get replaced, and for a company to tighten the belt and shift their culture to the toxic-side.\n\nThat part's out of our control.\n\nWhat's in our control is how we react to it.\n\nWLB is my #1 priority. Even if a company tries to turn up the heat, and introduce toxic expectations.... I don't let it alter my WLB. I do the best work I can from 9-5, M-F. That's non-negotiable. Management can scream about deadlines, ping me after hours, etc all they want. Doesn't change anything about how I behave. At most a 5:30pm text will get is a \"OK, will take a look tomorrow morning\".\n\nThere's an extremely clear divide between my work life and my personal life. This divide lets me disconnect after 5pm, no matter how much BS is going on during the work day, no matter how stressful it gets. That stress waits around for 9am the following work day.\n\nI've had companies \"tighten the belt\" before, but I've always stood my ground. If they fired me over it? Oh well, the culture was toxic anyways and I was already looking for another job. But in reality they never did. The last time this happened I even got a pretty massive *raise*.\n\nToxic management *loves* to take advantage of people that don't establish any sort of boundaries. Really they'd be stupid not to, it's free labor. But when you establish boundaries as the employee, more often than not, nothing's going to happen.\n\nSo whenever this happens to your company's culture, firstly establish boundaries and stick to them in the short-term to keep yourself sane. In the medium/long term find another job ASAP. It's a sinking ship culture-wise.",

Say you have been offered a place with a 20% raise, give your job the benefit of the doubt too (assumingyou like being there) and say that you prefer to stay but you have to do what's best for you and see if you can come to an agreement.

After we moved to the public cloud space most of that server automation work disappeared.)\n\nPay was fine, but frankly I just didn't like working with the product that much. It's all largely Java-based, and admittedly I've never been a fan of Java. But even if you ignore the \"Java-ness\" of it... I frankly just don't give a hoot about Salesforce itself. Straight up just do not care, and I found myself incredibly bored with the work.\n\nIt's a specialized role, but the good news is Salesforce is widely used across multiple industries. In many ways I would say it is similar to mainframe. Those industries that still run mainframes really need developers who know what they're doing on mainframe. It's just not something they teach in school, and companies are willing to pay for devs who know what they're doing. But it doesn't change the fact that it's very specialized.",

He sold his house here and went all in. On the down side, he has to worry about paying farm labourers and making sure the ends meet and he's pretty much spent what he sold the house in England for. They're in it now, they have to make it work. On the plus side, apart from a few initial bad starts which cost them a good few quid, the last time he came back to visit in the UK, he had a brand new Toyota. OK it's not an Audi or a BMW, but a brand new Toyota in Ireland is roughly equivalent. Especially a diesel with a Dublin plate! Seriously, in Ireland, that's doing pretty well!\n\n\\- Another bought a van, a bunch of cleaning equipment and became a carpet cleaner. On the plus side, the amount of hotels and function rooms that immediately gave him business and even rolling appointments is definitely helping to pay off the equipment he bought through hire purchase. On the downside, he's cleaning carpets at 55 years old with a 55 year old back. He likes the work but it's obviously a lot more physical than he really thought.\n\n\\- The last one now works three days a week doing minor admin stuff for an office. Filing, sending stuff out, packaging, doing the odd excel sheet stuff, fixing printers, any odd jobs. It doesn't pay well. But the mortgage was paid a while ago, no real debts, kids are off to university, his wages pay for the monthly bills easily, the wife's wages pay for the family holiday every year though kids may or may not come. If you have no heavy outgoings, you sort of don't need to chase the wage anymore.\n\n  \nSo yeah, none of that is helpful or answers your question. Or does it?",

My last two jobs (both very large companies) were both offshored. Not just me, but my entire team. I’m friends with a lot of former co-workers struggling right now.\n\nFor me, I just realized I want a field of work where I don’t have to be around Indians anymore. I know it sounds racist, but I’ve come to terms with it. Watching them slowly suffocate the IT industry since I joined it in 2013 has been like watching a family member slowly dying to cancer.\n\nI’m considering everything from digital forensics to trades work to just finally pulling the trigger and angling to move into product mgmt or architect. Tired of the dev rat race and companies building generic APIs but wanting to do Google interviews. Tired of grinding leetcode problems every few years after another layoff. I just like building and integrating stuff and seeing it all work, like finishing a painting.\n\nReady to be accused of being bad at my job or not passionate enough or something by people who want to virtue signal about the reality of things. Some people, especially younger people, will feel a knee-jerk reaction to what I said, but I feel bad for you. You don’t remember how enjoyable this work was before Cognizant took over and every remote job posting had 7,000 applicants from India within the first week. Before COVID killed socialization.

Also in your practice you need to sort of streamline the thought process along with the toolset.\n\nThink of it like branch prediction in computers.

There were teams of people whose job it was to run other people's code and give them the results. THen pipelines became more automated and now you dont need a 10 person team to do that, you barely need 1 person to be knowledgable in it. Im sure those jobs got replaced, but the engineers who worked on it, got transferred to other teams. Im sure some got laid off, but they adapted and found a new job and place to work at. \n\nThe thing about CS is, it's not just about programming.

The biggest mistake would be positioning yourself as a career changer when you're actually a seasoned developer expanding your skill set. Your deep understanding of how applications work from the client side gives you a massive advantage in backend development because you understand the full picture of how data flows and what the frontend actually needs. Companies should see you as someone who can build APIs that actually make sense for the consuming applications, not just someone learning Java from scratch.\n\nThe interview struggle you're facing is real and frustrating, but there are ways around the traditional leetcode gauntlet. Target smaller companies and startups where you can often get in front of actual engineering managers who care more about your ability to solve real problems than your ability to reverse a binary tree under pressure. Focus on companies that do practical coding exercises or take-home projects instead of whiteboard sessions. Your strength in systems design and high-level thinking is incredibly valuable, especially for backend roles where understanding architecture matters more than memorizing algorithms. Some companies do hire based on these skills alone, particularly in more senior positions where they expect you to learn the specific technical details on the job.\n\nI actually work on [AI interview helper](http://interviews.chat) to navigate exactly these kinds of tricky interview situations where you need to showcase your transferable skills and handle technical questions that might be outside your current wheelhouse.",

I have years of experience, and I’ve had conversations with someone who was working at Hobby Lobby a few months before. Don’t let someone lacking emotional intelligence get you down. I had a recruiter start harassing me on LinkedIn because I was being considered for a contract-to-hire role at Chase that was a higher rate than she was used to seeing. She kept trying to insist I was lying. I just blocked her. \n\nNo good advice on how to network. You need to find people willing to talk to someone, effectively a stranger, for very little in return. It’s a challenge. I recently accepted some LinkedIn invites from random new grads from my college, but I had too many personal things come up to follow up with them. \n\nIt’s a very hard market right now. You know that. It just takes more time and effort than normally. \n\nOne thing I’d encourage you to do more of is learning and expanding your skillset. You say it’s been 7 months. You can learn quite a bit in time like that. Maybe you should try learning some things to make yourself a stronger candidate. AWS had a free tier. You could get exposure to cloud services that will help you grow. I encounter a lot of experienced people who still don’t have a lot of cloud experience. ",

Also, there truly are people who want to help, and feel sympathy for people like us. Also, they admire the dedication we have to keep going.\n\nWell first, take some time to take care of your mental health. We need money to survive, but this career path should not determine the embodiment of your soul. Balance hobbies and hanging out with friends, forgetting about anything career related during those times. This should give you a boost of confidence. \n\nAlso, you have to attend networking events in your area. The point of building your network is to get connected to people in the industry, ask them questions about their career and get advice, and share what you’re currently working on / your experience. Not necessarily asking them for referrals right away. \n\nJobs for people like us are very scarce now, but in the meantime, practice interview / technical skills, work on projects, build your network through the advice above, always be on the lookout for open positions, etc. \n\nThe most important thing right now is to stay consistent, but also have a life. Get a coffee shop job to be around people and pay the bills while you do these things. It’s really hard I know, and I’m proud of you for still working at it / searching for advice after 7 months. But after taking my life back and following the advice above, I feel more confident now in my 14 months of post grad to find opportunities, then I did many many months ago. \n\nSorry for the ramble but we will prevail!! Keep going and most importantly, take care of your mental health, and soon you will find people who want to help you.",

It wasn’t a standard tutorial or project that everyone had done. I like to think it was that my excitement about my project shined through, because at several places I pulled out my laptop to show the project, and each time it usually ended up with me doing 15 minutes of pair programming with them. \n\nA side note: learning pair programming skills is super useful! Not just professionally useful, but great for interviews. Talking through what you are doing as you do it. \n\nAMA!",

Honestly, take it with a grain of salt. Most of the loudest voices predicting the \"end of software engineering\" aren’t engineers themselves and are often coming from a business lens where disruption = fear. But if you’re in engineering, you can already see what’s really happening. AI is changing the way engineers work, not eliminating the need for them. Sure, some lower-level tasks are getting automated, but that just means the bar is shifting toward people who understand AI systems, prompt engineering, model integration, performance tuning, security, ethics, etc. You’re positioning yourself exactly in that space.\n\nAlso, the fact that your new role is in AI software engineering? That’s one of the most resilient and high-impact areas to be in right now. There’s still a massive shortage of engineers who can build, scale, and fine-tune AI products responsibly.",

It was more or less a dead-end job since there wasn't a lot of room for advancement/salary increase. Mentorship was non-existent as was training and pretty much everything else. Things were siloed and if you did what you were told you would get the job. I'm thankful I had the job because at least it was a foot in the door into IT. \n\nThe second job I'm at is better in some ways and worse in others. We're very understaffed and are on a hiring freeze with a lot of technical debt that is overdue by years. Like a lot of organizations we want to be proactive by reacting to the latest trends in IT-- if you guessed AI, you'd be correct. We have a Github that's there more or less for some kind of version control, but it's used kind of rarely. Yes, the technical debt is to that degree. However, I'm lucky to have someone that's at least willing to work with me, and help me out and provides me some advice of things I should be doing-- that's when I buy a book on that topic and read it. I try to do a book a month when I have the time. \n\nMy advice would be to do that, talk with someone you trust or who is willing to help a little and research on your own. People will take notice and be happy you cared. If there's other IT departments you work with, I'd also ask some questions what they do, their responsibilities and at least understand them from a cursory glance so if you know of something is their responsibility you can articulate yourself in a manner where people will at least see you're taking yourself seriously as a professional.",

Others, you need leverage in the form of another job offer, which they can match or give you a signing bonus instead or maybe 1 extra week of vacation. They just aren't going to give you more for the sake of it. That looks bad. Your pay was set from experience, job title, work unit and pay bands. No one rolled a d20.\n\nOther thing in negotiation, standard time to accept or refuse the offer is 1 or 2 weeks.

It does help to make your resume look a bit nicer and might get you a slightly higher role and pay off the bat, but to me it's not worth 2 years of missing out on experience to do for an extra 5k-10k in pay you would've just likely had if you started to work. The key really is if you can get a job to pay for your masters degree. So in summary, it's not worth the MSCS unless you get someone to pay it for you or if you can escape paying minimal and not having to get loans. I had my job pay it for me and I grinded for 2 years as a part-time student and only had to pay 5k out of pocket those 2 years. But I also did summer courses as well to finish on time. \n\nAs for your leetcode grind. I am not someone who really thinks you need to \"grind\" leetcode to get a job. You can and might be good at it to land the job, the problem is that many people think they can just grind it and dont care to learn the ins and outs of what they are doing. So they basically are hoping to get a similar question where they can think \"omg that's leetcode question #100 or similar to it, i just need a map\". But they dont care to learn why they need the map, or if there's a slightly different approach they could take. I have been in the job market twice in my career, never had to grind leetcode and I got into two big tech companies (one of them a Mag7 company) by just following a google DSA guide I will link below. It has videos from cracking the coding interview author that explain DSA very well. Also links free leetcode study guides with example questions to practice on. \n\nCompanies dont care if you get the questions right, they only care if you know what you are doing and explain your thought process well in the questions. I got both those jobs and didnt do 100% well on the questions. A few times I got stuck but because I explained my thought process well they liked my approach. They know you wont get it 100% off the bat, they just want to know where your heads at. So for me i like to say \"hey i think I can possibly use a map here because of XYZ possibly a set\" and then I try it. I also go step by step. So usually the first thing I tackle is the return cases. I.e. if I am doing a array traversal the first thing I write is the return case if array is empty. It sounds dumb, but they appreciate when you tackle the small things first that could easily be forgotten. Also it's one of those things of once you start coding your nerves go down even if it's a simple lin. \n\nThen at the end I write test cases and try to go through multiple different cases (empty array, edge cases, etc). If any of them come out wrong, then I quickly refactor.\n\nGoogle DSA link is: [https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/)",

With today's market, you got to be pretty competitive (4-5 years ago, you had a better chance of \"getting lucky\"). Working full-time is a pain, and even putting just 10 hours a week into transitioning into SWE can be hard. All-in-all, I wouldn't be surprised if it took you over a year to line up your first job.\n\nI will say though, as a self taught dev with no degree, you got some strengths here: You have a CS degree and you've been working a job that will generally look respectable on a resume. I do think you have a pretty healthy shot at transitioning into SWE, but the market is bad and it's pretty rough out there.\n\nI'll assume you have some rough experience with programming (how to reasonably use classes, functions, if statements, for loops), or at the very least, all that will come back to you pretty quickly.\n\nIf you want to get into fullstack, I would start off by focusing on Java / Springboot for backend, JavaScript / React for frontend, and use Git. I would ***probably*** recommend taking a Udemy course (I never personally tried Udemy, but I often hear good things) for both React and Springboot. You can just watch a YouTube tutorial for Git. Try to get to a point where you can work on a project pretty consistently. Just have one project you're pretty committed to.\n\nAfter that, there's interview prep. Go through the roadmap on https://neetcode.io (mainly focus on the video explanations, don't waste a ton of time trying to solve questions yourself at this stage). After the roadmap, do some random questions LeetCode, and try to get to a spot where you have like an 80% chance of solving an unfamiliar medium-level problem in under 60 minutes (if you haven't solved it after 2 hours, just look up the answer and try to think where you went wrong).\n\nMore than anything else though ***talk through the problems***. You wanna be good at \"solving\" problems because sometimes you get \"assessments\" (basically you have to solve a LeetCode problem before getting to interview anybody), but for \"interviews\" you need to be good at talking technical. You should look up \"mock coding interviews\" on YouTube interviews to see what mean here.\n\nYou should start applying before you're 100% confident with anything though (you're never going to be 100% ready to start applying). In fact, I would honestly recommend you just start sending out like 3 applications a week ***right now***. Just half ass it, get it out of the way, and get used to it. Don't waste too much time \"waiting to feel ready\" (I wasted a lot of time on this back in 2021).\n\nFor your resume, skim through the wiki on r/EngineeringResumes. You'll have to adjust a bit though because of your background, but do what you can to leverage your current work experience (be detailed), and mainly try to sell yourself as \"an important team member that holds some key responsibilities and/or accomplishments\". I know that can be really awkward, but again, I think you got quite a respectable role.\n\nAnd finally, as far as applying goes, apply to any role that looks reasonably relevant, doesn't look too \"specialized\", and asks for less than 5 years of experience. Don't be too picky, just focus on playing the numbers game more than anything else.",

Python, SQL (start writing your own soon!), Power BI/Tableau are great tools, and healthcare companies are constantly hiring analysts who can work with lab or patient data. Bonus: you can build portfolio projects using synthetic healthcare datasets to show immediate relevance.\n\nThat said, if you’re more drawn to building things end-to-end, **full-stack with Java + JS** is solid—but it’ll take longer to ramp up, especially if your coding muscles are rusty. One middle path: try backend-focused roles or automation scripting in Python to bridge between the two.\n\nYou don’t need to “catch up” on everything just pick a direction, build 2–3 focused projects, and you’ll have a strong story.

Maybe I'm taking the wrong courses. \n\nBut yeah, I just started learning Java with Spring Boot tonight. Decided to do a common project (Making a Letterboxd \"clone\") , but rather than watch a video tutorial, I'm using chatGPT to learn. At first, it's been giving me a bunch of code snippets to paste and I'm going through with that to learn the process in how to make a project from start to finish with a backend and frontend, but I think moving forward, I'll ask it to give me less code snippets and more just explain concepts and theories with examples without the code directly related to the project I'm working on. \n\nPerhaps I'll try to get the fundamentals down again, maybe make a solid project or two (Nothing too crazy) and then start applying within the next week or two. Thanks for being encouraging about my chances. I'll try to leverage my science/healthcare background and maybe look for more niche roles in the biopharmaceutical industry related to tech/SWE. Obviously, they won't pay as big as tech or finance companies, but I'm just trying to learn and get my foot in the door ASAP to gain more relevant experience. Thanks again for the advice :)",

When you're employed and job searching unsuccessfully, your mind begins to think \"If I could just do this full time surely I'd line something up quickly and that'll solve all my problems!\"\n\nThe problem is that's not how it works. If you're getting 0 interviews now, job hunting \"full time\" will continue to get you 0 interviews. When you're not even getting *interviews*, that's not a problem you can solve by just buckling down and committing more time to the search.\n\nIf you were struggling with leetcode, or performing well in interviews, that argument would hold more weight. More interview practice means better performance. But you're not even getting the interview. That's not something that'll get better if you \"practice\" 8 hours a day. There's nothing *to* practice.\n\nI'm not invalidating what you're feeling at all, I'm sure it absolutely feels like quickand, and that you're stuck in your career.\n\nBut want to know a worse feeling? Being unemployed, draining your savings, while still having all of those exact same negative feelings. That'll be way worse. Getting into that hole is how a lot of people spiral into a deep career-ending depression.\n\nQuitting your job will not be a magic fix. If anything, it will make your search *harder*. It's always easier to find a job while you're employed with an income. An important consideration a lot of people don't think about is because you have an income you have the power to reject job offers that aren't good fits. Imagine you get another offer for a role *just like* the one you're currently in. Obviously you wouldn't want to accept that, right? That's the whole reason you're job searching, to get away from this kind of role.\n\nWhen you're employed, you just turn down the offer, and you continue the job search. There's no rush.\n\nWhen you're unemployed, you feel an intense pressure to accept *anything* because you need to put food on the table. So you accept a bad offer, and inadvertently end up back at square one.\n\nHold onto this job, and job search on the side. This is how most people change jobs.",

Postgres is the easiest to install on your own and figure out that jobs actually use. Python is used everywhere but the jobs tend to want you to know one of the above as the main driver.

Unless there's a compelling reason for you to leave your job and attend school full-time, I'd consider a part-time graduate program, perhaps even an online program from a reputable university. Expanding to online programs could expand the number of schools and specializations that you can consider, and keeping your job means you don't have to worry as much about the job market and it reduces financial risk after you finish the program.\n\nIf being in an academic setting is important, you may not have to leave your current job for a part-time in-person or hybrid program at a local university. Depending on your current company's policies, you may be able to do a flex schedule at work that lets you attend at least some of your classes in person, and you should still get access to other campus resources.\n\nThe state of the job market in 1-3 years, after you finish a graduate program, is probably the biggest question. This is especially true if you specialize in something your current company doesn't currently need. It's not clear how long it would take you to find a job using your new degree and specialized knowledge. It's common advice that it's easier to find a job when you already have one.",

Foreign Visas - Joseph Edlow was recently confirmed to USCIS director. A major hawk when it comes to h1b and opt, F1 etc. Only good for domestic stem. \n\n\n3. The fed rate - Naturally if debt becomes expensive, labor becomes expensive. This situation is still unravelling. Only time will tell \n\n\n\n\nSo the answer is: Possibly. This situation is sticky. On one hand salaries in tech are great. But the market itself is volatile. Like anything it's a calculated risk. If you want to mitigate it and still remain in tech.

I would recommend masters if you are potentially interested in research route otherwise if you want to continue with regular SWE, then your position, salary etc will solely depend on your interview performance and if an undergrad does better than you, they will end up with a better salary. So imo masters won’t be a good bet. \n\nWould highly recommend reading technical books to work on your fundamentals and get them strong and in parallel work on your soft skills (this is a game changer that most engineers don’t focus on and allows one to stand out). Doing this catapulted my career to senior from new grad in under 2 years over other engineers with 3-4x the amount of experience.The books you read will depend on what you want to focus on. For eg, my area of work was distributed systems so the main books I read were around that but the general ones I recommend are the following 2: DDIA, philosophy of software design. Then also diving into design patterns, pragmatic programmer, etc\nBased on what you are curious to learn and specialize in (FE, BE, DE, DS etc) you pick up relevant books there and start diving in. Also you don't have to read books cover to cover (though the previous 2 I mentioned, do read cover to cover) unless they excite you or you think you are learning from them. I usually use books as a frame of reference so when I get stuck I know where to look (tbh AI like ChatGPT has made that much easier now).\nFor soft-skills (the real game changer), I would recommend focusing on good documentation (and I don't mean writing docs that no one reads, but being strategic with it) like writing summary docs to summarize complex discussions, writing well-thought-out design discussion tradeoff analysis docs to promote healthy, structured discussions and building alignment, etc. Speech is equally important - the phrasings used, the tonality used etc can immediately set an authority apart from a noob - this also translates 1:1 into slack threads, and code reviews as well. Small tweaks like that can instantly make someone come off as authoritative and knowledgeable.",

        "body": "They're looking for your ability to think through real-world scenarios like \"how would you automate testing for a web application that has both UI and API components\" or \"design a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices architecture.\" You'll want to focus on understanding testing frameworks like pytest, selenium, or requests for API testing, along with concepts around test design, data-driven testing, and handling flaky tests.\n\nThe Python questions will likely be more practical than algorithmic - expect to write actual test scripts, parse configuration files, interact with APIs, or manipulate data structures in ways that relate to automation tasks. They might ask you to debug a failing test, explain how you'd structure a test suite, or discuss strategies for maintaining test reliability as applications evolve. Since these interviews can involve some tricky scenario-based questions that require thinking on your feet, I actually built [interview AI](http://interviews.chat) to help people navigate exactly these kinds of technical discussions and practice articulating their problem-solving approach in real-time.",

Like T100, Fortune 500, you're still in the same applicant pool of people with experience. You aren't better because the employer is a company casual masses have heard of.\n* Then while having 3 internships is better than 1, it's not 3x as good. You're already in the work experience pool. I see an occasional post with internships at 2 different companies who can't land an interview for a 3rd.

I worked there for 4 years and I know each company and project is different but in general pros and cons are:\n\nPros:\n\n\\- Chill and relaxed. Deadlines aren't a big thing in this industry and most of the time past 5 pm you dont hasve to think about work. THe office is ghost town after like 6pm. \n\n\\- Easy to coast - i knew people who worked 4 hour days and coasted the rest of the day. Some older people would leave after 4-6 hours and charge 8. \n\n\\- Work life balance is amazing. \n\n\\- Good benefits.\n\n\\- 9/80 - you set your own time but you can't work more than 80s hours in a pay period. So what a lot of people like to do is work 9/80s. Basically it's working 8 days of 9 hours (monday-thursday of both weeks), then work an 8 hour day on one friday to get the 2nd friday off. Some companies allow you to put extra hours in a OT bank hours. Since you can't charge OT, you put it in that bank and can use it to leave a bit early on a different week. What most people di dwas use it to save on vacation hours. So theyd work enough to have a week worth of OT hours and then use those hours instead of their PTO when they were on vacation.\n\n\\- Job security - I cant speak now (especially with some of tracking of government jobs) but befroe that, the defense industry was a great place to have job security. Because you needed securty clearance and that's expensive to get. So even in years where the companies didnt do too good, theyd avoid trying to layoff engineers becauset ehy knew once things got back on track theyd need as much as they could get. \n\n\\- The projects are really cool and working with real hardware makes it worthwhile.\n\nCons:\n\n\\- Lack of learning. It's very easy to coast and because of it, unless you really try you wont really learn much and going to a bigger company you may feel behind on how to work in big code systems with huge deadlines. \n\n\\- You can get stuck in maintenance hell. If the company is running out of projects, they may keep you in maintenance in one of their legacy projects. Lack of developing there. \n\n\\- Pay isnt that great compared to other CS industries. It's still better than most careers but dont expect big tech pay and you may need to jump around your first 10 years to get a good check. I made 75k off of college and with a promotion and few raises was at 90k after 4 years. Some of my friends who job-hopped to competitors are making like 120-140k as Senior level engineers. \n\n\\- No RSUs. \n\n\\-",

You may not want to do this. But it is most likely doable.\n\nAlso, you haven’t even started college yet, from what you are saying. Sorry, I do not believe you can’t change majors given you have not even started college yet.",
