A little story time: Our team once had a major pipeline outage (fun fact: it was when we upgraded our Hadoop infrastructure to a new major version, what a mess 🤦‍♂️). Suddenly, everyone in the company understood our value, because they saw what broke when our tables and processes went down.\n\nUp until that point, I often struggled communicating our value to stakeholders. Then, during a sales call with a third-party company, they asked me, \"What are your data products?\", I heard it the first time and thought it was just management speak. But actually, it became quite a useful tool for me.\n\nWhile software engineers ship visible features, data engineers build invisible infrastructure. Our work powers decisions, reports, and systems behind the scenes. That makes it hard to demonstrate value.\n\nTechnically speaking, I'd define a data product as a composition of assets that, taken together, deliver a result with business relevance(!). Assets can be anything involved in the process: input tables, queries, processes, models, intermediate results, etc. If we're talking Airflow specifically (because this is well known by most), that means tables, Dags, tasks, everything involved in delivering the outcome.\n\nFrom a data engineering perspective, data products are a communication framework to make our work visible. Simple concept, but powerful for explaining what we actually deliver.\n\nFrom a management perspective, a data product is a measurable business asset with clear ROI and accountability. It's something you can point to during budget discussions, assign ownership to, and track performance against defined SLAs.\n\nHowever, not every table, task, or Dag is a data product, but it might be part of one. It's a good exercise to identify them by looking at: Business impact (if this disappeared tomorrow, would executives notice? Would customers be impacted?), orchestration complexity (we had a super Dag triggering lots of other Dags, that was a clear sign for a data product), and high-value consumption (multiple teams depending on it, feeding executive dashboards, etc.).\n\nLook at all your data assets, try to group them together as data products, and also learn what value those data products generate (e.g. what are the tables, reports used for? Is there any measurable impact like revenue, cost savings, increase retention times along the chain?). This will help you to communicate the value of your work, be it internally or when applying for a new job and it helps understanding what needs monitoring and observability.\n\n**Basically: When they work, they're invisible. When they break, everyone notices.**",

If you're not a fortune 500, a not-terrible on prem warehouse is perfectly adequate, and a better investment in data might have actually been to document what you have and work towards a medallion architecture just within the dwh, which would have given you the opportunity to systematically unpick the sources and transformations, embedding business logic and documenting it as you go. But dipshit architects with a vendor in their ear are far from rare, anywhere you go.\n\n\nIt feels universally accepted that if you're on prem you're not a real DE and execs and architects believe it's a fundamental truth that the cloud will unlock value. In your case it sounds like your org had a not-terrible thing going already, and fucked yourselves with a lazy lurch into the cloud that just lifted and shifted your existing problems.\n\n\nMaybe the question to ask is what it is that you like about DE. Today you've got big problems to solve and lots of business value to unlock, a management structure above you that's floundering and will think you're a wizard if you help them by implementing some common sense basics, and a pretty typical set of issues that will be familiar in any role.",

Depending on the size of the company and your relationship with them, talking to your boss’s boss is an option but could backfire if you don’t already have a working relationship there. \n\nHaving been on both sides, depending on how frequently you’re trying to get clarification/how it’s being done I could potentially understand the manager’s side. I’ve had employees who seem to reach out with questions whenever there’s any kind of decision that needs to be made or they run into any kind of roadblock, rather than trying to figure it out themselves first, and it can be draining when it ends up being a regular interruption. Ideally a manager wants to be able to point you in the right direction, answer your questions up front, and then generally let you do your thing. \n\n\nI think it’s also worth acknowledging the difference between effort and results. If I have an engineer who is “lazy” but gets things done without issue or automates things to make their job easier, and another that is always working hard but seems to struggle a lot, I’ll take the lazy one every time. \n\nNot trying to doubt what you’re saying or anything, just some things to consider. \n\nAll of that said, if you think your review did not reflect your actual performance, and the company doesn’t value you, then absolutely find a job somewhere that does value your talents. It can also be the case that your manager is incompetent or a jerk, and there’s no obligation to stick around.",

It requires zero setup, zero dependencies, and zero configuration. TinyETL excels at fast extract and load operations for ad-hoc data migrations, conversions, and inspections. Python is still the best tool for complex transformations, but TinyETL is about moving and validating data quickly and frictionlessly without needing a full environment.\n\nThat’s my current vision at least.

This plan contains only user's statements, commands, etc. Actual schemas appears (resolves) only after the so called \"analysis\" stage when Spark replace user statements by actual tables, columns, etc. Analyzed Logical Plan is materialized only on action (or on explicit call to do it, like to call \"explain\"). You can easily write the code that read CSV, select non existing column and write it back. And you will see the \"Analysis exception\" only on action (or an attempt to force analysis stage, like call of \"explain\")\n\nThat is a nice picture: the first \"Unresolved Logical Plan\" is fully lazy. Inferring of schemas from CSV, table, etc. happens at the \"Analysis\" stage.  \n[https://www.databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-12-at-8.41.26-AM.png](https://www.databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-12-at-8.41.26-AM.png)\n\n  \n\\> Like, if I’m just working on a single machine, is Spark giving me any real advantage over Pandas?\n\nThe only advantage is Spark can works in out-of-core mode and process data that is actually bigger than memory of your single node. But it comes with a huge distributed overhead. There are better solutions for single node case that can work in out-of-core mode (Polars in streaming mode, DuckDB, DataFusion that can spill to disk, etc.)",

I have an idea, but are you sure this solution is the best for your problem? It's better if you use a combination of standard approaches (column level masking with policy tags, row level access controls, authorised views) in my opinion.\n\nYou _can_ use custom masking routines in your column level security. This involves creating a UDF that operates on the column and decides how to mask it. To make this work, you need to insert suitable info into the column, so you'd need to do something a bit hacky:\n\n1. create a column in an upstream layer indicating whether a row's ID is present in your list of those-to-be-masked\n2. prepend some identifier to the column of interest if it's in a row that needs masking\n\n```\nSELECT\n    CONCAT(\n        IF(to_be_masked, 'MASKME::', ''),\n        valuable_col\n    ) AS valuable_col,\n...\n```\n\n3. Define your custom masking routine to strip the prefix and hash the value if the prefix exists, otherwise ignore it\n\n\nI think this would essentially get you what you want, but it looks brittle and is somewhat complex. Better to avoid if business requirements permit.",

You aren't going to have a \"Stripe\" module, but there is an \"InvokeHTTP\" module, where you can make any type of HTTP call, so just like you'd have to set the request type (POST, GET, PUT, etc), API enpoint and HTTP headers in Python, you'd have to set those in NiFi as well.

There are plenty of excellent data tools out there. Cloudera believes in openness, building a platform that works seamlessly with those great tools. At the same time, it is probably one of the very few vendors that can deliver a truly end-to-end data platform both on-prem and in the cloud. While Hadoop, and the architectural principles behind it, remain the backbone of big data, today the focus is on the powerful open-source technologies that sit on top of it and enable modern data architectures: Spark, MPP DWH engines, Iceberg, Airflow, Kafka, OpDB, NiFi, a lot of niche tools and the full set of UX augmentations, security and governance capabilities that unify everything under one roof regardles the infra underneath. And if you need more, Cloudera provides private, on-prem, or cloud-based environments for running your data applications, workbenches, and ML/AI models, all while keeping your data and applications securely within your own premises (or cloud account).\n\nThanks for reading my sales pitch.

I worked with a Microsoft MVP (recent MVP), author of several books, and expert level. His academic training is religious studies.\n\nIt’s also true that a non-computer science background puts you at a disadvantage you should consider. It would be wise to strategically plan how you will overcome this gap - and which areas you need to cover in what order. Surely, you don’t need to go back to school and major in it - but you also can’t ignore it. \n\nIt sounds like you are approaching this in a very logical manner. I suggest you spend some time looking at real colleges, reviewing their requirements for computer science (classes) and look through some syllabus’s. The outcome of this exercise is to gain visibility in what you are missing - essentially benchmark. Then you can look at this and see what you think is relevant to you. For example a class in TCP/IP may not be so important for data engineering. This should  all your anxiety by helping you to understand how you fit. Once you find some classes you think you are missing, just look at the syllabus, find the book, and buy the previous version of the book on Amazon for $10. Read it, study it, master it - move on. \n\nI really don’t see computer science degrees teaching data warehousing - so keep this in mind. You might be better off starting with Kimball (follow my same instructions). I would prioritize star schemas over compilers!\n\nEdit: a computer science degree isn’t a finish line, it’s a piece of paper. Looking at my peers, 20 years later, some of them were brilliant and really accelerated in their careers. Others got A’s on tests but couldn’t do hands on. They didn’t survive in the real world. I did very poor on tests, well on labs, and great post university. It’s all about how you apply your knowledge - the piece of paper only gets you the job interview.",

Why not price by usage?\n\nIf business doesn't want to adapt the business model, and cost exceeds what you earn from it, you'll increase your profits by deleting the feature. Also means your people are so restrictive that they're possibly suffocating the future potential of your business. This is a business problem.\n\n> For example, the usage logs show a customer is using an \"Enterprise\" feature, but the billing system has them on a \"Pro\" plan. The agent doesn't know what to do and might give a wrong or confusing answer.\n\nWhat are you saying?:\n\n* The customer has access to an Enterprise feature they shouldn't have and is actively using it. -> Engineering bug, fix your code.\n* The usage logs are broken and are misreporting a Pro feature as an Enterprise feature. -> Engineering bug, fix your logs.\n* The AI agent is given access to tools including Enterprise features, and sometimes uses Enterprise features even when a client is on a Pro plan. -> Engineering bug, adapt/restrict available agents based on plan.\n\nEither way, engineering bug. LLMs only reply based on content/context/agents they have access to. Not an LLM problem.",

It’s generally not a good idea to give end users the ability to arbitrarily query the warehouse directly. If you want to give them access to this data, it needs to be treated as a product and exposed by a predictable (rate-limited!) API.\n\nFor example, I work a lot with Confluent Cloud. They have a billing API backed by Apache Druid. It’s designed from the ground up to ingest billing events, aggregate them, and expose carefully designed analytics through an API. No ad-hoc queries by an AI agent.\n\nMaybe for you it’s not ad-hoc queries but it starts to look like the “[N + 1 Problem](https://planetscale.com/blog/what-is-n-1-query-problem-and-how-to-solve-it)”, where instead of deciding ahead of time the queries users can make, the AI is interpreting what the humans want and making multiple queries in a row.",

Move the early steps, such as intent parsing, task planning, and tool calls, to smaller models like gpt-4o-mini or claude haiku. Keep gpt-4 for final synthesis. That shift alone can drop query cost from around $0.75 to roughly $0.30.\n\nThen tighten the workflow: cache outputs, remove duplicate sub-queries, and resolve data conflicts before the LLM using a simple source hierarchy (billing wins). When conflicts remain, show them to the user with context.\n\nLangfuse is great for tracing, but you’ll also want per-tenant caps and cost alerts at the orchestration layer. Once you hit about 5,000 users, that’s a must.\n\nThat $75k/month burn is real, but with routing alone, you can get it down to $35-40k.",

They shrink, stabilize, fix the mess, and then grow again.\n\nYou can apply the same mindset to BigQuery.\n\nIf it is possible in your org, try this for 1–2 months: cut access from unskilled users. Not forever, just long enough to stop the random migrations and “oops I scanned 40 TB” moments. Let a small, competent group model the data first. Build solid, optimized tables that everyone else can use safely.\n\nThen give people access back in stages. But pair that with training. Teach them how to use partitions, clusters, and how cost scales. Once they’re actually proficient, open things up again.\n\nIt’s the same as raising a kid. You don’t give full freedom on day one. You limit, teach, guide, and expand as they grow.\n\nOrganizations are no different. Sometimes you need to intentionally shrink the surface area, regain control, and only then let people roam free again. This approach can save you from endless BigQuery firefighting.",

First DE assess the DBT code, snowflake way of handling features, then back to the data model. Sometimes, changes needs to be made at the snowflake level or at DBT level or at the process level like incremental load vs full refresh and model doesn't need to be changed.

I think that is ideal to get started with local development, as it also creates a basic Airflow project structure for you, where you can add your DAG. If you are on mac, just install it via brew install astro, then make a new directory for your project and run:\n\n    astro dev init\n\nAnd afterwards, run the following command to start your local Airflow environment:\n\n    astro dev start\n\nI would not recommend switching to Airflow 2, there are enough pragmatic ways to get the latest version running. If you still have issues, please share a few environment details and the actual error.\n\nHave fun 🫶",

One day you will want to add unit tests for the transformation, for corner cases, etc. and having logic in pure functions (functions that takes DataFrame and return DataFrame) will simplify things, because you won't need to mock i/o, but can just write tests.\n2. Move configuration logic away from transformation logic. You can create a singleton \"context\" class or an abstract class for the \"job\" and re-use it everywhere. When I say \"configuration\" I mean things like partition dates, input schemas or s3 paths. Again, it will simplify both maintenance (anyone who wants just to check a path or a config do not need to dive into transformation logic) and testing (you can test config and transformation separately).\n3. Do not write a very long chain of pyspark transformations, it is really hard to read. Instead separate logical parts into small functions. Simplify reading the code, transformation and testing.\n\nOverall: the main benefit of using PySpark DF API over SQL is that you can benefit from all the Python tooling for working with growing complexity of the codebase (functions, classes, imports, objects, tests, etc.). So, such a migraton, imo, makes sense only if you are going to use this benefits. In other words, you should start thinking about your ETL as about the software product and use the correspondence best practices. If you just convert SQL to DF API calls it will be much worser: you won't use benefits of DF API, but you will suffer from downsides of DF API.",

However, I pretty much made my living undoing the work that people like this did. I don't really have the bandwidth to get too involved, but if you want to DM me and connect, I'd be happy to review whatever approach you get recommended by said freelancers and give my thoughts.\n\nIn all data projects, the most difficult part isn't so much the technology, but rather understanding the inputs and outputs. To hire a freelancer or get some better feedback from us here, you'll need a comprehensive list of all the platforms you want to source data from, the available methods of extracting that data, where you want to send it, and how you want to interact with it. For example, do you just want to run consolidated reporting from the various platforms you've mentioned? Do you want to push data from one into another? How often will the data need to be updated? etc. etc.",

Specifically, my suggestion would be for them to simplify the model as they work on delivering on the roadmap initiatives and focus on decluttering one entity in the model during each initiative.\n\nAlso, a nice side effect will be downstream items consuming the model will break as you make the updates.

The Backend and Tasks seem to be the main expansion of your transactional data, so your processing bottleneck will hit there first. I don’t think your CMS and Docs will expand on an exponential scale compared to the other 2.\n\nExplore docker, kubernetes and Airflow, then see if you can have your ETL/ELT processes organised for them to be running in parallel or sequence. I’m not too sure cost-wise if it’s cheaper to run via EC2 instances or directly using the services directly in cloud (Google Composer). Use airflow to produce an aggregated table so that the BI reports pull the required info quickly.\n\nFor the 60 man organisation, ask yourself if the staff are well versed to write their own queries, or are they excel-dependent.

I will keep the advice general and vendor-neutral.\n\nYou are on the right track. What you are feeling now is the natural boundary of relying on complex views in OLTP Postgres for BI and cross-system logic. The good news is that your data volume is still small, so you have a lot of cheap, simple options before needing a heavy architecture.\n\nA very important point: you do not need to move out of Postgres yet. One of the biggest cost-effective wins is to stop running 20-join views and instead materialize those transformations into tables on a schedule. Postgres can easily serve modeled fact and dimension tables for years at your size. And even in a warehouse or a data lake, you end up materializing tables anyway, so this work is never wasted.\n\nIf you eventually add a warehouse, S3 + Athena or Snowflake are both very cost-conscious. You are already on AWS, your data volumes are small, and both fit the medallion pattern cleanly. Athena is extremely cheap (5$ / TB processed). Snowflake gives more predictable performance on small workloads. If you are comfortable running your own infra, ClickHouse on a single VM is one of the strongest low-cost OLAP choices and works well for real-time dashboards.\n\nWhatever platform you choose, keep your transformations in SQL. At your scale, you do not need Spark or distributed compute. Most transformations and even ML feature engineering can be done in SQL. Use Python only where absolutely necessary.\n\nA big structural improvement is to model your Backend and Camunda data properly once. Instead of repeating joins or routing everything through a massive consolidated view, create clean fact and dimension tables in Postgres or the warehouse. This will eliminate most of your current performance limitations.\n\nFor ML and RAG, storing curated datasets as Parquet in S3 is ideal. Cheap, flexible, and compatible with all downstream tools.\n\nFor ingestion, modeling, scheduling, and lineage, you can keep things simple by using a single unified tool. Bruin can pull from&to Postgres and APIs, run SQL transformations, and give you lineage and a catalog without stitching together multiple systems.\n\nIf you prefer a more modular setup, dbt plus a scheduler (Airflow, Prefect, Dagster) is the standard alternative.\n\nAt your stage, a simple setup is enough: keep everything in Postgres with materialized tables, or store raw data in S3 and model it in Athena or Snowflake before sending it to Metabase and saving ML datasets in Parquet. This keeps costs low and gives you a clean foundation for BI, ML, and RAG.",

Instead of provisioning multiple large personal clusters on databricks for each contributor, we can do the same with a single SQL warehouse serverless and some k8s, for a cheaper infrastructure cost.\n\nI witness a lot of poor Dataiku deployments with poor architecture choices, relying on the underperforming DSS engine for most task.

I understand there are a lot of good reasons in favor of being opinionated by default, but that's a separate matter. Re performance, I suspect if duckdb is using indexing or parallelization, which is not yet implemented in zsv, it could be much faster in elapsed time where core/CPU is not maxed, but I can't see anything from these quick tests suggesting that DuckDB is faster in total CPU time or in a single-threaded environment, or in an environment where all CPU cores are otherwise being maxed out. I'm not even sure DuckDB's output is correct when it doesn't report an error (see above example with the extraneous text in the output)-- I see plenty of recent issues reported that DuckDB does not handle double-quotes correctly, though at least some seem to have been resolved. That said, I'm very interested in any evidence anyone finds to the contrary of this brief dive!",

Also tried to work with AWS's Bedrock equivalent, which was abysmal (so we had to roll our own and it was also not great). It's fascinating to see that to really make this work you almost have to do more work than if you just had an Analyst tasked with making queries on an ad hoc basis.

Do I still want to grow my technical skills? If I become a manager, would this hinder my time capacity to juggle both technical projects and managing people at the same time.\n2. If I become a leader - what kind of leader should I be? Should I stay technical and handle 50% of the implementation, or focus more on the high level architectures and strategies of the team.\n\nI'd also encourage you to discuss your concerns with your CDO - since he has more context on your situation. Communicate openly about your goals, and create an actionable plan on how you can achieve them.\n\n>Should I explore an alternative career trajectory, such as transitioning toward a Data Scientist role?\n\nOnly consider this if you're interested in Statistics/Quantitative projects. A big part of Data Science is story-telling and communicating results to business stakeholders.\n\nI personally stuck with DE because I love the software part of the job; building pipelines, optimizing Spark jobs, managing AWS/GCP costs etc.\n\nMost people don't realize Data Science has more to do with communication than technical - that's why many Econ/Social Sciences people do well in data science (not talking about MLOps or hard core data science PhD jobs of course)\n\n>What critical internal questions should I ask myself to ensure I make the most informed decision about my future path? \\*Should I ask for a salary update? of how much? 15%?\n\n15% raise is reasonable for promotions or \"very good\" performances. In general, single digit raise for non-promotions is normal. Double digit for promotions, exceptional or new job.\n\nFor salary negotiations, I'd start with having a X number, where X is the highest you'd want. Then ask for slightly higher than X. Also have a number Y which is the minimum salary you would accept,\n\nDuring salary conversations, try to center the conversation around your future responsibilities at the company, and re-defining your current scope of job to match that new salary.\n\nHope this helps!",

That setup gives you second-level latency, but it’s a lot of infra to maintain and debug.\n\nIf you’re okay with a few minutes delay, it’s usually easier to land raw CDC tables in a warehouse using a managed connector and build an incremental dbt model that joins them together. You can re-materialize the wide table on a schedule, and it’s much simpler to manage than a full stream topology. For 500M rows, ClickHouse will handle this fine if you pick a good sort key; BigQuery works too, but watch out for costs on frequent MERGE operations. I wouldn’t rely on triggers in Postgres unless you have a very low write rate. they’re painful to debug and can slow your OLTP side.\n\nWhat kind of latency do you actually need, and are those 7 tables small dimension tables or all large fact-like tables? \n\nAs a fully managed solution, you could check out Estuary. It can handle log-based CDC and any of your destinations + a bunch of cool features like schema evolution. I work at Estuary, so take that into account.",

Create a denormalized representation of this, and then describe it using something like jsonschema for the data contract.\n   * Whenever any one of these attributes changes, generate the domain object and publish to something like kafka/kinesis/etc.\n   * The consumer can subscribe to the feed, redirect it into a file or table, etc.  And from there are in a better position to perform additional transformations on the data.",

I had to learn to observe negative space, proportions, values, and all sorts of details that I wouldn’t have even noticed if I hadn’t trained my brain to think that way. It is a completely different way of thinking (and seeing the world) from programming. Switching between the two ways of thinking I found to be incredibly difficult and mentally exhausting.

It's because many people who know how to do IT-type stuff are incredibly good at doing those kinds of things. What they are generally terrible at is communication, for example explaining how some library or other works.\n\nGood succinct explanations would make even the most difficult technology accessible to all. \n\nThink about Amazon Web Services. When I started to look into it a few years ago I became really depressed because I thought I had suddenly become stupid. It was almost impenetrable. Now that I know something about it I find myself asking, \"Would it really hurt AWS to write just a few pages – just two, for crying out aloud – that tells beginners what the hell the whole thing is about?\"\n\nI have just bought a book on Terraform. It's good but only because I already know about Terraform. Documentation is similar. Too much of it is written by people who think that everyone understands things already.

AI, at least right now, is prone to bad coding style, prone to bugs, prone to weird decisions. A person who lets an AI do his task for him and does not oversee the result, he also will leave such nonsense in his project. And it will be visible to recruiters. Some recruiters for sure will leave out such people.\n\n2)interview stage: when a person does not know what he is doing it will be much more apparent during the interview. He can't explain why he wrote his project the way he wrote (well, the way his AI wrote). He is unable to make changes when asked. Sometimes the interview will give him Leetcode exercise. As he did not solve his assignments on his own, he will be unable to solve these Leetcode exercises on the spot.\n\n3)probation period. First 4 months or so.

It’s pretty easy to go to C++ with an uunderstanding of C, but hard to come back to C when you’re accustomed to things like vectors, stdlib functions and so on.\n\nI urge you to have atleast a minimal amount of pure C programming in low level fundamentals like memory, containers like arrays and so on. You can continue using C++, but you’re still being abstracted away from low level, just that you still have an option should you choose it.\n\nBy extension, learn a tiny bit of assembly as well. It’s generally impractical and isn’t seen as a general use language, but it comes in handy some times. Not to mention the theoretical understanding you develop in learning to use it, and a few discouraged programming paradigms that it makes you use like goto. It makes you think in interesting ways.",

You’ll learn way more by diving deep into data structures, algorithms, and systems programming than by trying to juggle two paths at once. Add Git, Linux, and CMake early, and after each topic, build something small, a console app, a mini game, or even your own data structure implementation. That’s where real learning happens.

Though you might also do quite a bit of C if you focus on embedded systems. \n\nCS and SE are both software-focused, but CS focuses more on the lower level infrastructure and usually applies more computational mathematics and algorithms to make complex computations faster and  more efficiently. SE is more higher level and focuses on architectural patterns of larger complex systems and making them more scalable and maintainable.\n\nSource: I was a CE major that switched to SE major during the second half of my studies.

        "body": "I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering.\n\nComputer Engineering is a sub-discipline of Electrical Engineering that branched off in the 1960s and 1970s. It focuses heavily on electrical theory and its application to digital systems. Main focuses are electronic components, signalling systems, control systems, circuitry, embedded and integrated systems, logic design, and system programming. Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering students will typically have a high degree of common courseload.\n\nComputer Engineering students at most universities will do a lot of VHDL/Verilog programming, as well as a lot of C programming. CE programs often include a number of compulsory Software Engineering courses focuses on operating systems and data structures; at some institutions these courses may fall under Computer Science.\n\nComputer Engineering is not for the faint of heart. It is brutal, but if you enjoy the guts of computers, you will love it.\n\nSoftware Engineering is a fairly new Engineering discipline and is still not as widely accredited as Computer Engineering. Software Engineering is an endeavour to apply the principles of engineering (ethics, public interest, safety, principled design, etc...) to what has historically been a tradecraft.\n\nPurist arguments aside, Software Engineering focuses almost exclusively on the practical aspects of programming and software development with a light dusting of multi-discipline studies.\n\nA spate of high-profile and high-casualty structural failures (bridges, buildings, viaducts, waterworks, etc...) during the early 1900s taught us that traditional engineering disciplines needed to be carefully regulated to ensure that members of the public weren't put into danger by people who had no idea what they were doing.\n\nA spate of high-profile and sometimes high-casualty software and/or control system failures (Therac-25, Cherynobyl, Three-Mile Island, the entire company of Boeing, Mars Climate Orbiter, etc...) during the 1970s through 2000s taught us the same thing about software development. Everyone involved in critical design and decision making needs to have their eye on the ball at all times; failing to do so can result in death.\n\nComputer Science is a field of applied mathematics and is more concerned with theory and abstract concepts than practical application of those concepts. I once worked with an individual with a PhD in Computer Science who hadn't done *any* actual programming; his interests were largely data driven business analytics.\n\nWhereas Computer Engineering and Software Engineering are accredited Engineering programs with a fairly standardized level of instruction across institutions, Computer Science is not. A Computer Science program at one institution may be radically different than a Computer Science program at a different institution.\n\nIn Summary,\n\nIf you think you might enjoy Computer Engineering, buy yourself an inexpensive FPGA development board such as the [Terasic DE10-Nano](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=167&No=1046) or ask for one for christmas. If you enjoy mucking about with that, then Computer Engineering is the field of study for you.\n\nIf you think that you might enjoy Software Engineering, start biting your teeth on C and C++ if you haven't done so already, do some tutorials in Qt (or any other application development framework), and get familiar with POSIX operating systems\n\nIf you think that you might enjoy Computer Science, study the differences between binary search trees, B-Trees, and B+-Trees. Read up on the latest AI craze. Try and understand what a Quaternion is and how it is used in 3D graphics.\n\nFeel free to throw any questions my way.",

You'll still take some upper level mathematics, but you aren't going to need to know about how to solder components or do any physics beyond the intro level. \n\nSoftware Engineering generally removes even more upper level mathematics and caps you out at Calculus or Discrete Mathematics. It is focused the most on coding and software development as a field. This is what most people actually want. \n\n  \nSpecial mention goes out to the IT and Networking degrees that will also introduce coding classes, but also focus on other aspects of how computers interact with the world at large.",

In a few universities, they are very upfront about this: you might enter a general ICT program, and then in your 4th year, you choose a specialization which might be Software Engineering, Data Science or Computer Engineering. In most cases, there's huge overlap in these majors.\n\nThat is because these programs tend to focus mostly on skill-building. It's useless to just have knowledge if you can't \"run\" fast enough, or \"jump\" high enough, mentally-speaking, to do actually code at an effective level. That's why using generative AI to help too much is basically  shooting yourself in the foot, as you're wasting all that time and money for no actual gain.\n\nComputer Science mostly involves math and logic. Computer Engineering adds electronics to math and logic. Software Engineering adds a little \"business management\" to math and logic.

So, if you want to learn about debugging, learn the fundamentals of logic and then practice until you get used to the thinking patterns.

Programmers like to write/talk about the parts of coding they like. This is why you'll find recursion or other advanced topics in introductory materials.\n\nWriting about debuggers and coming up with follow-along exercises of using a debugger for a non-contrived program is tough and tedious and programmers don't like doing it. So often, they just don't do it.\n\n(The same applies for documentation and testing.)",

How to declare and manipulate variables, how to design a function, how to solve problems with loops and generics, how arrays work. Then when learning a new language, you can search, \"How to declare a constant array in language X\" because you know what questions to ask.\n\nThe best way to get an answer your question is to think of something small that you wish existed, maybe an app that does something really specific like sort your files into folders a certain way. Maybe a mod for one of your favorite video games. Do a little research into a good language for making that happen, then just make it.\n\nIf you want to do low-level programming, such as interfacing with an operating system, C++ will be more useful. If you want to do game development, C# will be more useful. Almost any language can solve almost any problem though, and you can ask which of two languages to use and get 20 different answers, and all of them will have merit.",

Tone back the anxiety and dread and allow yourself to rest a little, making bits of progress. Follow their request. Be more communicative. \n\n\nIf you were there for that long, they likely won't be firing you if you maintain a positive attitude, check in more, and ask for advice. \n\n\nIn fact, you could probably slow your progress to an absolute crawl, but they might not care if you're really great to be around and look as if you're working hard.\n\n\n.\n\n\nDon't devolve yourself into a puddle of stress and anxiety. When you talk to your boss, don't have every conversation be about how stressed you are, how you're feeling down, etc. \n\n\nInstead, hold it in and be chipper. Instead of, \"I'm so stressed I don't know what to do can you help me?\", ask \"hey, I got done with that task you gave me! Am I progressing alright? If you need to me to speed it up, I'll be right on it!\"\n\n\nIf they tell you're great with some little nitpick, don't speed up and stress. Thank them for the feedback and maybe throw in a nice comment or two. \n\n\nIf they say you can pick up the pace a little, don't speed up and stress. Instead, \"Got it! I'll get right to it! Do you have any advice for me to help me along, perhaps something to focus in on?\"\n\n\nThey might give advice or direct you to your coworkers.  \n\n\nWhen you talk to your coworkers, don't be down, sad, and anxious. Let them know, \"man, I've been making so much progress but that imposter syndrome is vicious. You ever get that feeling?\" \n\n\nIf they're open to it, ask them what they've done to overcome it and how they progressed. You can spin negative things in a positive light through tone, word choice, and body language. \n\n\nYou can also throw in, \"I finished that one task, for some reason it was an absolute doozy! Still. I'm sorry for getting in a bit late. Would you have some advice for being more effective next time?\" to whoever assigns the task. They may already say it via their response, but you can also slip in a question about their expectations for the time frame and how to speed up your workflow to match it.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nStop judging yourself based on your own inflated metrics. Don't judge yourself on other people's behalf. Let them determine whether you're making good progress (like your boss said) or not.\n\n\nAs long as you actively *show* people you're improving, then they'll be lenient towards you. You don't show them by sitting in a corner by yourself stressing. You actively talk to them, keep it positive, don't reveal how seriously stressed you've been, and slowly open *them* up for advice and help. See what they're feeling, their thoughts, and their processes. Ask for their advice on your current work, your plans for progress, etc. Don't overwhelm them, but give them little bits to bite at while you're allowing them to speak a lot about themselves and their work/feelings. Make sure to let them know how great their advice was after you've implemented it.\n\n\nIf you present yourself as a good listener, pleasant to talk to, open to feedback, and always seeking advice, even if your progress is a small fraction of the speed it is now, people will *feel* like you're working harder than ever before, even with missing tasks dates. That's the beauty of perception. ",

If necessary then participate in the next team event and just have either one on one talk or one on X talk. Either sit down with them in a sauna and just sit in that hot place and talk with everybody. Or, if you are drinking alcohol then drink with others. Or something else. Point being: be in a relaxing environment and just talk with people as fellow people not as your team mates. Talking helps. Little ranting helps. They will tell you how they see it. Just bond with your team not grow distanced of everybody.\n\nBut coming back to your work then it is absolutely normal that you won't be on the same level as everybody else after being a junior just for 5 months. Forget comparing yourself with mid-level or senior-level developers. They are mid and senior because they have a whole lot of more experience, knowledge and skills. And they gained it with time. They also were juniors once. They also were slow, once. And even there is no point to compare yourself with other juniors. Every junior has a different past. Some juniors got a degree. Do you have a degree or you have a diploma or neither? Some juniors participated in computer clubs and such, during their studies. Some have been coding since a kid/teenager because their parents were in the IT field.\n\nCompare yourself only with the past you. Did you learn anything new during the sprint (or, if your team is not using sprints then during last week/month)? If you did, then well done. You are only competing with yourself. Not with others.\n\nAsk your boss if the time estimate in these tasks is taking you into consideration or the time estimate is how majority of the team members should be able to finish it in time. Let's say the time estimate is 3 days. Is this 3 days what your team mates should be able to do it in given time or is this 3 days also what a fresh junior should handle? Ask him what will happen when you deliver your task one or two days later. Depending on a project it can be that nothing happens. Some projects are quite agile. Client is fine with waiting some days more. Other are public sector projects where the government and ministries are setting fixed deadlines that can't be changed. Perhaps you delivering your stuff one or two days later, as a new junior, is totally fine. YOU must talk with your boss over this.\n\nYou are not expected to work off the clock. This can give wrong idea to the boss. Perhaps they should put more days or story points to the estimate when going over the tasks in the backlog. But when you are working at the night or something then they will not see this (unless you push your stuff, then pipelines will leave a mark behind). Work 8 hours a day. For the better or for the worse. You doing overhours WILL start affecting the quality of your tasks. Right now you are freaking out over a bug. The next time you might blow up their test environment or something. Because of being too tired, from working more than 8 hours. Stop working more. Get rest.\n\nBugs happen. This is why QA and/or developers testing the product exist. Even mids and sometimes senior developers have a bug in their code, a missed business case. Or a client asks something to be changed. You have to write tests to your functionality. Then test locally. Then test in your team's testing environment (if it exists). And after that pass it on to your team mates (QA or just other developers). They will do a code review and will do the testing. It is a normal process flow. Especially as it was a small bug. That is fine.\n\nYour boss is right. You must communicate more. If you are stuck then ask for help. Tell what you tried, what did not work out, where do you think the issue is (or where it is not). And people will help you out then. If you feel that you are running out of hours then talk with your boss. It is his job to ask more hours from the client or re-prioritize tasks. But when you are not communicating with your team and with your boss, then nobody can help you.",

Learn how to code without AI, re-learn the basics and start from scratch because that is what its going to take. Do it in your free time so it doesnt immediately affect your work. Pick a stack and stick with it, i suggest picking something you have already worked with because you will already be familiar with it.\n\nDo some small projects without AI, just using your problem solving skills, documentation, and stack overflow if you need. You will still need to identify a problem, identify multiple solutions, and decide which solution is best applicable to your problem. \n\nYou wont git gud tomorrow or next week. Itll take time but you need to put in the work and stop outsourcing to AI. AI should be an assistant not a crutch.",

It would help to know alot about the local population nearest the target location, their timing, methods, patterns... I could go on and on and on. if you gotta break into shit, it helps to know as much about it as possible, in every way possible, from every angle possible. pentesting is like the techno version of that, so yeah its not software engineering, but its certainly not easier then just software engineering, and while you wont need to know how to build and maintain tiktok 2.0, you still gotta know a lot about a lot, and for many pentesters that overall career starts with doing software engineering, you can also get into security by being a systems administration nerd or network engineering nerd, so if you dont wanna do make software then go the networking/admin angle and so lookup reddits for those other techno guys and ask questions there, r/sysadmin is a popular one.",

We have noticed how one team had started producing visibly worse PRs recently. With stuff that clearly comes from an AI: needless comments, helper methods that make no sense, deleted parts of unit tests / integration tests, unnecessary visibility modifications (making a method public when it has absolutely no reason to be public), using full-path dependencies in a code (instead of using \"import this.is.some.package.dependency\" they use it as \"var this.is.some.package.dependency = some value or initialization\", etc. Stuff that serves no purpose or is even dangerous (deleting functionality to \"fix\" tests).\n\nWe have just rejected such PRs when the PR makes no sense. If it is a small code smell or such, we let them change it. If it is a nonsense, then we reject it and tell to rewrite the code. \"IDK\" is not acceptable answer to comments that we add.\n\nThere have been also some complaints that we do not accept such PRs and the task stays unfinished because of taking too much time in the code review phase. But then we just escalated our concerns to our managers. It is their responsibility to talk with the managers of other teams for them to deal with their developers. Inside our team we do use AI tools but we also share both pros and cons with each other to teach the whole team to not fully rely on an AI and to not permit AI-generated code that does not first pass the review/criticism of the developer himself. \n\nWe also are using SonarQube tool for checking some of the more common mistakes in coding style and such. The person who is pushing his PR has to fix these findings before even forwarding the PR to somebody for a review. We will not consider a PR that has unfixed findings from SonarQube and from one vulnerability check scanner.\n\nAlso, the PR has to have a good test coverage (measured by another tool). Adding a feature without tests that verify its functionality, that also is not an option. The coverage % will drop and is visible from the PR.\n\nI'd say that first talk with these bad actors. If talking does not work then escalate it to your manager. And just reject such PRs / do not approve these. Set merge rules to prohibit a merge without an approval. So they can't even sneak pass your unapproved review.",

Why don't they just rewrite the code in a new language.\n\nHere are some reasons why not\n\n* The code is extremely large\n* No one knows how the code works fully\n* The code isn't commented\n\nWhen you have a million lines of code that has been tested and debugged, and you're asked to recreate its behavior, how do you do it? Not all code is written well. Some of it is pretty crappy. But it still functions. \n\nYou can also lose intent. Why does this code do what it does? What was the business logic behind this case or that case?\n\nMost programming is on existing code. Rewrites are generally quite uncommon. Writing completely new code is rather uncommon too.\n\nFor example, a lot of AI programming is being done in Python. Because there are communities using Python, there's not a great push to move that to, say, Rust or Gleam.\n\nYou fall into the trap many beginners fall into. You think a language is obsolete because one person says it's so. You look at the newest, shiniest language, even though few people have adopted it because you think one day, it will become popular.

A lot of people think they wanna go super specific with their degree when they're applying for college and often end up regretting not going broader and exploring more. As you take classes, maybe you'll find that you're really into data science/engineering, or hardware, or machine learning. A focused SWE/SDE degree would likely limit the amount of classes you can take in those areas, whereas a computer science degree would give you a lot more flexibility.",

If you can then check out which courses these two curriculums are having. And then decide based on that. If the curriculum is not listing the courses then contact a dean office or a student councilor and ask from them. It is their job to guide students and people who want to start their studies in given university.\n\nBut going purely by a guess then better pick software engineering. It should cover more than just a development. Because real life software development is not only writing code but more than that. Software engineering curriculum should be more relevant. But that is just a guess based on the names of curriculums. When you want a real answer then contact the university.\n\nGame development does not mean you'll be making a game from start to end. Even in games there is a backend, frontend/design, infrastructure, devops, data science, cyber security, QA, etc. Different roles. And, let's say you will pick game development. Are there any jobs in your area for game developers? \n\nAnd when it comes to web application development and being a backend side developer, then again, decide it based on the job offers in your area. Are there right now jobs for juniors? \n\nWhere I live, the job market is not doing well. We are living inside an AI bubble. Non-IT people (HR, managers and such) are investing more into AI tools because they think that the AI is better than a human developer. And they are not hiring juniors that much. As a software developer I say, the current AI is performing perhaps worse than some junior developers. Yes, it can generate code but it requires a constant overseeing. Or it will generate nonsense that a)does not compile, b)deletes existing functionality, c)introduces bugs, d)does not cover all the required use cases.\n\nWhen the bubble will pop then there will be again more openings for juniors. Juniors so far should learn their specialty AND should learn how to use the AI (to be competitive) and how to NOT use the AI.",

Either way is valid and people will generally understand what you mean either way as long as you’re consistent.",

And then you have a new problem: figuring out why your solution is wrong.\n\nThis isn't a problem. It's just how programming works. If you are easily frustrated by this, then the solution is either to just keep learning and practicing and doing problems until it doesn't bother you as much, or else find a new hobby with fewer built-in frustrations.\n\nRegular practice is key. There are lots of good problem sets out there. For Python, I'm a fan of the Exercism tracks, although they can be a little unfriendly for very new programmers.",

Use what you learned, automate something, build a useful little app that makes your life easier.  \n\nIn this moment i’m learning python, but i really hated the dependencies and setting up the venvs and the testers and testing. So i went a little deeper to really understand that part and automated it. So now if i start a new project i run a makefile and it sets up the venv, main dependencies, linters, and a basic unit test. So i can start a new project or tutorial without worrying. While i learned a lot about dose parts. Next up ( i’m a devops engineer ) is setup the same thing for a basic CI/CD to eventually get my python code up into docker on my local homelab. These things i spend about 20/25% of my time on, i learn something for my job, i learn more about python and in the meanwhile i make my own life easier.\n\nMain get away is, enjoy the process!

Like when you play tic-tac-toe, you both see the actual board with Xs and Os, and you imagine how the board will look once you place your next mark.\n\nThat is also how software works, there is some sort of output, if not explicitly graphical or visual, at least observable in some way, and there is an invisible internal representation, that you can't experience, but that the program \"knows\" and uses to decide its next move, or determine who won. \n\nAnd in both games and programs there's input that manipulates the internal model - often with very different results, depending on the previous state of that model.\n\nAnd of course, games have rules - often you follow an actual algorithm when playing a game, or at least you have some fixed pattern of steps to perform, and there is, if not an algorithm, then a fairly strict way of determining a winner or loser, or if the game should continue.\n\nAnd most important of all for learning - there is a lot of repetition in games, both as a player and a developer you are iterating a lot, gradually improving, and always trying various combinations. So often you work a lot more with a game than any other program you are creating, you actually enjoy playing your own game, and try to beat it - whereas with a CRUD system for Student administration or a Car Rental, you'll just build one feature and get quickly on with the next one as soon as it seems to work sufficiently.\n\nSo there are a lot of similarities between playing games, creating games, and building programs.\n\nAnd they are often fun to create and use!",

You don't need to learn every single thing from all of those areas, or even from a single book. Just being familiar with the core ideas / basics helps a lot. Then slowly study more of those books and topics as time goes by.\n\nBut here are some of the best programming books that were popular already back in the 1990s:\n\n* The Art Of Computer Programming series of books (Donald Knuth)\n* Design Patterns (Gamma, Helm, etc.)\n* Anti Patterns (Brown, Malveau)\n* Refactoring (Martin Fowler)\n* Pragmatic Programmer (Hunt, Thomas)\n* Introduction To Algorithms (Cormen, Leiserson)\n\nThose should get you really far. And the more you test everything you've read and learned from the books, the faster you'll become good at what you do. So don't wait to try out the ideas from those books. Try them out when you're reading, if possible. Pick a project or two and develop them from start to finish. You'll learn tons that way. Only reading doesn't get you very far. You have to design and implement something larger.",

Functions can be given other functions as arguments which makes this quite a bit more powerful than it sounds at first.  \n\nBy all means learn useful OOP, but also learn functional programming concepts.

Go with Python for its clean syntax—check Codecademy's free module or Python docs to build easy classes, say a Car with drive and honk methods. Java's good too if you want stricter rules; Oracle's tutorials are free and solid.\n\nOnce that's down, build projects to make it real,a text RPG with inheriting character classes or a bank app with transaction types. Use Replit for quick setups and GitHub to track and learn from others. Do a couple projects monthly; that's where OOP clicks, not just reading.\n\nFor deeper stuff, grab \"Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design\" for its visual take or \"Clean Code\" for practical tips. freeCodeCamp has interactive sections, Coursera's Java OOP course from Duke is structured well, and YouTube spots like Corey Schafer show examples clearly.

I very much recommend that for a -very- deep dive!\n\n  \nIf you are more into data structures than user interfaces, taking a deep dive into the **Collections framework** in Java is another interesting example of using OOP!\n\n  \nAnd of course, there's always the option of building your own game - like e.g. **a simple text adventure**, with objects representing items, rooms and characters, using inheritance and polymorphism to give different items either similar or different attributes, and letting objects communicate, like hitting an enemy with a weapon could happen as the player-object calling a hit-method on the enemy-object with a weapon-object, and the enemy-object then asks the weapon-object how much damage it would inflict, and subtract from its own health.

Your post here shows, that you’re not ready to analyse a problem and break it down, so work on that, not the technical details. Making the program work is just about breaking each part down further and researching those bits (perhaps online on Reddit, Google, AI, or teachers/mentors). \n\n- what makes a folder good or bad?\n- how would you describe a folder? Just showing the content? Can that be a text? Is that easy to generate or would you need AI to summarize it? Do you need visual previews of all files, just some?\n- what do you want to select and delete? The folder as a whole or individual files?\n- do you want to open files or folders? The last bit was contradictory. \n- what does automating folder* opening mean? That the program has a list of all folders and then shows the first until you make a decision and then shows the next?\n- all folders on your system or just some? How can you identify those?\n- how can the system keep track of which folders you’ve already worked on and which are too do?\n- what happens if you add new folders while you are still in the process of reviewing the others? How can that be added to the Todos?\n- how do you want to submit your answer? Keyboard, mouse, swipe?\n- are you on a desktop or mobile?\n- OS?\n- which programming languages do you know? Which frameworks or tools?\n\nAnd so on, more questions will come as you answer more of them. And then at the very end you can research how to build a GUI app on your platform, or maybe a CLI tool will work.",

That is, **HOW did you break the big problem down into smaller ones?**\n\n* You _did_ write pseudo code, right?\n\n* You _did_ list what the inputs are, right?\n\n* You _did_ list what you know about the data, right?\n\n* You did _describe_ the data transform, right?\n\nOver time as you acquire more knowledge and experience you can skip the pseudo code because you will have \"tools in the toolbox\" and will have an intuitive sense of how to start breaking the problem down. Until then:\n\n* write down inputs,\n* write down givens, \n* write output(s), \n* write down **edge cases.**\n\nThe third problem is **lack of language knowledge.**\n\n* In order to _learn_ a (programming) language you need to not just read code but _write_ code (preferably daily) **without** having to look up FUNCTION names provided by your language's library. You need to know the basic libraries provide by your language.\n\n* NOTE: **It is fine to lookup PARAMETER order** (we all do this, even as professionals) but you _should_ be familiar enough with basic I/O and string manipulation _function_ names.\n\nLet's take a small example:\n\nWrite a program to read a text file and count the number of unique lines. \n\n* Do you know how to open and read a text file?\n  * Can you read one line into a string?\n  * Can you read all lines into strings?\n* What type of container for lines will you use? \n  * List? \n  * Vector? \n  * Array?\n* Do you know how to test if a line is unique?\n  * How do you do string comparisons? \n  * If they are case sensitive?\n  * If they are case insensitive?\n* What kind of searching for duplicated lines will you do?\n  * Linear search?\n  * Binary search?\n  * Hash map?\n\nStart with _small_ examples.\n\nHope this helps and good luck!",

Go vack to writing again. Got stuck? Repeat the process. Do it again in an hour or the next day.\n\n\nAs you're doing that, try to take time and understand *why* things are laid out that way. Edit things to see them break and understand why it broke, and try to build up a mental image of what's going on under the hood. Reverse engineer the algorithm. \n\n\n.\n\n\nI really like drawing out psuedocode and pictures/diagrams to simplify this thinking. \n\n\nIt's a lot harder for me to code, say, binary search by simply memorizing the code structure given to me vs drawing out some numbers in an array and what the process I need to follow to get my solution looks like. The former is rote memorization. The latter is understanding the algorithm in a human way. \n\n\nI use a bit of both to solidify it in my head. \n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nYou'll likely not be able to undesirable the algorithm well and build a mental model of what's going at first. This might happen for every single example you see.\n\n\nThat's ok. \n\n\nHave AI (or an assistant? Peers?) walk you through the code, line by line, and help you understand what's going on. Tell it to give analogies to help you build up that mental model. Watch a few videos on the topic if needed. \n\n\nThen recreate that mental model either explaining it out loud to an invisible class or by writing it out in a picture, diagram, or some other form of psuedocode. \n\n\n.\n\n\nThese mental models turn abstract and distinct ideas into things that build off of each other, helping you not only memorize the solutions, but help ease the learning of new solutions. \n\n\n.\n\n\nI'm going through a DSA course that's about 9 hours long. It sort of speeds through topics. \n\n\nI think I've clocked several times that amount going through it? That's because I'm regularly doing the above. \n\n\nI think that's because these topics he's talking about actually take a much longer time to actually learn properly, but despite it being aimed towards beginners, it's assumed I'm already at the point where these ideas are easily understood. \n\n\nThe curse of knowledge if you will. Which is fine, AI fills in the small gaps of knowledge and I can always research a topic if it gets too confusing. ",

I remember skipping classes sometimes just to finish a feature I was working on. For me, studying felt like a waste of time.\n\nWhat’s more, after about seven years of working as a freelancer, when I decided to switch to a full time job, I couldn’t get through the interviews even though I had built dozens of websites. There were always questions I had no idea about, even after all those years, or things I simply hadn’t used in a long time and couldn't remember anymore.\n\nSo I started creating my own flashcards, for example for JavaScript, and printing them out. After two or three months of learning in my free time, I knew the answers to all the questions I had prepared. I passed nine out of ten interviews (meaning I answered all their questions), and I think about half of the companies ended up offering me a job.\n\nBased on that positive experience, over a year ago I built an app with flashcards and quizzes for developers to prepare for technical interviews, and now a few thousand people use it. Most flashcards are free (about 70 percent across 30 categories), and the subscription unlocks quizzes, which also help track progress more effectively. Of course, all of this was before AI appeared. Today it is much harder to even get an interview invitation and there are far more candidates applying for each position, so in my opinion it is even more important to be well prepared in order to stand out.\n\nIf you’d like to test your knowledge, let me know.

Because then you can compare the versions and you too will see and understand how much you are improving.\n\n**Now to your question.**\n\nWith the current code structure, it is difficult to create an enum and then switch on that enum value, meaning it is time to write a new version of this code.\n\nYou could achieve this result using a `map` and an `enum`.\n\nHere is information on how to use a map: [https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map.html](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map.html)\n\nTo do this you would create an enum:\n\n    enum class Months\n    {\n      Summmer,\n      Autumn,\n      Winter,\n      Spring\n    };\n\nThen declare a map to map each month to an enum value:\n\n`std::map<std::string, Months> months;`\n\nThen you just load the map:\n\n    months[\"January\"]  = Months::Winter;\n    months[\"February\"] = Months::Winter;\n    ....\n    months[\"December\"] = Months::Winter;\n\nNow you can use this map to get an enum value for any user input and then switch on that enum value.\n\nBut make sure you also cater for the case where the user input is not found in the map.\n\nAlso consider making the map lookup case insensitive.",

        "body": "Functional programming is useful because programming is hard, and some types of problems are easier to solve with functional code.\n\nI think it’s exactly like pure math, if you have any experience there. You can use the epsilon-delta definition of a limit to prove a ton of stuff in Real Analysis. But you can revisit those same problems later using the lens of topology, and make some of it easier and some of it harder.\n\nAdditionally, functional programming typically comes with some very strong guarantees on mutability and which operations are dependent on each other, stronger than can be made in *arbitrary* non-FP contexts. This enables a different class of compiler optimizations. But of course, immutability has many of its own performance downfalls, so it’s incredibly application specific.\n\nTL;DR: functional programming is useful because it’s another tool in your toolbelt for solving very hard problems.",

You can sorta code with \"responsive HTML\" that adjusts itself to the width of the screen, but that's more UI tweak than fundamental design. Use a framework/toolkit/library to help you with that. You *should* know which ones if you supposedly have HTML/CSS/JS experience. \n\nSo, how would you design a calendar app? It's just a database with UI. So you need some sort of database backend. Pick one that fits your needs. (Complicated: Firebase. Simple as heck: SQLite)\n\nThen you need some sort of middleware linking database to the UI. That's what you program the \"webapp\" in. And you need to learn THAT. The combination of database and middleware and UI is sometimes called a \"web stack\". For example, the MERN stack is MongoDB as database, Express.js and Node.js as Middleware, and React for UI. No, not suggesting that. It's too complicated for your needs. Figure out the right stack for your project is YOUR responsibility. \n\nHow would an app send you message? Well... WHAT TYPE of message? Text Message cost money, notifications don't, but routing it to yourself requires going through some sort of OS API. Again, your own research. \n\nYes, I've kept things vague for a reason. I want YOU to finish the research. I merely gave you some ideas to get started.\n\nEDIT: If you still don't quite get it, I want you to NAIL DOWN the requirements first. Right now, your requirement is kinda vague. Write the requirements down, into a requirement document. You need it written down and set in stone (well, mostly) before you start. Else, you'll suffer \"feature creep\". \n\nTHEN you think about HOW TO MEET the requirements with your design, BEFORE you start coding. \n\nOnce you have the design and architecture of your app down, THEN you start picking it apart, and code it piece by piece. (and test piece and piece if you can). \n\nAs the cliche goes, (you eat an elephant) \"one bite at a time\".",

Sure, you can have the URL but without being authenticated, you'll get 401 error.\n\n3. Authorization. Fine, you figure out how to get authenticated. You make a new user. You are using its JWT token. But you are not added to relevant access groups. Maybe you can access your guest / new user related endpoints but nothing else. You might find an admin endpoint but as you lack access rights, you'll get 403 error.\n\n4. Rate limiting. You get this funny idea that you start scanning the host or start brute forcing or something. Your requests per second will be used up and you'll be either banned or timed out for time being.\n\n5. Hosting it behind some weird port. You'd expect a website to sit behind 80, 8080 or 443 port. What if I put it behind 49157? You typing in the URL without correct port will default to 80 and you will get either 404 error or some default placeholder webpage or something. My real service sits behind 49157.\n\n6. Region blocking/whitelisting. Let's say our client gets scam calls and emails from India. He has no business there. Then we can a)blacklist the whole India from accessing the service and Indians will get 404 or b)whitelist only these countries where our client makes his business. Many US services are blocking traffic from the EU because they do not want to comply with European cookie policy. Yes. you might say \"But VPN. I will use my xxxVPN account to appear from Uganda instead!\". Well, a list of IP addresses can and will be associated with certain VPN services. These can be also blocked.\n\n7. VPN blocking. One can use deep packet inspection tools to block people using VPN even when the traffic is encrypted.\n\n8. Honeypots. One can set up a fake environment. Go ahead and scan it and hack it and try to do whatever you want with it. Either you gain nothing with it or you'll leave traces about you behind. Honeypots are there to attract script kiddies and such.\n\n9. Throttling. Alternative to point 4. Instead of getting blocked or timed out your requests will slow down to an unusable level.\n\n10. Security services like Cloudflare. One can leave all the protection to such services. They will deal then with attack detection and mitigation and such.",

The API layer should also have some rate limiting/throttling to prevent spam or abuse. \n\nI do again want to stress that this doesn’t limit someone to only making requests from the extension, someone could just as easily make HTTP requests and include the auth token and pretend they’re using the extension. The point of the authentication layer is that every request is now tied to a user which prevents bots from just spam requesting and lets you ban abusive accounts. \n\nYou should also likely have some form of IP blacklisting to ban suspicious IPs, for your case where this is just a chrome extension it makes sense to also preemptively ban the IP blocks used by the major cloud providers, regular users won’t be using those and it’ll ban bots that are running on servers hosted by them.",

You want to generalize the technique. For example, sorting the values is one idea you can try.\n\nClearly, some problems you can't solve. Also, the choice of problem solving does depend a bit on language. If you have a function without explicit loops (such as many functional programming languages), then you express your solution differently. If the language has certain features like `str ** n` doing `n` concatenations of the string, `str`, then that leads to a simpler solution than if the language did not have such a feature.\n\nI liked reading \"How to Solve It\", an old book by mathematician, George Polya.",

What people are going to hire you to do is solve a specific problem, and it's up to you to figure out how to do that.\n\nHonestly, you'll have better luck learning something technical that doesn't necessarily require any coding at all - like learn to set up a Wordpress site, or a Shopify site. There are millions of small business owners that need a website and don't even know how to use a no-code drag-and-drop website builder. You could learn to do that in as little as a few weeks.\n\nPart of the trick is learning about various options and steering clients to the right one. Someone with a blog with several different authors would be a good fit for Wordpress. Someone selling handmade jewelry might be good for Shopify. A small number of clients really do need a custom website built from scratch with a React frontend - but most probably don't need that.\n\nIf you want to go that route, though, more than half your time will be spent running a business: marketing, advertising, talking to potential clients who never pay, chasing down payment, and even things like doing taxes and paperwork.

There are usually also some ergonomics and possibly performance tradeoffs.\n\nIt also varies by platform. Mobile OS development tends to be pretty restrictive.",

        "body": "General-purpose languages like Python, C, C++, C#, Java, etc, are meant to run code - All they really do is move data around and execute instructions. GUIs are something else. Like in the beginning, there was just the console terminal, and people had to write programs that moved the cursor, colored parts of the screen, wrote text on the screen buffer.  Then framebuffered graphics cards became a thing, and then all of a sudden there were window managers and bitmaps, but the languages pretty much stayed the same. Libraries of course helped create an interface between the language and how data was represented visually.\n\nThere will always be a separate layer between the general purpose language and the UI. Also, people have different ideas of how a UI should be represented. For example, the Win32 API lets you call the OS layer to draw windows, buttons and style them according to the OS, but that means you can't use your program code as-is on another platform like Linux.\n\nLibraries like GTK and QT attempt to solve this problem by creating their own API, which calls the underlying OS to create some of the OS-layer objects like windows, but does the rest of the display stuff itself, in order to have a consistent cross-platform experience.\n\nSo most language rely on separate libraries or frameworks, like C#/.NET having WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) that is Windows-only, or AvaloniaUI which is cross-platform, and MAUI, which is... well...\n\nThen different libraries have different ways of abstracting the layout, so WPF uses XML or rather XAML, Kotlin has it written as code.",

There are frameworks for building GUIs with imperative code, but they're not great to work with. \n\nDeclarative languages, however, are great for building GUIs. For example, HTML.

Then once you get the fundamentals down, you can go with more complex lessons like OOP, Java-specific things, etc.  You'll know you understand it enough when you start paying more attention to what AI outputs, and you go \"wait, why is it done this way instead of this?\".\n\nAlso I haven't mentioned it yet, but people would agree that another method to learn faster is to find a mentor or ask in Reddit or Discord communities.

Debugging code is where you actually start to build your diagnostic muscles.\n\nAny programmer will have tales of woe of the time they spent hours, if not days, hunting down something as trivial as a badly declared variable.  However, that suffering will have made them better programmers and probably taught them innumerable things they didn't realize at the time.\n\n> I ask AI what I can do too make the program better.\n\nWhile an LLM can barf out code that does stuff, it achieves this feat by stealing all available code from programmers it can find.  Fixing code is something an AI does far less well.  They will, of course, offer suggestions with complete confidence; which is kind of worse.\n\nComputer generated code has always sucked.  Now it's more clever about it, but a human can still put the bots to shame.\n\nA \"better program\" is also rather subjective.  Do you want clearer, faster, or smaller, all of which tend to fight against each other.  It should be what you think is better.

Have you seen the problem or a similar one before? How kind were the interviewers for that particular loop? How desperately do they need a role filled?\n\nHowever, I reject that there was ever a problem with testing how someone does under the pressure of being reviewed by another. In practice, that's what professional development is all the time. Pair programming, collaborative problem solving, and explaining your reasoning to people who are both technical and non-technical. If you freeze up during an interviewer because the interviewer is seeing the code you write as you write it, that's not a problem in the interview process. It's working as intended. Could interviewers do a better job of putting their candidates at ease? Absolutely, but we shouldn't write that skill set off as 'not relevant'.\n\nIt's been a while since I've conducted an interview. But given the recent advancements I'd be inclined to allow my candidates to use coding assistants. A good interviewer was never testing if you solved the problem in the perfect way. They were testing your reasoning and communication skills. And the coding assistant doesn't change that in any way. If you can use the AI in a way that is simply beyond asking it to solve the problem for you, show me that you're capable of reviewing and understanding the code it produces, then communicating that solution to me clearly and engaging in a thoughtful discussion about the solution you'll get a pass in my interview.",

I use it in my daily work. I can build web services that consist of separate microservices/monoliths and communicate with each other via Kafka or via some MQ tool. That is my position on backend web application development line. Yet when I add frontend side to it, then I have to take many steps back because I do not feel comfortable with stuff like React or Angular. I can get my tasks done but it is out of my comfort zone. I am yet to reach a point where I do not mind a Jira task that tells me to work on our frontend side. Or, a totally different direction: I'm still quite a beginner when it comes to creating mobile apps. I can get something done on a hobby project level. But I can't work as a mobile app developer. And programming a remote control? I can't do it. Probably can figure something out by reading documentation and using trial and error approach, but it is totally out of my specialty. And implementing a post-quantum cryptography algorithms? No idea at all.\n\nI use different stages/levels of projects to measure my knowledge and skills.

You are just taking the easy, lazy way and don't want to actually invest effort to **learn**. You just want to get the things done.\n\nThe first step is to change your mindset. You are currently going to the gym to watch the others do the lifting thinking you'd gain muscle that way. It doesn't work that way. *You* have to do the lifting to gain muscle.\n\nWhat you are currently doing is actively sabotaging yourself. You will quickly lose the little capabilities you have so far and become 100% dependent on a third party that may or may not be available when you need it most. You are basically hiring a (bad) contractor to do your work.\n\nThe best way to actually learn is to forget that AI even exists for anything other than explanations or exercises.

List all the pages and features needed. Let the people with frontend experience work on the website, the others on the backend.  \nCreate a task list, begin with the easy ones, when people work at the same time make them work on different pages, and use git.\n\n2.

It's basically like shooting a laser in some direction and checking if it hit anything. You can try very much simplified version of it by just making some red and blue lines come out of the specific sides of the character and maybe 1 or 2 a bit forward.

It does make sense to also parameterize the \"1 hour\" part assuming folks using the API would be interested in other time frames, too.\n\nI think I prefer /centers as the end-point, since presumably a list of that resource is the return value, and the rest as query parameters treated as filters.

Or they could have filter added to the query parameter name.\n\nI would not do it as 2 queries without knowing more requirements that would justify an API like that. You'd want an API like that for various reasons. But without any reasons, you may as well just make the API as friendly to the user calling it as possible. 1 call is certainly more friendly than 2. It's also almost always more performant, though I wouldn't worry about performance without a specific reason to.\n\nSince it's your API, you can of course require the user to pass the item ID in. Since the requirement is so open-ended, I would just assume the user has an item ID, unless there's some reason to think they don't. If you don't have an item ID I'd change the end-point to /items and add a search query parameter.",

I mostly agree with you but having been in the industry a bit longer, maybe I can offer some perspective.\n\n\n- \"more than a year\" is not that long, especially to see the fruits of your hard work learning the trade. I think it's pretty normal for it to be overwhelming in the beginning, too.\n\n\n- don't stop learning new technologies just because there are new ones coming out every other week. The opportunity cost of switching technologies is pretty high for a company (depending on how deeply integrated it is) so chances are in your career you will sometimes work on stuff that is not bleeding-edge, and having learned a varied set of tools is likely to be if use eventually. Not to mention you will start seeing patterns at some point, which will make you grow as a dev\n\n\n- AI: sure this is transforming the profession in many ways, but try not to over-rely on it as a junior. Some things have to be learnt the hard way. Never keep going if you don't understand what you're doing. It's fine if it's AI or not your idea, but take the time to understand it first. Challenge it if you can. Also yes, many investors and execs would love to completely replace developers with AI, and this is making the market more difficult for junior developers. But if we want seniors tomorrow we need to train juniors today. I mean not everybody agrees with this but it is an argument worth making in my opinion (in interviews, etc)\n\n\nAnyway I hope this helps. This is just my two cents, I'm sure others will have other ideas",

Writing software is easy, once you figure out what you want to make, you can bang it out pretty fast. LLMs make this part even faster, which can be nice, especially when I have writer's block.\n\nBut.\n\nI have to go back and read through everything it wrote, make sure it works properly, make sure it caught all the weird edge cases specific to our codebase, make sure it matches our coding style, make sure it's going to be reliable, make sure it didn't hallucinate. I usually end up having to rewrite a decent amount of the LLM generated code.\n\nThis sucks because reading software and auditing it is much harder and more intellectually draining than writing it.\n\nFiguring out what you need to write is the bulk of your job, understanding the specs, understanding the context of your changes within your codebase. Making sure all the weird edge cases you know are handled. Writing docs. Coordinating with other folks on the team.\n\nTo get good at that, you need practice, and you need to write stuff yourself, and you need to see it fail yourself. I don't think it's going to actually replace me or you any time soon. I could be wrong, I wouldn't mind retiring early lol. So far, it's been years of threatening to take my job, but no real progress towards that goal.\n\nThe job market is tough right now and companies are blaming AI for layoffs they would have carried out regardless. Tough hiring market at the same time as AI does not mean one caused the other. And so far the companies that actually did lay people off to replace them with AI have ... re-hired everyone a few weeks later.",

Most are just a promise that someone has touched upon basic data structures, algorithms, database concepts, and programming in one or two languages.\n\nIt doesn’t guarantee they write good code, maintainable code, performant code, or code that even meets requirements. It doesn’t guarantee they can design a database schema or design a system, or even that they understand what a message broker and event streaming platforms are, much less how they fit into a system.\n\nIt’s always been like this, though, and AI hasn’t really changed anything about that dynamic. Sure, I can design a spec and pop it in the magic Copilot machine and get code that’s close to correct, but I still have to spend time paying attention to what it’s doing and checking its output, while with most junior engineers I can reasonably expect after the first couple months of their career that they didn’t just hand me a pile of dog shit that appears to do what the requirements are asking, but actually falls apart the second I run or test it.\n\nFor now, it’s just a shit economy, and hiring is going as you’d expect it to in a shit economy. In addition to that, software engineering is no longer the golden ticket everyone acted like it was in the 2010s to the early 2020s. More people have been trying to enter that career, and demand has not kept up.\n\nCombine this with a shit economy and it’s no wonder most CS grads are doing anything but software right now.",

A few of them were obvious showstoppers which meant they hadn’t touched the code at all for five of those “day for day slip!” weeks. It was schedule drama to cover their own issues. \n\nThey did this nine times in a row before they found one bug I hadn’t already fixed and created a tagged release for. Every one before that was known bug, upgrade to 2.0.4 or later to get the fix. I think we ended up with a 1:11 ratio. By then the API was fixed and the test coverage was high so it was mostly performance or security fixes. \n\nEventually everyone in my division caught on to what a clown car they were.

Use chatgpt to help you write a base one and then use it some more to tailor your resume and cover letter to the specific opening. They likely are using AI tools to scan your resume so fight AI with AI.\n\n-Apply for hybrid positions. There's too much competition for remote jobs. You are competing with the whole country and possibly the world. \n\n-Use your network. Ask literally anyone you know. You never know who has a connection. The guitarist in my band works as an accountant for a financial accounting company who develops all their software in house. He ended up being my referral and I would never have known about this company otherwise. And he obviously isn't a developer or technical at all.\n\n-Be confident in your interviews. Let your personality come out. You don't need to know all the answers but you can always draw on past experiences to at least relate to \n\n-I didn't do any leetcode (or any coding at all) and was mostly asked about my skills, history, projects, and experience. Idk if I got lucky or because it was a senior position or what. But anyway make sure you can tell your story and sell yourself. \n\n-Don't forget the interview goes both ways. Think of some questions to ask about the team or the company and flip the script on them. Make them sell to you. It's an old sales tactic. At the very least you'll have more information on where you are potentially going to work and if it's really the opportunity you want. A good interview should feel more like a conversation than a grilling. I walked away from a couple of companies just because I didn't like how they were conducting things (showing up late, acting kinda adversarial, etc). Anyway it's your interview too.\n\nIdk. Your mileage may vary, but I didn't have a problem finding a job. I didn't really see what everyone was saying with the bad market out there and everything. I never would have known the market was supposed to be bad if I haven't been on the Internet. I ended up beating recruiters away with sticks toward the end of it.\n\nGood luck!",

        "body": "A few things. At medium to larger size orgs there tends to be a split after senior where you decide to either continue advancing as an IC (with titles like staff, principal, architect) or go into management (with titles like manager, director, senior director, VP, CTO). As a result staff or principal engineer wouldn't be considered management. As these titles are in the IC track.   \n  \nThis can be important because if you say you want to be an architect or staff title but are talking about management you may be sending mixed messages to gatekeepers. I was surprised about your post title and then the contents of your post weren't about jobs that are commonly thought of as being management. They may think you don't know what you want. Or worse they may think you aren't experienced enough to know the difference and set your application to the side.\n\n\\> my manager keeps saying i'm \"operating at the next level\" but when i apply for staff or principal engineer roles, either internally or externally, i hit a wall.\n\nYou will have to be honest with yourself here as we can't evaluate you. But if you are struggling in the behavioral and system design rounds it doesn't sound like you are there. You shouldn't be struggling at all in a behavioral at any of the titles you've expressed. Those titles have a lot of coordination with other stakeholders and you should be able to breeze through them for those titles. Likewise system design is also a fundamental task for those titles. If you are struggling then that may mean you haven't worked on complex enough tasks for them to feel comfortable hiring you with that title. Yes interviewing is a different skill, but it's just as important for getting the job. Yes sometimes the interview is harder than the actual job.\n\nIf you have skip level meetings I'd highly encourage you to talk to your manager's manager about getting specific with what \"strategic thinking\", \"broader impact\" and \"working on communication\" means to them. Strategic thinking to me would be forward thinking about the feature not just how it's used right now but how will it be used in the future, should it be architected a little differently so we can get future wins for free. You may already be doing this, and what you really need to work on is how people perceive you. If you aren't explaining your thought process to your boss then he may not realize that you are doing \"strategic thinking\". You should be doing this in 1 on 1s.   \n  \nSometimes using the phrases they care about can work too. I know it sounds dumb but when they are filling out a review and you've been consistently talking about strategy for a project to make sure it has impact can go a long way. Broader impact tends to mean impacting multiple departments. If you are already doing that it might be code for you getting more visibility within those departments when you work in projects that impact them. That could be scheduling meetings to ensure the technical requirements will fulfill their needs. Yes product is usually involved here, but product isn't technical and may not make optimal choices.\n\nIt should also be noted in some companies they have to have a business need for the title you want to be promoted into. You simply operating at that level isn't enough justification.\n\nLastly, the market is utter garbage right now. You are competing against a lot of other people. Some of those people have been laid off from major companies. You really need to stand out.",

It’s a topic that is very challenging to offer “general” advice on.\n\nIf you haven’t read Will Larson’s book on the topic, I highly recommend it:\n\nhttps://staffeng.com/book/\n\nSuggest your current manager read it as well. It may help the conversations to be less “vague”. Frankly, if your manager is unwilling to read the book, or any book on the topic, it’s very unlikely you will find an internal staff+ position.

The problem was that the intended way of using a library scaffolding tool was to properly design a schema, but nobody did that and instead used a escape hatch feature of the scaffolding tool to blindly autogenerate a naive API, and the implementation caused all sorts of problems for the \\~300 services that used these bad libraries. And to make things worse, this was a \"cancerous\" type of technical debt, aka the number of bad libraries kept growing over time because people kept using the scaffolding tool the wrong way to create more and more bad libraries.\n\nFixing it was a colossal effort, involving a lot of automation to do the migration heavy lifting and also a lot of manual code changes and manual testing, impacting a ton of teams.

When I was at Compass we went from 150 to 440 engineers in a year and I sat through probably hundreds of technical screens. The correlation between leetcode performance and actual job success is... not great.\n\nWhat I've seen work better is giving them a real problem from your actual workflow. Like pull up some messy production data and ask them to write a query to find something specific. Then watch how they think through edge cases, ask clarifying questions, handle nulls and duplicates. For Python, give them a small script you actually use - maybe something that parses logs or transforms data between formats. See if they can extend it or fix a bug you introduce. The best candidates will ask about the business context, not just dive into coding.\n\nAlso consider splitting the time - 15 minutes on a practical coding exercise, then 15 minutes discussing their approach to debugging, testing, code reviews. Ask about a time their code broke in production and how they handled it. Or show them a piece of your actual codebase and see if they can understand what it does. These conversations tell you way more about whether they'll succeed than watching them reverse a linked list. I've hired people who bombed leetcode but were incredible at understanding business problems and writing maintainable code that other humans could actually work with.",

This could be 20-30 minutes.  \n2: Behavioral side, to assess if they can handle the business side, how easy/difficult would it be to work alongside, etc. -15 minutes  \n3: Technical Assessment: Prepare questions based on their resume to assess if they understand what they've mentioned. If someone says, I did X in my previous job.

Are they doing back-to-back interviews? If so, it's a waste of time if people ask similar questions and ask them to tell them about themselves and talk about the company. \n\nGet an understanding of what they've been through already. Is there already someone who has checked their basic competence in Python and SQL? If not, I'm in favor of doing some simple quickie questions first, and then you can see if they can move on to harder questions. HR at some companies will send someone who should have never got through an initial screening process. \n\nI really like asking people about their experience to get an idea if they really did the work. People should be able to talk about challenges, mistakes that were made, things they'd do to improve the system, etc. I interviewed someone who said they never have bugs and never make mistakes. We passed on them.",

It's usually pretty obvious within a minute or two if the person actually has the level of python expeirence they claim (again you'd be surprised at how many people say they have several years of experience as a senior python engineer then it takes them 5 minutes to remember how to define a function or whatever) and then you can spend the rest of the time gauging their communication skills etc.\n\nWe actually measure internally what % of candidates pass the initial 30 min tech screen and then fail later rounds of tech screens and have experimented with lots of questions, the fizzbuzz-style one had the best outcomes.",

The second thing, was exposure to SWE systems ideas, networking, distributed systems, compilers, embedded systems: just he distributed systems knowledge alone has made a huge difference.\n\nThat said, if I spent the same amount of time (more than 2000 hours) doing projects? I probably would have learned more. The only issue with that, is that the courses push you further than what you might do on your own. For instance, I'm still learning CS, ML, and math concepts, I'm just not spending 20 hours a week on it.\n\nOne additional point: I already was a PhD dropout when I got my MS CS, so I had research exposure, knew how to make arguments with data, and didn't really need help with research or academic skills, it was really the content that helped the most.",

If you’re struggling, let your manager/senior know rather than failing silently. There is nothing wrong with struggling. But there is something wrong if you cry in quiet and put your team and deliverables into risk. If you let them know, they can also communicate with whoever is necessary and take action earlier. This way, if you deliver stuff, perfect move on to the next thing. If you struggle and let them know, you will get the help you needed and everyone will still be happy because they know they can trust you.\n\nAnd second part is learn to be independent and you need to carry some of the burden the team have. Your existence should not be a burden for someone else but rather help them to carry it. Few examples of this could be, actively review pull requests. Don’t wait someone else to tell you to fix something if you see a problem. Write documentation if you know something. This is kinda related to company size but if you are working with different teams from different departments and they need help, be the guy who they get that needed help from.",

        "body": "60 hours a week is a solid chunk of time to become good at anything, which equates to about 3120 hours yearly.\n\nNow here's the kicker, you either like your job or you don't.\n\nIf you do, then you need to apply 20 extra hours to working more (if you're salary, if not then up to you),\n\nor if you don't like your job then apply that 20 extra hours on another subject.\n\n  \nIf you choose not to apply that time to your job then you're looking at roughly 1000 hours a year, which is what you need to \"master\" or \"grab the hammer\" I call it.  Some guys spend 20 years in C++ optimization and still find new things out today, so they are \"masters\" or \"able to drive nails in one hit\".  That's truly how I look at it, can you walk into an environment and within 10 minutes narrow down a root cause.  If you can't find something that quick then you haven't spent at least 1000 hours studying.\n\nIf you choose to apply those skills to your job then you also need to make sure you aren't a slave to it, then people can control you and make your life a living hell.  If anyone questions why you're there so late/early, or you login for a lot of time, then you can gently slip in that it's part of your \"professional education\".  Literally use those words.\n\nIf you're Indian or Asian (in those countries) then I would be careful with what you give your boss, they could become abusive.  If it's an American employer then feel free to work for free.  Why? because you're not working for free, you're making yourself look better (job security) and you're progressing your skillset.\n\n  \nThe Key:\n\nDo not think that your devotion to the company will result in that job security or professional progression.  You're using them for education while paying your bills.  Companies will chew you up and spit you out so be careful with how you practice things at work.\n\n  \nThe Middleground:\n\nStudy outside of your job things that will make you useful then either grab tickets you know you can do, or communicate that you want to try this because you've been working on it alone.  Why not just self-study and keep it private? Well a homelab isn't going to teach you how to upgrade pods and update images in a production environment, you can mock something like it, but when your boss is breathing down your neck and crap is running down your leg then you'll be glad you worked in a real env.\n\n  \nThe Takeaway:\n\nTake advantage of having a job and a place where you can see things break live, that's where the money is made, not when everything is running well.\n\nIf you are truly just a curious individual then forget everything I said and protect 20 hours a week to explore whatever you want.  Having a job means you can buy GPUs, electronics, hardware, etc. maybe not the best but something for you to work with.  No one skill will make you permanently secured in your job, no one job will make you automatically rehireable, but constantly learning new things and \"getting a hold of the hammer\", will keep you happily employed.\n\n  \nMe? well I'm unemployed because well...I don't know really...actually I suck at Leetcode and haven't used NodeJs a lot.  However, if you have a job then you're in good standing.",

I had to show my offer letter to confirm the number and had to basically do a review to ‘justify’ it, but not only am I still here, I even switched teams with no issues internally. \n\nThe external offer I received came from a position I was reached out to about on LinkedIn, and I took the interview as practice to make sure I’m on top of my interviewing skills and be on top of any subjects or topics relevant. It was NOT to leave. \n\nHowever, the offer I did end up getting was too good to pass up, and I would have been an idiot to pass on it. I was open about this to my manager - I didn’t want to leave, but I’d be an idiot to say no - and they wanted to keep me enough that they worked with me to get a counter. The counter almost completely matched it, and I’m having a good time where I’m at.\n\nI don’t know if I’m the exception, but hopefully that helps. Honesty paid off here the most for me personally, but just remember that no matter what, you’re taking a risk if you accept the counter offer. I’d be prepared for anything.",

Companies still struggle finding good hires that know a specific problem space so they would usually go for a new grad with a specific understanding in their problem space than a 3-5 YOE that knows nothing about it.

If a product doesn’t do well but the engineering team did a good job, they will likely be fine, but the pm likely gets fired.  On the other side if a product gets crazy successful, the PM is probably going to advance faster.",

There’s limited real desire and opportunity to get to those levels.\n\nTo be a “true” senior you need to be leading the team and product in all technical aspects, training others, and being “the man” on the team. That requires a lot of dedication, and frankly, down right hours on the keys at the desk that most people aren’t willing to put in.\n\nMost teams will end up with their senior engineers being the longest tenured engineer on the team or someone rotated over from another team who was either a rising “true” senior engineer or more likely: just one of the longer tenured engineers who is backfilling another person’s position. Most engineers with a senior title are mid level engineers who haven’t left.\n\nTo be a “true” staff engineer, you’re doing everything a senior did, but expand that across team’s through your entire department. Now take the hours you invested in your original team to be a senior, and multiply it by number of teams (roughly). That’s way too many hours for most people to want to invest to reach this level. Even after you make it to this level, your desire to stay here might wain and while your titled a staff engineer because you were performing at that role, a few years later you’re essentially a senior again because you don’t want to keep investing the hours.\n\nI quoted “real” everywhere because titles mean different things at different companies and the lower the max TC a  company offers: typically the lower the bar is for a higher title. So I wanted the focus to be on what the general-ish expectation is at each level.",

It is the most widely known MSCS program, because of its great price and typical program ranking. Many recruiters are aware of the lax acceptance rates (reported to be +80%) and that it is essentially a degree mill. There are many folks with near limited CS experience who have taken a couple of cc courses and enrolled within the program with hopes of breaking into the industry, slapping on the school name onto their resumes.\n\nIt is certainly cheap enough for a try, especially when the closest alternative is an overpriced bootcamp. How many GATech MSCS resumes (online part omitted of course) do you think recruiters see nowadays? There are plenty of people straight up spamming applications with GATech MSCS on their resume without even having taken a single course yet.",

You're not them, you can make the sacrifice that others wish they could make.\n\nAlternatively, you can also consider fields outside of CS, like a civil engineering master's, electrical engineering, computational biology, chemical engineering, or even law school to pursue tech patent law (most patent lawyers studied stem, not pre law), etc etc.  tons of fields.  I know for a fact that some law offices will even pay for your law school while you work as an assistant if you commit to working as a patent lawyer for them for X amount of time after graduation.\n\nAvoid the shit CS job market entirely because you're still young.

We just haven't focused on it as much but this is one of those \"what is the price of progress?\" questions. At its most ideal we do it to free people up to do better things or be productive in other ways, but I think we (collectively) tend to cast a very dark shadow on it because it's easier to blame something rather than take it as a reason to improve other things.\n\n> Aerospace: Space is cool as fuck but Elon and Bezos are certifiably insane.\n\nThey are the poster manchildren of modern aerospace, but there are many 'boring' companies involved in aerospace stuff (Lockheed, Boeing, Airbus, GE, etc.). Though then you're also probably getting government contracts in there as well.",

If you believe you are experiencing WLB (Keep it to yourself and please do not broadcast your great manager to bad managers) and treat it as just a temporary hallucination that you are experiencing that will fade away soon to those not in the know.\n\nNow with that in mind there are some really great managers in the company that actually do try, keyword being try to establish a real work life balance within reason.  Unless this is being pushed from the L8 and L10 levels it will be very hard to sustain long term by an L7 as they all eventually fold under the executive pressure cooker as they try to make it to L8 themselves.  Only then can they and do they have real power to enforce WLB in their org.\n\nFor yourself you will need to set hard boundaries and never become a yes person for too long or you will be crushed due to taking on more work than you can actually do.  I've seen it happen so many times with the courageous happy faced yes people, then 3-6 months in they are burnt out and depressed because they are way overdue on their projects that they agreed to do and management is holding them hard accountable for it due to work being in motion.  \n\nYou let things slip then you get dinged for bias for action, ownership, and deliver results which massively dings your ratings (max HV1, maybe LE) then if it happens again in the next quarter you are put in focus, pivot, and then your done for.\n\nSo if you want to flip the coin, do it for the work experience.

If you are going to risk it, do it for a job that will pay you life changing money in a way. 10% for me isnt life changing especially in this career. \n\nPut it like this, if you make 80k a year 88k isnt that much of a difference. If you make 150k a year, 165k isnt that much of a difference. It's extra money to play with or invest but again, is it enough for you to risk maybe the next few years being hectic and stressful?

They are very different jobs and as a staff the expectation is that you will grow the seniors around you, so you need a good senior resume to lean on.\n\nA good, very high level distinction is that engineers below staff tend to focus on how they're going to do something. Staff and above focus more on why.\n\nAs a staff, it's my job to become deeply intimate and opinionated with the product or platform I am paid to improve, as well my company's technical roadmap. From there, I need to form solid business cases as to what technical work is most important for my team, defend those with SLT or C-suite leadership, and then set up my seniors for success in the execution of that roadmap.\n\nAs a senior, it's your job to become deeply intimate and opinionated on the problem that's put in front of you, likely a project from your staff dev or manager. The business case is already made at that point, and your staff dev has likely proven the case with a poc of some sort, so you need to lead the execution of the solution. \n\nBecome an expert in leading solutions E2E as a senior. Then shadow your staff as much as you can to start understanding their world and responsibilities. \n\nIf I can be frank, going from senior to staff in 1.5 years is extremely tight. Most companies are going to want you to have much more experience as a high performing senior before they give you this position. Be ready to not be ready in 1.5 years is advice I think you should hear now.",

The traditional way to go about a job search is to double down on your strengths so that you look competitive in comparison with your immediate peers.\n\nThere's something to be said about adjacent skillsets as an augmentation of your core skills, but \"from admin stuff to IT\" seems a bit too far off. Ideally, you'd target skillsets that complement what you're already good at in some way that bridges gaps in requirements from job postings in your area of expertise.",

        "body": "Hey, I really feel for you. I went through something similar transitioning from Java to React and honestly, it was brutal at first. The whole functional programming paradigm, ES6, components, props, how renders work, Redux - all of it felt like trying to drink from a fire hose. I had anxiety and panic attacks over it. So I want you to know: this transition is genuinely hard, and you're not failing because you're finding it hard.\n\n\nThat perfectionism/ADHD piece your therapist mentioned is huge though. Modern frontend development, especially in complex codebases, IS a constant stream of \"wtf is happening\" moments. Even seniors get lost in deeply nested components with no documentation. The difference is they've built up tolerance for not knowing and can sit in that discomfort longer.\n\n\nAlso, you lost your mentor. That's massive. You went from having someone who understood the codebase to basically being on your own in a system with minimal documentation.\n\n\nThe isolation is probably making everything worse too. Even if you go to the office and those people don't understand your specific codebase - they've been through what you're going through. We all have, even if we don't show it or are too proud to admit it. You could try working from coffee shops sometimes too, just to break up being alone all day.\nFor me, it took 1-2 months of really intense, focused work before things clicked. But what forced me to lock in was when the stakes got really real. That kind of pressure made me focus in a way nothing else does, but it's also not sustainable or healthy long-term.\n\n\nYour manager's job is to help you thrive - you could try being really open with them about needing more structured support after your mentor left. Pair programming helped me a ton - you get to ask questions in real time and it actually makes both people more productive. If you ask your manager or even just another dev to pair with you on some tickets, most people would probably be down. And when you're stuck solo, timebox it - give yourself 30 minutes to struggle, then ask.\n\n\nYou're 9 months in. That's still early. But you also need to be honest with yourself about whether this specific situation is set up for you to succeed.",

        "body": "Yeah, I usually see them as MLOps Engineer or Data Science Engineer, though they can also be listed under more generic AI/ML Engineer, or even occasionally as Data Scientist, depending on the organization. But there's absolutely a career to be made in the space.\n\nCandidly, I find that ML Engineering as we're discussing it isn't really an entry level role, but more something that a software/data engineer or data scientist will lateral into if they have an affinity for it. While as an ops/deployment person you won't need to have the same familiarity with the statistics/math as the data scientists and researchers putting together the initial proofs-of-concept and models, you're going to need enough familiarity to be able to sense check things, collaborate effectively with the research side, and, from time to time, optimize the approach without negatively impacting the model capabilities.\n\nKey skills include traditional software dev, including the usual system design, engineering, testing, etc., with a few other things. For embedded, there's additional nuances around programming on custom boards, signal processing/cleaning, and to some extent hardware tinkering, and for cloud/forecasting stuff, parallelization and distributed computing comes up with some frequency. Some of the more relevant challenges I see day-to-day are around model instrumentation/tracking metrics, managing cloud costs, runtime, and wrangling tech debt that inevitably spawns as the model pipelines keep changing.\n\nI'd personally want to take a software engineer with a few years of experience working in the cloud, or someone who's done some lightweight embedded stuff, and get them up to speed on the ML-relevant side. I could probably take a data scientist and do it, but I've found that most professionals that grow up on that side have pretty terrible programming skills. It's easier to beat data quality and validation into an engineer's head than to get someone up to speed on formal engineering, I find. Though if our nascent ML Engineer is bad at math and logic, their career in ML will probably be pretty short lived.\n\nEdit: For LLMs, I think that there isn't much reason (apart from political organizational reasons) to have ML/DS teams responsible for applied LLM implementations and deployments. You'd think that people who should notionally be familiar with the math would be more clear-eyed on what these models can and can't do, but that doesn't seem to be the case--so in my mind, there isnt't a reason to bother having a data scientist involved in the implementation from a technical standpoint. Any decent engineer should be able to integrate an LLM into the broader system with some thoughtful design and extensive testing.",

There were 3-5 engineers most of the time. No dedicated QA, no pipeline or deployment process. We'd take our app to install on the client's infrastructure on a flash drive. And I'd feel silly and hilarious to wear a suit.\n\nThe place was laid back, very informal. We would always go out to lunch together. Occasionally working until late at night during deadline crunch we would share a beer in the office. I learned and grew a lot. Got promoted a couple of times while there. They would sometimes fail to pay our salaries on time, always on the cusp of failure. But I was having fun and it fit my life as a 24yo. I would absolutely hate that place today.\n\nThe second job I'm going to mention is my current one. Healthcare industry related. Chill, remote friendly. Very few meetings. I get to work on my tickets at odd hours, so I can be present for my family. But there is some good engineering happening and opportunity to stay sharp. I've worked at other chill places where after a year or two I felt like I'd have to be very creative to write a single bullet point about that job.",

He picked me up, dusted me off, and just... believed in me.\n\n\nAny time I encountered an issue, he never treated it as a \"me\" problem. It was always a systems problem. His first question was always \"how do we prevent this from happening again?\" Not \"why did you mess up?\" That psychological safety was everything.\n\n\nHere's the thing though - the work itself was an absolute shit show. The technology was this custom mess that practically functioned as its own language. Hard to understand, impossible to debug, nightmare to optimize. The product team was perpetually confused, and we were constantly building the wrong thing.\n\n\nBut my team? We were in it together. We kept trying, kept pivoting, and most importantly - we all had each other's backs.\n\n\nI'm at FAANG now and have been for the past 6.5 years, and I'm grateful for it. Better pay, better tech, better resources. But low-key I miss those days.

Happy hours multiple times a week, great people and made many friends while working hard and learning a lot.\n\nNew favorite is my current job. Tons of perks and events, also in a great part of the city, 15 minute bike commute or 15 minutes by train. Lots of money and bonuses going around, free snacks and meals, smart people, up to date tech, good tools, documentation, and support. We routinely get hockey/basketball/concert tickets in a suite, and people really value the work we do because it makes a positive impact for people. \n\nIt's three days a week in office, but the office is so nice and the bike ride into work is enjoyable so I don't mind going in for a few days. I've even gone in when I didn't have to because the building is so nice. I've made some friends and referred a friend to work with me. It's been a good time.\n\nLast job sucked and I got laid off with 30% of the company. I was able to get severance and had a new job with months of severance left. Their loss.",

Although some interview questions lend themselves to specific architectures, we don't necessarily ask you to design systems with anything in particular, you're supposed to put your best foot forward and design a system that makes sense given the requirements.\n\nPrep guides love to tell you to list FRs and NFRs and put an api gateway in the middle of the fucking diagram etc etc, but you'd be surprised at how frequently people don't actually know what they're talking about beyond the initial keyword vomit. Getting caught bullshitting is an easy way to get disqualified.\n\nI usually ask people to sketch out the system end to end, and then dive deep on some area. Frontend folks sometimes treat the entire backend as a black box, and we focus on frontend things, up to API layer. But not always. There are plenty that can speak backend too, to varying degrees.\n\nOften it depends on the specific requirements for the job. Some teams want a strong frontend expert, others want someone who's more full stack. General bar for us is \"we want a software engineer, not a react dev\". Mind you, also, this is for high pay roles. Other companies with lower pay bands often have easier bars, especially for frontend, whose interviewers tend to not be as strong in full stack, end-to-end system design themselves (not throwing shade at anyone, just my observation from having spent a lot of time in this space).",

I make good money working on a silly little CRUD app. I would love it if my company took it further and developed some sort of vision - but we have users, we are profitable and I can pay my bills. Even if we had a vision, it would still be worthless if we didn't actually manage to build it.\n\n>Would getting a certain number of high quality daily users make a difference… I ask because I personally see the value in targeted ads to doctors plus the data I would have from their use( it’s all HIPAA compliant).\n\nIf all of that works, why would you be looking for a job?

If I were to do a personal project, I would build something that I want to build that addresses something I care about - and if other people found it interesting and used it, great, but I would 100% ignore any requests to build stuff that I don't care about, or are too difficult, etc.\n\nThat's what a lot of personal projects are like, and the problem is that most jobs just do not work that way - you don't get to choose the path of most fun and least resistance. \n\nNow, mind you - those personal projects are still good in their own way because they allow you to showcase your more pure technical skill. But from an overall \"how will this person do at this job\", they miss a big chunk of it.\n\nWhen I see someone who built something that was clearly based on a user request with real-world, annoying ass constraints? That's when I'm really interested. \n\nI think an app built for doctors kinda fits that, because that's not a group that is going to use something for unimportant stuff. So if you're going to get users, you're going to have to be able to handle annoying shit that most people don't want to deal with (e.g., HIPPA compliance).",

I'm expanding on 4 other hospitals at the moment because of my wife's connections and friends etc. They will also be in oncology. Each site will probably take me a day or two of data work to be ready to go. Then I am going to get started with cardiologists at her hospital. \n\nI don't have revenue worth speaking of, no... I'm still testing it. If I were to monetize it, I think I would go with ads that target doctors while i grow it. Single small ads for expensive cancer treatments, devices, conferences, studies etc. I haven't gotten that far yet. \n\nI have a big advantage with her to constantly bounce ideas off and to teach me exactly how this all works and what they need... plus her network of doctors. I'm trying to utilize each angle I have. \n\nI would be looking for a job because, well, why not? I am going to keep on working on this full-time but I can send out applications at the same time.",

Learn Python and Postman at least. I think those will be useful for the foreseeable future. Knowing Java and Jmeter, at least last time I checked, was *really good* in some niche situations if you needed to validate data being put into a SQL database. Like, one of the best tools I've ever found for specifically that, which is weird since it's nominally a load testing tool. It's was also surprisingly easy to write your own plugins. That was a few years ago now, though, so I don't know if anything better has come along in the mean time.\n\n\nKnowing a bit about how http/networking works behind the scenes is also a good idea if you do any appreciable rest or network testing. If you're going to be working with that sort of thing at all you really don't want it to be just a magic black box to you. I don't see networking going anywhere either, since the cloud is a thing. I interviewed a guy for QA one time and while I was talking to him I realized that he had a fantastic amount of knowledge about networking and network protocols. I suggested hiring him based on that and told him later that he was underselling himself on his resume because no one else I'd ever interviewed had ever demonstrated the level of networking know-how that we were just casually chatting about.",

        "body": "Make sure your resume is up to date and shows specific things you have done. Even better if there are real numbers you can display. I would argue something like:\n\n\"Developed a DAG-based AI inference engine for video analysis using Python, FastAPI, and TensorFlow for deepfake video analysis.\"\n\nis better than:\n\n\"Wrote a python backend service for a machine learning workload.\"\n\nBe specific and provide overwhelming evidence that you have done useful things. The evidence is these hyper-specific bullets. Be ready to talk in detail about everything you say you have done. It is really easy to tell when someone is talking out their ass about a resume bullet point. If the interviewer is doing their job they will ask you to get specific. Specificity, detail, depth of knowledge.\n\nThe best way to get these bullet points is for every single job sit down for at least thirty minutes and just write every single technology you used and every single thing you did. Be painfully verbose in your listing of things. Once you have that you can go back and create bullets like the first one I showed you.\n\nI would focus on LinkedIn (shocker), Dice, and Indeed. Dice and LinkedIn are where most of my 'in bound prospects' come from in terms of job opportunities. Dice has actually been really great for me. Get your profile there up to date and as specific as possible.\n\nNow let us talk applications. You need to be doing hundreds per day. Don't waste time creating tailored resumes to job postings. Your resume will likely get lost in the sea of other applicants. I wish it was not this way. When I was looking for a job when I got laid off earlier this year I was doing 200-300 a day or more. You will find out eventually that most recruiters look at the new job postings Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday so Saturday and Sunday are GREAT days to slam job postings but you need to be ass-in-chair submitting till your fingers fall off every single day. Do as many easy applies as you can stomach then start moving toward the regular job applications. APPLY, APPLY, APPLY. It sucks, it is boring, it is a numbers game. I had 10+ interviews a WEEK for almost a month when I was doing this. It works.\n\nHave two or three references ready to go that you can submit if recruiters or job applications ask for them. Let them know you are applying to a TON of places. It speeds things up if you don't need to ask every single time.\n\nBack to the resume thing. It is a good idea to have 2-3 developer 'archetypes' you want to apply for. I have 'Full Stack Python focus', 'Full Stack TypeScript focus', and 'Full-stack AI infrastructure focus' archetypes ready to go. Then you can go to LinkedIn and type 'TypeScript Software Developer' and crank through applications.\n\nAlso, I like to have at the top of my resume a little blurb that shows what I am:\n\n\"Software Engineer with experience building AWS-native Python applications to automate critical workflows in the insurance industry as well as large-scale video analysis for customer POCs, securing $10K+ MRR deals, and developing a Python-based DAG-driven AI inference engine for deepfake video analysis.\"\n\nThe HR person or whoever is looking for X type of developer and if you can put that in front of them your chance of getting a callback goes way up. Do EVERYTHING you can to show them you are what they want.\n\nOne more thing, on LinkedIn it is a good idea to filter by 'Jobs Posted in the last 24 hours'. I applied to some of those earlier this week and within an hour got a call from a recruiter for one of them. This has happened many times.\n\nThis is how I hunt for jobs, it works for me. It is alot of work but its pretty straightforward once you have the resume and profiles ready to go.\n\n  \nAnd I don't mean to be an ass by bringing this up but I make $150k a year, graduated late 2024 with my CS degree. I landed this job in a tough job market. Or, rather, I created the preconditions of job offers and was ready when they inevitably appeared. You can do this. Employment is an emergent property, like flight.",

I was hoping my last contract would roll over into a full time position making 160K but it didn't happen.

Originally, recruiters would scout people with impressive side projects because it gave strong signals about technical excellence/leadership/etc. So job search gurus started to spout the idea that having side projects would help differentiate people from other candidates, and new grads started to misunderstand it to mean that \\*they\\* have to have a side project. But now we're in goodhart law territory, aka \"when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure\".\n\nThing is, the original people getting scouted are senior level high achievers with years of experience. And yeah, the average run-off-the-mill new grad project is nothing to write home about. What people don't realize is that the \"years of experience\" from these high achievers also include a graveyard of side projects that never saw the light of day. Side projects are largely for upskilling and exploring the depths of some technical specialization/area. When you see people getting scouted for a side project, that's survivorship bias from those that stuck with a side grind for years.\n\nNew grads themselves seem to at least half understand the importance of \"years\", since years of schooling is what differentiate them from bootcampers, right? But they need to be productive years: it's a very different thing to coast during uni playing games like all your buddies did in high school vs going home after uni classes and hacking on side projects and coming out of graduation with a very good idea of what the professional landscape of your desired specialization looks like.\n\nThere's a saying that the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago and the second best time is now. Side projects are like trees. If you want the fruits of labor, then you ideally should've had the project for a while already, but if you're just starting, don't expect it to be bearing fruit next month.",

I (as an interviewer) don't typically care about your resume holistically. By the time I'm given your resume, I'm already slated to interview you. I may not even look at your resume for more than 10 seconds depending on the type of interview I'm conducting.\n\n3. Hiring managers may actually be the person who care the most about your resume as a whole if they are involved in selecting resumes.\n\n4. Many people do not have projects.\n\nEverything I've previously said to you applies (in no particular order): luck, location, resume quality, and connections are probably the four biggest factors for getting opportunities, especially the first one.",
