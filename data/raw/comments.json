Stuff like replication/mirroring/scheduling have become very reliable in most of the cases and tools out of the box do job very well. Things just work fine most of the times. Things that you are highlighting become an issue at a certain scale and importance but for most of the cases its ok to have a trade-off of slightly unreliability over not having it.\n\nTo give you context, just imagine what it was like to develop a website during the 1990s around the dotcom era. It was super tough you needed a diverse set of engineers (from os specialist, network engineers, database architects/engineers, frontend and backend engineers) to just get some basic functionality out. LAMP stack changed all of that and literally made web engineering accessible to anyone, but those websites could have issues unless platform was used properly. But it got lot of work done and on a net it was a huge positive.\n\nMy personal belief is democratization on a whole is net super positive.",

All that mattered was whether you were good. So I just worked hard to be good.\n\nIt's a very different world now, though. I work in a niche industry so maybe this advice isn't as helpful for people looking for generic \"careers in tech\", but for me by far the biggest thing that enabled me to get ahead and move around the organization was domain knowledge.

I knew cloud services and python would be important in the future so I taught myself those skills over the next few years in my free time. Mostly online and creating my own projects. You always have to be learning because trends change every 2-3 years. But everything can be self taught in my opinion.

The moment you start to process larger volumes, the cloud is clearly more expensive - on average it is 2.5x more expensive. The larger the data volume, the more expensive it becomes. That's why there is an accelerating trend of cloud repatriation for the past 2 years.",

We are running express routes with MEs and all that jazz. We have production workloads on both AWS and Azure. \n\nI know that this is going to draw a lot of downvotes, but I am yet to see how a cloud setup outperforms, both on cost and performance, a well tuned SQL Server. DevOps and infra are much more efficient, easier and natively supported on the cloud products, but other that, I am yet to see the tangible ROI of these projects. The same goes for storage, cold archives and so on. I am speaking only data platforms here, application deployments are a whole another story. \n\nThat being said, I love working with the thing!!",

One thing that isn’t talked about enough here is that if you have on-prem it has its own costs that are slightly different from being cloud based, such as physical maintenance of the equipment as well as purchasing the equipment. I view it in the same way I do a legal capacity in a company, not every company needs to have a dedicated legal capacity available to them at all times, so they outsource that bit (in our case use a dedicated consultancy to run it all, likely cloud based for access). Over time they may bring in a singular lawyer to coordinate things and deal with the majority of the paperwork, but they’ll still need advice or capacity help (singular data person with consulting support probably still cloud based). Then you have a mix of stuff where the legal department expands all the way to a full blown department with dedicated head count and seat at the board (everything from a small data team who are cloud based to a dedicated data department who have at least one person for every role including maintenance because they’ve brought it on-prem) but even then that legal department won’t be able to cover every single base and will have to bring in external help on occasion, probably keeping someone on retainer (there’ll still be some workloads cloud based).\n\nWe all look at this as a purely technical and budget problem whereas you need to take a far more holistic view of the requirements of the individual business.",

Of course, many emergency responders would also report much higher stress levels. Those folks are probably doing just as good a job as the no-stress folks, but they're thinking about their work differently.  Something has clicked in the heads of the no-stress folks, and they can get on and deal with terrible situations effectively without it affecting their internal state. They presumably have healthy mental hygiene outside of work: hobbies, practices etc that keep them on an even keel.\n\nI think this applies to all office/corporate/white collar jobs just as much. DE and anything else. I haven't attained no-stress nirvana but I have noticed in the past I react differently (much _less_ stress) to the same situations that cause visible stress in some colleagues: colleagues that I know have the same training and similar skill levels to me. \n\nFor example, having a huge pile of work doesn't stress me. There are only so many working hours; I just make sure I know what's the #1 priority and focus on that, and make sure stakeholders know what I'm doing (and not doing).",

You can easily get a distributed k:v store to ingest millions of entries per second, and each write can be retrieved essentially immediately for low latency results, but it will generally struggle to handle large analytical queries.\n\nYour deltalake tables can ingest enormous volumes of data, and are great for huge analytical queries, but there are limitations on the types of write that you can do in the process. Most importantly here MERGE operations have *a lot* of overhead -- you'll be rewriting entire files for an update to a single row, and every write is going to leave behind another time travel copy of the data it just superseded.\n\nYou can clean up these time travel copies. You run compaction periodically, then do a VACUUM with a custom short time with the necessary override to let it delete files less than a *week* old. You'll still have a lot of overhead processing the merges, however.\n\nWhat is often better with rapidly updating data when using something like deltalake is to move away from merging every single change, and instead just blind-inserting new values to an append-only log with a timestamp of when that row version becomes active. From there a window function looking for the latest timestamp for a given key lets you filter for the 'current data'.\n\nOver time the total amount of data will get pretty large, and that will get inefficient. So you can periodically create a proper merged 'current state' table that *doesn't* need the window-function-for-latest filter. Then when querying for the latest data you start with that fully merged table as your base, you anti-join the keys from the timestamp filtered append log, and union data with the window-function-for-latest filter only on the new append log data.\n\nThat query will skip all the 'previously merged' data from the append log and keep the window processing to a minimum, but still lets you get the latest state from the append log where it applies.\n\nYou'll want to do something like a bucketby on both tables on the key, so that they are properly organised to minimise shuffles to achieve the joins and window functions.\n\nYou can tune the full merge period to whatever suits. It could be hourly, or daily, or any frequency you like. Each time you do a merge you can also compact and vacuum to clear out old data. If you partition your append-log by a time bin you can also drop old partitions to save storage space there too -- and it can help with skipping files that won't be relevant.\n\n---\n\nThese sorts of 'streaming into big analysis' issues seem to come up from time to time. We had [another one last month](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jfwyyn/streaming_to_an_iceberg_scd2_table/) but that one went a step further to doing full SCD2 history, not just latest value.",

The classic issue there is state change causing failures in writes/upsets. \n\n\nThe thing about 'live' tables is that they work best as a 'window' on the latest data, doing live data at large volume in delta is just too cumbersome. \n\n\nAt this point it would be better to use something like cosmos db, you may still have challenges in reporting, but just use serverless change feed to get realtime kois that you need and then have near real time data perspectives in a different style of reporting. \n\n\nDelta live is great, it does give you batch like consistency even on realtime, but I still don't like it as the answer when the main challenge is realtime transactions",

Sure, spark sql can work as a general query engine, but it wasnt really designed for that.\n\nThere’s some differences under the hood, particularly around how spark executes in stages, and uses more I/O steps than Trino.\nEssentially, for ad-hoc queries that change frequently, or you rerun things to change and shape results, Trino will nearly always be more performant. You can make some tweaks with a spark application (and then run it interactively to try and do the same), but tbh, Trino’s entire design, really, is for extremely fast reads on object storage datalakes.\nSpark is better places for wide ranging transformations, that are potentially more complex in nature. A good example here is the fault tolerance nature of spark, which matters way more in big batch pipelines, than analytical ad hoc queries. Sure, data loss and the task fails, just re fire the query. In a pipeline, you cant manually do that if its all running automated. \nAgain, different horses for different courses in my opinion.\nI see it a bit like:\nSpark was a natural successor to Hive, for better big data transformation.\nTrino was a successor for something like Impala, as a faster query engine over datalakes",

In my opinion, the key differentiating feature between Trino and Spark is not the speed, but support for fault tolerance, which is required for batch workloads. As such, many organizations deploy two separate systems, despite the increase in complexity, added infrastructure costs, and the overhead.\n\nI think Starburst is well aware of this trend, and they are promoting Trino with fault tolerance suport. You can find some report that Trino with fault tolerance enabled works well in production and even saves the compute cost. From our own testing, however, Trino with fault tolerance does not work well for large queries (which it is designed for) because Trino coordinator crashes repeatedly. In any case, even Starburst recommends two separate deployments of Trino, one for interactive and another for batch. So, I think it is (and will remain) common to deploy separate systems for batch and interactive: Trino + Spark, Trino + Trino with fault tolerance, Trino + Hive-Tez, and so on.\n\nThat said, we offer a solution that simplifies operations and reduces costs by eliminating the overhead of maintaining two separate systems, with a single unified system. It's based on, well, Apache Hive (with the MR3 execution engine). If you are interested, please visit our website: [www.datamonad.com](http://www.datamonad.com)",

You want retrieval of a key to correspond to the data that was inserted at that key, very fast insert and read, to be able to distribute the workload over many servers (especially over large geography). You need to trade normalize data with fast updates and flexibility with regard to access patterns.\n\n\n\nIf you post something on your friend's page while connected to a plane's wifi flying over Nebraska and your friend deletes their profile from a phone in Nepal at the same time, do you both need to wait for the entire state of the Facebook network to resolve to know if your transaction completed? Or could you both just have your request accepted, just resolve any inconsistencies when you request the data in the future?",

This works fine for daily batch and is reliable if PKs don’t change.\n\nTo make it a bit more robust, consider soft-deletes downstream. In your warehouse, mark missing records as deleted rather than removing them. This way you keep history and avoid accidental data loss.\n\nTo “optimize”a bit, you can do a hash-based comparison. If tables are huge, and full PK comparison is too slow, you can hash rows or chunks of data to detect changes and only diff those chunks.\n\nAlso, some teams snapshot the full table daily and treat it like slowly changing dimensions (SCD Type 2). Storage-heavy, but you get full history without needing to touch the source.\n\nRe: tooling, Python with Pandas or even dbt (as an SQL option) can handle the diff logic but it will be kinda complex to maintain.\n\nNow, the issues with this are:\n\n1. Late-arriving data can look like a delete if yesterday’s extract was missing a row that shows up today.\n2. Extract gaps (like job failures) can cause false positives.\n3. High-churn tables can make diffing expensive or slow.\n\nSo keep these in mind.\n\nThat said, I definitely recommend pushing for log-based replication though. It will make your life 100x easier.

Another tip, you can take a look at Fivetran's teleport sync and try it out. If your company has a budget to use it, good for you. \n\nIf not, try to use the Fivetran teleport sync on a test DB where every query is shown in the log.

Append-only + latest view: Just write every change and use views or queries to pick the latest version (row_number() over pk, updated_at). It’s simple and scales ~okay.\n\n2. CoW vs. MoR: For update-heavy workloads, merge-on-read is usually more efficient with Iceberg. But frequent small writes still hurt performance (you’ll want to buffer and batch). [Here’s](https://estuary.dev/blog/apache-iceberg-cow-vs-mor/) a detailed article about the two.\n\n3. Event stream + materialized views: Send CDC to Kafka, then process and materialize into your lake in micro-batches. Works great if “near-real-time” is good enough and you have the resources to manage Kafka, Kafka Connect and Debezium yourself.\n\nIf you want to stay open source, something like Debezium + Kafka + Iceberg + Flink/dbt can do the job. But it can be a LOT to manage.\n\nIf you’re open to managed tools, [Estuary](https://estuary.dev) handles full load + real-time CDC into Iceberg out of the box (and runs merge queries for you!), and deals with all the tricky bits like ordering, deduping, and schema changes. Worth checking out if you want to simplify the stack. Disclaimer: I work at Estuary - happy to answer any questions!",

It's easy to learn and quick to get started on. Use Databricks if you also want machine learning and a few other neat features like advanced analytics and big data processing. The learning curve is a bit steeper in my opinion, but it's worth it because of better flexibility/control.\n\nTools: look into are dbt, SQLMesh, airflow, kafka, fivetran, terraform, pyspark and the list goes on. I highly recommend dbt because it allows you to easily abstract data modelling and transformations while remaining (nearly) platform agnostic. SQLMesh is also proving itself to be quite good, outperforming dbt in certain things like write operation times and incremental models, but has a much smaller community than dbt. You can use fivetran for integrating a gazillion sources. I won't go through all of them, but I definitely recommend looking into pyspark if you're working with large data sets. It will significantly boost your pipeline performance! \n\nAll in all, there are so many decisions to be made. My advice is to keep it stupid simple. Pick only what you need and nothing more. Data platforms have an uncanny way of ballooning in complexity as new teams, use cases, and business logic start piling on. Choose boring, proven tools. Build clean, modular pipelines. Scale complexity only when you absolutely need to.\n\nGood luck!",

Building these with low code tools would be a nightmare. Databricks provided us with a comparatively high code option. \n\nDatabricks charges based on storage costs plus compute costs. So very low volume data isn't necessarily all that expensive.

For managing non conterized workloads, Functions and app service can be great, otherwise you'd be better off with ACA.\n\nAlso, are you sure you want to use streamlit for your frontend? You may not know that with streamlit you run a backend as well. Your client communicates with this backend which then communicates with your FastAPI backend. That's 2 apps that you need to run. Instead you could choose a framework in Python (if you don't want to touch JS) that's a little more flexible and allows you to\nwrite the client logic in python but also the API endpoints with FastAPI?",

Tooling in this case is probably irrelevant - you just need careful engineering and separation of groups of tables that are being synced. Typically migrations are handled by modifying writers which temporarily write to both DBs. I'd probably stay away from Kafka/other queues because they will increase your synchronization lag. I can probably say more if you provide more details. What maximum latency are you looking for? I'm looking at a similar setup in production right now (MySQL -> PostgreSQL) and I see that under load P95 latency (time of write in destination minus time of creation of item in source) is about 850 ms.

You need to look out for situations when code of the old system and new system mutates the same pair of linked tables. Sometimes it's impossible to avoid, like for example when you're developing a new version of an EHR system and medical personnel of both systems should see fast updates to the orders table to avoid double administration of a drug to a patient. Perhaps you can mitigate this by having a filter table for order IDs that has information about which system created an order to break the loop. It will be a difficult project :)",

You can read about the different types of joins spark does (shuffle, broadcast etc) and even use hints in your SQL or pyspark to force a certain one.\n\nSQL and pandas and spark have a lot of differences, but one thing that’s helped me is learning the fundamental data structures at play. SQL databases use a B-tree for its index, so if I 10x my data size, my reads are only 2x slower. Parquet uses a bloom filter so you can filter it with a WHERE clause extremely quickly. Chapter 3 of designing data intensive applications goes into this.\n\nRelated to this, one neat optimizations databases do is use statistics for query optimization. For example, if you have [HyperLogLog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog) statistics, the query optimizer can get more accurate cardinality estimates on your data. This can really help if you have many joins. \n\nThere’s a good paper from Meta and others (including Pandas creator Wes McKinney) going into the differences between all of these systems, and it gives a good overview of what needs to happen between you submitting a query and getting data back: https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol16/p2679-pedreira.pdf",

If your new data arrives as parquet files on S3, you'll have to configure some kind of pipeline to detect new files and INSERT/MERGE them into existing Iceberg tables. I recommended to someone on here recently to use a cron or lambda in conjunction with Athena to accomplish this. There are many ways to approach this. \n\n3. Yes! a lot of engines support reading Iceberg (and Delta Lake). Particularly if you are using AWS Glue as a catalog. You can leverage Iceberg tables in Redshift, Spark, Athena, Trino, Snowflake, Clickhouse, and a few others if you have Iceberg tables cataloged with AWS Glue. Only a subset can do write to tables.",

In order to do anything with it, you need a data engine that understands the protocol and can read/write from it. Historically, only Spark really understood this protocol (because all the logic for this protocol was written in a .jar). Nowadays, other engines are slowly catching on. \n\n2. Yep — if a new parquet file drops somewhere, you’re going to need to run some kind of job with your data engine of choice to read that file and write the data into your iceberg table. No magic here unfortunately and different engines might do this differently :(\n\n3. Now here’s the real kicker… if you want the latest and greatest features in Iceberg I would argue (very sadly) that Spark is the only engine that can do the newest stuff. Iceberg itself is pretty much just developed against Spark, and there is even logic in Spark that doesn’t follow the Iceberg spec that other engines have had to follow because of how ubiquitous Spark-written iceberg tables are in the wild :(\n\nThe problem is that the iceberg protocol itself is very complex, and all the logic for adhering to the spec was originally written for the JVM. So only JVM tools such as Spark can leverage the latest features. \n\nThat being said though there is tremendous progress being made in other ecosystems such as the PyIceberg ecosystem and iceberg-rust that are promising. We leverage PyIceberg for reads/writes of metadata (but do our own data reads/writes) which so far seems to be a great compromise :)",

The code is written and pushed into a dev branch on github from local machine of devs\n\n2. That triggers Github action workflow which creates a docker image for the code on that branch and publishes into our internal image repository. The image is tagged in a way that separates my teams images from others and also provides info about GitHub repo, branch, developer, team, etc\n\n3. Using airflow we trigger that docker image into a containers in our test environment. The image is triggered on Kubernetes using our internal api tools and airflow action.\n\n4. The code is now tested through the running container on the test environment. If there are issues, the code is fixed and the above process is triggered again\n\n5. The test environment is a mirror image of the prod environment so we monitor the behaviour of the pipeline, check logs, analyse observablity metrics on datadog to ensure that the pipeline works as per expectations\n\n6. To test the data, we have an testing module which acts as a defence layer named lighthouse. Lighthouse automates running test sql scripts on our spark dataframe. The queries are written in a way that negative issues can generate rows. If all tests pass, the dataframe is ready to be written in data lake.\n\n7. In the data lake, we do another round of adhoc testing to double check if everything works well\n\n8. Once done, a PR is raised and the code is merged into the main branch. This triggers another github action workflow that updates the production docker image of our data pipeline.\n\n9. The same image is triggered via our production airflow. Since we already have tested on test environment, it’s just the same code running on production so we are mostly sure that it would run.\n\n10. The final dataset on production as scheduled data check and alerts using collibra. This helps us getting issues beforehand and fixing it.\n\n11. For logging we use splunk and for incident management we do pagerduty. The github action also handles linting and formatting of our code. \n\nSo, yeah, we do a few things for testing our pipeline.",

If that is local, partially or totally on cloud, it depends on the technologies and capacity of your machines.\n\nThen there should be a test environment - I usually refer to it as INTegration. It should have data enough to test volyme/stress, and it should cover all cases - both success and failure cases. Most companies that have this just make a snapshot of production (depending on technology, a virtual one), but that leaves security issues (may need some maskung/synthetic data as well), and really doesn't guarantee that all possible edge cases are covered, only the ones that happened in the past. This is the hardest dataset to curate and maintain.\nIt's common for INT to not be directly accessible, just via CI/CD or by a few controlled accounts. That's mostly OK, the test results should give deva the info they need.\n\nAnd then there's pros.\n\nSome companies have more (an UAT Env, separated unit, integration, stress test envs, etc), but these 3 are the minimum to give devs productivity and peace of mind.",

Similarly, I couldn't spend 12 hours a day running reactions or practicing using instruments because materials cost money, there's limited space, you need supervision etc.\n\nConversely, you could learn none of the things you've mentioned and begin practicing writing and running code right now.

A second, more focused on data warehousing is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1j9lyg8/comment/mheoy1h/?context=3).\n\nUnderstand the difference between operational data (where flows are important, the data sizes smaller and response time is critical) and analytic data (large to huge dataset sizes, storage costs become a factor). Most of the analytic data in the cloud is in 1NF(-ish) style and as such limits what can be done with it without starting over. Most cloud tools have a sweet spot that is in the operational spectrum.\n\nSorry for all the links, but data is a huge subject. It is far bigger than the nuances of any programming language. It is very rare for screwing up in a program gets you fined or thrown in jail. Getting fired is the low end of the scale. Data screwups have the potential for all of them.",

That way if you mess anything up in your pipeline, you don’t need to find the hard drive again. Use dd to create a disk image, and build a pipeline off of that. Parquet is a good general purpose way to store time series, and also works well for logs and images (hint: use zstd compression for large blobs, not snappy). Importantly it is fast and compact, and this data is optimal for your analytical/ML workflows. You can also set up batch reading/writing if your dataset gets bigger than available memory. Then records can be loaded from parquet to your OLTP database. \n\nDepending on how your data is stored on disk, duckdb could be a good tool here - especially if you have a larger than memory workload. It supports reading data in many formats, including raw blobs or text data (for images/logs). It can then store the data as parquet or in a .duckdb file - the export to parquet can even be batched, which is where it comes in very handy for larger than memory workloads. It supports connecting to/from some OLTP databases like Postgres, so you can insert data.",

Do chunked reads from OLTP with retry logic from your DBs read replica as a heavy data pull \"may\" significantly impact your application.\n\n2. Alternatively connect the hard drive and do a distributed copy to a cloud store and point your OLAP to it.\n\n  \nThe main pain point was ensuring that the data pull ran fully (retry logic, DLQing failed chunks), while ensuring that I didn';t take down any production systems.\n\nYou could try cdc, but that will require a lot of infra. You can also use a tool like dlthub for incremental loading (https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/sql\\_database/advanced#incremental-loading) if you don't want to write the chunked pull yourself.\n\n  \nHope this gives you some ideas, good luck :) Please lmk if you have any questions.",

Compression (this is especially useful for highly compressible data such as sparse sensor feeds)\n\n2. Very portable — Arrow is basically a first-class citizen from Parquet at this point, meaning that Parquet as an intermediate checkpoint maximizes portability of your data into any subsequent systems. \n\n3. With proper partitioning, storing and accessing this data into the cloud is likely going to be extremely cheap. Any other always-on database solution is going to be really expensive :(\n\n4. For multimodal data, you can most likely get away with storing a URL pointer in Parquet, and the raw data as a file with an appropriate encoding (e.g. JPEG). These encodings work best because they’ve been honed over the years for compression ratio and compute required to decode the data. \n\nAs for the engine, check out Daft (https://www.getdaft.io) which is built for multimodal data like images that you mentioned! It also handles all the bread-and-butter stuff like numerical data etc of course. Also with the added advantage of being able to go distributed if you need to (at the upper end of your data scales in the terabytes).",

Do you want something in-process so you aren't dealing with maintaining a whole server?\n\nMotherDuck uses DuckDB as the whole warehouse solution rather an in process analytics engine so you could use them. You don't have to just use Duck in your ETL scripts or locally on your laptop.\n\nYou can use Clickhouse as well if you're looking at another option, clickhouse comes in full fat full server edition, local edition (clickhouse-local) and in process edition (chDB)",

I don't know how Duck is as a cache compared to Redis. In this case you're storing whatever local chart data which I'm guessing are just rows local to a chart as the value and then the key is the chart instance or something?

Key technologies are Debezium for CDC, Kafka, Flink.\n\nThe industry is moving aggressively in this direction. The operational and data worlds are getting closer and closer, and what I'm seeing happen rapidly is that a lot of data engineering work is increasingly being done by software engineers. What this means is that data engineers who are only skilled in ETL are going to be left behind rapidly. And it's not just because ETL is \"different\", it's also because traditional ETL workflows usually don't adhere to the same standards of CI/CD, testing, etc. as services written by software engineers.\n\nWhat I've witnessed was that a huge part of a financial platform that used to be owned by DEs, was completely replaced by services owned by SEs. The DE's had a bunch of messy scripts in all sorts of places, typically Spark jobs, that were orchestrated by airflow and run once a day. About half of all of that was replaced with near realtime Flink jobs, that were adhering to the highest CI/CD standards. The costs more than halved, and no-one was woken up in the middle of the night anymore.\n\nSo this doesn't mean everything will (or can) be replaced. But it did mean that there was a hiring freeze for DEs, while more SE positions were made. The story I'm telling is from a company a friend works at. But the same is happening at mine, albeit a bit slower.\n\nRead about shift-left with an open mind.\n\nApart from all that I'd look into Iceberg. It's gaining momentum at a rapid pace.",

Having an understanding of data modeling can help shape how data professionals approach data applications and is what sets us apart from a Software Engineer “building a data pipeline”\n\nWhile those two may seem boring, gaining a mastery in each topic will be key to progressing as a Data Engineer.\n\nLastly, just to throw out an actual newer technology is open table formats (such as Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Hudi). These frameworks allow for performing ACID transactions within an object store like AWS S3.

        "body": "*This is long, feel free to TLDR and move on.*\n\nHere's the problem with interviewing programmers. Most of us work with a large codebase that can take quite sometime to learn and work with, partly due to its size, partly due to its organization, and partly due to knowing what the program does. Consider a tax program. How long would it take for you to learn the various tax codes used to determine how much taxes you owe? OK, maybe if the software was well-designed, that part would be isolated to areas where tax experts could work on that logic.\n\nBut in many other situations, as part of building the software (or, more likely, maintaining it), the programmer becomes the de facto expert.\n\nIf I'm interviewing you, I can't have you look at our production software. Let's skip past the fact that it might be proprietary. Simply put, in an hour interview, you can't learn enough to absorb even a fraction of the details (which is often why people feel completely insecure when they're hired and have to deal with software that they don't understand).\n\nIn the past, sometimes the key was graduating from a top university. If you went to Stanford and could answer basic questions, then that degree could get you hired. The reputation of the university was enough. \n\nIt was also common to ask people brainteasers (I'll give you one in a moment). It was thought if someone was intelligent enough to solve brainteasers, they would be good coders. Turns out, not so true. Some people love and are good at brainteasers (for example, I liked brainteasers) and this can make such people feel perfectly qualified. After a while, the so-called FAANG companies realized brainteasers didn't really help.\n\nThe technical questions that were often asked in interviews were often confined to intro courses up to data structures and algorithms. That's because the typical CS major takes a bunch of optional electives in their 3rd and 4th years (in the US). You can't assume a person knows SQL or neural networks or undecidability or even NP completeness (at least, proofs of such problems).\n\nThey'd ask basic coding questions, instead.\n\nBut with leetcode, they can ask similar kinds of questions that rely on data structures and algorithms. These problems are self-contained, and more importantly, can be programmed without learning much and done in around 100 lines or less.\n\nThis is clearly not the kind of programming most people do which is why you're not so good at it. This skill is kind of important, but it's like learning knife skills and being able to chop something quickly. Maybe a working chef needs this skill. Maybe it's nice if a home chef has this skill. But you can make a great dish without this skill. It's a nice to have that may come in useful in certain situations.\n\nYou can do a simple search `how to solve leetcode problems`. There's even a leetcode subreddit /r/leetcode. There's a YouTube channel called neetcode where the guy tells you strategies to solve leetcode style questions. It's popular enough that there are lots of resources out there.\n\nThese questions have become today's brainteasers. They share similar qualities, but they are also unrelated to most typical programming.\n\nFinally, I mentioned a brainteaser, so here is a common one.\n\n> You have eight seemingly identical balls. One ball out of the eight is heavier than the other seven identical balls. Your goal: find the heavier ball. Your tool: you have a scale that tells you three pieces of information: the left side is heavier than the right side; the right side is heavier than the left; the two sides have equal weight.\n\n> Next piece of information: If I put an uneven number of balls on either side, say, 2 balls on one scale and 1 ball on the other scale, then the side that has more balls is *always* heavier.\n\n> One restriction. Each time you use the scale, I will charge you money. You want to save as much money as possible. What's the fewest number of weighings you need to find the heavier ball? And, tell me how to find it?\n\nThe other kind has to do with estimation or weird mental puzzles. \n\n* How many gas stations exist in the US?\n* If a commercial plane had its wheels on super treadmills that could go very fast, but the plane stood still (just as a runner on a treadmill doesn't go anywhere), does the plane lift off? Explain your answer.\n\nSorry for the long reply. It was meant to show why leetcode questions are being asked and to explain that it has little to do with your ability to program, but has become this necessary evil (it's not evil, to be honest, as it's useful but not essential to know this) in programming interviews.",

In Europe this is all easy, as there are a ton of small businesses and everything and everyone is in close proximity. I can imagine in the united states it's a different game. Then again, if you live there; you got worse problems like offshoring mania, big companies, travel distances and overall more competition as everyone speaks the same language etc...",

The plans can be way too ambitious trying to duplicate a CS degree.\n\nA CS degree takes four years, and that's with help: friends, teaching assistants, professors, tutors. Plus, there's pressure taking classes. You have to get assignments in or get penalized. You have to prepare for quizzes, exams, and finals. This means a typical CS major has to work at an accelerated level.\n\nI've always thought that you keep your plans much shorter, like a few months at most. It may feel daunting to learn as much as a CS major, but you don't have to. If you can't get past the first few months, then a 3 year plan won't matter.\n\nSome feel making the roadmap is the end of the story. You have to follow the roadmap, but it's like learning anything. It takes perseverance. For example, let's say you want to learn to skateboard. You're going to fall a lot. Some will decide that falling a lot is too painful, and if they don't see any signs of learning the trick, then they quit. The same could happen in programming.\n\nAs long as a person realizes that, much like learning to skateboard, it may be painful (not in a physical way) or frustrating and that they need to be patient, then maybe they can achieve their desire to learn programming. Knowing it can be a tough road can help, but you need to get started.",

That said I've only \"been consistent\" since January, which is a relatively short period of time but still way longer than I've ever stayed focused on it.\n\n\nI had dabbled in Python in the past, played around with an Arduino, but never really went beyond following instructions, and I got bored. For me, this kind of approach meant I never really could work out what to do on my own when faced with a problem, nor could I creatively think of how to apply concepts.\n\n\nI know this isn't just \"programming\" but I went the other way and bought some electronic components, then worked backwards trying to understand how to get my devices to work together. That made me encounter issues with memory (as an example) and led me down the rabbit hole of all kinds of concepts - some of which would never have been a part of any of these tutorials. So now, I find myself more engaged, more ready to even experiment in my programming and with a list of things I want to try/make.\n\n\nI'd also note that I'm a hobbyist, so I'm not looking (at least for now) at learning programming as a way to carve out a career, which allows me to take it easy and not feel too down when things aren't working. It's all just fun enjoying the process and celebrating small wins.",

Rarely are there rigorous dives into the properties of the underlying enabling abstractions. If you are learning these at a university, the typical course names are calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, complex variables, nonlinear dynamics.\n\nThen there’s the math that's just about uncovering the deep underlying properties of abstractions. Everything is built from first principles, rigorously, no details overlooked. Definitions/theorems/proofs are the focus. Computation is an afterthought. Typical university course names are real analysis, abstract algebra, topology, formal logic.\n\nThe former will improve your ability to program, but the latter will really improve your ability to program, come up\nwith algorithms, general mathematical reasoning and much more at the expense of increased difficulty.\n\nPersonally, rudin’s intro to real analysis (principles of mathematical analysis, or colloquially, baby rudin) changed my life. In particular, theorem 2.40 changed how I thought about pretty much everything. Theorem 2.40 says every infinite set of circles that contains a rectangle has a finite subset that also contains the rectangle.

If you know anything about cars there are stick shift cars and automatic right? \n\nThese days automatic transmissions are faster than humans can shift and nearly as reliable with less and less horsepower loss as the years go by. \n\nWhat your instructors are getting at is similar. C and Rust are cars with manual transmissions or in computer terms manual memory management. C#, Java, and the node.js platform are automated memory management languages. \n\nManually controlling gears, downshifting into a corner, clutch kicking when you want the ass end of your car to slide, and dumping the clutch for a nasty burnout are things you can only do in a stickshift. \n\nSimilarly, manually allocating heap (and stack) memory, directly accessing processor register information, running online assembly and other features are only possible in systems languages like C and Rust. \n\nMost people just want to get to work and back safely which is why most cars these days are automatic. Business software (and jobs) are the exact same. Businesses don't want to hire you to write a compiler or window manager. They probably want a crud app that is fast enough and doesnt look awful. \n\nYou can do a lot, these days most, types of serious software development in memory managed languages (automatic) like c# and Java. If you don't believe me ask Microsoft who uses one of the most hated languages of all time (javascript) to power their most important communications app (Teams).\n\nBuild things with the tools you have and know and then if you actually can't build something you need using the tools you already have then you pickup and learn a new tool.",

All of these things you can also do from C. Many of these things you can also do from Rust and other languages that compile to native code, but not all of them.\n\n1. Call native operating system APIs directly. If you're on Windows, go to [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/) and explore the tens of thousands of APIs. The ONLY way to call these APIs directly is from a compiled language like C++. If you call them from any other language you're just calling some wrapper function that calls the function from C. That's even true for C#, even today there are some Windows APIs that you can't call from C#. Some specific examples below.\n2. Memory mapping. Let's say you have a 1 GB file. In C++ you can memory map that to an array of bytes with 1 billion elements. The memory map function returns almost instantly, it doesn't copy the file into RAM. When you access byte 777,000, it doesn't read the previous 700 thousand bytes, it just reads only one small chunk of the file from disk into memory at the moment you access it.\n3. Shared memory. You can have multiple processes on the same computer that \"share\" a chunk of memory directly. To communicate they don't need to copy huge data structures back and forth if they don't want to.\n4. Hardware drivers. Using C++ you can write directly to a memory address, or read directly from a memory address. Most hardware peripherals are entirely controlled this way, by communicating via nothing other than accessing special memory addresses plus hardware interrupts to let you know when something changed. On a modern operating system you can only do this if you write a kernel driver, but if you get an embedded development kit you can write bare-metal code that talks to keyboards, sound chips, push buttons, or whatever just using direct memory reads and writes.\n5. Hooking system functions / injecting code into other processes. For example on Windows, write a DLL that provides an alternate implementation of some common function like ShowWindow, then inject that DLL into some other process so every time they call ShowWindow, it actually calls your function instead.",

And if you look through it, you will very quickly find little \"baby projects\" that could be made that are very C++-specific. For example, let's look at the list for concurrency:\n\n>  \n\\[2\\] Write a program with two threads: one that writes \"hello\" every second and one that writes \"world!\" every second.\n\n>\\[3\\] Time a loop. Write out the time in milliseconds. Do this for the default setting of your compiler and for a setting using an optimizer (e.g., −O2 or \"release\"). Be careful not to have the optimizer eliminate your whole loop as dead code because you did not use a result.\n\n>\\[4\\]  Repeat the histogram drawing example from §5.6.3 for a normal\\_distribution and 30 rows.\n\n>\\[5\\]  Use a regex to find all decimal numbers in a file.\n\n  \nSo, on that list, \\[2\\] and \\[3\\] \\*could\\* be done in Python, but they would not make sense. The issues that Mr Stroustrup is trying to teach here (e.g. how concurrency works on the OS or hardware level) is probably best observable in C++. Also for \\[3\\] this is purely a C/C++ thing. Python turns code into bytecode in a completely different way. I very doubt that Python does loop elimination or anything like that, for example. Also, to properly do all parts of \\[3\\], you will also need to look at the assembly language output of your code to see what optimizations your compiler is doing (and to really verify whether it is eliminating loops, and under what conditions it does that).\n\nExercises \\[4\\] and \\[5\\] probably could be done in any language, of course Python would be an easy language to use for \\[5\\]. I'm not sure why Stroustrup placed these exercises in the concurrency section. Maybe he mentioned those topics in the same book chapter for some reason.",

One day I was wondering whether there was a way in which I could predict the direction in which a stock could go and whether I could achieve this with a program. I found a tutorial online that did it with one stock, but I changed it slightly, so it worked with another stock I wanted to see.\nIt didn’t really help at all because you can’t really predict anything in the stock market with absolute certainty, but it was still really cool to write a program that accomplished this.\n\nTLDR: Think about something you really care about/are interested in and try and find ways to write programs that help you understand more about that topic(s).",

Let me throw my opinion.\n\nYou're asking yourself how a \"programmer\" thinks as in, what's the type of mentality you should be following to produce proper code.\n\nBut the truth is the code and good coding practices is just one of the many tasks one actualy has to think of about because being a \"programmer\" almost never means _just coding_.\n\nThe actual job involves a lot of aspects, to name a few potential examples: finding customers, understanding what they need and want, planing resources like time and money, concepting about data transfer, data quality, user experience, security aspects, documenting all of the above... and endless others.\n\nYou can study all you want, do plenty of tutorials and watch a dozen YouTube videos but without a proper project this all means little, and this is the reason many people fail to find a job or gather experience to begin with.\n\nSo here is what you should be doing: simulate projects. Find yourself either a friend or family member. Inform yourself about their daily tasks, their interests or hobbys and figure out where there could be need to have an application or automatization process to make their daily routine easier.\n\nOr, at last resource _pretend_ that you have a hypothetical customer, take up on different and role-play with yourself (for example, pretend that you're Person ABC, a developer, DEF, a customer, GHI, a project manager, etc, and even send emails to yourself).\n\nNow that you have a _reason_ / a project to code, research about all the steps that a project usualy requires from start to finish (GPT can help you if you don't undergo a specific training) and go through all of the steps.\n\nYes, this will triple or quadruple the actual effort rather than just coding, but this is essential for your experience, professionalism, and ensuring you've concepted and properly planned the actual development phases and don't end up stuck in a loop of overcorrecting your implementations, because you also must set yourself time and hypothetical budget deadlines.\n\nThere is only so much information I can provide here in a few sentences but I hope this helps you understand how a \"programmer\" works. Being \"just\" a programmer doesn't realy exist. You will in most cases be at least a team member, preferably also a Consultant, potentionaly even a project manager or even a freelancer. Grasping all the involved roles and being able to understand their minimum requirements will help you understand what's actualy important.\n\nAlso, last tip, start very small, with little apps and \"customer expectations\". Stuff that seems easy done and implemented can add a lot of effort and grow the project exponentionaly because each part of the project needs some extra time for that specific aspect to consider. Keep it small, keep it simple. You can always add more to it when the basics are established",

Now programmers do indirectly memorise syntax, but it's only because this is a byproduct of understand the syntax.\n\nThis would be my suggestion:\n\n1. Take an example of some C++ code from the internet.\n2. Open a text editor and type in the code. Don't copy and paste the code. The typing will help you to remember things.\n3. Run the code through a compiler making sure it compiles and runs. Understand what the running code is doing.\n4. Now go back to the editor and write one or more lines of comment for every line code in the file. Tie some of the comments back to the behaviour you saw when you ran the code.\n5. Now go back to step 1 and repeat this for another dozen or so different examples.\n\nThose 12 examples could easily be a day's work, only because you will need to research each and every line of code so that you can write the line of comment for code that makes sense and is accurate. But what you should also find; as you loop through more examples that process of adding a comment get easier; you should also find the typing gets easier and is more accurate.\n\nNow if you repeat this for two or three weeks, you'll find your way on the way to being a programmer.\n\nAnd using this approach you can actually measure your progress. If after one week you're still struggling to write a line of comment for each line of code, then you really have not learned much. Over those many examples there will be many common lines of code, meaning the comments will also be common. It is the details found in those comments that you are trying to memorise, not the code.\n\nPS: For context, here are some examples typical line comments. But in general, these comments should also span more than one line.\n\n// import the iostream. This defines the standard input/output stream objects\n\n\\#include <iostream>\n\n// write the hello world string to standard output using the cout object and don't forget the end of line character\n\nstd::cout << \"Hello World!\" << std::endl;",

Having a cheat sheet is helpful.\n\nSo, work with git is done locally in your local folder where you store your source code. When ready, you explicitly send your changes to the master copy on the remote git server. \n\nTo open a code project (and any of its branches) locally, you need to copy it down to a folder on your local machine. That’s what git clone does. It makes a local copy of a remote repository that you will then work in. You generally use it once when you join a team working on a codebase or if you get a new laptop or something.\n\nOnce you clone, you get to the second command: checkout. In every other source control system I’ve ever used, checkout means you want to edit something and want to prevent or inform other users of that. In git it means either you want to switch to a certain branch or you want to make a new branch from the current branch. Just remember that. Checkout is for local branch switching and changes nothing in the remote repository.\n\nHere are the basic commands for doing local work and explicitly communicating it to the remote master copy:\n\nFetch - I want to update my local list of branches and their history so I can view what my coworkers did and maybe checkout someone else’s branch if needed.\n\nPull - I want to update my current branch with the latest changes from the repo. This may prompt a merge if there are conflicts. You often do this to update your local copy of a main develop branch and rarely the one you’re actually working in.\n\nPush - I want to send my committed changes to the repo for other people to use. This may trigger build automation.\n\nStash - I want to preserve select changes in a local side store while rolling back the files for tracking purposes. You do this to preserve a draft for future use.\n\nMerge - I want to move changes from my current branch into another (e.g. I’m done with my feature and want to merge it into the main dev branch). This is done locally. You pull dev first. Then commit and push the merge into it. \n\nThat merge btw, is often done using a process called a pull request which puts a review request in front of the merge.",

It is really important to not code along, you need to retrieve the information from your brain in order to streangthen your memory.

If you have trouble with that watch videos in smaller chunks like 10-20 minutes or just watch single chapters if the video has them.\nThen after you completet the tutorial you play with the code. Try to add new features or write a different project with your new skills. You need to tinker, this will really boost your learning. ",

So for example if a project builds with gcc, clang, and MSVC they might wait until all three support all of the syntax, but if the project only needs to run on one platform with one toolchain they might upgrade sooner.\n\nAllowing features from a newer C++ rarely means updating all existing code. Parts of the code that are stable and haven't changed in a while might still be written in an older style, including a pre-C++11 style.\n\nSo if you joined a company today and got put on a C++ project, my expectation would be that it supports and allows C++20 (which has been stable in all compilers for a while), does not support C++23 (most compilers have incomplete support, the average project doesn't want to be bleeding-edge), but that lots of the code doesn't take advantage of newer features where it could because nobody has bothered to rewrite it.\n\nNewer versions of C++ standardize things like networking and threading that were previously only available from third-party libraries. I think use of those in existing projects is low, because most existing projects already use a different library that works fine, so why change something that works?",

For language learning you can write word lists where you feasibly will return to every word 20+ times and reach that long term memory. And for philosophy you can do the same with 1-2 sentence long quotes.\n\nAlso, (for most of us) coding is our profession and not our hobby, so in a good way we are kind of forced to get that long term exposure to CS concepts anyways through our work that will lead up to the concepts sticking in our long term memory.",

I do quite enjoy asking candidates \\*why\\* they worked on this particular problem because hearing about how people have scratched and itch that they have found is usually quite interesting and clue to how they think about the world. \n\nHowever... it's 98% about how they have structured a project and how their code looks. \n\nI'm afraid, as an apparently satanic friendly Russian has already pointed out, there is quite a lot of issue with the code itself and this, I feel, probably would work against you. \n\nWhen I am reviewing code I am expecting to see some consideration of 4 groups of people... \n\n1) Your users\n\nI don't mind that there is not a UI, there are plenty of technical, command line utility projects out there, but why are you telling me what I need to call my files? You have a CLI tool, where are my flags and options? Why do I have to accept all your hard coded values like 'chat.txt' and all the thresholds and things? Why can't I configure these on the CLI and experiment with the results? This is a CLI tool for technical users right? Who are they? What are their skills and what might they need? \n\n2) Future developers looking to understand your code\n\nThere are plenty of improvements to be found here. Separating the files, and not doing things like calling regular expression variables 'pattern', which can be clearly seen by the fact that you assign it a.. well... pattern. What pattern? What is it for? You had an opportunity to provide a descriptive name here, and you went for the most 'technically correct, but useless' option. This is a microcosm and applies all over your code. Go through it, and refactor giving consideration to other people who will want to understand what you are doing. \n\n3) Future developers looking to \\*extend\\* your code\n\nWhere are your hooks? You don't have to have a network accessible API but where are the places in your code that future developers might hook into to provide additional or improved functionality? I'd like to see that you have thought about where things might go next and left the code in such a way that somebody other than you might pick that up and run with it. \n\n4) The reviewer \n\nThis, in some sense is an extension of number 2, but if you are submitting your code for review for job applications you want to be applying number 2 here to a more elevated degree than you even might in other projects. I don't see a single comment in your codebase. Comments are a bit out of a fashion on some professional codebases right now because people have the (correct and noble) goal of writing 'self-documenting code'. Few who attempt this can do it effectively honestly and you definitely can't right now (not a dig, this might be the hardest coding skill to actually learn and takes many years). Without self-documenting code, you need to be documenting with comments. As a reviewer I don't have a huge amount of time to spend on each application (especially at junior where there are, these days, potentially hundreds), so if I don't 'get' your code within a few minutes, I will probably put your application into the 'maybe' pile to come back to if other applications are not better. I need to return to the 'maybe' pile for an applicant perhaps 5% of the time... because there is usually something better. \n\nYour energy and drive is great, and you have picked a problem and solved it. Really good for you and don't be disheartened. Many, most, juniors have \\*nothing\\* to submit, you just now need to take what you have done and think about the 4 groups I mention and consider their needs and interests and you will have something very valuable to put on your resume.

The larger companies will not analyze this, but instead put you through competence tests that they themselves devise, so I disagree with the reasoning behind some of the other comments here. The projects on your CV at your level are to demonstrate domain interest and active learning.\n\nFor higher level roles, your current project would not count as a large project that holds the same weight as an employment entry on your CV. The closer your project is to a product then the more likely you would be to gain/pass a product-centred interview stage(s). It's perfectly fine to gain product development experience primarily through employment though. So you should really be focusing on being valuable over pretending you are a highly experienced product developer.\n\nFrom here, in my opinion, you've got two options to continue your active learning - develop this project into something closer to a product, or begin a new project that fits a target domain. The point being, don't spend time upgrading this project at the expense of genuine interest, by for example; appending unit tests onto it. If you want to genuinely learn about test-driven development then begin a new project. Adding unit tests onto a project after the development stage would skip some of the development process insights you could gain from doing it properly.",

At most smaller companies, everyone in security has to know a little bit about everything.\n\nRemember, security is only as strong as its weakest link. Let's say your company has a mobile app, a web app, and a backend running in AWS with a Postgres database. All of them need to be secure. If just a single one is insecure and can be hacked, that brings the whole company down and it doesn't matter how secure everything else was.\n\nHonestly that's one of the things that makes security fun. You don't stay in your small lane, you get to work on literally everything. Your job is to catch any potential vulnerabilities wherever they might be, before hackers do first.",

So what you're wanting to learn is a particular style of programming.  That's a good goal, but you need to learn general programming concepts before you can comprehend a specific subset of coding.  \n\nThere are two distinct ways of thinking about APIs, and both depend on some knowledge of core programming ideas.  First, you can write a program in any language that *consumes* an API.  That is, you can write a program that uses an API to find the current weather in Barbados.  This is a relatively straightforward process in most languages, but typically you learn this after you've learned more fundamental things, like how to get information from the user or from local files, how to handle looping and branching, and how to write functions.\n\nThe other way to think about APIs is to *produce* an API.  In that sense, you are writing a program that lives on some type of server that produces data in some kind of machine-readable format (usually JSON, but other formats are certainly viable).  This is also not a difficult process, but it requires knowledge of essential programming concepts, and typically you'll also want to write a front-end package to test your API. \n\nI would say start with any good programming course.  There's a good reason Python is taught as a first language in most CS courses.  It's reasonably straightforward, and is excellent for a number of use cases, including working with APIs.   You can read and create APIs with Python out of the box, but for creating an API, you'd probably be better off using a library like flask, bottle, or rapidAPI.  I would definitely learn standard programming ideas first before digging into libraries. Express.js is fine, but it's a specialized form of JavaScript that doesn't make any sense if you don't already know how to program in vanilla JS. \n\nIt seems to me that CodeAcademy has a more organized curriculum.  It doesn't go straight into using APIs, but that is fine.  If you can't drive yet, race cars don't matter. Learn to program in a language, then we can focus on the particular skills you want.  FreeCodeCamp is great for looking up a specific skill, but it often makes a lot of assumptions about what you already know.   \n\nI have some videos of my own I can send you, so DM me if you want that.",

Regardless of *specific* guts any given function (or class or anything) needs, what is the contract it makes with the outside world. If I want to calculate the distance between two sets of latitude & longitude coordinates... I may not yet know exactly how to correctly calculate that... but figuring out the exact contract I want for handing that work off to a function is pretty trivial:\n\n    func calculateDistance(from: Coordinate, to: Coordinate) -> Distance {\n        return 0\n    }\n\n(for whatever syntax you need for your language)\n\n  \nIf I chunk my application up in this way, I can write the main flow of `main` or whatever into this smaller bites and start with an organized structure of code that I just need to go back and fill in little chunks bit by bit.\n\nIf it's easier for you to implement all the logic first *then* slice chunks off to move into functions, I think that's *also* fine.... but it also means the contracts, the interface, becomes kind of an afterthought *and* it means your first pass likely has you non-obviously duplicating some code.",

This massively increases adoption and helps you get grants and sponsorships  \n\\- Build it for you first; everyone else comes second otherwise you lose grasp of the vision\n\nBasically:\n\n\\- No one will use it if the documentation sucks or if the github looks dead  \n\\- Integrating with other tools is the fastest way to grow since you are tapping into existing userbases  \n\\- During downtime or if you get writers block, use your framework as a content creation engine...this gets you views and also helps you apply for grants etc\n\nAs for resources:\n\n\\- Look up \"Commercial Open Source Software\", even if the point isn't to make money it helps you understand how big frameworks gain momentum  \n\\- Keep an eye out for fellowships and foundations, eg I received over $15k in grants from Processing Fellowship alone by integrating with p5.js and three.js",

[https://github.com/Retro-Tv-Emulator/Retro-Tv-Emulator.git](https://github.com/Retro-Tv-Emulator/Retro-Tv-Emulator.git) it just sits there bc i cant code. i even got a back end installed follow directions from the no-code platform but without that knowledge, i still cant fix the bugs that it does not know what to do with. and the biggest issue, the project got to big for the no-code platform and it would just get confused and start breaking and changing all kinds of stuff but never what you asked it to do.",

That being said, low code environs can be massively helpful in niche fields like computational geometry where having visual feedback for geometry manipulation is - I'd say - almost mandatory.\n\nFrom what I've seen so far - no-code or low code tech seems to thrive in cases where (a) the majority of the users aren't programmers, and (b) outputs from these technologies aren't the deliverables in and of themselves.\n\nBy deliverables I mean the end product being shipped/deployed/put into production.\n\nFor example, in the construction industry - architects and engineers will frequently use no-code solutions to build quick and dirty prototypes for their projects. But these prototypes aren't the deliverable, the drawings and 3d models are. They'll use the prototypes as seeds/base for building mode complex models sure, but the direct output from a no-code or low code solution is rarely ever passed on as the actual deliverable.\n\nTo sum it all up - For a typical career in programming, I feel you don't really need it (outside of cases where using them speeds up the feedback loop). But if you go into niche fields like game development and/or 3d modelling, then you'll encounter them sooner or later, but you don't need to know them beforehand to get used to them.",

I did databases for a while, and our primary tool was a low-code thing called 'datastage' where you drag and drop  icons and connect them to do the work, with just a little sql here and there to help out.  It took basic, C++, and some others if you needed a custom thing -- I wrote a few just because the performance was so bad compared to C++, even though it did the same thing.  But regardless, it was pretty easy to learn how to use it... COMING FROM a coding background.  People without any experience were as mystified by this kind of tool as they are by anything else computer people can do.  But to highlight just how easy it was, about 1/4 of our team were not software developers but could use it fine after some hands on with the computer science majors helping out, talking 2 weeks to be good enough.  I have used a couple of other older programs of this nature, same thing... easy for someone with a coding background... so focus on this stuff only if its a BIG part of your planned career.",

One project I worked on involved an in house \"low code\" platform that the client (very large org) had developed internally for their very .net heavy suoply chain management/logistics application. On paper it wasn't hard to wrap my head around the platform itself, but after 6 months of backend work on another project, it was painful having to get into a workflow of connecting front end \"no-code\" visual elements with C# code that was still necessary. There was a structure within this app that had many layers for simple things a user would interact with that would have been handled painlessly in code, but instead I found myself keeping track of many nested \"parts\" all over my monitors and such. \n\nThis was 3 years ago, never happened before and hasn't happened since.",

The other thing would be to run the program in the background, ask for help to set it up so it doesn’t use too much memory, or can periodically do resets, and start up when the pc reboots.

Using the UI(user interface) would be a challenge but nothing unfriendly for Java and is good practice for using the API.\nAs for Java friendly, I’d say using Java for the first two is good for learning Java, but the last one is very much Java friendly because of Java’s tools and usability , at least compared to the other languages I know.\n\n(Java was my first language, so I am very biased and probably sentimental)",

But usually no they don't, because they're implemented in hardware which only supports a few precisions.Traditionally, those have been 32 bit and 64 bit. With machine learning, we're seeing a lot more interest in really, really low precision because it still works \"pretty dern good\" for big fuzzy matrix multiplies. So you'll see FP16, FP8, BFLOAT16, and other variants. But those are mostly confined to GPU tensor computing, not general purpose processing.  For 99.X% of general purpose applications, the hardware is super super fast and you don't care that much about precision. If you do care, you should probably be using fixed point.\n\nA good way to think of floating point is as a fraction between powers of 2. So for numbers between 32 and 64, you get 32 \\* 1.XXXX. That [1.XXX](http://1.XXX) fraction is the \"mantissa\" and the power of two is the \"exponent\". The number of bits in the mantissa gives you your precision. It's very precise near zero, and it gets a lot less precise for really big numbers. You can simulate any arbitrary precision you want in software though by just storing all the mantissa bits and simulating the floating point operations with fixed point.\n\nAnother interesting bit is that for machine learning, they do care a lot about the buildup of errors from layers and layers of floating point. They normally fix that by normalizing the output to be between 0 and 1 at each layer rather than messing with the precision of the multiplications.",

If you’re interested in cryptography then some discrete maths and number theory are your friends.\n\nAt the very least a good grounding in discrete maths. \nFocus on understanding the concepts and as much of the proofs as possible. Don’t be bummed out to not understand certain proofs. A high level idea is good enough you’re not trying to be a mathematician.\n\nGood luck my friend",

For us, UML is like a schematic for an electrical engineer or a blueprint for an architect.

        "body": "Python is a good start and is enough to understand programming concepts.\n\nTo be completely fair, the most important concepts you need to learn have nothing to do with actual programming or languages. Those are your foundations - Data Structures, Algorithms, Networking, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Databases. There’s a very good reason most universities focus on theory for the first two years of a CS degree, and not so much on coding. Learning these will make you understand programming as a whole. After that, any language will be equally valuable to you.\n\nTo answer the question. I’d say, after learning Python well, you can either go useful, frontend or lower level (well every other language is lower level but that’s not the point).\n\nIf you want to find a job as quickly as possible, learn Java or C#. Those languages are by far the most used in the industry and there’s never lack in demand (keep in mind that there is also a lot of supply). If you choose this option, you have to know that you’ll also most definitely need to learn their respective web frameworks - Spring and .NET, as they are pretty much required by the job market. This is a very good path to take and I can highly recommend it. Also, keep in mind that there’s a very good chance you circle around to Java/C#, even if you choose a different path now, since these are one of the most essential languages and are taught and used everywhere.\n\nAnother popular route is to master JavaScript and become a capable full-stack developer. That’s also where React comes in. React is a JavaScript framework used for simplifying the way to build responsive web interfaces. I think there will be time in the future to worry about frontend, so I wouldn’t choose learning JavaScript at your current stage.\n\nFinally, the lower level route. I personally encourage any beginner to go deep into the land of pointers because you gain soo much more understanding of the way a computer works, than you do by using Python or JavaScript. For this I recommend you go with either C or C++ (personally, I’d go with C). These languages are what we call “lower level” because they don’t have fancy built in features to simplify the hard stuff and you have to think a lot more about everything. Those languages have no “garbage collection” meaning you need to allocate your own memory, and you need to free it when you don’t use it anymore. They use pointers to reference the data you use. C has no Object Oriented Programming, meaning you can only encapsulated data using a “struct”, and you can’t have methods tied to that data (procedural programming).",

FizzBuzz is just an easy, dumb problem [to see if a candidate knows enough to at least solve an easy, dumb problem](https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/). We all have our favorite little solutions, but if you can write a function with a loop and a few \\`if\\` statements, you're done.\n\n>However, the above link doesn't explain why the hashmap solution is more efficient.\n\nHashmaps trade space for time. They offer O(1) time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions, which is to say that you can find, add, or remove an element in constant time regardless of whether it contains 5 elements, 5 thousand, or 5 million. But they get that speed by using enough space to avoid collisions (where different keys hash to the same location) most of the time, so they're very efficient in time, much less so in space.\n\n>I've heard that in technical job interview problems, if you can use a hashmap, then you should. Would you agree with this?\n\nCertainly not. Use the right data structure for the job. Hashmaps are often a great choice, because if you can get constant-time access to every element, that's pretty appealing. But hashmaps are unordered, so a poor choice if you want to access elements in order. They use a ton of space, so not great if there's a space constraint or if the number of elements is huge. And they don't handle multiple values for a single key. Maybe those are reasons that you \"can't\" use a hashmap, but I'd still turn it around and say that if you *need* what a hashmap offers, then you should use it; if a different structure offers a better combination of features, you should use that instead.",

In that case, just using hashmaps everywhere is probably better than not knowing what to do at all. In the end, you'll probably do better by learning some basic data structures and writing programs with them, then using your own brain to decide what is easier, nicer, and more efficient.",

It is truly a misunderstanding of epic proportions that everyone thinks they should \"learn\" how to solve FizzBuzz to prepare for an interview ...\n\nAnyways, the third solution with the hashmap, is **NOT a solution for the FizzBuzz problem**, but a generic \"engine\" that can solve any kind of similar problems where you have some specific value, and if a number is divisible by that value, it should print a specific word instead - combining all the words to one compound word, if the number is divisible by all of them. None of the code will change if you add Jazz for divisible by 7, only the datastructure (the hashmap).\n\n*And it is poorly written, violates the \"single source of truth\" and ironically makes the code harder to maintain, which was the exact point of using a hashmap in the first place.*\n\nPlease don't write ultra-generic code in your interview or in your professional life - I had a colleague once, that wrote some code to handle which days of the week some system should be active. He made it flexible enough to handle if a week ever had more than 7 days, or if there were by chance two Thursdays ...\n\n\n\nAlso, don't trust Geeksforgeeks - their code and article-text often don't match, in this example the text mentions Jazz for 7, but none of the code examples implement it.

We can compare:\n\n*  _actual_ **run-time** time versus the\n*  _expected_ **theoretical** best case. \n\nThat is, we can do A vs B comparisons such as A is `X%` faster or `Y%` slower to answer the question: _Is our optimization helping, hindering, or neither?_\n\nBut oftentimes we want to know HOW an algorithm scales up relative to input size. `O()` is an _estimate_ of this which may, or may NOT, be accurate:\n\nIf we have three algorithms that all perform the same task and have this scaling ... \n\n* O( n )\n* O( n^K )\n* O( K^n )\n\n... then the linear `O( n )` algorithm is probably going to be the fastest, by far, all things considered.\n\nHowever `O()` IGNORES RAM speed, RAMaccess patterns, and branch prediction -- all which MAY be factors!\n\nThe _reason_ this was done was that pre-2000's CPU speed and RAM speed roughly had a 1:1 mapping. We used to store calculations in tables because the computation speed was SO slow.\n\nHowever by the 2000's CPU speeds became significantly faster than RAM. As CPU speeds increased and RAM didn't (as much) it became faster to calculate more, lookup less.\n\nUnfortunately Computer Science textbooks never got the memo that `O()` has COMPLETELY failed to adapt to the changing hardware and performance uplifts of modern systems. **It is an INCOMPLETE metric.**\n\nLet's take a [simple example](https://github.com/Michaelangel007/cache_line_speed) of summing up entries in an array.\n\n    sum = 0;\n    for( int col = 0; col < STRIDE; col++ )\n        for( int row = 0; row < SIZE; row += col )\n            sum = data[ row + col ];\n\n_Normally_ stride is 1, sequential acess, but what if it isn't?\n\nWe can change the stride to show HOW we access data (and the data cache) plays more and more of a role the larger the data set.\n\nFor example with an array of 2^30 elements (1,073,741,824) we see this falloff:\n\n| Stride | Op/s | Time |\n|--:|--:|--:|\n| 1 | 1 G/s | 00:00:00s |\n| 2 | 1 G/s | 00:00:00s |\n| 4 | 733 M/s\t | 00:00:01s |\n| 8 | 388 M/s | 00:00:02s |\n| 16 | 213 M/s | 00:00:04s |\n| 32\t | 141 M/s | 00:00:07s |\n| 64\t|  116 M/s | 00:00:08s |\n| 128 | 115 M/s | 00:00:08s |\n| 256 | 115 M/s | 00:00:08s |\n| 512 | 100 M/s | 00:00:10s | \n| 1024 | 66 M/s | 00:00:15s |\n\nEXACT same O(n) but HUGE differences in the Real World^TM.\n\nHOW we access this array matters! This is why ... \n\n* AoS (Array of Structs) and \n* SoA (Struct or Arrays) \n\n... can have such a HUGE difference even though we are iterating over the _same_ data. **All those cache misses add up to slower performance.** This demonstrating O() IS incomplete for modern algorithms.\n\nIn modern performance programming, often times we want a _branchless algorithm_ as we are _trading latency for throughput._ We want to keep the CPU pipeline saturated with work and not cause pipeline bubbles or flushes via branching.\n\nThere are 3 categories of optimizations from slowest to fastest:\n\n1. **Micro-optimization** or [Bit Twiddling Hacks](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html). On older compilers and slower CPUs you would replace `MOD` with `AND` for powers of two, division with multiplication and bit shifts. i.e.  Calculating `7*n` as `n + 2*n + 4*n` -- assuming your CPU even has a `MUL` instruction!\n\n2. **Algorithm.** Using a faster algorithm used to be the second step in optimization . We would use `O()` as a guideline for performance/scalability.\n\n3. **Macro-optimization** or Cache-Oriented aka Data-Oriented Design (DOD). As we deal with larger data sets optimizing for _minimizing cache misses_ becomes more important.\n\nSee [CppCon 2019: Matt Godbolt “Path Tracing Three Ways: A Study of C++ Style”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG6c4Kwbv4I) where OOP, FP, and DOD is compared.",

They use SOQL (Salesforce object query language) which is a lot like SQL but not as fleshed out. I ended up getting really frustrated by these limitations and changed roles in like 7 months. \n\n\nThen it may have just been my org but we used provar for testing which is cancer. And flosum for version control which is... Fine but way worse than git. Since those are both Salesforce products.",

And if your long-term goal is to work remotely, you can still work toward that in parallel.\n\nThat is the path I ended up taking. I spent months applying to \"remote\" jobs that seemed like a perfect fit, only to find out they were limited to one country, or I got automatically rejected because of my location.

After over 200 hours of research and trying to apply to hundreds of jobs, I ended up building a list of 300 truly remote-first companies. \n\nIn a nutshell, it sounds like you are taking a smart approach already, and just getting started with real experience is most likely the best first step.",

Opinions vary on whether or not using \"interfaces\" is a good way to go, both sides have good arguments IMO.\n\nStepping back, *why* do you need runtime polymorphism? Is there a design that doesn't require it? In this case, you can probably get away with instantiating each importer you want, and selecting a concrete implementation to be used based on file type, something like this:\n\n```\n// No virtual\nclass AssimpImporter { void importByFile(); };\nclass StbImporter { void importByFile(); };\n\n// Top-level \"importer\" facade\nclass Importer {\n  public:\n    void importByFile() {\n      if (assimp_importer_.supports(file_type)) assimp_importer_.importByFile();\n      else if (stb_importer_.supports(file_type)) stb_importer_.importByFile();\n      // ...\n    }\n  \n  private:\n    AssimpImporter assimp_importer_;\n    StbImporter stb_importer_;\n};\n```\n\nIf you need some compile-time polymorphism, C++ concepts are a sort of weird duck-type-y tool you can use too:\n\n```\ntemplate<typename T>\nconcept MeshImporter = requires(T a)\n{\n    { a.importByFile() } -> std::same_as<void>;\n};\n\nclass AssimpImporter {\n  public:\n    void importByFile() {}\n};\nstatic_assert(MeshImporter<AssimpImporter>);\n\ntemplate<MeshImporter T>\nvoid doFancyMeshImportThings(T* importer, File file) {\n  importer.importByFile();\n}\n```",

Thing is, if you're afraid of doing that, then it's tough to get started. Chances are, you don't know what your program should look like when you're beginning.\n\nRather than spending hours upon hours on planning something only to later change your mind(or even worse, get attached to your initial idea because you don't want the effort you put into it to go to waste), instead try things out, see what doesn't work, figure out how to make it work better, and so forth, until you arrive as a cohesive whole.\n\nFraming the early stages of your project purely as a exploratory learning experience is quite liberating. I think that you should only begin properly implementing the project when you're ready and confident with your design, and I believe that you can only get there by trying things out and figuring out everything that can give you trouble, first hand.",

As others have pointed out, Intel has not innovated in a while.\n\nBack in the 1990s, the thoughts that Motorola would stop producing processors and innovating was absurd. The 68k CPUs drove entire generations of home consoles, not to mention oodles of commercial applications.\n\nThe fact is, they couldn't keep up with Intel. That's what buried them. Now, if anything, they build ARM designs, no need to innovate. But that's also why you don't find them so prevalent in modern markets. They still do stuff, but the Motorola of the 1990s has been subdivided and chopped up more times than a tin of tomatoes. It never really recovered it's prominence in the processor world, it just makes low key devices, that's why you only sometimes see the Motorola logo gracing various products. They license a lot of it's IP. \n\nThe question is, what's burying Intel? In the home markets, maybe AMD? Samsung certainly has a major edge against either company's offerings with most of Samsung's fabric being manufactured and designed with far cheaper labour than what the Americans can do. \n\nI don't doubt that in 15 years, when we want to build a new home PC, we'll be looking at NVidia and Samsung processors instead of Intel. The current gen of home consoles are sporting AMD and NVidia fabric these days, Intel doesn't even have a shoe in.",

Even though the tool absolutely was tracking stats at the individual-level, they just said they weren't gonna use it.\n\nEveryone knew they were gonna use it. We're not stupid.\n\nThat company used to have an amazing WLB, and then there were a couple C-suite changes and a bunch of upper management changes and not long after those changes this tool was introduced, and the culture went to shit.\n\nI found another job by mid-2024.\n\nIt's nothing inherently wrong with my previous company, or with Microsoft. It's just a culture shift. They went from chill, to micromanagey-PIP-culture. Different strokes, I'm not gonna demand they keep a culture that I like.\n\nI always say culture shifts are the *only* inevitable thing in this industry. It's why I recommend if you're at a good employer, you hold onto that employer for as long as they stay good. They *will* change at some point, so cash in while you can. Then when they change, you jump ship, and your salary gets re-adjusted to market rate.\n\nI found another company with a great culture/WLB in 2024, and it's still great now. I'm praying it stays good for the long-run. If the culture/WLB stays like it is now I will happily stay here the rest of my career. I'm just not naive enough to think that's very likely.\n\nAll that's to say.... I'm just not surprised.",

When the market is overall doing well and people agree spending money, that Cascades down to every segment of the economy - if you spend more money at restaurants, waiters make more money, so they spend up on Hulu without ads, so SWEs at Hulu get paid more, so they buy a bigger house, and their realtor makes more money, etc.\n\nI feel like that's the logical side of the answer.\n\nThen there's seemingly just.... vibes.\n\nFor like 5-10 years, every tech company got into this arms race of spending as much as possible on DS, ML, etc. Like, you couldn't be a tech company and not have an answer when the board of directors asked \"what are we doing in ML?\".\n\nI was working at a dino Fortune 500 company - not tech. And I had to put together an entire deck for my boss to tell the board what our ML strategy was. \n\nThe point is, you couldn't get left behind. Even though the ROI was trash, you had to throw money at it. Most companies had no idea what they were gonna get out of it.\n\nAnd I feel like at some point, that broke. I think Twitter under Elon opened the floodgates - he went the opposite way (let's get rid of bloat) and to a degree it allowed every company to reset. And sure enough, every company immediately took that as an opportunity to pivot into cost savings mode - even though most of these companies are still doing great financially.\n\nSo when will the job market improve?\n\nOne answer is when the overall economy starts doing better. \n\nAnother answer is whenever some sunset of tech companies decide they want to play offense and start spending again to try to separate themselves from the rest",

Follow a consistent problem solving process (you can google around).\n\n2. Practice speaking out load through that process when you practice.\n\n3.

Go on Blind or Glassdoor to find these. \n\nIn theory nothing is wrong with LeetCode. But it’s because the questions you get are random when you interview. It would be more fair if it was like: “you’ll get one tree problem, one sorting problem, and one path finding problem”. But that’s not the case, you can be given literally any problem and be expected to solve it. A very stupid test simply meant to fail most candidates, because you’re expected to know literally every algorithm and data structure.  The study has 0 application to your actual job, unless you are studying for some hardcore algorithms or low latency engineer. In which case you’d be told ahead of time which algorithms they expect you to know, etc. Now we have Cursor and other AI IDEs too, these skills are less and less needed.\n\nI get contacted by Google and Meta recruiters regularly.

Needing to ask questions during the work day is impossible. The number of times I've seen a team work for eight hours on the wrong task, or a solution that's completely unviable, is nearly equal to the number of days I've worked with Indian engineers.\n\nAnd there's another reason that outsourcing to India sucks: The best developers in India don't want to work under those conditions, and they don't work for $20/hour or whatever you're paying your outsourcing team members. I'm told that many of the junior developers who get hired by outsourcing companies are making $10/day, and it's blatantly obvious that they do just enough work to keep the contact live for as long as possible. \n\nNone of this is even remotely racism. Put a billion people in an area that has insufficient employment opportunities and you'll find millions who are willing to learn just enough software development to be able to do a crap job in outsourcing as part of a scam to extract money from richer countries. It's human nature. It has nothing to do with their culture or the color of their skin or their accent (though extra strong accents can impede communication, and that's a real problem).\n\nNot only that, but scammers running consulting companies run them in the US as well. Several of such companies are well known as defense contractors. Remember the debacle of the Obamacare web site that had something like 50 different consulting companies working on various parts? I'd have a hard time assigning that work to fifty people much less fifty teams. And the result was a disaster.\n\nThat said, at the low end of developer skill? It may very well be permanent. For the last 30 years it's been bad for lower skill developers more often than it's been good. Higher skill developers are still doing OK even now, at least if we're willing to accept lower salaries. \n\nSo the question to ask yourself is what your relative skill level is. If you have always been in the bottom of your class or the slowest employee wherever you have worked, it might be best to try for a pivot.\n\n(Edits: Fixed auto complete fails)",

They are incentivized to focus on passing the interview rather than long-term transferable skills. I'm sure some of them are good enough for the position, but that isn't always the case.\n\nWith AI and vibe coding, it's never been easier for mediocre developers to pose as a higher skilled one, especially when you only work remotely. \n\nOnce the companies start to smell the shit pilings of AI generated code as it starts to cost them in maintenance, we might see a recovery.

The 2008 crash we probably didnt fully recover until like 2012 or so. \n\nThe argument i always make (and i have little actual numbers or data) is that covid made everything ridiculously high. Government was giving out money like candy to any independent worker or business. People were getting money that they didnt deserve to get (some did need it). I didnt deserve a stimulus check tbh, and i got one. \n\nIn 2020 everybody stayed put to their jobs because they didnt know how the future would look like so it was best to stay put. Then things open up in 2021, companies all have the money to use for hiring so companies of all shapes and sizes ar hiring. Jobs become remote and it looks like remote is the future. But what i think happened was that companies didnt realize how hard it was to hire remote workers and have them quickly learn their codebases. Jr engineers didnt have any camaraderie with their older engineers. Then the free money is gone, people arent spending as much as they did in the high time of covid, and many projects get acwd because small companies can no longer keep up after the government help ended. Bigger companies realize that they can either get a similar engineer for less money or that they overhired in 2021-22 and can fire PIPd employees quicker without having to give severance. Companies have still paused hiring for some time and because of that many people have stayed without a job. I also think potential candidates are too in love with the idea of remote work that anything less than that they are avoiding.  \n\nBut i applied to many jobs and sooke with many recruiters. The consensus i get is that, it’s not  fully recovered but it is slowly getting better.",

Or they think coding is just like excel. \n\nExecutives? Whole different breed. To them, all work is menial. The only thing they get to see is results. PowerPoint decks. And I think when you do that long enough, you start to very quickly forget that people need to actually do the work.\n\nSo when the work is not getting done - deadlines are missed, the product isn't good enough, whatever - your first thought isn't \"I need to get in there and figure out what's going on\". Your first thought is \"I need someone to get this department's ass in gear\".\n\nA lot of people hate on middle management, but that is literally the role of middle management - to both be close enough to the work to understand what is and isn't getting done and why, while also being above the work enough to be able to tell executives what they need to know (and what they want to hear).",

Learn to code is a term coined by bill gates, I don't know what people here think. That big tech enjoys paying people 200K for knowing basic html? Of course they want everyone to code and will promote it. A lot of day in the life videos are sponsored as well by sub industries like boot camp and self teaching courses. There's no universe where people would just \"stfu about it\" because people are making money selling the shovels here. All these big \"day in a life\" channels made even more money partenering up with algo interview prep sites, boot camps, code academy and so on.\n\nGenerally speaking there's no way to keep things like this a secret, because there are always industry incentives to \"sell\" getting into the industry itself. It happens with every field. People were telling everyone to \"stfu\" about law, finance and engineering and look how that turned out.\n\nToday's oversaturation is due to one thing and one thing only, it's cause this field pays a shit ton and there WAS demand for it but now that demand is lower.",

They’re going to give you X number of shares the day you sign your offer. That number is determined by your total comp target. They’ll use a 30 day moving average stock price. Stock has tanked recently due to external political factors. That works in your benefit… I know many people who made a killing getting hired post split when the stock price was $90-$100 coming in with those 4 year guaranteed grants… some took that and moved to quieter parts of the country, bought a home in cash, and took a slower paced fully remote job.

You get started on 401k faster/earlier in your career, employee stock plan, the best health insurance in the country fully paid, they have education reimbursement (when I was there it was 5250$ a year they just pay you out, literally free NON-TAXED money) for going to school that you are already doing, you can work in sales and not have to deal with as many angry people as the Genius Bar, even busy stores have very flexible schedules to work with your class schedule, and there are no sales quotas for you as an individual (this doesn't mean don't work hard but you won't feel pressure when you go to work). I truly believe that there is no better college job out there than an Apple store if you have one near you.",

There's a lot of people willing to take a pay cut, or work longer hours to be part of something they are passionate about. \n\n  \nSo people get into it thinking it's going to be a fun job. Then the reality hits - a lot of the time, you might be on a huge team, just working on a very small part of a game without a lot of say in how the game is put together. It becomes the kind of work you'd do anywhere else, it just gets plugged into a game at the end.\n\n  \nUltimately, I think the gaming industry is kind of past it's prime. There was a time when a team of 1-10 people could build a ground breaking AAA game. Rollercoaster Tycoon was built by one dude, for instance. Now, AAA games are made by teams of 100+ people. But the games don't cost 10-100 times more just because they required an investment of 10-100x what they used to. Game Studios are much less likely to take risks, it's just like games like \"Call of Duty 153, Ultra Future War\" or whatever, there's not as much innovation which I think is why a lot of people are drawn to the work. \n\n  \nSo people who love gaming get into the industry. They are smart enough to make 50-100% more doing any other corporate job, but the game companies know they can get top talent for a fraction of the price, and in fact, need to, because of how expensive development has gotten. Then they work there for a while, and find that while the work and team structure is similar to any other corporate job, they are being under paid/over worked, while their peers who went to work at some boring fortune 500 company are walking out the doors after 40-50 hour weeks, making more money, enjoying other things in life. They are stuck grinding it out while thier passion slowly leaves them, and they not only don't like their job, but they also don't like video games anymore.",

For a SWE that isn't tied to an industry, they can just find another job if they're ever unhappy. When you've tied your entire career to a specific industry, you don't have those options. You get to go to another company that also has a terrible culture. You have no bargaining power. Companies are very aware of this.\n\nI'd argue most passion careers suffer from this same issue. When there's a niche passion fueling your career choices, you will be taken advantage of.",

I'm definitely a soldier in my attitude, and that's largely a protective measure since I don't control the \"mission\", so worrying about things beyond my control, where I don't have an ability to impact, doesn't make a lot of sense. You should be a missionary when you're an owner.\n\nThis same thing happened to me when I tried to join a recycling start up. Idgaf about recycling, and the CEO asked me directly, \"so tell me how recycling and climate are important to you\". I basically told him I'm interested in doing great engineering work. Jokes on him, now I make 3x the salary they were offering me!\n\nThese small companies tend to go way too far with hiring on \"alignment\", and think they aren't employers, but facilitating employees to fufil a higher level calling to service that is exactly the same as their. It's such BS. Trust me, you dodged a huge bullet: these guys have no idea what they are doing, and nothing is worse than working with a bunch of incompetents whose biggest credential is \"they care\". It sounds like you care about software, care about leading, and care about building things. If that's not enough, fuck 'em!",

Ask some follow-up questions, and dig into the choice of algorithm or data structure.\n\nI typically ask Number Of Islands, because it's easy enough, and even if you don't know graph traversal you can probably brute force your way into inventing DFS.\n\nSometimes I'll ask this question and will get a working solution in 5-10 mins. Many times, I'll ask the time and space complexity, why they chose DFS over BFS, what changes if you switch, how they'd handle a graph with 1B rows and columns, how they'd implement with a stack/queue/in-line, etc. When the person has a blank stare and can no longer answer, I know they've memorised the solution or they've cheated. If they can answer these questions logically, they're usually a strong hire.\n\nPeople have been cheating for DECADES. Back in the 2000's I heard stories of people aceing the complex Google interview process, turning up on their first day, and someone being confused because they swore the guy they interviewed was Asian. It also wasn't uncommon for some CS classes in some countries to dedicate months towards drill-based repetition of thousands of LC questions, alongside recitals of behavioural answers - over actually learning CS. AI cheating makes it easy, but let's not pretend the interview process that was apparently \"good\" before is suddenly incredibly broken.",

It sounds like your team isn't taking ownership and that they are happy being dependent on you. It could be that you just didn't hire strong candidates, or it could be that something in the company or team dynamics isn't helping people flourish.  \n\nIt sounds like you are pushing to upskill others, rather than others being the driver of their own growth. This means management needs to get to work. It's their responsibility to create a healthy team dynamic, where everyone is pushing to be better every day, actively trying to upskill themselves. \n\nBut fixing this situation isn't your job - it's the job of management. So my question for you: what is management doing about this? Do they see the same issues? Do they have a plan? Do you have confidence in their plan? \n\nIf the answer to the questions above is \"no\" then I'd start looking around for other opportunities, because the situation is likely to persist until some crisis happens that forces management's hand.",

One productivity mechanism I really rely on is checklists for my TODO items. \n\nThat said, there's always more work to do than I have time for. If you haven't heard about it, The Eisenhow Matrix is a good tool. Keeping the larger goals and capacity in mind, I'll try to plan my day around a few high impact things I can work on or hopefully get done.\n\nDue to the nature of our project, the most important thing in the afternoon is sometimes not what I think is most important in the morning. These are sort of rare days, but I've had maybe 3 or 4  recently where the priorities of the team need to shift, and I'm responsible for getting that done. There's another mental model, the OODA loop that's pretty helpful. For software, that's often means hearing some news or getting more information (observe), putting that in context of the team and the rest of the metrics (orient), deciding and building an action plan to address the issue in the context of what we are currently working on (Decide), and brining it to the team (act).  \n  \nI like the eisenhower/OODA stuff becuase it's both a framework for planning/doing, and a way to respond when those assumptions and priorities which determine the plan change.",

I've interviewed many FAANG intern and FTE candidates.\n\n\nPeople change their career in their 20s, 30s, and beyond all the time. If you become a SWE, you'll probably end up as a people or project manager later in your career anyway. You are very young and have plenty of time. Here's what I would recommend:\n\n\n1. Get a BS in computer science. Any accredited program is sufficient. You don't need to go to an ivy league. \n\n\n2. Apply for internships, your sophomore and junior years. They don't need to be a top-tier companies, but it helps a lot if they are reputable, household names. Doesn't have to be a tech company, but that certainly helps. (I've recently seen FAANG hires who interned at IBM, FedEx, Walmart, Uber, etc).\n\n\n3. Build s***ty software in your free time. It doesn't need to be elegant perfect code. Just think of a very simple idea and write a solution in code. Then add simple features to it. Refactor and improve your code as you go. This is the foundation of every SWE job. A lot of University students over index on solving LeetCode Hard problems. Then struggle on the job because they've never built an app or system before. You need both skills to get into FAANG.\n\n\nRegarding your IT career, those skills will help you navigate the workplace more efficiently than a new grad. However, it may not give you a leg up in the interview process.",

Anyone working their monthly rotation knows this feeling right now.\n\n  \nSo fuck 'em. If you have a job which is chill enough where you have a few hours of slack a day or week, build during that. It can be difficult to do that stuff after hours on your own, but is considerably more compelling if you have to sit at your computer anyway during the day and pretend to be busy.\n\n  \nYou're inherently going to get slanted answers here, though. 1.5 years ago everyone would've told you to just job hop.

On that last point, it really drives me crazy, but when you have managers/stakeholders in the room, you need to speak to them with a language they understand, about concerns they care about, and at a granularity level that matters to them.\n\nI have one guy on my team, great developer, who spec'd out an EPIC level feature set, and wanted to present that to a manager. The only problem with his presentation is that it was way to granular, and talked about tickets in progress, focusing on the details of the how, and not the what/why. That's going to confuse the shit out of any manager whose trying to make sure the high level plan of the team is aligned to what they believe should get done.\n\nThat's one thing, another is example is someone on my team shipping a feature without good product rationale, like the feature was just sort of garbage and we couldn't tell either way, and not backing down or and providing weak evidence that the feature was useful. What they said was basically: \"since we don't have data it's not good, we should keep it released and just observe\". Lol, I don't have data that my Greyhound can't drive a car, you think I'm letting him drive?\n\nFinally, the last thing which drives me completely crazy, is when people don't understand the purpose of meetings, and use the time in the meeting for something else. This just happened, where I was trying to run a planning session with the team, and an engineer goes: \"oh one more thing, u/justUseAnSvm can you navigate to the dashboard so I can show u/<the manager>\" No brother, if you want a meeting to discuss this, schedule.  \n  \nAnyway, these are just some examples of things I notice in ambitious and competent engineers, that will otherwise be leadership material someday. I'm a real stickler for keeping things on track and not wasting peoples time. Your approach, listen, observe, and write it done, is a good one. Next step is to just ask for larger feature work.

You don't even have to like or enjoy tech.\n\nWhat I mean is when you're working with a system, technology, or even code snippet from Stack Overflow you actually care enough to understand how it works. You don't just consider it black box you can't peer inside and must take as a given. And you don't do this because you love it, but because you recognize this is part of your job.\n\nWhen you're more experienced this gets easier because you have a larger body of knowledge to fall back on. It's most painful when you're new, and to be honest a lot of people never get over the hump. This is because it's possible to get by for a while without this curiosity at lower levels. You have to actually choose to put in more work than you necessarily have to at some point.\n\nHowever you reach limits of what you can do without it because at a certain point your job is no longer about doing well defined widget-adjusting tasks, and furthermore this comes more suddenly than you'd think.\n\nMost of the times I've seen people flame out in this industry is because they precisely fell into this trap. They got comfortable doing simple things at lower level that didn't require curiosity and ended up digging themselves into a point where it was either psychologically or practically impossible to get up to being a \"grown up\" eng in the timeframe they needed to, because so much of what they were doing was just learning to invoke what may as well have been magic spells by rote.",

Nobody's policing where the line actually is, and yes, frontend SWE is a thing that people hire for.\n\nPersonally, I find the labeling thing a bit silly given that the tone is usually along the lines of \"you can't call yourself X because you can't do [insert hard thing] (and I am better than you because I can)\", but that makes no sense because junior SWE who don't know how to do [most hard things] obviously exist and are, well, SWEs.",

Not advocating for you to work without pay. But that's one avenue to try if you're considering.\n\n\nAnd if you *really* feel like going back to school...maybe find a program that has career placement help and take full advantage of it.

Career switcher already indicates you had a prior job. The way you kicked off the post with saying you were career switcher and ex-military gives a tone like you have expectations of how things should run and like veteran status grants you something. I'm just responding to the tone of the post so this may or may not be relevant - your veteran status counted as general career experience but is otherwise worthless in tech - almost none of the experience is tangibly relevant for a newbie software engineer.\n\nI'm not saying that is what you are doing, but reflect on yourself if you're overplaying the veteran card. If you are being cringey with your veteran status (I wish I could go tell 25-year-old-fresh-out-of-service me to shut his fucking mouth) it might be pushing people off - especially your manager.\n\nEDIT: fixed typo",

Working on non-critical or internal-facing initiatives **right now** (doesn't matter if you had been with the company for years performing amazingly and recently switched teams)\n2. High TC (especially if combined with #1) think Architects/Staffs/Sr. Staffs\n3. If you were on leave (maternity/paternity/medical/sabbatical).  Apparently they're allowed to do this if they set your termination date + severance payout *after* you come back from leave\n4. An actual low-performing team/group that could have its responsibilities absorbed by peer teams\n\nThat last one (performance-related) was the exception and not the rule.  I would have hoped there was far more consideration of performance/contribution, but for big cuts like this my guess is it's just too much to evaluate and they can't let the information leak outside of executive level for fear of \"spoiling the surprise.\"",

It is one of the hardest jobs to do in security.\n\n\nI'll give you an example, pen testing is one of the very very few tech roles that Amazon hires contractors to do and all the internal pen testers are allowed to permanently WFH.\n\n\nOut of the entire company, all the people from grads to directors, all forced to go to the office 5 days a week... apart from every single pen tester.\n\n\nThe pentesters are the only tech role that has Amazon over a barrel and Amazon knows they cannot force them to come to the office because they will walk and have new jobs by the end of the day.",

Pentesting is in not too different state as the \"real\" advanced pentestig work is done by a very, very small number of companies, while the majority of them rely on automated tests and reporting, which can be very boring, and if anyone tells you otherwise they either live in a bubble or have watched too many YouTube videos hyping the job.",

Welcome to being a reasonable adult.  You will never be ready for everything an internship or a job will throw at you.  You figure it out as you go.\n\nThe joke used to be \"fake it till you make it\".  Not exactly true, but not exactly false either.\n\nThere are things that I need to learn every week in my job and I've been doing this for close to 20 years.  There's always some new change to a tool or a framework or some new thing that just go introduced, a business process than changed, new requirements from the clients, new compliance consideration, etc.\n\nIf you are fully qualified, you have a boring job which is very repetitive and you should leave because that type of work will rot your brain.\n\nSo, words of encouragement:\n\n1. Don't have impressive projects?  Well, do something about that.  Make something.  All the tools are free at this point.  The only thing holding you back is you.  Don't know how to do something?  Learn it and then use it.\n\n2. The job market is rough, but if you keep at it, make a reasonable plan that lets you have a roof over your head and food in your belly while you search, you will be OK in the long term.  You career is decades long.  Can you point out the last time we've had a multi-decade economic downturn?  No?  Good, because that's never happened in the history of this country.",

You are absolutely looking at a dip in the current market. The thing is, we've had these in [the.com](http://the.com) bubble, 2008, 2020, and 2022.\n\nYou need to take a long view of the market. And that might not be something that your program has necessarily taught, unfortunately, because I was built the same deck of cards, but downturns will happen and life will go on. Things are a little tough right now, but your job is not to do a job right now. Your job is to learn and to pick up as much experience as possible. So figure out how you can do that, and find something that you really enjoy, and you're going to be fine.",

It's analogous to civil vs electrical, they have some surface level commonalities early on but you have to fully commit to one in order to achieve a minimally employable skillset (and then commit to some amount of effort again if you're going to switch).\n\nWithin SWE, there's a lot of variance, from the super-competitive big techs of the world to startups that are hungry for scrappy go-getters to \"boring\" F500 industries to the consulting world. Some don't even do DSA questions. Some don't even have recruiters. If you're worried about employability, it's going to be less about which tech field you decide to pivot to and more about how well you can conduct your job search; that in itself is a whole skillset on its own",

I’m worried that without an internship/job offer before graduation, I won’t be considered for these positions either.\n\nStarting in IT seems to be discouraged nowadays as it can “trap” people, or it can be a blemish on a resume if transitioning to development. I don’t see much talk about people attaining CS degrees with the intention of getting into IT. \n\nI wish I could more clearly express my thoughts, but I’m basically asking if I can take time to up-skill after graduation while working in IT and still be considered for a dev job in the future, or if getting into IT is a death sentence.",

        "body": "are you checking r/ExperiencedDevs ? \n\nI have 2 Bay Area centered 10 YOE friends who got jobs both through LinkedIn reach out from recruiters. They spent months and didn't have as much luck in beginning of 2024 in doing the cold applications. They've had more luck during the end of 2024, though one moved to NYC. Both based in the Bay. \n\nOne hired an ex-FAANG recruiter who was a resume writer but basically they both filled in their linkedins and got premium and connected with as many recruiters as they could to start the process, sent some cold messages. Basically SEO gaming to show up higher on a recruiters radius. \n\nI think they were averaging between LinkedIn big company applications and startups on Wellfound about 1/50 call backs per application. This included top companies not just FAANG and local + hybrid positions not just remote. Focused on the Bay Area geographically but NYC as well for one of them. \n\nOne is a former .Net dev the whole time and the other was an embedded systems/C++ developer for half their career, then Data Science focused developer the other half. They both did around 6 months of cold applications, one did maybe 100 since they wanted to make their own cover letters and the other did about 300. Both non FAANG but F500 company SWEs. One BS in CS and one BS in ME, no MS nothing else extra. Some side hobby projects on their Github but apparently no one has looked at those. \n\nThe both got full time positions again in F500 companies, one as a senior SWE and one as a staff level SWE. \n\nSo I'm not saying that you don't get call backs from cold applications and you're doing the right thing with applying as soon as possible, but I think your geographic region matters a lot too. A lot of it is just luck. The numbers are insane. We're into a new presidency and past Q1 2025 so things might be looking different in terms of effective advice compared to even 2023 - 2024 which were both brutal for the SWE market. \n\nWhile you do cold applications, polish your LinkedIn profile, increase you SEO with recruiters. You don't need to pay anyone for that, I think the various job search subreddits have a lot of LinkedIn tips all for free. You just need to pay for LinkedIn Premium. \n\nI'm averaging 1/100 ratio of applications to call backs as a data engineering applicant with 2 YOE of direct DE experience, though on prem and I'm working with a huge gap of almost 18 months. I only use cover letters on applications to startups on Wellfound or YComb jobs. Otherwise I've just been submitting without a coverletter following the advice posted on r/EngineeringResumes for working on my resume using their wiki and template. I've applied to around 400 jobs, almost all of them directly through the HR portals of the company but a few through easy apply because I saw someone on reddit say it worked for them, totally by chance. I've applied for mostly on site or hybrid positions in most of the major geographic regions of the US. \n\nI've had recruiters reach out on linkedin, after I changed my LinkedIn seeing their success. 2 actually, for contract work but better than nothing and if my shitty profile can get it then there's hope for others with even some experience. \n\nAlso not to shill for a service but to really maximize the cold applications I used hiring cafe because the Job Title + multiple Geo region search was a bigger time saver compared to LinkedIn and just opening all the jobs in new tabs and working through each one, one by one. They have a subreddit as well r/hiringcafe",

Understanding of OS system (especially how CPU/cache/stack/heap work) is a huge benefit. Same goes for networking (good knowledge of different protocols, how they work and what are upsides/downsides).   \nThere aren’t a ton of jobs available, but candidates who have mastered the topics above stand out. So if you are already comfortable with most of it, you might as well go for extra mile, fill in the missing knowledge and try to make your career there.   \nOnly downside is that most of jobs are in Chicago /NY / London / Hong Kong, and you’d most likely have to relocate.\nPersonal projects for junior are good place to start. Build market order book, option pricing formulas, company earnings data scraper & parser.   \nCompared to game dev, you will have much better working hours and great pay (not as good as FAANG, but multitudes more what you’d get in game dev or any other web dev company)",

How are your teammates gatekeeping their information?\n\nFor example, if your teammates have some sort of specialized domain knowledge that your project hinges on, and you can’t get responses from them, then you have a legitimate grievance. \n\nBut it’s also possible that this isn’t specialized knowledge at all, and is information that you could find yourself if you really tried. Maybe your team doesn’t want to condition people to expect hand-holding for this stuff. \n\nI’ve seen both scenarios personally. The approach you need to take to fix it is different depending on which category your situation falls into, so some self awareness is important here.",
