No development since - engineers were not allowed to work on it - even in their free time. If a PR was created to improve something, it was not merged. **The only way to get changes through was when a production pipeline broke and there was no other fix available without modifying the framework.**\n\nI mentioned to the leadership, if they could just allocate 40 hours of engineering time per quarter (!!) for minor improvements, the engineers using the framework plus the downstream consumers would be much more satisfied.\n\nI joined in August 2025. One of the issues with the framework became apparent pretty quickly. I found that Airflow logging was not working - in case of failure, stderr was printed in the logs, but nothing from stdout. There was another logging interface configured, but stdout was missing from there as well. The only option to see the error message was to rerun the step again directly on Airflow through SSH. \n\nA step usually took 5-30 minutes. So if there was a failure, an extra 5-30 minutes had to be spent instead of just seeing it in the airflow logs. The fix was just 2 lines of code. \n\n**The lead engineer had to wait for a production pipeline to fail so they could bundle (sneak) my change into the emergency fix to get it deployed.**\n\nYesterday was my last day.",

Yea I'm sure it's not needed at an operational level but that's not the level that your execs and ultimately your board is looking for.\n\nIf you acquire your competitor and say you both share the same supplier but have different supply terms which are more favorable to the company you acquired then you would be smart to use that contract going forward. You will get to that answer sooner with MDM.\n\nMDM helps us get in front of these types of data challenges. Yes the tooling is bloated, expensive, and hard to implement and maintain. Regardless, the need will always be there. \n\nAnother easy example, what if your customers are subsidiaries of other companies. How does Finance calculate the consolidate line of credit if it doesn't know or manage those relationships in the systems. \n\nWhen your company decides to change and modernize their ERP there is a huge effort to migrate accurate master data.

Also it’s more expensive, requires more infrastructure, more optimization, more maintenance, more engineers, oncall rotations. So make sure leadership actually understands what they are actually asking for. \n\nIn most cases you can make it work with a microbatch architecture, but if you don’t even have Kafka/debezium/an event-driven architecture that is also your data source, then it’s probably not worth it unless there’s a solid business case around it",

In larger orgs it's also a great way to enforce standardisation of calculations like KPIs: without a semantic layer Sue from finance might have a retention rate calculation different from Bob from HR's version, and when the C-suite see two different numbers for the \"same\" thing they either pick on based on whether Bob or Sue has the better reputation, or distrust them both entirely. If Bob and Sue are dragging and dropping a measure from the same model that doesn't happen. And if Bob and Sue both think their one is best, then there can be a process for working out which one becomes the single source of truth instead of them going off into their silo and doing their own thing.\n\nOrganisationally it sits at a good place too, in that it can be a product of a central data team to enable business unit-adjacent analysts and BI teams to get straight into their value-add (engineers do the engineering, business users do the questioning, presenting and interpretation) . So semantic models work really well for hub-and-spoke style organisation set ups.\n\nI haven't gotten into the AI side of things but when getting buy in for this work, pitching it as a step towards AI enablement is a great way of getting traction.",

Data products mean anything that the end users need. One of the biggest challenges any data warehouse has is keeping the data between data products aligned.

Data products are created to align with the business needs. What finance needs is not necessarily what sales needs. When you create something like a star schema, you are layering on business requirements, processes and definitions that may not be the same across the entire enterprise. Just that one data product. It is often very tempting to reuse a data product that has close but not entirely overlapping needs. Don't do it.

Likely one operator using multiple accounts to shape buying criteria rather than link-spam.\n\n**Users & take:**\n\n* **Key-Boat-7519** — very likely promotional (central voice; repeats “DreamFactory auto-generates REST APIs…” across many subs).\n* **Ashleighna99** — likely same operator (same cadence and stack: Airbyte/Temporal/DreamFactory).\n* **CharacterSpecific81** — likely coordinated (ad/analytics threads end with the same DreamFactory closer).\n* **Fragrant\\_Cobbler7663** — likely coordinated (identical “practical path” style + DreamFactory).\n* **Aggravating-Major81** — likely coordinated (migration playbooks with the same product plug).\n* **WholeDifferent7611** — likely coordinated (automation/stack advice ending in the same plug).\n* **Dry-Data-2570** — possibly same cluster (dbt Cloud take with the familiar closer).\n* **Titsnium** — possibly same cluster (agent ops posts, same REST-layer refrain).\n\n**Why this reads as astroturfing:**\n\n* Repeated product mention with near-copy phrasing across topics/subs.\n* Same bullet-list structure and niche terms, posted to many unrelated communities within short windows.\n* Promotional CTA without links (typical filter-avoidance tactic).\n\n**Confidence:** High that it’s coordinated promotion; moderate that all accounts are one operator.",

        "body": "I did this at my last job, reluctantly. I was forced to do it as part of an initiative to surface metrics and data transformations back to end-users, and one of the engineers refused to use production data to test the dashboards; it HAD to be a fully separate env, hooked up exactly to the app's staging env. The rest of the company already had a full pipeline but tied to prod.\n\nI thought it was a waste of time and money when I was forced to do it because the environment was fully read-only. And after I finally completed the project I thought the same thing. The only good purpose of the separate envs was that it made it a little easier to test security, but it wasn't like that was particularly difficult. It would have been probably just as much work to set up a way to mock production data in localhost, and overall way more useful for the company.\n\nSo, we got it working ultimately (separate Airflow deployments and separate Snowflake accounts), but it was a pain in the ass. I had a somewhat informal way of managing Snowflake account level changes as migrations / IaC, and setting it up perfectly still took a while. (This also corresponded with a company wide push to formalize migrations of all db's into a new software.) Then the Airflow instance, oh boy. You don't realize just how many assumptions you make about envs until you have to formalize the ability to make an arbitrary multiple number of them. I thought I knew, but I didn't. Oh, also, your staging and prod data will be different in painful ways. Like imagine a JSON field stored as a varchar, but the staging env has some bullshit that's not a JSON. Yep, that's one of many things that happens when you try to run your prod data pipelines on the app's staging environment.\n\nOverall, not worth it. The setup I had originally is very simple: there's local and there's prod on a single Snowflake account. When you run commands locally, you hit a separate database for writes and transforms that are handled by the env vars. All reads are exactly from the prod data. All developers have full permissions in the local or dev or whatever you want to call them environments. There were also simple utils to help clone prod into dev for easy development.\n\nMoving to the multi env setup was not only months of my life neither me nor the company is getting back, but due to how MWAA works, it significantly increased the costs of the data platform.\n\nShortly after I left, the engineer who wanted this colossal waste of time and money also left. Or maybe he was forced out. Cool.\n\nHonestly, at the point you're doing this sort of thing to support multi tenancy across genuine staging/prod envs, my advice is to scrap Airflow and Snowflake entirely. Go to something like Clickhouse and use materialized views to manage your pipelines so it's orchestration free.\n\nI also want to note another thing. Not a single internal data end user cared about this. This came from a single frontend app developer and was supported by upper mgmt because it sounds good on paper if you're a conventional SWE. Even though it's completely divorced from how internal data consumers use and contribute to data pipelines. What data scientists do is they train models and do analysis on prod data. They don't care about the developers' staging data because it doesn't represent or cover real usage. As you note in your post, this seems to be what they want to do, right? Except now you're finessing with data shares instead of just some simple IAM and permissions.\n\nLastly, the place I left to, I setup their entire data infrastructure. I'm still on exactly \"local\" and \"prod\" in one Snowflake account, and I have no desire to ever change this. Actually, we do have a \"staging\" env for testing full CRUD being run against our OLAP db in the app's actual staging env. What it is, is: a clone of the prod db, cloned weekly, so that state is preserved within testing sessions but it also up to date with prod. Also, we do have a way to mock user sessions in our app's staging env. That works well enough! I will literally write javascript dashboards myself, or migrate to an entirely separate DB and delete our Airflow pipelines and switch to materialized views, before I spin up multiple envs to assist someone who won't put up with a minor inconvenience for them at the expense of multiple months of my own time.",

We've been working on improving JSON in ClickHouse as well.\n\nWe released our native type last year, and just recently did a big update (https://clickhouse.com/blog/json-data-type-gets-even-better). We originally designed it so that you could pick (or let CH pick) about 1000 paths to store as native columns, and then pack the rest into a shared part file. It worked really well, but as more people used it, we found that a lot of people have A LOT of JSON paths. Either huge objects, or just huge variance between objects, which results in tens of thousands of paths. At which point you have many thousands of paths being bundled into the shared parts, and losing much of the efficiency (i.e. trying to aggregate a field that is packed into shared parts was slower and used a lot of memory compared to a real col).\n\nWe redesigned it so that we can essentially do hierarchical indexing of buckets of shared parts - the post above explains  how it works in detail. We managed to get some pretty impressive gains - about 58x faster when querying paths in shared parts, and using 3300x less memory, when you have over 10k unique paths.\n\nIt's a pretty interesting area to work on as not many OLAP DBS handle JSON very elegantly, typically you just flatten it which is pretty annoying and brittle.",

Both systems will try to get you to implement your transforms within the system, but this just introduces a tight coupling.  \n  \nImplement your logic in something standalone that can be called by itself (eg package it into a Docker container that you can call with \\`docker run\\`) and then just orchestrate *that* from Airflow / Dagster. You can then test it entirely independently and only have to wire it up to the orchestrator when it comes times to call it as part of a pipeline",

        "body": "Having a clean ETL process that updates non-prod environments with appropriately tokenized/masked copies of production data on a recurring basis should be considered just as critical a piece of infrastructure as having proper CI/CD pipelines and automated test frameworks.\n\nIt starts with identifying sensitive fields in production data.  They should all already be identified and catalogued someplace, as part of a data security framework.  If they're not, that's a problem in and of itself.  You need to know where the PII actually exists, and ideally section it off into separate, higher-security datastores.  Less sensitive datastores should only store identifiers to the records in the secure datastores that contain the actual PII.  This step alone can dramatically simplify the process of keeping things secure, and can make it safer to allow production access for developers to debug issues.  It's rare that a bug involves needing to know actual PII, even in production.\n\nOnce you know which datastores/fields contain PII, you can set up automated ETL pipelines to mask or tokenize them during the process of being copied into non-prod environments.\n\nA good practice is to have (at least) two non-prod environments:  development and QA/staging.  The QA environment should be automatically overwritten with a fresh, sanitized copy of production data, on a regular basis.  The development environment should have finer-grained controls for overwrites, so as not to erase work-in-progress changes that developers have made to those datasets.  Ideally, each team should have some control over whether their data domain is merely appended to by the automated ETL jobs, or overwritten/reset entirely.",

That way the Asset graph (exists in 2.x and 3.x but imho is much easier to navigate in 3.x) serves as a proxy-lineage graph. Side note tip if you need both, runs based on time and upstream DAG dependencies, there is a combined [AssetOrTimeSchedule](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/airflow-datasets#combined-asset-and-time-based-scheduling).\n\nFrom there, yes, some people implement custom solutions, often based on dependency information gathered from the Airflow API or use the OSS OpenLineage integration to get \"true\" lineage and then visualize it with Marquez. How well this works highly depends on the operators and hooks you use, if they already support lineage extraction (there is a [list of supported classes](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-openlineage/stable/supported_classes.html)) or if you need to add extractors to your own custom operators. Inlets and outlets (so Assets again) are also evaluated by this integration.\n\nIf you want an out-of-the-box solution there are paid products like [Astro Observe](https://www.astronomer.io/product/observe) which is based on OpenLineage and reads in that information to create a lineage graph with additional fancy features like SLA definition, alerts, cross-deployment lineage etc. There is also a list of potential up and downstream impacts in case of failures. The upside is minimal setup needed and managed service support.\n\nDisclaimer: I work at Astronomer :) and a lot of the above was inspired by [this blog post](https://www.astronomer.io/blog/the-road-to-reliability-implementing-pipeline-observability) (and the webinar linked at the bottom of it) from our internal data team. They don't use dbt but their pipelines center around Snowflake and they had the same goal of getting to end-to-end visibility and documented their journey to that there.",

Dealing with highly abstracted classes and complex ingestion architecture is something that requires a decent bit of training. If you think you're being set up for failure with the DE role, the DA role may be safer. \n\nThe big question is: which hiring manager do you like more? I'm guessing that if they are hiring an entry level DE as the only DE on the team, they are resource strapped and have no idea what is going on. \n\nNext question: is there an internal path to a data engineer or data science role at the DA team?",

If you're not sticking with Talend/Talaxie, you're in for quite a lift whether it's on another commercial platform or a free open source one.\n\nThe big vendors include Databricks, Snowflake/Snowpark, Fivetran, Matillion, AWS Glue, Azure DataFactory, and Informatica Cloud. Most of those can give you the capabilities you asked, but implementations vary and none operate quite like Talend did.\n\nThe open source options include DLTHub, Airbyte, Bruin, CDAP, Nifi, Trino, and a few others I probably missed. That comprises at least the ingestion pieces, but you'll likely need other tools to supplement that such as dbt/sqlmesh and a workload orchestrator. You will pay in labor what you saved in cost, but it's rewarding when you get it right.\n\nHope that helps.",

The different data layers (medallion or whatever fancy term created) are for representing the state of your data and its quality.\n\nEach environment should contain identical layers so your code logic would work consistently across environments (when it get's promoted through your CI/CD process).\n\nThe bronze layer should absolutely exist in dev/test, but you can use small or synthetic data.",

You can having a different staging location for each step and does not have to be a database could just be a s3 folder that triggers your pipeline.  Think of Bronze => Silver => Gold as the tables in your DWH .. you have a \"staging\" where you can put all raw data if you are using some sort of file type(csv, json, xml) once the data is in your Bronze stage you can then just move the data between the stages that best fits your use case.  For example if you are on AWS your Bronze data might land in some Glue Table once you trigger your pipeline that cleans up your data for the Silver Layer you can save the file as a csv to s3 and do a bulk load into Redshift and repeat for Gold.  Your 3 environments Dev, QA/UAT and Prod should all be separate in a ideal use-case so you get no chance messing up your prod data when developing I have seen bad things happen when people have Prod and Dev database on the same environment forget to change 1 line in a SQL command and boom there goes your prod DB",

        "body": "My ideas on demos have changed over the years. Keep in mind that Agile and the demo they talk about was not designed for data engineering, so you need to adapt. Showing how a pipeline now runs 20% faster, or how you’ve improved data accuracy by 30% is dry as hell and demos terribly. What demos well is actual apps (or web apps) and clicking through them showing shiny features and pictures.\n\nIn my latest project my team is creating a data pipeline and suite of reports for a new product. Our stakeholders are regulators, so we don’t get to talk to them. We have internal product people that interface with them. \n\nOne thing we have done is create a crude diagram of each of the models we are building in the DAG. If it was created in the past sprint I color them one way so they stand out. I don’t go into depth on what they do, the point here is for upper management, product, and others to see “oh there’s more green boxes than 2 weeks ago”. Pictures demo better than words, and this shows progress. Obviously this works for greenfield work and wouldn’t work as well for other work.\n\nA challenge we have had is that we get different personas joining our demos. Sometimes they are upper management who think they are still technical and they want to get into details. Other times they are product people who are curious about how we interpreted a particular requirement. Other times it’s upstream teams asking things about a particular interaction. Honestly, any interaction is good interaction. However, I have been absolutely terrible at predicting which part of the demo will get the most traction. This is probably a function of how demos operate though. We roll with the punches and answer what we can.\n\nI usually have 1 or 2 people demo something we delivered. Usually it’s a particular table/model, but I push for something that is novel. People love novelty. If the report is “select everything from this table and aggregate” then it’s not a good candidate. We recently had a report that had the goal of showing the transaction record that crossed a certain cumulative sum threshold. That’s novel, and so that is what I pushed the team to demo. There ended up being a lot of conversation around that approach and the validity of the requirements. Good, we want conversation and interaction.\n\nI try to rotate different people demoing work they have done so everyone gets their time to shine. I make it clear that the goal is to a degree sales. Sell your work. Brag. Explain what you thought was interesting or challenging or whatever. People will engage with that.\n\nI also bring up specific challenges. This last sprint we spun out on a particularly ambiguous requirement. Attempting to nail down that requirement resulted in not delivering one of the items in the sprint goal. I made sure to relate those 2 things and called it out. It’s not just about painting a rose colored story, it’s also about showing we do more than just sling data left to right.\n\nNumbers also tend to register with people. An old manager of mine used to have a slide for git metrics. “this sprint we added 2311 lines of code and removed 5541”.  It seemed a little corny to me at the time, but in reality it adds to the perception of “oh this team Got Stuff Done”\n\nOn the topic of numbers, mentioning them can also make you sound like you know what you are doing. This can be more useful in non-greenfield areas. For example: “this table has 110 million records in it and grows at the rate of 5 million per month. Each daily run varies from 150k to 175k and runs for 20 minutes” if the goal of your project is to reduce cost then you tie it to that “…and with our new special sauce, we save $20k/yr”. If it is to run things faster you could say “and now we have partitioned it in a way that we have 10 parallel jobs that complete in 2 minutes”. Tie what you are doing to the goals of the sprint or project.\n\nSorry if these ideas are a bit unorganized, hopefully these help you.",

Here you can have unclassified data, and potentially have it unmasked. The only access to these areas is either the automated system, or users with elevated privileges who are accessing it for the specific purpose of classifying data and setting up automation for ingestion and transform to later layers.\n\nYou should track the classification for each column to determine what kind of data it has. Is it personal data? Is it PII? Is it generic contact style PII (name, email, phone) or sensitive identity-theft-enabling PII like external identifiers or private information (license number, tax number, birth details, passport, etc). Those classifications help you to understand the security policy you place on the column.\n\nWith a lakehouse you have the option to also separate the data in the storage layer. You can have separate buckets for pii or sensitive data, so that you can specifically track and audit access to the buckets, and a leak of any kind on the general data bucket does not leak sensitive data.\n\nYou will need some kind of query portal that enforces column-level security for you. Something like SageMaker, for example. You will need to set up rules for automatically hiding/masking tables/columns that people cannot access. You need to make sure people don't have an alternative for accessing the data.\n\nThere are tools you could point at your bronze data to scan for sensitive data. They won't be perfect but they're a good start. I believe AWS comprehend can do it, but there's a variety of 3rd party tools you can run.\n\n---\n\nThe main point is your early areas are kept inaccessible to users, so that you can hold the data in an unclassified manner that allows you to do ingestion and classification work on it. Users can only access data through a system that enforces security and access controls on queries, and you only add data that has gone through that classificatio process.",

It is also free, and you can use it indefinitely without being a customer. However, it is only for running Airflow locally which we would highly discourage from doing in production. [https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/cli](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/cli)\n* Astro is Astronomer's managed Airflow service, which is paid, and allows you to run Airflow in the cloud in production without managing it yourself. If you want to use Airflow in production but not pay for a managed service, you can of course do that too. Airflow is open sourced also under the Apache License 2.0 and is free to use, and many companies run it themselves on kubernetes, or using other deployment options\n\nHope this is helpful! We have seen lots of Airflow + dbt users be quite happy with that stack, and find using Cosmos to be the most functional way of tying the two together.

Until that is done, you can choose almost any database internals book and see mentions of how os is not your friend, etc.\n\nOr taken from [https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3709714](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3709714) :  \n\"Database systems often aim to tightly control hardware to optimize performance, as they typically have better insights into the workloads than the operating system. However, with the performance gap between CPUs and modern I/O devices narrowing, database systems are increasingly dissatisfied with the general-purpose interfaces provided by the OS\"\n\n(written by guys at MIT)\n\n>What? At fist computers were almost only used for databases and not desktops. Also there are thousands of newly developed OS', old codes also got rewritten.\n\nWell we didn't say what were computers used for, but what operating systems became in last 50 years.\n\n\\> Based on the description, QuinineHM is an OS - just not a general-purpose one, but who said only general-purpose OS can exists? Boots the hardware, Manages CPUs, timers, and devices etc. - these are exactly what we call operating system.\n\nNot really. OS provides many other things. Hardware Manager is just there to do things needed by hardware, set up interrupts, nic, apic, boot cores, etc. After that is done it gets out of the way and exposes full hardware to software it got compiled with. It cannot execute code it didn't get compiled with.\n\nHope that answered some questions, feel free to ask more.",

Start by building the MVP (minimally viable product) THEN add features and improvements. Build with the intent that things will get bolted on. \n\nThey are doing a classic waterfall approach. Deliver the final product all at once. So in this method, building in certain features first might be more efficient to get to the final deadline. \n\nAgile is faster, more flexible, and some variation of it is the new modern standard. Waterfall is good for building something with core features that are extremely well defined. Of course, there's the other option that they are just building what they want to build whether it is needed or not. With data scientists, you can't rule that out. \n\n\nHere's the catch, every data scientist I have ever met HATES Agile. I suspect it is because in academia, you design your entire experiment, make your hypothesis, do your research, THEN do the experiments THEN publish your results. To them, Agile is following a poor practice of finding something 80% correct with the end goal of getting something better in the next round. Plus, if they are building a gradient boosting regression with specific variables now, the 90% correct version may require completely different variables with a Random Forest Regression. In other words, a complete rebuild. Data engineers can add features much more organically. \n\n\nI'm not saying that the Data Scientists are right. There is a very good reason while Agile has dominated tech, and there is a reason Data Science projects never get anywhere. Understand where they are coming from, but ultimately, you're more likely than them to be following best practice.",

        "body": "I guess it depends on what you mean by features. If you mean selecting what variables go I to a model, yeah, you figure that out first. Typically data scientists work in a sandbox environment when they model. If you’re talking delivery, then I assume you are building data pipelines? They need to figure out what model works before they can tell you what data they need and how they need it. It’s a lot of exploratory work. \n\nWhen I worked on an agile data science team, we just wanted access to copies of raw prod data from different sources while we figured out approximately what worked. (Honestly, even if it would work.) Training can involve significant amounts of data. If it was something large and complex, like a simulation, this might take weeks. At review we usually had draft models to talk through with business and often changed or added data as a result. We didn’t get involved with engineering until we had a good idea of what data we needed and how we needed it first (and where we were putting it). If business needed something faster for a particular reason, we’d just refreshed our working draft. (They usually had access.) “Productionizing” something like that as we worked would have been wildly expensive and time consuming. \n\nWe had conflict with one of the engineering teams at one point because they thought it was inappropriate to give us access to data until we could tell them exactly what we need. Then they would decide how to model it, spend time modeling for us, and it wouldn’t be modeled in a way that worked, the back and forth arguments took forever. (No, six months of data isn’t enough. No, the most recent value replacing the old value doesn’t suffice. Actually, we needed those variables you deleted, etc.) It was a nightmare. They considered us “non-technical” as just told us we didn’t understand best practices. \n\nNo idea if this applies to you. Hopefully not. But you might ask them their reasoning. Data science is not a software dev discipline and follows a different life cycle than the standard SDLC. I have seen multiple issues with tech people over my career who could not wrap their heads around this. They can be overly perfectionist, yes, and I can’t tell you if yours are or not, but I’ve lived it long enough to know they might not be.",

If I didn't need the DBT plugin I would look at SQRuff in preference to SQLFluff.\nFor DBT we publish the output of DBT Docs to cloud blob storage so clients can download it into whatever internal websites suit them. Again, interactive data lineage comforts auditors and people who query business data.\nIn the past I've used products such as Redgate SQLDoc and Innovasys DocumentX to document databases. As the company I was with went with a plethora of other databases I ended up writing my own version.  For any tabular DB my app needed a DB connection and a folder to hold that DB's equivalent of queries whose output was a defined contract. Again, this comforts the auditors.\nCode quality tools such as SonarQube, Sonarlint are useful. In JetBrains PyCharm there us a \"Problems\" tab that provides code improvement suggestions. I've found these to be useful. I think VS Code has some useful extensions that do something similar.\nJavaDoc is over 30 years old, most languages have an equivalent.

I've found that their APIs, for the products I use, need a lot of calls as an API call answers a question but doesn't always provide the info to feed directly into a related question. Using Mermaid markup allows the relationships between various cloud artefacts to be autogenerated. I'm crap at graphics so Mermaid is about my limit. Again, a diagram comforts auditors. A comforted auditor is a comforted management team.\n\nData testing can be DBT Test, Soda and more specific queries. Its easy enough to generate AWS cloudwatch metrics from the results of a query. From AWS Cloudwatch metrics, its easy ti generate AWS Cloudwatch alarms. An example would be average expected sales +- 1.64 standard deviations as the acceptable range, anything outside of that range needs investigation.\n\nIn all honesty, the tooling is not the important thing. Its thinking about the goal you want to achieve, the benefit of achieving it, and the process by which you can achieve it. Only then do I look at tooling.",

(Wouldn't be right for me to go into too much detail.) We worked with many of the leading Pharma. The goal was to help the companies collect regular data feeds and ELT them into a data warehouse, usually Snowflake or Redshift. We used our own PaaS orch platform based on K8s. the main observability tool then was New Relic -- an OTel adopter. (What we did when I was there was basic. DataKitchen now sell an observability tool of their own -- haven't used it but it looks cool). We used NR to monitor data file arrival, data loading job execution, and platform and/or K8s errors coming out of our airflow-like orch tool -- including sql errors. NR captured user who created the job, what the job was for, how much data the job moved, and did every step in the process complete in \\~expected time, history of the job over time. We also used NR for basic log aggregation and had alerts for specific conditions observed in log output. We didn't use traces. We wanted that for the steps in the jobs, but didn't have time to implement while I was there.  The DevOps team used more sysOps sampling metrics to know how the pods were performing and the health of the underlying nodes and storage.\n\nKind of similarly, I'm currently leading a project to build a data file feed ingestion tool called CsvPath Framework. We support Otel and OpenLineage for observability. the framework doesn't do any sysOps metrics. and it doesn't natively ship its own logs -- you would have to do that, same as for any system you're hosting. What it does is fire data processing events for arriving files registered, validation scripts loaded, runs started/ended, steps within runs started/ended, and validation errors. I.e. we're just focused on the data. CsvPath is kind of like [Soda.io](http://Soda.io) for databases, but totally focused on preboarding flat-file feeds with a lot more opinionatedness about how to do it right. if we didn't have Otel (and OpenLineage) we'd have to roll our own way of doing monitoring and alerting. that would not have been practical.\n\nHope that helps. if it's not off-target happy to say more.",

If your organisation is big enough then all sorts of things typically can and do happen. Now, I am not saying that the approval must come from the consumer domain necessarily (you're right, that's probably a bad idea...), but some sort of sign-off should come from someone. Thinking of it, probably the official data product owner or steward should give that, BUT the downstream data product consumers should receive a notification of change.\n\nIn any case, this does not fundamentally change my question or argument. The main point being that data products would have some form of enforced and versioned schema, and you could not simply consume a data product by circumventing that contract, nor could you simply change the schema without any formalized and versioned change request.",

You should be using sth like dbt/bruin for that so that you have a maintainable framework to build these SQL pipelines.\n   * If you need to \"activate\" this data by pushing the data into some other systems/reports, you then build that part of the ETL in Python or any other language you are familiar with.\n   * If you need to orchestrate these, you use something like airflow/dagster/prefect/bruin to make sure the steps run at the right time in the right order.\n\nA significant chunk of the work here is exploration, as you can tell. Once the problem, the data sources, and the usecases are clarified, building the technical solution becomes clearer. My suggestion would be to map out these clearly and then look into the technical capabilities of the team, the tools you all are familiar with, and pick the simplest option to start with.",

Definitely enjoying the ability to rip things down and stand them up in no time at all during these early days 😅",

What helped us in ClickHouse: use ReplacingMergeTree with a version (updatedat) for idempotent upserts and late-arriving fixes; resolve surrogate keys via ClickHouse dictionaries so facts can map to dimension IDs without heavy joins at write time. Put tenantid first in ORDER BY and partition by month (toYYYYMM(ts)) for fast pruning and easy drop/backfill per tenant-month. For custom fields, store a Map for long tail, but promote high-usage keys into real columns; add bloom filter indexes on common filters and a soft\\_delete flag with TTL DELETE to keep storage sane. Row policies work well for tenant isolation if you expose direct SQL. Tinybird is great for serving pre-aggregates, but keep ClickHouse as the source of truth and rebuild from staging when mappings change. I’ve used Airbyte for ingestion and dbt for tests/backfills; DreamFactory helped us expose secure REST endpoints over the star for internal tools and partner integrations without hand-rolling auth. The main thing: tenant-first sort key, ReplacingMergeTree + version, and a small canonical layer will save you when schemas shift and backfills hit.",

        "body": "Thank you! Looking briefly at this post, it does seem to touch on what I’m asking. The post calls it a “monster query”, which is accurate. A composite metric fact table is just that - rather than a period snapshot, or transactional fact (or other) it’s literally taking data (facts) from many adjacent places and smashing them together - in my case to create “supply vs. demand” - adjacent facts include production actuals, production schedules, inventory (on hand, consignment, with vendor, in transient, etc), stock received from 3rd parties, projected sales, actual sales, goods issued, etc.  There is like >17 datasets that comprise the formula for “supply vs. demand”, and each data set is multiple ETL jobs / facts broken out by different companies / regions of the world (in a large multinational). \n\nHence, you can see my concern about potential challenges about different points of time due to unexpected failed or delayed ETL jobs, and ensuring to write an artifact to the fact for data quality purposes. I don’t need to expose this to my end uses (who are restricted to views on top of my table) but I would put in in the physical table for quality/explainability. \n\nAlso, I’m only concerned with the explainability part now (best practice design). Obviously, the more important part is the proactive portion of who you programmatically ensure all combined data is from the same point of time. For example, you can break the metric up into regions of the world (NA, EMEA, APAC) to ensure it’s computed relevant to their time zones, you can adjust your “subqueries” to enforce timeboxes, or time travel / time restrictions to ensure they are all consistent, or you might do some sort of staging tables that can be “frozen” (for example frequent loading upstream but frozen into daily buckets, etc.). I’m sure there are a few good options.\n\nAgain, I’m starting with “hey they this is very complicated since ETL doesn’t always work as intended and error free” so how do I assure quality given the many challenges. \n\nThanks again - it’s is a great link, very helpful and exactly what i was asking for.\n\nEdit:  the blog post called out something I forgot to mention that’s pretty critical. The subsets of data are all aggregated, so what’s included/missing from the aggregation is very important.  For example, if we are calculating MetricValue = Inventory on hand [region | material | day] - goods issue [region | material | day ] + projected sales [ region | material | calendar day] —> and each of these are very volatile. The different businesses in different regions of the world will change their sales forecasts through out the day (especially as we near quarter/year end, or other business target dates), inventory changes drastically, and goods issue (reduction of inventory) is very dynamic. So, if I’m after a daily level, as in what’s my EMEA inventory for material 111 on 10/23/25, this value could be very different if my subquery executes at 1am vs. 4am vs. 7am. Where as in a transactional fact table, i would simply be adding rows (ie: additional sales invoices to a sales fact table) and the differences are easily understood - I’m summarizing inventory per day, so the differences in values due to timing are a mystery. I like that the blog post is pointing this out as a challenge in the “monster query” which aggregates results into a “common grain” (which is exactly what I’m doing here).",

Focus on gaining *formal* knowledge of software engineering, rather than the trial-and-error/self-taught approach of your predecessors. Look up Onion Architecture, Hexagonal -- how uncle bob has unified all of these with Clean Architecture. Understand SOLID fundamentally for clear code segregation, experiment on your own to internalize these concepts, so you can then prompt the AI to do the same; learn UML to represent your systems, do C4 diagrams, sequence diagrams, design everything; and experiment.\n\nA different approach than your predecessors, and you'll outpace them all.",

This version of the game was VERY different from the java version. \n\nEventually the goal was parity, which meant Mojang getting more hands on with the mobile version, developing it to also support other (non pc) platforms. Its arounds this point where console edition turned into what is now bedrock edition.\n\nSo yes, it would be easier (and probably a lot better) if there was only one version of the game, but thats not what we ended up with.\n\nBased on how the development went, yes, they essentially redid the entire game and tried to make it feel like minecraft.

Having two seperate versions of the game predates the Microsoft purchase by a LONG time.\n\n\nThe first non-Java version of minecraft was minecraft pocket edition for android, all the way back in 2011. It was released as part of a deal between Sony and Mojang to make a minecraft version for the Sony Xperia Play, which was a gaming phone. Think about how shit the hardware on a phone would have been back in 2011, and you can see why they would need to rewrite the game in the more optimised and lightweight C++. Also worth noting, all the way back then, the game was very simple and didn’t have that much content, it wouldn’t have been that hard to rewrite. It was still in beta, with the really old terrain generation and even basic features like sprinting and the hunger bar hadn’t been added yet. The old, shitty pocket edition version you remember from your childhood was basically identical to Java edition at the time.\n\n\nAccording to autobiographies about Notch, at this time mojang was still a really small company with probably 10 or less employees and the rewrite was mostly entrusted to a single guy who was known as “the smart one”.\n\n\nLater that year they copied over the C++ engine for iOS, then next year to the Xbox 360, then the year after that to the PS3. \n\n\nMicrosoft didn’t buy minecraft until 3 years later. They didn’t rewrite the game engine at all, they just got all the different existing C++ versions for consoles and phones onto the same page in terms of updates, then unified them into what we now know as bedrock edition and made them cross play.",

Java is accessible, and a popular language for academics, but also a popular language in the enterprise world, so there's lots and lots of resources for learning and doing and using.\n\nMicrosoft bought Mojang, and therefore Minecraft. Java is a product created by Sun Microsystems - a competitor of Microsoft, and Microsoft is not going to condone and legitimize a competitor's product.\n\nThere's some argument that Java won't run on phones? Are you fucking kidding me? And who says this? Microsoft, of course... Android OS is a JVM on top of a Linux kernel - and constitutes the single most widely deployed OS and platform, and Open GL is the most portable 3D graphics platform there is. So that's a whole bunch of bullshit.\n\nOf course Microsoft rewrote it in C++, because they explicitly won't allow a JVM on the XBox platform. They would have written it in C#, but at the time .NET Core was 2 years away, and its initial release was a barely functioning prototype and wasn't all that portable. As much as Microsoft hates C++, at least no one formally owns it and they can swallow that pill. Their legacy is also largely built upon it. It's a neutral territory that they are willing to port.\n\nSo in a word: politics.",

This started to gain some traction among the device makers, namely Nokia and Siemens, and lead to the first games you can buy and run through WAP and sold through app stores included on the phone. \n\nFWIW, iPhone (1) didn't come out until 2007. And probably the earliest recognizable Android phone, the Motorola Droid, didn't release until 2009. \n\nNotch launched Minecraft Java Edition in 2009 but it didn't gain traction until 2010. By then, J2ME was almost a decade old, designed for FAR MORE PRIMITIVE CPUs, and no understanding of GPUs. \n\nNot going to go over history of Minecraft much. \n\nEDIT: Except to add that Minecraft Pocket Edition (aka Minecraft PE) was actually written in C++, and when ported to iOS and Android, standard transpiler was probably used to create Java/Dalvik code and Objective-C code. (see Minecraft Wiki). \n\nIn 2017, Microsoft acquired Mojang and all stuff related to Minecraft. Yes, Notch WANTED a big corp to buy his stuff. \n\nBut one of the reasons is due to all the different ports to different platforms, the codebase became fragmented. There's a Pocket Edition, there's a Windows 10 Edition, and there are the various console editions. Maintainence and bug tracking was eating up a ton of time. And Java... is a big long in the tooth. And having to pay Oracle (which bought out Sun Micro, and thus, own Java) for a license is probably not in Microsoft's long-term plans. \n\nSo Mojang and Microsoft pushed out \"Bedrock Edition\" in 2017, which supposedly united a lot of the codebase in the program core, by ~~rewriting~~ basing the core in C++ with the Pocket Edition codebase, and because C++ was the most \"universal\" language. The program core will call the OS language libraries to do native processing (Dalvik / Java on Android, Objective-C on iOS, and whatever else platforms).",

The library is a port of a bunch of Matlab scripts written by the scientists. There is an off-by-one error somewhere that's causing one certain array result to be shifted by one element; presumably the Matlab code is correct, but that's not a given.\n\n\nMy previous task: there's a 20k-line C module written by a certifiable genius decades ago, and a newer C++ wrapper application that works in concert with it. One part of that C++ code has a method that needs to be called in a thread-safe way at certain times in the runtime lifecycle. Figure out where in the legacy C program that call belongs (perhaps multiple places), and add a line or two of code in those places.\n\n\nI've worked in very different code bases and industries, but it's often similar: the task may take four hours or four days, but often results in changing a \"0\" to a \"1\" or adding or rearranging a few lines of code.\n\n\nThe fun and easy stuff, where you take a spec and write hundreds of lines of new code, that's all done by junior people. I get to review their code, but that's not all that interesting.\n\n\nEdit: I remember about 15 years ago at one of my first senior roles becoming fed up with this....in my mind, I imagined being a skilled and creative barista who gets hired by a specialty coffee shop, but spends most of the time at work sweeping floors while others do the actual coffee.

The `@Autowired` annotation on something means that dependency is being injected by the framework, and it could come from anywhere.  All you know is that you're getting an object that implements the `MyServiceClient` interface.  It could have been made by half a dozen different implementations of that interface, or it could even be a mock object created in a unit test.  You treat all of them the same way and don't care where they were constructed.\n\nIf you think there's something wrong with the way the object is being constructed, looking in the code that is having it injected is the wrong way to inspect it.  Look for any implementations of that interface that have `@Bean` or `@Component` annotations.",

If it was that good, every other language would be copying the patterns. Instead, what we see is Java trying to copy other languages while maintaining backwards compatibility, which naturally makes the language harder than needed. See the \"wonders\" of how string interpolation is stuck with a kind of nasty format, because all the more reasonable ones were used in other libraries first, and they didn't want to break backwards compatibility. See the streaming api, less comfortable than the equivalent in every language with monadic collection operations. The Option class that has no nullability guarantees, so it's not reliable, And since 95% of all Java for services is written in Spring, the annotation salad is what we've got.\n\nSo yeah, your best bet is to cope via heavy IDEs that do all the work and will track usages, including knowing the autowiring logic.",

        "body": "I think that code readability has a lot to do with one's experience with the particular paradigm being used, as well as one's understanding of the abstractions and the underlying platform.\n\nSorry for the essay - hope it makes sense for someone out there :)\n\nI teach intro-level Java-Programming as well as Spring programming, and it is interesting to see how different students grow into the different paradigms at wildly different paces.\n\nUnderstanding **imperative code is easy for everyone**, first line does something, then second line does something else, then the third line does another thing. The hardest part is learning that when you write `int weeks = days / 7;` on line 14, and then change the number of `days` on line 20, the value of `weeks` doesn't change along with it. But you get used to it, and learn to read code.\n\nThen comes **procedural** code, with loops and functions/methods (we ignore the objects at first), and it gets a bit harder to understand that the loop does the same thing over and over, but with the values changing - so now changing a value on line 20 **DOES** impact the calculation on line 14, if they are inside the same loop. Or a function behaves differently from time to time, because it depends on a global variable, whose value might have changed since the last call ...\n\nThen you move into **object oriented** code, where objects ask each other to do stuff - but it still mostly reads like procedural code, where a single thread of execution goes through methods living in different objects - you get used to having to jump around in different files, but most of the time you can still follow along. The hardest part is knowing when the objects are instantiated, and who \"owns\" the reference to them - but other than that you begin to abstract away the actual program flow, unless you really need it.\n\nBut you begin using frameworks, and suddenly you don't see all the code - you have objects that extend existing objects, who then call methods in your object. You don't know exactly when or why your own methods are called, you just get CVS-receipt-length style stack-dumps when something fails, and you sit \"outside\" the code, looking in, trying to understand what might be happening around your own code - mostly you are guessing or using information from other people also guessing.\n\nIt becomes very hard to follow, even for experienced programmers\n\nAnd then you move to Spring, which is **aspect oriented** programming, where you don't even write, nor see all the code, but only add annotations and interfaces, and then some magic entity behind the curtain reads your code, and changes it! Sometimes before compiling, sometimes after! And you have no idea how your code is being used, who uses it, what for, or when. You just hand code to the monster, and it does something - now it is literally impossible to follow what is going on, and you need to know what the platform does, what the framework does, how it uses your classes and methods, and why it uses them in the way it does ... And you either have to read through 35 years of accumulated specifications, or watch days of indian youtubers explain it, still somewhat on the surface-level ...\n\nSo to answer your question, **yes**! Modern Java is actually very hard to read - and Spring is outright impossible to understand if you don't know a whole lot about it beforehand!",

It's a requirement on this field to be self sufficient as everything is rapidly growing.\n\nTaking this approach will also solidify your skills fast which would definitely give you advantage when you start on working environment.",

        "body": "I'm in a similar boat, but I happened to figure that problem out as an undergrad. You're probably ahead of me in skill and prospects. \n\n\n**Work on skills related to finding a job:**\n\n\nSet a block of time, every day after work, for applying and upskilling. No exceptions, even if it's as little as 30min for one and 30min for the other. \n\n\nEvery time you feel like you're not skilled enough (which may be true), remember that people less skilled than us ARE getting jobs.\n\n\nFigure out why. Are they applying in novel ways? Do they have really good interviewing skills? Are they personable? Did they do x, y, and z? \n\n\nImprove yourself based on your findings. There are A LOT of unique ways to get hired while being less skilled. At the very least, you can improve your interviewing skills by failing at them and learning what to learn. \n\n\nDon't be afraid to look for more technical, but still retail-adjacent/low-level roles as a start. Don't allow yourself to settle for this either - keep searching and improving your process. \n\n\nI'd also try doing Neetcode 150 as well. Spend 15-30minutes failing on one question, watch the solution to the video, and then learn why the solution works (you can use AI as a mentor, not a solution solver). Rinse-repeat. Don't worry about \"not knowing the answers.\" Even experienced developers struggle on optimizing Easy's.\n\n\nSo, 30 minutes of self-study, 30min of applying (even \"knowing\" you'll fail), and a bit of LC-style learning when you're bored. \n\n\n.\n\n\n**Work on your technical skills:**\n\n\nThere are just as many paths forward in this as there is on the above. \n\n\nMy advice as a beginner? \n\n\nFigure out what domains you liked during your studies, research what it takes to get into them, and then follow an online roadmap learning those resources. \n\n\nDon't have a preferred domain?\n\n\nThen either read some books related to learning how to program, ones that are heavy on coding along and building things, follow a bootcamp, or go straight into \"github project-based learning\" repo and start building with your preferred languages. Focus on your preferred languages and up your skills.\n\n\nI recommend that path the most.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, school primed us to be very good at intaking new information and thinking like a computer, so now you have to learn how to be a craftsmen, building new projects and applying your theory. \n\n\nToo overwhelming? \n\n\nThe Odin Project is a free online boot camp that will essentially take you from 0 to the very minimum skills of a junior full-stack developer. You'll learn how to research, use version control, and build projects. \n\n\nThis will solidify your programming foundation, especially if you go a layer or two deep when using the additional resources/reading books.\n\n\nDon't forget to keep applying. When you're done with Foundations, you're not going to be \"cracked out junior\" level, but you'll be \"meh, *maybe* I can teach him the rest\" level. \n\n\nIf you haven't been applying due to being an imposter, you want a job or what? At least start at this point. \n\n\nThe more you improve at learning to program, the workflow for it, the rigor it takes, etc, the better you can pivot to other domains of programming. This is just one method of trying to open that door.\n\n\nYou are free to learn whatever else (project-based building in your preferred domain, reading books about programming, following tutorials on building a game, etc) as long as you complete that block of time for applications (or learning novel ways of getting a job) and dedicated self-study (this example being The Odin Project).\n\n\nIt's important to have fun during it all and not try to speed run yourself into burnout. You may find you learn the most in that period of fun/exploration.\n\n\n.\n\n\nSorry about the wall of text! I don't know the correct/most efficient path since I'm stumbling along as well! \n\n\nIf you want someone to chat with, feel free to DM on here. I'll give my Discord. ",

We only had to choose in year three and then could also choose multiple paths at once to test them out.\n\nSome jaded opinions from having done all of that a bit (my formal background is databases, chip design, robotics and cognition psychology):\n\n- Cybersecurity is steady but boring. It sounds flashy on paper with hacking and 0-days, but in practice it's about managing risks, audits, and doing lots of trainings for Rachel from accounting and writing stern memos for Herbert down in the archives to not write passwords on a postit. I've come into that via formal certifications we had to do to get projects in certain industries and I'm in contact with the legal department of a client for risk management there.\n- AI is buzz. There's money there, but you have to be able to suppress any remnant of morality to get that money by promising the sky and unicorns. The actual tech is cool and fascinating but can do a lot less than what sales people promise and unless you can get into one of the big players, you'll be eternally chasing their work. We do get project requests related to that and at least half of them ask for applied magic.\n- Databases is steady and boring and a bit frustrating. 99% of what people need from databases can be taught in a simple SQL course, the rest comes up if you either need to scale a high performance setup for 100000 users or when the new manager Timmey suggests we move all our data into a MongoDB on his notebook because he can scale with kubernetes or something like that. As I said, my formal background, and the MongoDB example is only half exaggerated.\n- Avoid Web. It's been the lowest common denominator in coding for decades. It will be expected that you can do web in addition to your \"real\" specialisation.\n- Game Dev... as you said, not a good option if you want to eat.\n\nEdit: added a bit of context, also some more specialisations to consider:\n\n- control unit and embedded is surprisingly complicated and rewarding. Pretty much all machinery out there runs software somewhere, but it's not talked about a lot.\n- graphics programming is also surprisingly large. Medical imaging, HUDs and sensors for vehicles, big data visualisation etc are all non-trivial, and the algorithmic side overlaps with the nitty gritty details of running AI.\n- robotics is cool, but not a lot of jobs in my city.\n- signal processing is an absolute rabbit hole. Take it at least as an elective because it helps immensely with compression theory, cryptography and video encoding.\n- if all else fails, there will always be jobs for stupid, boring enterprise software. The electronic version of a clipboard and a document binder. It's soulless corporate work, but it pays the bills.",

        "body": "Check out what's taught in the core curriculum for these specializations: subjects, courses, technologies, topics, languages. They can teach anything under the name AI. It could be generative AI, ML, or complex but important topics, but also things that are completely irrelevant to today's world or the job market. Similarly, other cybersecurity categories will likely include theory, encryption, encryption algorithms, and more, but there's a good chance they won't include what everyone expects—hacking or active intrusion prevention. Web can also encompass anything, perhaps focusing more on network administration or web application development (more or less latest technologies, languages). Depending on how the university keeps up with the times, databases might have a well-developed foundation, but they might also include cloud computing, Azure, data warehousing, Big Data, and more.\n\nBased on what these specializations contain, you can make a more informed decision, and we can recommend one over the other. Of course, it's also important what you're interested in, what you've done, and what you felt good about. This is especially true for things you didn't particularly enjoy; this can strongly steer you toward a particular specialization. However, the names of specializations alone aren't enough, as they can encompass many other things.\n\nAdditionally, look at the job market in your country or the location where you'd like to work. For example, you probably won't find a job as a junior game developer or Android developer. Job offers based primarily on databases should be available, although you'd likely need to learn something, such as data science. If this specialization truly teaches the topics I mentioned and others, you could easily find a job, for example, one related primarily to Azure and databases. There are jobs for web developers, but they involve a vast array of technologies. Unfortunately, you'll likely have to learn many of them completely on your own due to the limited number of subjects and hours to even call yourself a junior. It's also possible that the technologies they'll teach you for creating web applications aren't entirely aligned with market demand. Therefore, it's crucial to check what they'll actually teach under the term \"web\"—will you have the skills to administer networks, for example, or will it be a mishmash of everything, not necessarily up-to-date, and will pose a problem later.",

Instead, by posting how you *started* in the form of your newbie, beginner-level code (that, yes, might \"suck\"), and then posting a steady progression of how you learn, you would show evidence of by far one of the most important skills a programmer can have: the ability to learn. \n\nI feel this is especially true for a modern software developer.

        "body": "Well, you're already in CS. Undergrad CS doesn't teach you how to develop software. But the fun thing is that a huge chunk of people who develop software don't understand CS. You already know how to program, too. That doesn't change much. Neither does computer architecture or networking principles. Same for OS design and for parsers/compilers (the purple dragon book is still likely going to be the book you read for compilers and that was written 40 years ago).\n\nWhat you want to do at your stage is to continue passing your math and engineering classes because those are extremely important if you want to do anything with CS that doesn't involve basic software engineering. And the reason for that is going to be that the math classes you take will likely gate what upper division electives you can take. Go through your course catalog and look at the electives for your major. THOSE are going to lead to high-level, interesting stuff that *does* require a college education. For example, machine learning as a college junior or senior is severely more intensive than what you're going to experience through online tutorials aimed at people who don't have a CS background.\n\nThe important thing is that a lot of interesting stuff that you can learn as a CS major *isn't necessarily CS.* If you want to learn about simulation, you might end up looking at stuff for civil engineers (and realize that you need to take more physics). If you want to learn more about data science, you might end up looking at economics and might need to take way more philosophy. The more interesting networking classes are usually tied into management of information systems. The split info embedded is likely going to land you in electrical engineering if not directly into computer engineering. If your school has an informatics program, you might even want to change majors. \n\nIf you want to manage software projects and your college doesn't have any sort of specialty in that, then you're going to need to learn the Project Management Body of Knowledge on your own *anyway* if you want to become a project manager... and then software project management is a subset of business management anyway. A ton of tech project managers can't write a lick of code. \n\nSo at the end of the day, look at your upper division electives and think \"Does this sound interesting?\" If it does, go for it and make sure the path on your curriculum leads to it. As for personal development, I always tell people to just work on something, ANYTHING AT ALL, just for fun outside of their school hours. The only people I know that managed to finish a CS degree but then never did anything with it were people who never wrote any code for fun on their offtime. If you simply want to flex what you already know and want to broaden that, then look up coding challenges or attend a jam of any sort.",

Then I didn't use it because I 'needed' a spray booth. Got one about 18 months ago. Still didn't do any because 'I need a dedicated space'. Recently I got one. Still didn't use the airbrush because I 'needed' running water, power and internet (because of reasons) in order to spend time down in that area.\n\nAll of these things that delayed me starting were, if I'm honest, because it scared me. The whole journey off learning to use the airbrush properly and learning to clean and maintain it, scared me. So I didn't use it.\n\nIn the last few weeks I finally used it. First time was okay. Cleaned it and left it all there. Came back and had problem after problem with the airbrush.\n\nTurns out that that was the best thing that could have happened. I had to repeatedly strip the brush and work or what was wrong and how to fix it. All of these problems completely destroyed my fear of it. The problems (and solving them) were the perfect thing to educate me on how to use it and have me experience and confidence.\n\nThe lesson here is that problems are good. Problems teach and instead of fearing it, it's just best to dive in and confront the problems.",

Hell no, but also you don't need to.\n\nBut you should be building up a baseline of knowledge over time.\n\nWhat's the system to learning all of that faster? Make it *hard* for yourself to look the information up. Brains are inherently lazy - if it is easy to look something up, your brain won't bother spending the energy to remember something. But if it is a royal pain in the ass to look something up, eventually your brain will just be \"alright, fine, I'll remember it because I don't want to have to bother looking it up again\".\n\nThis is part of why any kind of self-testing where you look at the answers right away sucks. Your brain will be \"whatever, I'll just get it wrong and then I get to see the answer\". Where if it is more like \"I'm going to sit in this goddamn chair as long as it takes to get it right\" you'll start to get better at actually putting your brain to work.\n\nThis is one of the reason actual honest to god paper books are actually really good for learning. They've got great info, but they slow you down and make looking up that information take a bit of time. That's actually really good for learners.",

Then, having done that, find the next problem, tackle that.\n\nThere's no silver bullet here. Making progress is hard, it takes lots of time, dedication and being quite stubborn, and it is slow. If you don't get a kick out of having something finally click, or finally figuring out that everything that was wrong was a missing semicolon (or something similiar), then it might not be for you. It may feel like you're hitting a wall all the time and making the same mistakes over and over again - but recognising that you're making mistakes is what will enable you to learn. There's really no other way forward than just insisting to continue, be curious and seek out all the knowledge you can.\n\nGood luck.",

Get a project over the finish line, to the point where you can demo it to people. It doesn’t have to be earth-shaking. But it should be complete and it should work. Think shop class not math class. \n\nTake a look at https://freecodecamp.org/ for some learning tracks that focus on projects.\n\nYou got this! Welcome to our great trade.",

I could list a bunch of stuff I believe are important to know, but more than likely, miss quite a few in the process.\n\nA more broad answer is that the fact that you are aware of gaps in your knowledge is a great place to start! If you find yourself unaware of why an implementation is done the way it is - investigate it! Many of the frameworks you're using are likely Open Source, and likely developed in the open, with open issues, RFCs, etc. that describe exactly the sort of information you're missing.\n\nNow I don't know your skill level, so I don't know if you are well adept in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTTP, etc. But I would add that you should know what the frameworks you're using are doing for you. If it is a frontend UI framework - your first question should be \"Why am I using this?\", \"What problem is this framework solving for me?\" If your answer is \"because this guide tells me to\", then that's an issue.\n\nUnderstanding basic design patterns is also something I consider to be quite important. Sadly I think many traditional methods of showcasing these patterns are quite poor in terms of teaching the way one can internalize the patterns and use them - even if programming in a different language than the one being used to show examples in, and even if the implementation details differ to the way the patterns are shown.\n\nSo, to summarize, my take is that the fact you're asking questions is half the way to progressing, now you just need to look for the answers. Mastering all of this is a craft, and it is ever evolving. But if you want to look past the frameworks as \"the stuff you learn\" and get to \"I use them to solve specific problems\", you need to be painfully aware of exactly what those problems are. This is also the only way you will ever gain a proper understanding of when to switch to a different framework. Remember this industry moves fast, most of the frameworks in use now either didn't exist or were quite new 10 years ago, and going back 10 more year will yield the same result. But knowing all of the fundamentals, as well as how and why the frameworks evolved as they did - that will always be relevant.",

You need to learn to create the discrete steps that make the computer do what you want it to do. \n\nI fully do understand that your ultimate goal is to create your game, but that's a *future goal*. (A new carpenter doesn't directly start building intricate Victorian furniture. They start with learning to work with hand tools and with the grain of the wood and gradually work their way up.)\n\nTake two steps back and start with general programming. The suggestions I give you now are tailored to your desire of making games in the end:\n\n+ Start with the MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki. It is a free, textual, extremely practice oriented course that is the current first semester of \"Introduction to Computer Science\". This course will give you a solid general programming foundation and understanding along with teaching you the *Python programming language*.\n+ Then, move on to [Making Games with Python and Pygame](https://inventwithpython.com/pygame/) - also free to read online. This book will lay the foundation for game programming. Maybe, if your game is simple enough, you can even realize it with Pygame already.\n+ Then, move on to Godot. And here, I'd suggest that you shell out a few bucks (it's really cheap) and buy the [Humble \"Learn Godot in 2025\" bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/software/learn-godot-in-2025-complete-course-bundle-software) (available for 2 more days at the time of writing this comment) - I've bought a previous similar bundle and can attest that the courses are excellent and well worth the money.\n\nMy recommendation for Python first comes from GDScript's similarities to it. GDScript is basically a Python dialect with some additions for Godot and some peculiarities. If you know Python, learning GDScript will be much, much easier.",

So in high school I learned through paper magazines ('Byte','Compute', etc.) where you had to copy your games by hand into the computer. Somehow the local library did have subscription to a few of these. Game piracy branding (think custom splash screens) was thing but you had to know a friend or a friend of a friend with a modem.

When you merge, either you'll get a clean merge, or you'll get merge conflicts that need to be resolved.\n\nThe key thing is that any new changes from the base branch may or may not matter for your feature development in that 4 day period. It depends. A major factor there is how orthogonal the team members are to one another. If people are working on completely different things that don't affect the other, then you could potentially defer merging the base branch into your feature branch until your feature branch is done, especially if it's pretty short-lived.\n\nSometimes, you'll encounter merge conflicts when you attempt to merge the base branch into yours. Depending on what they are, I usually prefer to reconcile those sooner than later, just to not have that looming over my head, but even so, you could potentially hold off if they're not critical and don't affect how you develop the feature.\n\nIn some cases though, even non-conflicting changes can be problematic, either in the sense that the code is no longer working (a semantic conflict, rather than a textual conflict), or they could just muck up your build in some way and force you to have to rebuild. In either case, if it doesn't affect how I'd build the feature, then I tend to defer merging until my feature is done, unless there's some good reason I should merge sooner.\n\nAll that said, it's a judgment call, and ultimately you'll want to ensure that in the end you're merging quality work to the main branch that is well tested against the main branch's latest changes.",

But if you always plush to master, and you've done work since you realized that feature you added broke something, removing it without removing the in between work is a pain.  It's also harder to go back and figure it out.\n\nWe branch from master when we start on a new major update.  These usually are usually a very big deal - features being added.  We don't merge a major into master until we end support - master holds the oldest version we support.\n\nWhen we patch, we branch off the major branch into a patch branch.  So most of the time there will be master, major, and patch.  There can be two major branches, though it's not common.  When we release a patch we merge it into the major, so that doesn't get cluttered.\n\nWhen a developer starts working in something, they branch from, usually, the patch branch.

Mostly small scale and/or personal projects right now, but I have experience with medium sized project (50 devs, over 1k active users, < tens of millions of datapoints)\n\nThere is not one perfect order. This is the first decision you will have to make: Where do you start, and what project style do you go with.\n\nSince I am currently building a one man project, I can give you the order of operations as I did it:\n\n1. Rough outline: What is my project? Why would people care? What problem does it solve? What solutions are already available? Who are the potential users?\n2. Feature list: Itemized list of all features it should have. For each Feature I wrote down for whom it is useful, and what I need to to technically to get it to work. (Networking, database, things like that)\n3. Feature details: I then added something similar to user stories to my features: Basically, short descriptions of how a user would interact with it, and what they would expect to happen/see. On my whiteboard, I then drew a lot of boxes, denoting my features, and connected them with arrows: \"Feature A needs Feature B\", or \"Feature C leads to Feature D\"\n4. I took everything I've built up to this point, and made UI mockups. First \"wireframes\" with a pen and paper, to roughly block out what could go where. then I made a single page in detail, to decide on a style for my UI. With those two in hand I went to some potential users, and used them to \"test\" my idea. I put the papers in front of them and asked them to perform a task (and I ended each test session by letting them choose a few tasks themselves) This resulted in me changing quite a few of my designs and intended workflows. It is good to catch errors as early and cheaply as possible. Changing the blockout version of a site costs a few hours in drawing, changing a coded version would take days or weeks.\n5. Then I sat down with my new UI and double checked, that all planned features are present, and that all parts of the UI are part of a planned feature. If not, I adjusted either side until I was happy. Then I used my feature List to plan my tech stack (yes, I did it this late in the game) Now I knew everything I wanted my (web)app to do and what it needed to do. So I chose rust(leptos) frontend, rust(axum) backend and postgresQL as my database. (shocker)\n6. With my new tech stack in hand, I made some rough diagrams of the architecture of the front and backend, something like a UML diagram, but much less formal. (because I am alone, as long as I can guarantee that I understand it, it's fine, and I have been using the same \"almost-UML\" since year 2 of university) I also mapped out the DB, but in excruciating detail, every nullable field, every relationship. Then I double checked again, that every feature, both in the UI and my docs, is present in my database.\n7. Then I started implementing a vertical slice: Meaning a single feature, from the DB to the UI, \"fully\" functional. I took this to even more testers, got feedback and did a final round of adjustments to my UI style plan.\n8. This is where I am now: I am currently implementing version 1 of my app, in it's entirety. This will be interrupted by testing with real users from time to time, but I am hoping that no major issues will come up, and I am confident that my architecture is strong enough to support refactoring most features.\n\nThis is not \"the best\" way. But I was bitten by agile too often in the past, so for my free time, I wanted something a little more waterfally. I am certainly not moving as fast as I could, and if I was dependent on external funding, this might not be a path I could afford; but since it's only my spare time, I chose to take the time and try to get it right the first time. If I get it 75% right, I will be more than happy.\n\nEDIT: \n\nI forgot Step 0: \n\nI actually built a prototype. The UI was shit, and I only had 10% of my final featureset, but I wanted to see if the \"demand\" was there. It is. The UI was built sloppily over a few weeks with no plan, and was very unmaintainable. I learned a lot about the domain though, so it's not wasted time, it made my second attempt so much easier and better.",

Maybe not.  You should expect to have to rewrite parts of your code as you discover errors in previous assumptions, find better ways to do things, find that your requirements change, or whatever else comes along.  That's why you try to have strong separation of concerns and loose coupling between well defined functions (and architectural layers) that can be swapped out at a later date\n\nI would generally advise writing an end-to-end solution as early as possible, including installing your app on an iPhone/iPad to prove that it works in the wild.\n\nA good starting point for an architecture is to separate your app into 3 separate layers: data, business logic, and presentation logic.  The data and business logic would be in the 'M' (model) of an MVC architecture, while the presentation logic would be in the 'V' (view).\n\nTry to think about how easy it would be to swap the components within one of those layers for other components with minimal impact on the rest of the app.  The fewer changes you have to make to interfaces between layers, the more decoupled they are.\n\n> Can someone please breakdown their typical workflow, do you start with back-end? ground level framework stuff, and then work your way up to re-usable shared features that can nest into full components later?\n\nIf you imagine your architectural layers as being stacked one on top of the other, with the data layer at the bottom and the presentation at the top, then my approach is to design the architecture from the top down, then again from the bottom up, then finally once more from the top down.\n\nI start from the top because that's where the user lives, and it's the user experience that will drive the app.  There's always a bit of tension between the the best implementation for the UI and the best implementation for the data, and that tension has to be resolved somewhere in the middle (e.g. at the API); so once you've established your data models from the perspective of the user, it helps to look at the system again from the perspective of the models, make sure you've established the best way store and query those models, then see how your UI will interact with those models.  With your new understanding of how the data will be modelled, you might find a better design for the UI, or at least refine how your UI interacts with the models.",

Si tu as déjà des bases en HTML, CSS et JavaScript, je te conseille de **te lancer en développement web**. tu peux commencer directement avec **Next.js** (React) si tu préfères le front, ou **Expressjs** (Node.js) si tu veux te concentrer sur le back-end. Ces frameworks sont relativement simples à prendre en main, et avec des tutos, tu vas vite progresser ! Crois-moi, une fois que tu es dedans, ça avance vite !\n\nSi je devais choisir parmi tes options, je dirais plutôt **Ingénierie Cloud + DevOps** (Azure/AWS) car c’est un domaine avec beaucoup d’opportunités aujourd’hui. Sinon j'ai touché à l'**IA/ML**, mais ce n'est pas vraiment mon truc. Ça demande souvent du **matériel puissant** pour tester les modèles. La **Data Science** est aussi intéressante, mais je ne m'y suis pas trop plongé, donc je laisse quelqu'un d'autre donner son avis.\n\nQuoi qu’il en soit, l’important est de **passer à l’action**, de **te fixer des objectifs** et d’avancer petit à petit.\n\nne reste pas bloqué. Bonne chance et surtout, **never give up** !",

There's really more harm done by misunderstanding or forcing others to look things up, than what you are saving.\n\nPreferred language by whom? Why do you care? If you're already at a school, shouldn't you just do what your teachers recommend? Specific tech stacks don't matter at all, you're getting a degree to learn how to think, not how to use languages.\n\nData structures and algorithms are often taught in pseudocode because the principle mattes, not the implementation. Sometimes metaphors are used like lightbulbs or searching a phonebook, etc. Nevertheless, the C language is often used for more practical examples because it is barebones. There's not much high-level fluff and it feels closer to the actual memory implementation, which sometimes makes it feel more relevant to learn about sorting algorithms when working directly with raw arrays. A language like Python works just the same, but the ecosystem around it will throw high-level standard libs in your face, which already take care of all data structure and algorithms for you, so it feels more pointless than a lower level language.\n\nI've never heard that C++ or Java would be preferred for learning DSA, why would they? C++ is like C, just with classes and more high-level features, which aren't applicable when learning about the fundamentals. Java is a memory-managed high-level language similar to C#, therefore still in the root vein of C, but with many more features, all which are irrelevant for DSA.\n\nUse whatever your teachers/mentors know best to reduce the friction of setting up any environments or getting stuck on syntax features. Then ignore the language and learn computer science, it goes a far longer way than any single language.",

I should focus on Node and the JS stack, or Java because it was ubiquitous, or Python because it was easy and common, or Rust because it was the rising low level language, or Ruby because at the time Ruby on Rails was the big back end thing.\n\nEvery interview I did had a different stack. I'd spend a month working on Python only for no one to work with it, and I found myself frustrated that I was \"wasting my time.\"\n\nManaging your sanity in this effort is at least as important as studying things that are applicable to your next job, and the truth is you have no idea what's going to be in your next job. At my current position, I've been writing in JS, Java, Python, Swift, PDL, and some proprietary stuff unique to this company. Have you ever even heard of PDL? No you haven't.\n\nYou're trying to do three things here - master engineering fundamentals, learn to learn, and demonstrate your capabilities.\n\nSo decide on a project - a calendar app, a video conferencing app, something business people will recognize as valuable. Then decide on a stack that will be appropriate to build that particular app, learn that stack, and then be able to articulate why you chose that stack in an interview. That will be more impressive than already knowing a language, at least to any engineers you want to work with.\n\nHope that helps.",

So there isn't a quick and easy explanation I can give you that will make it easy to understand. It's going to take time and effort on your part.\n\nTo learn about how something like Spring works, you have to read *both* high-level overviews *and* the detailed lower-level documentation. Since you've asked such a broad question, I don't think I can do much better than just pointing you to [the Spring documentation website](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/index.html). For quick answers to specific subtopics, I've found [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/) to also be pretty good.\n\nIf you can post the code and ask *specific* questions, like \"where's the program's entry point\" or \"how does this function get called\" or \"what does this annotation mean\", then people can try to give you more specific answers. But the answers might not make much sense without background knowledge of how Spring works.\n\nAs for Kafka: Kafka itself is not super complicated to use -- it just acts like a fancy persistent queue. But you need some distributed systems and systems programming knowledge to understand when it makes sense to use it, and how to use it performantly.",

It is good practice to have all relevant documentation open in a tab at all times)\n\n1. README - Any good repo should have a readme in it's root path, ideally more READMEs when necessary in subfolders. This should give you a rough idea of how to get everything setup, what the project does and how you run tests (if it's well written)\n\n2. Comments and Code - The Code should be commented. I normally start at the entry point (main function if applicable) and go deeper into the project from there, by following used classes, function calls and so on. If the project is big, I always have a whiteboard and / or stack of papers to take notes and draw diagrams of how it all connects. This step will take time, maybe hours or even days, depending on the size of the codebase. I also like to make small changes, like commenting out function calls, to see what breaks. This allows me to know a little more about what does what. (don't forget to revert all changes, using git preferrably\n\n3.

This is why we have peer reviews and GitHub Pull Requests.\n\nOf course, it's hard to create a foundation if you have no idea what the frameworks are doing. As a quick explanation, Spring is used in the creation of microservices, and has a robust structure for making RESTful web services. Apache Kafka, based on its description, is known for use with real-time data feeds. Based on these 2, I'm guessing that I have a web client that sends or POSTs a certain data and a receiving end (maybe a database) receives or stores something, and that latency or throughout is pretty important that we are using Apache Kafka to manage multiple POSTs or other HTTP methods.",

In Europe/US as far as I know, Python, C# and Java are still pretty common, Go, JS and Ruby (and rust) exist, but at different and lower frequencies, I have seen only very few Kotlin backends, even though I love how it is done in the language. If you want real numbers, go on job portals in your area, and look through a few hundred backend jobs. (Yes, it will take 2-3 hours, but you will have an accurate answer, which did not come from the subjective, 2 years out of date experience of someone from germany)\n\n2. I mean... Not sure what you mean? A Backend REST (or GraphQL) API will work for any frontend, as long as that frontend can do network requests. You can use the same backend for a python Frontend, a JS Webapp and an embedded C controller, and I have done so in the past. \n\n3. You will have to learn the concepts of backend. This is not optional, and will be about the same amount of work for all of the options listed above. But once you know how it works and how to set it up, it works pretty much the same in every framework (+/-, different things will be included, there wil be different names and slightly different details). If you know what middleware is, or how a request/a form is handled, you can migrate frameworks pretty easily. If you don't know those things, you can't really work productively in teh backend. \n\n4. I don't think that there is a huge difference between languages/frameworks here. If you want to shorten it, use a language you already know. (So I guess Java or Kotlin, if you come from Android). I have built a toy project in Kotlin, but never anything in Java. I can't really give you advice there.",

I kind of suck in putting the button in the middle of a div or whatever. Styling stuff is not my thing. I can get it done but I would prefer a backend task.\n\nJust being a frontend developer will limit your options. Yes, there ARE jobs for frontend developers but in general it is more likely to find a job as a person who can do both backend and frontend.\n\nBut if you did not mean frontend but web applications/services then focusing on that is a fine and valid choice. Sure, the job market is saturated with web application developers and you have to stand out of the dozens or hundreds of other fresh graduates, to get hired. How will you do that is up to you. Will you work on your portfolio, will you try to get an internship, will you start as a freelancer, or something else? You choose. But you do have to push harder to be able to stand out.

Then build something small: a calculator, tic tac toe, a web scraper that notified you when a certain youtube channel uploads. You are allowed to choose a new language for every project, but you must set a max amount of concurrent projects (I suggest 3), not switch the language during a project, and finish all of them",

        "body": "In terms of learning, my biggest recommendations is don't use AI. And rarely use videos or tutorial blog posts. Get used to reading documentation and figuring out how stuff works, those are the skills you want to learn.\n\nUnless you luck into a business opportunity or a viral app, you're unlikely to be using your skills to make money directly by programming until after your graduate. But you can use them to get retail jobs in computer sales, low level tech support jobs, etc. Working low level service jobs is honestly probably good for most people if they haven't done it before - one of the big skills you need to be successful in any career is being able to work hard and persevere, and low level service jobs give you that in spades. And hopefully one day you'll take the mental fortitude you've developer and be able to earn an actual living wage with it.",

For example, knowing how to read and manipulate data, automate checks, or interact with embedded systems can have a huge impact in your day-to-day work without touching full-scale R&D projects.\n\nI’d suggest focusing on small, hands-on projects that directly improve what you’re already doing. Maybe write scripts to log system data, automate routine diagnostics, or build simple tools for troubleshooting. Over time, you’ll get comfortable with patterns, debugging, and problem-solving and this is what hiring managers and supervisors actually notice, not just knowing Java keywords.",

If you don't know any framework yet, just take the one with the biggest userbase / selection of tutorials. That will make your start easier, and switching a framework later really is not that hard. \n\nIt's just like learning your first programming language feels hard, because you are actually learning programming. Once you pick up your second language, it will go pretty fast, and your third language won't even take an entire weekend to start getting productive. Same goes for frameworks: Once you know how a backend is structured, they are all pretty much the same. (They are solving the same problem, and there are only so many ways to do that) \n\nSo I would suggest, staying in JavaScript (although it pains me to see it used in the backend), and choosing the framework with the best community support. \n\nThere are a lot of alternatives, and you probably should use many of them at least for one project, until you feel you've found something you like. Python has Flask, Django and FastAPI (among many more), PHP has Laravel and CakeSomething? I think. .NET, Kotlin, Java all have some, Go is great for backend, and although personally I really enjoy axum in rust right now, that is really hard to get into for beginners.",

I say in your area because it does drastically change depending on when you live! JavaScript is often miserable for employment, especially if you are BE only.\n\n\\- If your goal is to learn some stuff, I would stay with JS/Express. You are already familiar with JS, so you can learn the server-side concepts more easily without having to relearn the language. But learning comes in any shape, so it would also be perfectly fine to switch to a different language if you want to.\n\n\\- If your goal is to become a full-stack dev with a decent developer experience, definitely stay in the JS ecosystem. This way you will be able to leverage both the fe and the be to a very high degree while writing the same code, reusing types, etc. With time, you will probably move to Next or some other full stack framework instead of express.\n\nNotice that I answered your question regarding JavaScript in general. Thats because the specific technology doesn't matter in your case. Yes, express is minimal and somewhat outdated, but its perfectly fine, and even great, at teaching you concepts and getting you started. You will shift your stack and ways of writing code a million times, but fundamentals stay.",

Write your own tests or search for a testing set online, they should exist for most common algorithms. When you feel comfortable with simple tasks, go online and search for problemsets.

        "body": "It’s always a good idea to include some documentation with your personal projects. \nI usually have 2 or 3 .txt to track everything. \n\nFor me it starts with my planning and it follows through what I’m doing as I work, so if I get pulled away to something else or pick up a project again after a while I have detailed note on what I was doing and (maybe more importantly) what I want to do. \n\nnotes.txt: this file is just for my revision and work, I don’t share it with anyone. \n1) Concept. I start by explaining the idea of what I want to do and what I might need to make it. Brief 4-5 lines as an intro to the project\n\n2) Aims and Objectives. Here I detail exactly what I want and what it needs to be a success. This help keep things on track and prevent scope creep as I can always focus on what I really need and the real objectives in the background. \n\n3) Plan. First through rundown of how I think I’ll build it. You don’t need to be exact on every detail but figure out what you’re going to need. Login section, landing page, diff options, processing input for ‘x’ or ‘y’ and how it’s done/what the out put should be. \n\n4) Components. List out the big bits you need to do. Parts that need to be put together with key functions and features. It’s to track that plan you did earlier and figure out what needs to be done at a glance. \n\n5) Variables Functions libraries and Header files. \nList out all the variable you’re using and why you use them, do the same for function. Very basic ones can just be named with type, you don’t need an explanation but if you won’t know at first glance what it does write it out. What are we importing from this library. Why did we make that header file and what’s in it/how does it work. Keep updating as you move along\n\n6) Working journal. This one might branch into a different file depending on the size of the project. Start the project, write out what you need to do first and what you’re planning to work on. I usually put the date in but that’s just for me to be able to look back over it. \nEvery day I start by bringing unfinished tasks forward and writing out the next set of tasks I need to finish. \nCopy across what you’re doing and what’s not working  and the final version when it is. Anything important or interesting I need to note for later goes in here. “Had to scrap an entire section and restart it”, throw that in here and explain why. \nAt the end of the session I list out what I  did today and what I need to do on the next session (cuts back 10-15 min of figuring out where to start when you sit down next time). \n\n\n7) Closing Brief. I usually move this up after the objective section once I’m finished. How did the project go? Did you achieve your goals? What was difficult how did you get around it? What would you like to improve further? And finally are you happy with the finished product? \n\n8) Lessons learned, at the end of the file, where did you go wrong and what do you know now about doing “x”, “y” or “z” for next time. \n\n\n\n.\n\nRead Me file:\nAfter the project I’ll make the read me file. \n1) Update the Concept, Aims, Components and Brief so I have a concise document that anyone I share the project with will be able to understand what’s going on and why it’s built this way. \n\n2) Features:\nDetail what the project takes in and what the intended out puts should be. If it’s an API detail the call and expected output if it’s a web app follow a trace of how the user progresses through the app. Think of it as a guide on how someone else should use the application. \n\n3) Components:\nList out the key functions and methods, how they work and how you’ve used them. No need for major details just let people know why it’s important and what you were thinking with it. \n\n4) Closing Statement:\nDetail what you achieved in making this application. What needs more work and whether you intend to come back and work on anything else. \n\n.\n\nIt’s a good habit to start tracking your projects as you go along even just for your own notes. \n\nWhen you look back at this in 6 months or 2 years are you going to know what you were thinking on April 3rd when you need to fix/plan around a similar issue in the future. \n\nThe notes.txt file is just for me and I usually put it in the gitignore. It’s helped out in interviews when I was asked to walk through some of my work I’ll pull up my notes file and can quickly find key details on what I was doing and how I did it. I’ve shared my screen to show some of the details or pulled up \nA specific part of my journal where I figured out a problem. \n\nReally helps to have actual example of what you did and how you processed the problem before finding the solution. You can also then say “Well I know about this library now that fixes this for me but I could build it myself again if I needed to”. \n\nVery small concept projects or feature test I don’t do this out. It’s only for projects I might show people or a 10 min glance wouldn’t explain what’s going on. \n\nSorry a lot in that comment but that’s how I do it.",

Make the repo(s) public (watch for secrets  and personal data etc.).\n\nIf you have a website too I might visit it, but 95% chance I won't. 1% chance I look at any of the code in the repos. We just don't have time for that, generally. I'll just look at the repo README to see what it is, then move on. With this in mind, it's a good idea to spend a bit of time on the README, telling me the details I need to know \"above the fold\" (without having to scroll down) like what the project is/does, where it runs, key technologies used etc. In a few formatted sentences or bullet points. I will never ever ever pull+build+run your projects. Again, I've got tens more candidates to screen, so anything you can do to dial back the bullshit, not add to it, is great. (E.g. I once passed on a candidate that had an obnoxious loading message on his website whilst his unnecessarily large front end bundle loaded and hydrated taking seconds to do all these fancy JS things. The exact opposite of impressive.)\n\nYou don't need to deploy things, but if there's a convenient link in the README I will probably click it just to see what you built. I won't run through the features or anything unless it's a button push.\n\nSaved on your computer is only useful if you're screen sharing for a demo or something, like in an interview. Maybe have a local copy checked out and built in case you get the opportunity to demo or something. I would look positively on a candidate offering to show me a project we are discussing actually running, even if I didn't take them up on it.\n\nDoesn't matter for recruiters. Most of them are even less likely than us to look at projects in detail, they just pass these things along to client firms. Occasionally you get a recruiter that will click around but their feedback probably isn't very valuable in all honesty. They'll focus more on your CV itself and experience etc.\n\nIn general don't worry too much. If we want to see you code we'll set a test (live, take-home etc.) as repo code could have come from anywhere and doesn't tell us much. Honestly, I mostly use projects to gauge the level of interest a candidate has in writing software, not their actual ability, as we expect that to be low at entry level. You have no idea how many people we get that can't point to anything they've done outside of education, and can't demonstrate any ability or approach to solving a problem they weren't prepared for.",

Facebook today is not the same app as 10 years ago. \n\nIf you believe in your project then keep working on it since nothing else matters when you can always grow to make it better.",

        "body": "I think what you're being confused by is a special feature of unions in C++. When you declare a union starting with a simply typed field like an integer (or an enum, which is just integer values you that have certain names), or multiple such fields at the start of a union, C++ treats then as the \"Common Initial Sequence\" of the union. What that means is that the compiler assumes that all the struct union member types that follow, such as, say, SDL\\_WindowEvent, SDL\\_KeyboardEvent, and others -- that all of those structs themselves start with those fields/types. If your SDL\\_Event event union is in a variable e, it lets you write e.type as a shorthand. What that actually means is \"no matter which member type (SDL\\_WindowEvent, SDL\\_KeyboardEvent, etc.) I'm currently interpreting my union variable as, I know it starts with an enum SDL\\_EventType value (because I've arranged it so all the union struct types start with that field), so just interpret the first four bytes of this variable as the type.\"\n\nI think (?) when you say 'shouldn't it be e.SDL\\_EventType == SDL\\_QUIT', what you mean is, 'when I access things from a union, I always have to specify which sub-type I'm thinking about the union as at that moment, so I expect to see e.SDL\\_EventType or something like that, just like I would write e.SDL\\_WindowEvent.whatever, and I shouldn't be able to access any field directly as e.type\". But you can because of this Common Initial Sequence convenience C++ gives you.\n\nOn the other hand, if your question really is just about how enums work: An enum is just a way of telling the compiler that certain symbols stand for certain integer values. So when SDL defines the SDL\\_EventType, one of the values in there is SDL\\_QUIT, which is assigned some particular value (like 5 or whatever) by the enum. Your intuition is right that it's kind of more \"proper\" to refer to that value as something like SDL\\_EventType.SDL\\_QUIT (i.e., the SDL\\_QUIT value as defined by the SDL\\_EventType enum. But C/C++ let you just say SDL\\_QUIT and it knows that by that you mean 5. It doesn't make sense to say e.SDL\\_EventType because that's trying to refer to a field of e using a enum \\*type\\*. The actual field e is an integer, so it has values like SDL\\_QUIT or other enum values defined by SDL\\_EventType.",

The first member of the `SDL_Event` union is `UInt32 type;`, followed by a bunch of members of various struct types.\n\nEach of those structs must also begin with a `UInt32` so that they share the common initial sequence.

If it does exist, it'd be a lot more straightforward, but I wouldn't spend too much time looking into it.

For html and js it’s better to use webstorm, c++ is CLion and I think php is phpstorm specifically but you can also use php in webstorm. You can use plugins or use multiple languages sometimes in the same ide but they designed ide’s specifically for specific languages so you’ll have to research what to use best. Since you need an account and a license, your settings will sync over all jetbrains ide’s. As a student the ide’s are free to use, if you’re not than the licensing is still affordable with a package that you basically get all ide’s.

No matter ... We'll just pretend that you are a skilled painter.\n\nNow imagine that someone comes up to you, saying: \"How to I get better at drawing? I'm not very artistic, but I like to think very logical, and my goal in drawing is to simply be able to make these drawings I see street-artists do, where a few simple lines suddenly resemble a duck or an elephant! I want to try those challenges and overtime get better at it!\"\n\nHow would you react, what would you tell them? I'd imagine that you'd get somewhat angry, tellin them that isn't what drawing is about, that is just learning some basic shapes and strokes, and repeating them over and over again, following a pattern like a robot! No, if they want to learn drawing, they should start by watching the world around them, note how light and shadows move, make sketches, thousands of sketches, practice, imagine, dream and practice over and over, not trying to copy those \"hack artists!\"\n\nBecause that is what leetcode and the rest is - it isn't about programming, it is about knowing and memorizing patterns for solutions to specific problems. There isn't even any problem solving involved - surely, you might be able to \"invent\" an algorithm that solves that particular problem, but that isn't what most people do, they just know of the correct algorithm to apply. And the only way of knowing, it to have been exposed to a large number of algorithms, and remembering (or being good at looking them up). Something an AI like ChatGPT is extremely good at - but still, it isn't really programming, just like drawing a \"remembered shape\" isn't really drawing.\n\n  \nIf that is still your goal, then you simply need to learn all the algorithms and remember them - it is boring stuff, and absolutely useless, but it can be done, and is done by a lot of over-eager students around the world. Just go through every article in this list: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Data\\_structures\\_and\\_algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Data_structures_and_algorithms) \\- read and implement every one - then you'll quickly see that most leetcode problems is similar to one of those.\n\nIf however you would like to learn to program, and actually solve real problems, then look at your program like you would look at creating a piece of art. Imagine the finished piece in your mind, begin with the rough sketches, implement some ideas, research parts you need to know more about, and gradually work your way towards the goal. That is what programming is supposed to be - not guessing at which algorithm some writer were thinking of when they designed the problem!",

I think this is the way to go to learn what I am looking for. \n\nIndeed it feels like leetcode is way above what I can do right now. At least you confirming this I don’t feel that stupid. \nIs difficult to find answers. People that code well appear to have some magic skills but in the end you just have to follow some structured path. \n\nWill check also those links of previous threads.  \n\nBest.",

Music feels closer to code though.  Music has some clear path of what you have to learn before being able to play what you want.  \n\nAs I mentioned on the answer above, up until now coding felt like, “once you learn the language you’ll be able to code” which is far from the truth. I didn’t know where to look for answers.  \n\nNow I know that I have to study data structures to be able to understand how to solve logic coding problems. Compared to music would be learning harmony.  \n\nAgree that chat GPT is almost cheating.  But so far I didn’t know how to find answers.  Although I should tell you if you use gpt as a teacher you can learn a lot. \n\nThanks 🙏",

That was just one relatively small disastrous file in a much larger dumpster fire of a C#/.Net project we're trying to refactor into sanity.  Anyway...\n\nThere are techniques to make AI extremely effective at working with even the largest code bases, but that requires putting in time and effort to learn how to use it effectively just like any tool.  It isn't magic and you can't force feed it your dumpster fire legacy code base any more than you can force feed it to the new guy.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with AI is as much as it can massively increase the effectiveness of well seasoned engineers...it just as much magnifies the failings of junior and weak forever-mid engineers.  That's an industry problem, because we aren't going to turn the current junior engineers into tomorrows well seasoned engineers through the use of AI.

The majority of early career devs I've seen have def degraded in skill and understanding over the years regardless if they're bootcamp, new grad, or \"self taught\".\n\nI'll ask questions about projects on their resume, not even technical assessments, just a discussion on their experience in a no-stakes setting, and they can't talk about it without wanting to pull up search or AI.\n\nSometimes it's because they used AI and just accepted/copied what was given. Other times it seems it's because it's in their muscle memory: they get a question and, instead of listening to understand, they're listening to engineer a prompt. Instead of pulling from their pool of knowledge, they reach for the laptop. It can take 10-30 minutes to get the person into a frame of mind where they can remember and talk about their experiences instead of trying to give the \"right\" answer. At this point I'm thinking I need to make a meetup to help early career folks think like an engineer instead of a student. \n\nFwiw I've helped engineers from self taught to \"elite school\" grads, early career to sr staff (but haven't interviewed in a while). I'm involved in my local community and talk with other engineers about their new hires. I've only got my anecdata to go on but it's a significantly more informative pool than what most people get exposed to.",

        "body": "This is not a forever problem; this is the inevitable outcome of a field that was in a hiring bubble during the past decade & during covid and which is in the continued process of a correction. People are really starting to grasp the reality that CS is different now, and this realization will only get more apparent as time goes on. Since most high school students who enrolled in CS during the last several years did so for the money, it's pretty obvious that most incoming high school students who possibly would have done so before are now going to pick something else by and large. Hence, we will likely begin to see enrollment decrease year by year, not least because of the upcoming enrollment cliff. Of course, there will still be high achievers, along with low achievers who are too naive to understand that CS has fundamentally changed. But I think that the middle achievers will be largely hollowed out such that in the end, it will become crystal clear who is worth hiring and who isn't worth hiring; and thus, the problem of resumes looking identical will go away, because now the quality distribution for new grads will be more bimodal and less uniform.\n\nAlso, even though I agree with you that offshoring is a real thing, the way you have characterized offshoring is kind of strange and seems to contradict your views on new grads. Talent didn't just suddenly 'grow' abroad;  apart from recently incoming juniors with potential, any people who were talented would have been talented before and it's not like they magically became talented during Covid. On top of that, it's not like talent grows on trees, as you can't just train anyone at all to become talented since there are certain untrainable innate characteristics which make people talented such as high IQ, innovative creativity, visuo-spatial capabilities and so forth. If that weren't the case, then surely all of the new grads could be \"grown\" by domestic companies hiring in-house, just like offshore employees are being \"grown\" by satellite offices. But like you said yourself, the median talent of new grads has deteriorated significantly and by now, they can't even do easy-medium leetcode problems and are essentially unfit for this field, as you also said. So this goes against your other idea that people can be made fit for this field. And as an aside, let's not pretend that talent doesn't vary by location. You're telling me that different countries which have all have extremely varied PISA scores in math, reading and science have the same amount of talent density? Please.",

I know jobs go away, it's been internalized from a young age when I saw my grandfather use CAD at home, and he explained to me he started as a draftsman. \n\nInstead, engineering is a good job for people who like to build things. You can raise a family on the salary, and I still believe that's true. There are benefits, but there's also a good deal of instability in the whole thing.\n\nWhat's really helped me make career in software, is approaching the field like it's a lifelong academic pursuit, and inoculating myself to the stress of layoffs and instability by spending my early career in academia and start ups. I like building things, but I really love learning things.  \n  \nThe other perspective, is that the stuff you deride, KPIs, performance reviews, corporate culture, insanity of enterprise from the ground level, it's all worthy of gripes, but it goes a lot easier if you embrace your role and focus exclusively on what you can control.\n\nIdk, I'm sorry to hear you are realizing all of this at once.

Did you explicitly select a message like \"*Merge without waiting for requirements to be met (bypass rules)*\"?\n\nYou can remediate this mistake by proposing a solution to prevent this happening again. Namely:\n\n1. no direct commits to main\n2. always need an approval review to merge branch\n3. if your mistake could have been caught by an automated check like unit tests, improve your CI\n\nHonestly that's on the devops guy, he's paid to prevent mistakes like these.",

I bitched out a Comcast representative one night in the car because I couldn't make a call during a normal time. Everyone in that company was super on edge. One guy legit committed suicide years later and that role was really the start of the unraveling.\n\nAll that being said, it took me about 2.5 years to get over the trauma of that job.",

If you're getting a lot of inbound interest that means the signal you're receiving is the market wants people like you.\n\nIf you're not getting that interest my advice is to try something different. Do some stuff on LinkedIn to raise your profile, maybe take a look at some JDs of the kinds of roles you're looking for and ask whether your resume accurately shows how good you would be at those jobs, or if it's missing information that could help you.\n\nI asked ChatGPT about this and, obviously take this with a grain of salt since it's a robot, but it suggested to me that the niche that good senior engineers are in is like \"person who can run projects\", people with lots of years of experience just pushin' code and gettin' paid don't get as much inbound since they're really only staff level on paper.\n\nNot sure what nugrads can do tho, it seems like the market is just awful for them.",

All these free and low-cost tools your employer is using to save money? Now is the time to capitalize on those because the cost model for AI is completely unsustainable and the bubble will burst. When that happens, all those cheap tools will get more expensive, free options will either go away or become so limited that they won't be practical for anything but casual use, and the enshittification of AI will truly kick into gear.\n\nEnjoy the tools now while you still have them. Don't worry about the future: it *looks* like your boss can replace you with an AI and save money (and some may truly believe that), but that's never been true, and it won't be long before that is painfully obvious to everyone.",

Also, there are times personal life or other factors may be impacting your work.\n\nI joined a high-performing team, but my personality is pretty laid back. There was always someone more familiar with the code (they wrote it). It wasn’t until they all moved to other projects, and I was given an opportunity that I got a lot better. I was more responsible for success or failure. When I had originally joined the team, I spent more time reading about World of Warcraft than improving myself. So, you can definitely become a stronger developer, but you have to make the effort. \n\nI do believe there are those with more innate talent, but there are plenty of cases of people wasting opportunities. \n\nAlso, take what some of these people say with a grain of salt. Some of them are preoccupied with building their branding and misrepresent a lot of stuff. Be wary whenever money, fame, and recognition are involved.

I'm able to navigate through these interviews - but its just another candidate with theoretically a similar skillset, that gets to the offer. It's ME that needs to be better. \n\nI absolutely cannot imagine starting from scratch in a new area of work. I have twins, 3.5 y/o now. My finances are wrecked. But this is the kind of job and level role that can pay me what I believe I'm worth, so I can eventually dig myself out of that hole. I did a lot of work over that 15ish yrs; I'll be damned if I cant make sense of working through an algo.\n\nAnd so, this is just my situation, I don't know the exact details of yours, but 17 YOE is hard to give up.",

Those can be pretty demanding, and it’s more of a people management role than a CS-related role. AI is just a tool to help get the job done, similar to Google Sheets. It’s not the focus of the role, even if it’s advertised as “AI enablement” (though I’m open to being corrected)",

I remember that at one seminar we were given a list of 30 ideas for projects, with no requirements at all, things like:\n\n* \"4-way chess game\"\n* \"Musical composer\"\n* \"File browser and manager\"\n* etc.\n\nand it was up to us to come up with our own requirements and build something. Some of these projects were group work too, so that made it easier as you had other peers to brainstorm with.\n\nThat said, I wouldn't worry too much. Job interviews for juniors don't usually have you build a whole project from scratch, and when you join a company you will be supervised and given a lot of structure. I would suggest joining a more established company rather than an early startup, because they would offer the structure, the product and technical requirements, and you will be given ample support and guidance (ideally).\n\nAt the interview for my first job they had me write a small function to determine whether a given string was a palindrome (i.e. a word that reads the same forwards and backwards, such as \"madam\" or \"racecar\").

Hiring good people  (with good skills and high ownership), b. Getting them excited about the domain and deepening their engagement in the company business by growing them, nurturing them to be a team player, finally, c. Weeding out the bad apples - hopefully fast.\n\nIn a long-term play, a few days, weeks, sometimes months of lean periods do pop up, and that’s the opportunity to clean house (reduce tech debt, refactor, cross-learn from other modules, do hackathons, and have fun, etc). And good bosses keep their own backlog of these things ready for these low periods.\n\nTech work is not as transactional as some other careers. The value generated by good engineers compounds with time as they improve their skills and understand the domain better. 'Keep them busy - no matter what'  attitude usually leads to a sub-optimal outcome.\n\nSo no, bosses don’t look for ways to cut their teams as soon as they run into a low patch.\n\nThis doesn’t apply to situations like contracting, a dying/loss-making company, bad performers, over-hiring (which happened right after COVID), and teams run by bad management/bosses.",

Don't bother finding out what they don't know, and let them know this say its okay to not know something. Don't let them flounder and meander if they obviously don't know, just move the conversation on. You only have a set amount of time to figure this person out.\n\n2. Let them show you what they do know and let them go into depth about it. If they have a project or past work experience this is a good place to start, ask them what they did, what decisions they made and if they might change those decisions in hindsight. \n\n3. Have prepared questions. This doesn't mean a script but you need to be able to move the conversation on if it gets stuck. Hopefully your company has good enough practices the topics for your interview are defined, but if they aren't you should know what skills/tech/aptitudes are important for your job since ideally you have them.\n\n4. You aren't trying to trick them, too many interviewers do this where they will ask a misleading question to see if the candidate just takes the bait. The problem is candidates are nervous and will always be hesitant to disagree with the interviewer. Keep questions straightforward and open ended. \n\n5. My most important advice especially if you are an early round interview, you aren't trying to find the number 1 candidate. You are trying to avoid the bottom 90 candidates. At the end of your interview (assuming your company has good hiring practices) you should be able to fill in these blanks about every candidate:\n\nI would/n't hire this person.\n\nIf we did hire them these are my concerns __________ .\n\nIf we did hire them here is where I think they would excel ________.",

Having rarely interviewed the perfect experience fit, I like to ask as much about their work as their familiarity with our tools to gauge how thoughtful they are as a developer.  I think the equivalent of white boarding for UI work is asking to pseudo code a rudimentary application that paginates streams of data or an account creation client app.  If you aren't the sole interviewer, take note of what others are asking and try to overlap with the other interviewers are trying to pique.",

Not sure which clients are Revature ships out the trainees to anymore.\n\nRecently I was given part of a class action settlement with Revature.

Also having associates use their own equipment for training.\n\nOne of the craziest things I experienced was that we spent some time learning AWS.

Some companies don't spend any time getting on the same page on how to interview people, criteria, etc. They just assume devs will know how to interview people and throw them in there. There are also people who literally do not care. Having worked with some hiring teams, there are devs who care more about their work deliverables than interviews. It's possible the feedback you received is valid, it's also possible it's wrong. \n\nThat being said, I'm not sure you should be so sure you submitted what they were looking for. I worked at a place that intentionally left take-home assignments vague, because they wanted people to impress them. One person made a solution that technically did what was asked, and my assumption is they knew what they were doing, but the submission was so non-standard, we ended up rejecting them and wasting everyone's time. \n\nI think you just need to realize hiring is an imperfect process, and some company passing on you isn't necessarily an accurate assessment of your ability to do the work. You have to just forget those who passed on you and keep looking for a job that will fit. \n\nAlso, don't assume people are spending a lot of time doing a really personalized candidate tracking process. They probably just clicked a \"reject\" button in some candidate tracking software, and you got an automated message. I've worked with HR people who do less than the bare minimum contacting candidates. It's not a reflection on you.",

But it's unlikely to be one that ends in you getting promoted into a leadership role.\n\nFew organizations with any sense are going to \"gamble\" on that sort of transition. As a manager/staff+ person your ability to affect the organization increases significantly. That has as much potential to skyrocket the value you provide as it does for you to completely crater important initiatives and entire teams. Organizational leadership will want to see that you are capable before officially putting you into a role with more responsibility. In this case, your best option to move upwards is to find a new job and tell very convincing tales during interviews.\n\nYour manager is telling you: They think you have what it takes, and want you to show some initiative.\n\n> Obviously I want to continue getting raises, but I'm reaching that mid-high experience point where I become leadership or become a slacker.\n\nI can't speak for every org, but mine loves our \"super seniors\" -- ones who aren't quite staff+/management, and have no desire to be, and are happy to continue owning major feature-sets and mentoring newer engineers, and are happy to sit at the tippy-top of that Senior Engineer pay band in perpetuity. There's value in people who are exceptionally good at the \"chop wood, carry water\" work, and who have an inclination to do it. The top of our Senior Engineer pay band is still like 2x the median household income for the broader area we employ from, and we remain competitive with other employers in this area. Sure those salaries are less than a management/staff+ salary, but our Senior Engineers are very far from starving.\n\n> How have you all handled this transition?\n\nPersonally, I was doing all the \"leadership\" stuff before the thought of moving into management had ever occurred to me. As much was reflected in an offer I received to be a staff+ member of a big-name DevOps/SRE consultancy. This offer came roughly at the same time I was offered a management role with my current organization. I stuck around to feel the \"people management\" stuff out a bit, enjoyed it plenty, and did that for ~5 years before moving more into a product focused role.",

For example, if there is a gap in documentation for a process, and everyone is always coming to you for help, write up an SOP and publish it on the team wiki.\n\nFind ways to improve the workflow and improve morale on the team.  Listen to your coworkers and think about their pain points, then think of how you can design new workflows or mechanisms to address the team’s issues.  Take them to your manager and discuss them.

Record your interviews and play it like game footage to figure out the type of questions asked, weak points resume, and how you articulate yourself.\n\n5. Mock interview yourself with someone 1x week.bare minimum. Try to have them dig in your resume and go in depth extract down to mutiple layers of why you did x, value brought, trade offs, etc. Interviewer wants to understand your thought process and most people including me beyond surface level struggle to articulate mutiple layers deep unless they really know their shit.\n\n6. Aim for lower barrier entry gov, defense healthcare, retail, etc.\n\n7. If your resume is not getting hits, let say least a 4% ration. 100 apps least 4 interview. I would use online resource, friends, or pay services update resume.\n\n8. Star when answering questions interview.\n\n9. You should be sending out say least 15-20 apps every other day during work week imho.\n\n10. If you have any social skills or your kinda funny, try find some way to relate it could be as basic as small talk b4/after interview to even little banter if your confident enough. \n\n11. Always send thank you email after every interview and give or take 3-4 weeks no response fine send follow up.",

But I joined in high school and 3 weeks after graduation I was in boot camp because I had no plan for my life. It’s hard to explain but my advice, whatever it’s worth, is to keep your job and work your way up the economic ladder. Even if you went in as an officer, you’re losing 85-90% of your paycheck. If I were you, I would stay and keep working because the money you can and will make will provide the travel and fun experiences you desire. Sure they won’t be exactly the same as creating some relationships, however, not all relationships in the military are good. You will have corrupt seniors harm your promotions if you don’t play by their rules, you’ll go places and do jobs you absolutely hate doing. That’s why I say it’s better to be financially independent and choose what experiences you want rather than maybe experience them by chance. I never got the chance to go to Russia or Australia and those countries were the stuff of legends. But you can go there now where you’re already at. I feel like I keep saying the same thing differently, but I guess that’s my point. You don’t need to join the military to have experiences someone else got to have when you can make those experiences with the money and freedom you possess right now. If you want to feel like you’ve contributed to the welfare of the country then I would recommend you get hired at a tech company that fulfills that wish. Best wishes on your decision and your future young man.",

What one company considers a Junior SWE, another company might consider them a Senior SWE.\n\nMy new grad company for example tossed the \"Senior\" word at people after 2 YOE. Does that mean those people are suddenly Senior industry-wide? Obviously not. That was just that single company's title hierarchy.\n\nCompare that to the next company I joined, which wouldn't consider calling anybody \"Senior\" until at least 7-8 YOE.\n\nThe roles themselves can differ too. At some companies a Staff SWE is just a regular IC with a lot of experience, and churns out code on a single team like everyone else. At other companies, a Staff SWE is much closer to management than it is SWE. At other companies still, a Staff SWE serves as an architect role and is working across several dev teams providing technical leadership. So just because Company A called you a \"Staff SWE\", doesn't mean you meet the expectations of what Company B has for a Staff SWE.\n\nEvery company has their own hierarchy, with their own expecations. Downlevels, and *uplevels*, are just the company mapping you onto their hierarchy.",

That's just what it takes to make senior.\n\nit's not really about YOE (at least not for my job), but about the roles you've played on teams , your responsibility, and track record of technical execution. For instance, I was at a scale up database startup, filled with ex-Meta engineers, but I was still rejected at one big tech company over: \"lack of technical leadership for long term projects\".  I was a tech lead, but I just hadn't lead a team on a project that lasted long enough.

These companies are huge with around 100k employees so it’s impossible to have widespread cultural changes quickly). \n\nBaked into the agile process is the decoupling from requirements driving code and moving towards user stories. By the book agile means that every user story has an acceptance criteria which resembles a unit test. This means teams (again, not everywhere but it is slowly propagating as a culture) perform test driven development where they inherently do red-green-refactor. \n\nBuilt in the development process, devs usually are presented a failing TDD/BDD style acceptance criteria to get started (red), they write just enough code to pass the test (green), and they (refactor) the code with the safety of the tests performing safe operations from Fowler’s refactoring book that may use GoF patterns. Some teams have a senior engineer or software architect that write user stories or tests that explicitly force software into a particular architecture or forces a design pattern in order to be implementable. \n\nSo yes, we do refactor but it’s baked into the process. Code doesn’t break because it is common to have projects have a strict requirement for 80-100% test coverage. Unit testing is just one level.

The goal of refactoring is to make the system easier to extend, update, and understand.\n\nWhen you have a brittle system, actual feature changes are significantly more likely to break production.\n\nWhen you have a difficult to extend system, seemingly simple feature changes can take months (or years!) to complete, costing the company tons of money and time.\n\nWhen you have a difficult to understand system, your employees because a single point of failure. When one person leaves the company, now you have to find their replacement or else the project timeline gets delayed by several more months. But when the system itself is cryptic and difficult to understand/modify, it takes significantly more time to onboard a new employee, easily resulting in a year+ of lost productivity. That high onboard cost can often get teams into a situation where *all* their developers leave, and now you have a fresh team of people that don't understand the codebase. This is how \"black boxes\" get created, by not refactoring combined with turnover.\n\nAll this kinda plays into retention, which exacerbates everything. A complex, brittle, difficult to work with, system is *not* pleasant to work on. If management has no interest in letting the SWE's improve that system, then those SWE's won't be staying at that company for very long. High turnover introduces new developers, who are significantly more likely to break prod, while also having a very long and expensive onboarding process.\n\nSo yeah, in critical areas, you *need* to refactor. The costs of not doing it aren't always immediate, but it's significantly more dangerous than not refactoring at all. Any halfway competent engineering manager will be going to bat for their SWE's to refactor against product and upper management. This is the balance of a healthy SWE team. Product is pushing for features, upper management is pushing for results/money, engineering management is pushing for a stable/maintainable/extendable codebase. If either of those 3 prongs get an inordinate say, you're on a toxic team.\n\nThat said, there are very well defined approaches to refactoring a legacy codebase. Writing a massive PR with +10000/-12000 isn't the way to do it. That's a high risk PR whether it's a refactor or a new feature. Refactors can be done in small chunks, and done using common design patterns that reduce risk.",

You can get an employer to pay for it or if you’re lucky the school will pay for it (I had the school pay for both, and option 1 seems off the table for you considering your circumstances). \n\nA few things about a masters, it absolutely can help you get a job if you’re struggling to get one now. However, you need to have a complete mental shift if you decide to get a masters. A masters will be entirely worthless if you view it as just more school. You should treat it like a job which means you should take the hard classes intentionally, if you look for easy A’s you’re wasting your time and money. \n\nYou should also get involved in graduate research (this is also how you might be able to get the school to pay for your degree + a monthly stipend). Doing research is free experience that can help you land an internship and/or a job. Talking about my graduate research during an interview is probably how I got my first job. \n\nThis means you need to go to a graduate school that is a notable research institution. Also note that Trump has gutted NSF funding so some PhD programs are not even fully sponsored now and they will certainly get sponsorship priority over a grad student. \n\nI can answer more questions if you have any but if you wasted your undergrad you’re probably going to have a hard time getting into a worthwhile graduate program and even harder time getting it paid for. You might be able to reach out to an old professor and offer free research labor and maybe work your way into getting them to sponsor you eventually or at least see if you have what it takes to do a masters while getting at least something resembling real experience",

Juniors don't get jobs becuase they are useful and make the company money, they get jobs because we all know we need juniors to skill up to become the next generation of seniors. \n\nB) Build Build Build. Pick a specialty you like, and start building large projects with it using popular libraries so you can get a feel for how it all works together. Focus on using the framework and libraries that the industry commonly uses first, you want those names on your resume and cover letter. \n\n>but I feel like machine learning is too competitive now I am not really a top programmer material \n\nThe entire industry is competitive as hell, ML, like all CS, has roles for top talent hat make the **REALLY** big money, and roles for regular developers who are still learning or just want a stable job. When you look on social media, or listen to others, you're only hearing about the top developers, you don't hear about Jim who spends his days doing the grunt work that allows the top developers to have the time to do what they do. You don't need to be  genius to be a great developer, you just need to build and listen/learn from your colleagues every step of the way. And maybe in 10-15 years you'll be a top developer, or maybe you'll prefer work life balance and just be a regular developer like the vast majority of us are. \n\n>What are some directions I should chase? \n\nhttps://roadmap.sh/machine-learning\n\nLearn from those who came before and follow their path, or make your own path, but you'll have to learn the same basic things so following other people's paths is generally more efficient.\n\nAlso, as someone else mentioned, you will almost certainly need to learn leetcode questions. Don't panic they're easier than most people think. The easy level questions shoudln't be too hard, go through 20-30 of them to see what sorts of questions you'll be asked. But before moving to medium or hard, first learn DS/A. Data Structures and Algorithms is what Leetcode is there to test (not entirely, but basically). Most jobs will almost never need it, but really complex problems solved at scale (think Google Map's directions handling hundreds of millions of requests a minute) do, so Google started using these questions to test their recruits and the rest of the industry couldn't be bothered to make their own interviews, so now we all have to answer them. \n\nThis youtube channel has some great lessons on how DSA/Leetcode all works:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@mycodeschool\n\nThey don't cover every element of DSA but do cover the most common. Either watch a video, then go to neetcode.io and practice the questions related to that video, or get a question on neetcode.io, look at the answers, then go find the videos that cover the answers and watch the video and then learn how and why the answers work. Sorry if that's unclear, my point is don't sit and try to \"learn\" how to answer leetcode questiosn on your own, lots of them are not \"intuitive\" and you will only get annoyed. It's much simpler to understand the question, then find the answer soemone else already fine tuned and learn that. If you want to fix a car, you don't just go smashing on things and see what happens, you get the manual. For leetcode, DSA and neetcode.io togehter, are your manual. \n\nAnd no, you don't need to pay for neetcode.io for it to be incredibly useful, you get better organization if you pay, but it's all still very usable for free. Though I will say, its' a pretty useful site, so I did end up paying, but I actually got the lifetime membership after I got my job and had some money coming it. More of a \"thank you\" than anything else, plus I'll have it for my next job hunt, though hopefully leetcode questions will be fully gone by then, they're definitely starting to disappear which is nice.",

Feeling trapped between financial obligations, career dissatisfaction, and the loyalty you feel towards your team, especially with such significant projects on the horizon, must be incredibly isolating. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed when facing such critical decisions, particularly when they involve your health, your peace of mind, and your ability to start a family. When you're dealing with such frequent panic attacks and the daily drain of a job you dislike, it's natural for your brain to feel like it's in overdrive, making it hard to see a clear path forward. Prioritizing your mental health is never a sacrifice; it's an investment in every other aspect of your life, especially when you're considering bringing a child into the world. It might be helpful to explore different ways to manage the acute symptoms of anxiety, especially since your current medication situation is changing. Sometimes just having a toolkit of techniques can make a big difference in those overwhelming moments. There's a free [podcast](https://youtu.be/72ZhaR-aWNI) that covers common anxiety symptoms, coping strategies, breathing exercises, and techniques for controlling panic attacks, which you might find useful to listen to in your own time as you navigate these challenges. Thinking about your long-term health and happiness is really important here, not just for you but for your future family. God bless.",

Nobody would touch me without a degree. I went and got a degree circa 2017 and I can say unequivocally that college is not an educational institution, it's a licensing gauntlet. You're bouncing from ego to ego of the full time teaching staff that have never been in the private sector, but are charged in preparing you for it. I wrote essays on the \"Browser Wars,\" traced some algorithms, tried out some new programming languages, but NOTHING from college prepared me better for my fulltime career. \n\nI actually did a bootcamp for the time that I had my degree, yoe and still couldn't get interviews because my history was in legacy systems (COBOL + Mainframe). So everyone reading those COBOL developers are drowning in offers, just know that's a very hurtful clickbait lol. But the bootcamp gave me a full stack experience that tripled anything of value from college, since we used a template of Flask. That bootcamp gave me 90% of my modern view of development work. I started working personal projects until I got hired to do API work.   \n  \nThere's nothing of any value from my undergrad degree. I answer these because I'm a contrast for some of your worldview. I experienced it in the weird oddball way that OP highlighted. I broke into the career, then got my degree, then continued my career. Calc 2 and 3 didn't make me a better developer, it made me better at test taking and studying. Data Structures and Algorithms were already known, but I didn't know what was available in modern and other languages from COBOL. I was working in procedural languages, so I got an OOP lesson, which was neat, and I probably had the best OOP professor who added in how he uses it practically which is what many of my classes taught by academics were missing. My electives were taught by academics and did not help me apply much of my core studies. A bioninformatics class had given me hope, but the teacher just read from the book and power points and we had a 3-4 week intro to what bioinformatics is and the tools used before getting our hands on anything. My DevOps class opened where the professor asked us \"What is DevOps,\" and started taking notes and building that syllabus on the first day. We didn't touch git until our software engineering final group project and most of the class couldn't figure it out.  \n  \nI solemnly promise that I did not need to get a bachelor's degree and am now Senior level in my shop. The classes were full of old material taught identically for over a decade. The math just simply didn't coincide with computer science lessons, like I've heard some have. It was hard, It was messy. But luckily I experienced that prior to learning how to code for the military and already had a prideful ego. I think everyone needs to get discipline and experience hard/dark times to really push themselves. But academically at a mid-tier state school, I did not become better for it.",

The first is to find a job at a company that has a relaxed WLB. That's hard to do on command, at any company, in any role. Historically the best option has been government work, which right now is more volatile than it has been in the past. When I've seen this work out for people in the private sector, the situation is usually that they got hired into a \"boring\" company that doesn't pay particularly well, and they stayed long enough that they're performing well and worth more in the market vs. their current job so therefore they have the leverage to push for a great WLB. This isn't your situation. So if you can find a company like this, great! But I wouldn't bet the house on it.\n\nOption two is to accept that you're going to end up working longer hours than you want to for a while. I don't think it actually matters whether you stay in software or pivot to sales, PM, solutions engineering, or recruiting (which are the most common pivot options). Those may be more people oriented and may be a better fit if that's what you want in a job, but you aren't necessarily more likely to stay employed, or have an easier time finding work. This is kind of the time where leaning on family for help with the kid is going to make a big difference.\n\nOption three is to take a few years off until the kid is in school.",

You cannot know what abstractions you'll possibly need before the software is being used in the real world and you run into edge cases/new feature requests.\n* Keep the conversation grounded - ask for practical examples. What would happen if we didn't do this? Would we experience pain when working with this code? Would it be easier or harder to make a mistake/bug?\n* KISS - keep it simple, stupid. Onboarding new devs is going to be more difficult the more abstractions you add. Then maintenance becomes an issue. Then mistakes are made because the new guy doesn't understand the code.

Just like any other sort of writing. \n\nThere are of course some general principles that tend to make things better, and it is certainly possible to make *horribly unclear* code, but past a certain point a lot of it really is a matter of taste.\n\nSo essentially a person who has strong opinions about specific details of how code should be written is similar to a person who thinks their preferred genre of music is superior to others, or otherwise thinks their taste is superior -- they are wrong, but it's going to be very difficult to convince them of that, and the more persuasive you are the more they will probably dig in and get pissed at you.\n\nSo you'll need to decide which things *you* care about and which things you don't. \n\nIf you don't actually care about something, just go along with what they want and smile and nod anytime they try to justify it, content that they're trying to justify it to themselves as much as to you.\n\nIf you do care, really think again about whether you actually do care. Lots of people don't actually care about things they fight for but rather let ego get tied up in it and are instead fighting over ego. Try to avoid that if possible. So really think about whether you genuinely do care.\n\nAnd if you genuinely do, try to act in good faith. Explain what you think, then invite them to explain what they think and walk you through their thought process and be genuinely open to it. They might actually have good reasons, and so *you* should be open to changing *your* mind. But inviting them to explain will both make them feel like they are valued (which is important to them if they have strong opinions about how the code should be written) and also let them talk themselves out of ideas that are bad (like, if you explain a good idea and ask them to explain theirs, they will have a hard time denying yours is better if they actually have to explain it, and because it is them talking it through and deciding they will be more likely to compromise than if you order them to).\n\nInviting them to explain also gets both of you on the same side -- rather than arguing you are instead both looking at the same problem and talking about it as a thing separate from yourselves. And that change in perspective is helpful -- it makes them feel less like *they* are being devalued if their ideas aren't used.\n\nIn my experience, most workers do ultimately want to get along and do good stuff, and if you can diffuse their defense mechanisms and avoid getting defensive yourself you can usually find a common ground.\n\nBut if a person truly is an asshole and can't be reasoned with and truly is my way or the high way, and you really do care about the thing they're digging in on, your best bet is probably to try to go around them. Build support for others / get others to validate your view. After all, if the person is an asshole to you then they have probably been an asshole to others as well, and so you probably will find support. Try to avoid getting ego involved, as that will only make it harder and also pull you into petty drama.",

But ofc you could say I use patterns.\n\nDI is a pattern and I pray people are at least using that for testability purposes.\n\nI mostly tend to refactor into patterns that emerge from the first pass of implementation. I think if you're starting with a design pattern, and working backwards, that's really backwards. Sometimes with enough experience you short-circuit the logic though. For example, I'm a big fan of step builder pattern in the main language I use ( Rust ). Why? It's pretty ergonomic and it makes it so invalidly using the API is a compiler error rather than a runtime error. So whenever I have a highly customized struct or state machine, I tend to lean towards step builder off of prior experience. But I also don't just roam the codebase with patterns in my hand ready to force them anywhere.",

So, its probably quite uncommon that most people aren't using design patterns in some capacity.\n\nThat being said, I think design patterns are a thing you should be able to understand and reason about but I actually think they are overused and can be harmful, hot take incoming and I'm sure I'm gunna get downvoted into oblivion.\n\nThe problem is design patterns draw your focus away from the problem you are solving and make you focus on the organization of the code itself. Nothing about design patterns makes you're code A) correct or B) performant, and most the time you end up taking what was a really simple problem and making it wayyyyy over engineered and over abstracted.\n\n  \nThe worst is when people go to build out something and they start with a design pattern in mind that they want to use and the first implementation is driven by that pattern, rather than the actual problem that needs to get solved. Outside of stuff prescribed by a frameworks, starting with a pattern is a terrible idea, you have no idea what functioning code will look like and even worse, you have no idea if a pattern is even necessary for what you are trying to accomplish. \n\nDepending on what patterns you are even using, you may actually be affecting the compilers ability to optimize the instruction set because it can't reason about the amount of misdirection you have introduced into the code.\n\nI'm not saying there is never a use case for design patterns, but more often than not, if you just keep it simple and straight forward, your life will be easier. At a minimum, get the thing working and see if a pattern can be applied, never start with design patterns.",

I also have high profile references.\n\nThere's two ways to look at this:\n\n1) Your interview went generally well but the company could not pay you the salary you wanted or maybe they filled headcount and decided to move with another candidate.\n\n2) It did not go as well as you think. Take time to reflect on the answers to questions AND how you came across as. I've been in interview debriefs where we had a technically great candidate, but the person's soft skills were awful. In my interview, I was constantly interrupted, told me I was wrong, told me that they didn't care about getting the job because their current job was better, etc. The conclusion was \"this person is technically smart, but I wouldn't want to work with this person\" and so we passed on the candidate.\n\nIf you're working for 7+ years then you have more than enough opportunities to show why you're a senior dev. Talk about projects you led, mentorship opportunities, etc. Be kind. Literally be someone you would want to work with.",

My last company did a reverse-version of this for every manager role. “Promote the internal person, with 5+ yoe, already doing the managerial work, to the role? Nah let’s hire some random external person because they already have manager in their title… then we get the internal to train them for 6+ months”.",

Otherwise, the barrier is high: I have a good thing going.\n\nOne pro-tip: make sure you understand the team switching process. At my company, your current management chain is notified, so if you start the process, make sure there's a spot for you.\n\nAs for what to say to management, you could say nothing, but I'd just give them the truth: you're thankful for the opportunity, their support, but what will make you happy long term is to do MLOps. They might not like this right after investing in you for a promo, but it's hard to argue with that logic.",

AI has won 1 day out of about 10 now and it isn’t trending closer.\n\nIn math we talk about convergence and logarithmic returns and it does look like it’s jammed at around 70%-80% reliable on single tasks.\n\nI just don’t want you, OP, to stop studying what you enjoy because of the news and pro-AI articles. They are designed to hit CEO algorithms so they push it on their own businesses. My sis works for a robotics company and they started requiring engineers to use AI and it’s visibly hurting their productivity and output. Even a CEO who made their money in automation would be stupid and gullible to unleash an army of 80 IQ consultants. \n\nI encourage you to study, head first. I’m like you and I love solving problems, data visualization. I can say that my job satisfaction is enough to keep me coming into work on the darkest days. But I have been in the industry for 12-14 years and I’ve experienced constricting periods that they’ve blamed on other things.\n\nMy view from a mile above is that this will end by ChatGPT 7 which will be 4% better than ChatGPT 5. Nobody has proven that they’ve vibecoded something successfully and search engine speeds are slowing down as AI slop is really suffocating results. So I really think there will be a reckoning that an army of 80 IQ people can’t help with complex tasks. \n\nRight now the industry and the rest of the economy is constricting. The articles blame AI, but companies are even cutting their AI teams. %of code written by AI is dubious because it’s very easy to skew numbers as you see on posts discussing those articles. But this happened in 08, and 12, and 17 and each time they blame something and cut full teams like microservices and automation, the loss of investment capital, or the rise of H1B visa use.\n\nI think you’ll be fine as long as you are passionate about your projects and you remain curious. You might use AI to aid you, but I don’t see it advancing to the point where it can do the human part of that work.",
