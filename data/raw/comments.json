That was a bit of a red flag, especially since his resume said he graduated from a public university in Brazil (where it‚Äôs rare to have classes in anything other than Portuguese).\n\nHe turned his camera on for a second, then quickly turned it off saying his internet was unstable. My husband mentioned he seemed to be of Asian descent, but it was hard to say for sure. Weirdly enough, the guy still managed to answer some pretty tough Java questions and even spotted issues in code with no problem.\n\nA few days later, we randomly saw a video showing AI tech that can fake someone‚Äôs face during a video call ‚Äî the example showed a low-res, vaguely Asian-looking face... and it looked a lot like the guy from the interview. ü´†",

But there are a few points I don't entirely agree with.\n\nI also work for a company that is relatively reasonable in its tech stack. We only have a few TB of data for more than 10 years of operations and most of it runs on an on-prem setup using mostly open source tools. No cloud bloat or any of that.\n\n> There‚Äôs a tool for ingestion. A tool for orchestration. A tool for transformation, reverse ETL, governance, monitoring and if you‚Äôre lucky, a tool for remembering why you started this project in the first place.\n\nI'm a big ELT proponent. Part of the ELT philosophy is that each part of your pipeline performs as few tasks as logically necessary.\n\nMy ingest/outgest scripts run in python and they *only* do ingest/outgest. They don't perform a single transformation unless they absolutely have to.\n\nI run my transformations with dbt.\n\nI schedule my jobs with Airflow. I don't really see how I would orchestrate my pipeline unless with an orchestrator (CRON would also do fine). Or does the author imply we should have an alarms set somewhere so we can manually run these singular scripts he seems to such a big fan of?\n\n> But here‚Äôs the secret the consultants won‚Äôt tell you:\n> Fewer moving parts means fewer bugs. Faster answers. A fighting chance that someone on your team actually understands what the hell is going on.\nOne script. One machine. One person who can debug it without a PhD in vendor certifications.\n\nI have seen these 'One script. One machine. One person.' solutions he's talking about. I've made a bit of a career out of refactoring them. Often that 'One person' fucked off some place else and now no one understands this one script that is taking 40 minutes to run every 30 minutes.\n\nThese one scripts typically had hundreds of moving parts that seemed to perform tasks with varying degrees of usefulness and efficiency. Except it's almost impossible to figure out what part does what since it's all thrown together.\n\nIf you One Script performs ingest/outgest and transform at the same time, good luck debugging your hot mess. If something goes wrong you've now got hundreds of lines of code to comb through to find the offending part.\n\nWhen something goes wrong in my stack, debugging is easy as hell.\n\nDoes the problem happen between the source and my RAW schema? Well, just look in the ingestion scripts. Is it between RAW and the final data set? Check the dbt queries. Is it between the final data set and the consumer? Check the outgest scripts.\n\nWhen each moving part performs a single, clearly defined task, debugging is a lot easier.\n\nYes, it is true in engineering that fewer moving parts typically means a less complex system, trying to cram as many functionalities in as few moving parts as possible is also not the best idea in general.\n\nImagine building a house and having your water and your electricity lines all using the same pipes in the wall/floor. Sure, you've got to install fewer pipes, but good luck when one of your water lines has a leak.",

These are not being migrated away from spark, but are being tuned a bit as we move them to ingest from redshift instead of hive. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm going to say that length of runtime when reading from hive to generate an extract is not directly related to decision to keep in spark or migrate out. Some of our jobs run for a very long time in spark due to the hive partition not being ideal. These will run very quickly in redshift because our distkey is much better for the type of pulls we need. It really is about amount of data required to be manipulated once in spark and how complex that will be.",

That'll make a significant cost decrease. \n* Dont stack tables on top of each other in layers if you dont really need to. e.g if your table is almost 1:1 from your staging to your gold layer make bronze and silver views then gold a table -- Conversely if some of your long running queries have a lot of joins on heavy views then make those incremental tables \n* Last one - heavy filters on CTEs where possible",

New teams get their standard setup, databases/whs/roles and some pipeline to deploy stuff. When other teams want access to some data of another team, we have request forms that ask for approval (email) from the data owner, and upon approval automatically assigns the appropriate roles. \n\nBoth the platform managed and data owner managed are also stored in Snowflake as metadata.

If you want a portfolio project for data engineering jobs, spin up a tiny Kubernetes or Ray cluster on something like AWS Spot nodes. Even a three-node run shows you can handle cloud orchestration.\n\nStreaming ingestion can be worth it if your target is ‚Äúnear real time‚Äù dashboards for devs watching new reviews flow in. Stick Kafka or Redpanda in front, keep micro-batches small, and output rolling aggregates to a cache. Transformer summarization can handle chunks of, say, 128 reviews at a time without killing latency.\n\nwith Dask on multiple nodes, workers sometimes drop off during long GPU jobs. Enable heartbeat checks and auto-retries.\n\nGood luck.",

The worker distribution helps with the cost as instead of a sequential run which took me 30 minutes to process a single file which contains 200k reviews, the current implementation takes 2 minutes to do the same. and the application is session based and does not run the whole time. I still have a few optimizations to do.\n\n  \nstreaming ingestion, though i mentioned it in the post, does not make sense right now because the steam reviews need to be extracted from their web API, since the application summarized millions of reviews, it would have to redo the whole process for the previous reviews as well as the new reviews which just came in.

If there's a constant... It's that healthcare data is an entirely different ball of wax than you're used to working with everywhere else. \n\nNot only are the structures weird and deeply nested but the context of the data can be hard to grasp for some. Also, security is a big factor you have to understand. For example no offshore employee can even get a sniff of production Medicaid or Medicare data or you're violating the law. That's a federal law. Some onshore people can't ever look at federal employee plan data for certain situations. \n\nNot only that but the amount of vendors and integrations that have all these mind numbing weird schema layouts that don't at all conform to a standard like FHIR makes everyone's life hell in this space.\n\nUnderstanding the complexity of healthcare plan info like the relationship of a member to the group to the plan(s) to the product(s) can get a little out of hand. Then you have a claims where you need a 45 day runout because a single healthcare claim line can change a ton of times before it's actually approved or rejected but you have to capture everyone of those steps along the way. \n\nThen you always have to be prepared and ready for an audit by either someone internally in your org or someone from the government so your documentation and processes need to be on point.\n\nThe reason why we need people with experience in healthcare data is because it's very hard to ramp up people with 0 experience. When I bring on juniors to my team I don't expect them to \"get the data\" for like 24 to 36 months and even then you are always learning new parts or domains of healthcare data and probably still don't understand all the nuances around the data. \n\nIt's just easier to bring someone in that would have at least a clue about what a care plan resource in FHIR format looks like, how to load it, and how to extract from it.\n\nThe true gatekeeper is really the rules, regs, complexity and lack of enforced standardized format amongst all healthcare companies whether that be health plans, pbm's, provider groups, client groups, hospital groups, these middleware companies that claim to give you robust integrations... It's all a pile of steaming shit and we are the plumbers to keep it moving.",

No more 3am pipeline debugging sessions.\n\nThree years ago our data team was drowning. Beautiful medallion architecture (bronze ‚Üí silver ‚Üí gold) that looked great in slides but was a nightmare to maintain. Every layer had schema changes, quality issues, debugging headaches. We spent more time figuring out which layer broke than building features.\n\nBreaking point: a simple schema change cascaded through 7 tables and killed reporting for two days. That's when we rebuilt everything around FITT principles.\n\nThe four FITT principles:\n\n1. Functional - Pure functions only. Same input = same output, always. Made everything immutable by default. Storage is cheap, debugging corrupt state at 2am isn't.\n\n2. Idempotent - Run it 1000 times, same result. Recovery = just re-run it. Junior devs actually experiment now instead of being terrified.\n\n3. Tested - Tests as architectural components. Every pipeline has data quality, business logic, and integration tests. They're living documentation.\n\n4. Two-stage - Raw ‚Üí Final, that's it. Raw data stays immutable forever. Final data ready for consumption. Everything in between is ephemeral.\n\nWe ditched bronze/silver/gold entirely. Those layers were just arbitrary complexity.\n\nKey implementation patterns:\n\n\n\nDev/Prod split: Dev uses yesterday's data + today's code. Prod uses today's data + yesterday's code. Never deploy untested.\n\nGit as truth: Want results from 6 months ago? Check out that commit and re-run against raw data.\n\nIncremental processing: Each increment is idempotent. Run once or 50 times, same result.\n\n\n\nResults after:\n\n\n\nOn-call incidents dropped %\n\nNew hires productive in weeks, not months\n\nData quality issues caught in dev, not prod\n\nNo more mysterious data drift\n\n\n\nCommon pushback:\n\n\"Storage costs!\" - Compute is cheaper than engineering time.\n\n\"Performance?\" - Less debugging = more optimization time.\n\n\"Over-engineering?\" - Worth it if you have 3+ people on pipelines.\n\nGetting started:\n\n\n\nPick one pipeline that breaks a lot\n\nMake raw data immutable\n\nAdd comprehensive tests\n\nEliminate staging layers\n\nMake it idempotent\n\n\n\nFITT made data engineering boring again (in the best way).

No need to overthink about patterns.\n\n> will each table of each datasource have its own set of functions or classes or whatever?\n\nNot sure what you are talking about. If you ask the self-glorious Analytic DEs (like me) who bath in the thought that we care oh so much about business logic (see my previous post), they just write queries for each table. We use DBT so every table is a \"model\", a glorified SELECT query with a bunch of configs. If you are interested you can probably create your weak version of DBT if your company doesn't use it.\n\n> how to manage the metadata of a table ( column names, types etc) that is tightly coupled to the code?\n\nEh, different teams treat it differently. Some teams use...Excel sheets. Some tools such as DBT addresses the issue. But whatever the tool is, it needs humans to feed in information. Automated tools exist too I think, but it's just a ticking bomb if humans don't check from time to time.",

        "body": "Here's some general suggestions:\n\n1: Care more about what your file/module look like than about whether you use classes in the right way or follow code patterns. Avoid large interconnected codebases, have clear interfaces and responsibility splits with other teams. Your main measure of maintainability should be whether you can easily transfer ownership of your code to another team with little context.\n\n2: Simple imperative code in pipelines is perfect for most usecases. Be explicit and avoid magic. [Push for loops down and ifs up](https://matklad.github.io/2023/11/15/push-ifs-up-and-fors-down.html) to make it at least possible to optimize code later and be very careful about functions that can't operate on batches. If you use streaming iterators, use your languages equivalent of chunked and call batch functions on chunks, don't call single element functions in an iterator.\n\n3: Understand the difference between struct of arrays and array of struct (aka row based vs column based), be aware of which of the two applies to the data formats you use and process things in their natural order. This combines nicely with chunking.\n\n4: If you use python, use ruff and uv, declare dependencies clearly in pyproject.toml, and use type hints on anything public. Prefer simple functions over classes, take protocol classes as input and spit out concrete data structures as output. Use asserts often, especially if something might need a comment.\n\n5: Make your data partitionable if possible. If you use a database, there should be a clear way to split it into (for example) ten smaller DBs with the same layout, and only need to copy small tables. Try to identify or create natural keys that are shared over the entire data pipeline that can be used to neatly split data without overlap. If you can't do this, you have most likely made things too complex and your data should probably be flattened.",

It's important to understand that there's no direct value passing between task-decorated functions in Airflow (xcom is used for that).

It'll save you time when you decide to scale Airflow workers. E.g. use shared object storage or database to exchange the data between tasks. \n\nMake tasks granular enough for ease of retry and debugging.\n\nUse idempotency for complex data pipelines to its fullest.

Use airflow for orchestrating not for data processing, while that is not a hard and fast rule, I see a lot of failures when workers run out of memory because their pandas ingested too much data. Worst part of that is, you loose all your logs, so it‚Äôs hard to work out what went wrong.  What to do? Track the size of data you are processing and compare them to the memory you have. If you see a trend that tells you you are headed for OOM situations, export the data processing function into a serverless option, be it a k8s pod or any other option.\n2. When you download files to a worker, make sure you clean it up reliably, to avoid running out of disk space eventually. Use the tempfiles module appropriately.\n3. Avoid large xcoms. It stresses the meta data db and impacts overall processing. If you have large data to pass between tasks, consider using external storage.\n4. Avoid dags that run more frequently than once every 10 minutes. The round robin nature of the scheduler means for a non trivial setup can exceed  several minutes and you may not be able to keep up.  \n5. Avoid dags that watch for file changes and do that every few minutes (as above). See if you can have an external file watcher trigger the day instead. Alternatively space it so it checks every 30 minutes.\n6. Review the day code for expensive functions at module level. The dag gets executed every few minutes and everything at module level gets run every few minutes. So variable.get uses your database, why stress it with hundreds and thousands of such calls. Move these into your python functions.\n7. Use logging but use it judiciously, your logs can end up in your metadata base, or at least in your file system. \n8. Monitor and manage the size of your metadata base. If it‚Äôs too big you can‚Äôt run snapshots/backups.",

It‚Äôs columnar, optimized for scan-heavy queries, and handles large joins better. At 2.8TB and growing, Postgres will get painful for historical analysis.\n\n\\-Syncing data into Redshift with 5-10 min lag is fine using CDC, we have multiple customers doing that at terabyte scale and we are consistently getting <5 min latency even after taking into account the time to run Merges.\n\n**Is it important for data to get into the \"warehouse\" quickly and it's ok for analytical queries to be slower?** \n\n\\-If this is the case, CDC to get data into Postgres will be faster (seconds, instead of <5 mins). But the tradeoff is analytical queries will take much longer to run on Postgres vs Redshift. \n\n**As for your questions:** \n\n1. Depending on the use case downstream, you might want to think about fanning in from many single tenant DBs and writing into large multi-tenant table. Separately you could do a 1 to 1 sync and then use dbt to transform and combine the tables. Our CDC pipeline ([Artie](https://www.artie.com/?utm_source=reddit)) can either fan-in in-flight or do 1:1 syncs, so we've done both. \n\n2. Postgres vs S3: very diff roles. When you land in S3 in parquet files, you'll have to write the logic later to Merge delta files and recreate the current table view - that's overhead you need to consider. \n\n3. Redshift will be easier to manage long term IMO. You‚Äôll likely outgrow Postgres for analytics. Redshift can save you a future migration.\n\n4. DMS is great to start off, but at certain scale it becomes unreliable. We've observed that it starts causing problems with data consistency and latency when you start doing mid-to-high 100s of millions of rows a month. That's when we see a lot of DMS customers migrate over to Artie (disclaimer: I work there) for a CDC pipeline that they can trust to scale with them. \n\n5.

When you were using Aurora as the landing zone, did you use a workflow tool **(**dbt, Airflow, or Glue**)** to extract and transform the data before loading it into Redshift?\n2. Now that you're using S3 as the landing zone, how are you achieving near real-time delivery to Redshift? I'm aware that Redshift isn't ideal for frequent small inserts, so I'd love to hear how you're handling that part.",

Your Lambda just needs to make the query, then post the data to the firehose API.\n\nAn average of 1-2 requests per second isn't going to stress firehose.\n\nConfiguring firehose will let you choose how big you want your S3 write batches to be. You can make them more like every 15 minutes, or every 60 seconds. It is a tradeoff between object count and maximum latency to write to S3.\n\nIf you *need* to have the data in S3 within seconds, then Firehose isn't the tool for that. You would just be writing individual objects directly. I am struggling to think why you would need low latency S3 objects -- that's what Mongo would be for. S3 would generally be for your long term analytics or bulk data store, which is more latency tolerant.",

It would at least give you the contents of the archive. \n\nHow straightforward this is depends on how they've structured their app. Best case scenario, it's basically a REST API that serves HTML. Worst case, it's dynamic websocket hell. \n\nGetting that into your new CRM suite is, of course, a separate problem.",

We have a data eng team <3 And 50-60 downstream users. Not every user is directly querying but we support a lot of SFDC, Hubspot, Zendesk, any SAAS platform some team decides to use. We cannot keep up proper optimization of every single one of these platforms tables by setting the correct split and dist key it's just unrealistic (yes they have an automated version now last I heard it was in private preview but I don't expect it to be good)\n\nDatabricks automatically handles via liquid clustering and automated vacuuming.\n\nBecause of this your price per compute usage is so much lower on Databricks (probably other platforms as well). The queries run much quicker on the same priced clusters.\n\n - Severless yes redshift has Redshift serverless and it's fucking dog shit and you're paying a lot. Because it's so bad you're effectively still tied to paying for compute + data, which scaled horrendously for us.\n\nOther platforms allow spinning up and down compute much simpler than Redshift does imo -> more savings.\n\n- Because of the simplified compute system you can separate jobs much more easily so resources aren't fighting with each other during a heavy dev dbt run or fivetran sync. You can do this in Redshift by modifying the WLM but it's just a bitch and you can still run into problems, it's very much a trial and error process.\n\n- If you're working with any JSON in redshift I'm sorry.\n\n- We had some governance problems that were helped via the transition, but I don't think the problem was redshift specific.\n\n- Not totally relevant but we also had some ML/GenAI jobs we were wanting to use Databricks for so doubled up our use case.\n\n- Federated queries make a migration insane easy.\n\nCaveat databricks really can be just as pricey as redshift serverless if you leave it to auto scale and aren't particular with your compute sizings. \n\nDownside: a lot of SAAS platforms support Redshift integrations but don't typically build out much more than Snowflake, BQ. Any datalake solution you kindve get fucked on here.",

It may not happen immediately, but it does.  I've read countless stories from developers that lose their ability to not only think critically, but can't even remember basic syntax over time.  This isn't just happening to programmers.  This is happening to other fields as well.  The brain is a muscle and if you don't use it, you can't develop it.  Now, I'm not saying that its not a valuable tool.  It definitely is, but if you are a student or still in the process of learning, A.I. takes away the process of learning that develops your critical thinking skills and the repetition that you need to learn syntax when you are learning.  This is also why you take so many math classes.  Are you going to use Trigonometry or Calculus out in the real world?  Probably not, but that's not the point.  The point is that the process of doing it helps develop your critical thinking and analytical skills.  The same goes for programming\n\nI'm speaking from experience on this.  I'm a 3rd year CS student.  My first year I made the mistake in using A.I. in my Computer Science 1 class.  Its essentially the 1st class you take that teaches C++ and programming fundamentals like OOP, abstraction, and recursion.  Halfway through the class, once we started working on anything remotely more difficult than defining a function, I used A.I.  I didn't realize how much I didn't learn anything until I got to Computer Science 2 the following summer.  I couldn't write anything beyond basic console apps.  I turned off all A.I. including Intellisense, and went through my Computer Science 1 book and did all the projects from that class again.  I actually retained the information that time.\n\nI have seen so many posts about people who are on the last year of their CS degree, or even graduated, and they don't know how to code.  I don't know how this is even possible if you aren't just copying code for projects.  This summer I'm in Data Structures and Algorithm Design.  Last weeks project was to write algorithms for linear sort, merge sort, quick sort, and selection sort, and print to console the running time along with their Big O Notation to prove their runtime complexity.  I would love for someone to tell me how they did that if they don't know how to code.",

This is NOT what the IT field is like normally. What you're describing is a toxic workplace that's taking advantage of you.\n\n$4/hour is insulting even for outsourced work. No training, unrealistic expectations, being asked to train others when you're barely trained yourself? These are massive red flags.\n\nWe run Metana and we've trained hundreds of developers. The good news is that your interest in programming is still valid, you just landed in a terrible situation that would break anyone.\n\nHere's what I'd suggest:\n\n1. Start looking for other opportunities immediately. Don't let this place crush your spirit\n\n2. Use whatever time you have to build your fundamentals properly. The \"training\" you got sounds inadequate \n\n3. Document everything you're learning on your own. Build a portfolio\n\n4. Connect with other developers online, join communities where you can ask questions without judgment\n\nThe real tech industry has proper onboarding, mentorship, documentation, and pays way better. What you're experiencing is unfortunately common with some outsourcing companies but it's not representative of the field.\n\nAt Metana we actually have students from similar backgrounds who've gone on to great roles. If you want to chat with someone about mapping out a better path forward, happy to connect you with one of our career folks. Just want to help :)\n\nDon't let this experience kill your programming dreams. The field needs good people and you deserve way better than this exploitation.\n\nHang in there but definitely start planning your exit strategy.",

        "body": "People are often thrown into this class with only a vague notion of what a log in math is.  This is a bad starting point right off the bat.   Also, its VERY easy to get confused about WHAT YOU ARE COUNTING.  Bad books; you can't tell if they are counting the comparisons or the swaps in a sort algorithm.  Those numbers can be similar or very different.\n\nYou are in part telling me without telling me that you don't understand the NOTATION.  The concept aside, O(1) is notation for the simplest thing you can do: you do one operation (this can have several steps) and get the result.  Eg array\\[user\\_input\\] = 0;  you go there, you do something, you are done.  Sure, that is like 8 assembly instructions or something, but big-O is a conceptual level thing, not a detail level thing.  You wanted to know how many assignments, you did 1.\n\nO(N) is similar.  you iterate an array and add 5 to each element.  How many times did you add 5?  Well, you did it for whatever the size of the array is, but we didn't say...  that is abstracted to the letter \"N' which just means \"some amount of them\".   You write that one O(N), see how that works?\n\nlooping over every element with nested loops is a multiply.. for(1-n){for (1-n again)} .. how many times does the inner part happen?  Its N\\^2 .. the outer loop does n inner loops for 1, n inner loops for 2, ...  right?  And that is unsurprisingly written O(N\\^2).\n\nSo the notation is O (some expression of N).   some expression of N could be almost anything you might see in math, from N! to log(N) to N\\^3 to sqrt(N) or whatnot.  Big-O only keeps the dominant terms (eg 3n\\^3 + 11n\\^2 + 37) is just written O(n\\^3) ..  because in the big picture, the cubed term will soon dwarf the others and give you a general sense of how slow it will be.\n\n\\-------------------\n\na log is just an exponent, with its own math notation that is weird and a bunch of cool properties that you are told to memorize without being led to connect the dots, the first time you see them, and many people never get much past that part.   I mean, its stuff you know, though, if you can just see past the notation and look at the numbers.  0,1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128 ... you know these guys ... its the powers of 2.  How many times, using only integers, can you cut the number 100 in half?  Even rounding it up..  50 (once), 25(twice) 13(three times), 7(4), 4(5),2(6),1(7) and done.   Hmm.  2\\^7 is... 128.  Hmm.  See the connection?  The math problem is \"to what integer power do I raise 2 to get 100\".  The answer is 6 or 7 depending on if you want to over shoot or under shoot the target.   THAT IS A LOG problem, and its all you are going to see in big-O is powers of 2.  No base 17 logs or e or anything from math that gets weird, just powers of 2, and that is the question it is asking and the answer.  Its not that scary, when you see it written out, hopefully?  All the log algorithms are about cutting the data in half over and over, just like that, for example think about how you search a physical book dictionary for a word: you open in the middle, and its more towards A or more towards Z, so you cut the half where it will be in half again...  is it more towards M or Z... more towards M or S ... whatever... (and yea humans jump to the first letter section better than by halfs but play along with the blind approach ... this is just what a binary search does ...  cuts the list in half until its down to 1 element and its found or not at that point). \n\nThat is about 85% of the big o stuff.  There will be other notations at the same time  that denote best case, average case, worst case and so on that you just need to memorize (the notation, I mean, memorize THAT) and rules (like the dropping of constants and taking the dominating term of the equation that your code defines.\n\nthere are not that many REAL in use big-O answers.  There is 1, lg(n), N\\*lg(n), N, N\\^powers, and the ugly stuff like N! or 2\\^N etc.  And practical algorithms rarely go abouve N\\^3 before someone gets mad and finds a better way (there are some things where there is no better way, but MOST stuff you see day in and day out has an answer N\\^3 or better).  I mean there are screwballs... shellsort for example often ends up with some form of O(N\\^(x+1/x))  eg N\\^7/6 was a common find back when I studied that algorithm.  But shell sort needs a freakin PHD level analysis to find the complexity for many of the sequences and its not handed out lightly to students.  You won't see that kind of mess most likely, or if you do, they will just give you the answer and tell you (indirectly) that it was a pain to figure that out.",

        "body": "Big-O notation is a fancy term for approximation. Basically you count the number of operations that your code performs.\n\nFor example, the very first LeetCode problem: given a list of integers, find a pair of integers that sum up to a given target. An example of non-optimal solution:\n\n    def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\n        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):\n                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:\n                    return [i, j]\n\nIt has a loop with n iterations (i index) and inside each iteration is another loop with n iterations (j index). So the code may evaluate the if statement up to n \\* n times, hence O(n\\*\\*2) time complexity.\n\nAn optimal solution:\n\n    def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\n        prev_numbers = {}\n    \n        for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n            complement = target - num\n            if complement in prev_numbers:\n                return [prev_numbers[complement], i]\n            prev_numbers[num] = i\n\nIt has only a loop with n iterations. The code may evaluate the if statement up to n times max, hence O(n) complexity.\n\nAnother common introduction to the notation is a binary search. In a binary search you halve the length of the list at each iteration. How many times you divide the length of the list (n) until it becomes 1? Roughly log(n) / log(2). Hence O(log(n)) complexity for binary search.\n\nLook up multiple tutorials and introductions and build your own understanding of the subject. Don't just rely on a single course or tutorial.",

        "body": "So lots of other people have given good breakdowns on Big-O, but when it comes to practical applications I find where a lot of learners struggle isn't actually the time complexity part, it is the part where they look at real algorithms and figure out the Big O. Because they can't read and understand code well enough to make any conclusions on how many times some code might loop or the like.\n\nLike, look at some pseudo code like:\n\n    function maxproduct(List l): int\n    {\n        int maxproduct, i, j = 0,0,0\n        while (i < l.length)\n        {\n            while ( i + j < l.length)\n            {\n               int product = l[i] * l[i+j]\n               if (product > maxproduct) maxproduct = product\n               j++\n            }\n            i++\n        }\n        return maxproduct\n    }\n\nIf the list contains 1 item, how many times will the \"`int product = l[i] * l[i+j`\\]\" line be executed? What if it contains 10 items? 100?\n\nIf you can look at the code and figure that type of thing out pretty quickly, then figuring out Big O becomes a lot easier to understand - you're really just talking about the relationship between the number of inputs and how many instructions and how one grows as the other grows.\n\nBut if you *can't* look at a code block like that pretty quickly and tell me roughly how many times the interior loop will run based on the length of the list, your problem isn't really understanding Big O notation. It is that your programming knowledge isn't advanced enough to really be able to grasp it. So if that's the case, I'd put worrying about Big O aside and instead return to focusing on the basics of reading and writing simple code until you really get it and can read it easily before returning to more theoretical concepts like Big O.",

How long does a randomly generated alpha-numeric GUID has to be in order to ensure it's collision-proof?  \n\nIt sounds like you're thinking about this the same way I did when I first looked into the subject. \"So, I'm supposed to generate a big-ass random number while jillions of other devs are simultaneously generating big-ass random numbers and just hope that none of us bump into each other? What's the logic here besides 'Trust me, bro'?\"  \n\nThe secret, at least for [Version 1 GUIDs](https://guid.one/guid/make), is that it's actually not entirely random, and that's a good thing. The idea behind a GUID is that it should be unique in time and space. With that in mind, it's pretty easy to deliberately avoid collisions by incorporating spacial (physical or logical space) and temporal components in combination with randomness.  \n\nIdentifying the exact latitude and longitude of the device generating the GUID is often infeasible, so a common practice is to use the machine's MAC address, or a hashed namespace (e.g., company/app URL). Basically, you're saying that this particular GUID was generated by *this* computer at *this* time, down to millisecond precision (or at least, as accurate as the onboard clock can be). That's probably good enough for most uses, but to kick it up a notch, we also generate a pretty good-sized random number, *and* check it against ones we've already made, and increment it if, by some miracle, we managed to come up with two of the same random number in the same thousandth of a second.  \n\nThe thing to take comfort in is that you don't actually need to be unique in all of time and space in the universe. You don't even need to be unique in the history of computing on Earth (although you almost certainly will be). You *probably* don't even need to be unique within your organization. What you care about most of the time is being unique within your application, or, really, within the primary key column of one single table.  \n\nWith that in mind, you can be confident that the pretty good-sized random number generated by Mike's computer at 3:14:15.926 PM on June 10th, 2025, to be used strictly for identifying records in sale_item table in SysCorp's home grown CRM, isn't going to conflict with any other GUIDs in that table.  \n\nFurther, if some rando in Timbuktu, or in the sandwich shop across the street, manages, against all odds, to generate the exact same GUID as one of yours, it doesn't matter, because *they're not putting it in your database.*  \n\nI hope this helps you feel better.",

You have nobody to blame but yourself.\n\n> So my question is, how do I relearn programming? Where do I start? From the beginning?\n\nYes, you start at the beginning again. You did through your materials and support them with the internet. Check the **Frequently Asked Questions** here in the subreddit sidebar for recommended learning resources.\n\nStop using AI for anything apart from getting deeper explanations. Under no circumstances use it to do your thinking, to give you solutions, to give you code. Do not copy-paste code from somewhere else. Type it yourself.\n\nLearning programming requires effort. Learning programming requires practice. You need to come up with your own solutions. You need to struggle. You need to fight. You need to fail. You need to solve. This is how learning works, not through letting others (AI) do the work for you.",

No, a player isn't an enemy, wtf were you thinking? You already had a common base class, use that. Besides, an \"enemy\" isn't even a class in itself, nor should player be. They are just specific characters used for specific purposes. You're trying to inherit roles or behaviour, which is bad. Create one character class that supports \"can be controlled\", then player is just an instance that's controlled with mouse/keyboard while enemies are instances that are controlled automatically.\n\nSame thing with your archer/mage example. Being an archer is a playstyle, a role, or a behavior. It's still a character, use composition to indicate its roles and/or weapons that it uses. One useful tip is to think of \"can this change at runtime?\" If the answer is yes then use composition. Can a character become a building in the middle of the game? Uh, no. Can an enemy become an ally? Yes, people change their mind => use composition.\n\nAlso I have no idea what your issue with the Button is. Yes, use composition. Is checkbox something you can press?

How do you do that without complex or ugly workarounds like creating another class named FighterAndMage ?\n\nWell, you *don't* do it with an inheritance graph like Object->Character->Player->\\[Fighter|Mage|Archer\\]. Instead, you could give the class that represents a player an attribute, like \\`role\\` and a corresponding \\`Role\\` type that sets the expectations for what a Role is. Fighter, Mage, and Archer *could* be derived from Role, or they could just be instances of Role -- i.e. all exactly the same type of object, but with different data. For example, it might be that any role can hit an adversary, and any role can cast spells, but a Fighter might just hit harder, and a Mage might have a higher probability of success with magic. If a player can have more than one role at a time, then the \\`role\\` attribute should really be \\`roles\\` and refer to some kind of collection or combination of the roles.\n\n>Encapsulation is a useful trait for OOP to make code more secure but getts and setters can add a lot of boilerplate.\n\nThat depends on the language. For example, in Swift you don't have to write any accessors -- you just use whatever attributes an object has. But there are implicit accessors there, and if you later want to modify them you can do so at any time.\n\n>With ECS you have a relation of \"IT HAS\" instead of \"IT IS\".\n\nWith OOP you have both types of relationships.

I use OOP for polymorphism, abstraction and encapsulation.\n\nModelling problem domains like you describe, with a Player class and an Enemy class deriving from Character or Triangle deriving from Shape is very rare in practice in my experience. It works when your domain is more or less fixed, and you can draft the entire type hierarchy from the start. But if there's enough uncertainty and you need to add new types to the domain over time it's just too hard to get right. This is where something like an ECS shines because it's designed to give you maximum flexibility when defining types and assigning properties to them.\n\nI also don't think that DOD necessarily conflicts with OOP. DOD just tells you to design your classes around the data and how it's mutated instead of modeling your domain in code.",

It is not a \"huge\" concept in and of itself, but it does take some getting used to, and to learn how it can be used effectively, and when to use and not use it, for example.\n\nAnother peculiarity of C++ is that when doing OOP, member functions are not virtual by default.  You must \"opt in\" to make a function virtual. In almost all other languages (including Python), methods (that is, functions placed onto a class) are always virtual. And because they are always virtual, you might not even yet know what the difference is between a function being \"virtual\" or \"non-virtual\", for example. But you will learn this when you learn C++.\n\nC++ also has function overloading, which Python does not have.\n\nC++ has templates (generic functions), which Python does not have.\n\nPython also has some stuff that C++ does not have, or which is hard to do in C++. For example, \"generators\" in Python are pretty useful. Maybe you can do something similar in C++ but it will not be so convenient. Python and most dynamic languages have an \"eval\" facility which lets you evaluate code \"on the fly\" but this kind of thing does not exist in C++. Again, it can be done but you will have to implement it yourself (e.g. by calling out to a compiler to compile code, or else embedding your own small compiler along with your executable).",

Famous computer scientist Donald Knuth once said \"premature optimization is the root of all evil\", meaning basically that we should worry about correctness and simplicity first, otherwise we will end up wasting all our time/shooting ourselves in the foot.\n\n2. The correct approach is to first have a working program/code/feature, and then assess whether the performance even is problematic, and then if it is, use profiling or instrumentation to see which part of the code is slow and why. Then, focus on optimizing only that part of the code.\n\n3. In order to understand why code is slow, you can look at it from an algorithmic standpoint, like for instance noticing a double for loop, meaning a potential N\\^2 algorithm, which could maybe be redone in some clever way to become O(N) or NlogN, OR you can look at it from a systems standpoint, for instance you are only using 1 thread/1 cpu core but your machine as 128 cores available, or you should be doing CPU work and IO at the same time, etc. to maximize utilization of the resources.\n\n4. I don't really think it's realistic to be able to write thing fast and efficient \"in the first draft\" as you say, it sort of goes against everything else I wrote here. That being said, depending on what kind of code you are writing, if you have a general understanding of basic algorithms like sorting and searching and so on, along with time complexity, maybe you can build some muscle for doing this just at a basic level. But I would not encourage you to try to optimize things at the system level in the first draft because usually it's more trouble than it's worth.",

I'm more focused on the quality of the interfaces/organization of the code units and how the mental model is reflected in the code, etc. Not focusing on speed first helps me to only compromise the design in areas where it's truly necessary due to identified performance issues.\n\nUsually when I do wind up fixing performance issues in my code, it usually comes in the form of caching. Has its tradeoffs. Sometimes I'm also able to change things to avoid garbage collection running as often or at inopportune moments.

Use that judgement to trend toward low complexity, so that if/when you get to an optimization pass the basics are already sane. \n\n2. Pay close to attention to your intended throughput. Think about how fast this needs to go and how often and how much data it's working on so that you're aware of how much you need to be thinking about #1.

This subreddit isn't called learnCoding either, it's called learnProgramming.\n\nIMHO what sets a programmer apart from a coder is that a programmer is capable of understanding (software) architecture decisions in their programming field (and maybe even make their own architecture decisions). A mobile app developer has learned the architecture layers of mobile apps, a backend enterprise application programmer has learned how to keep their growing projects maintainable, a frontend dev may know a thing or two about designs, ... .\n\nSo what can you do? Understand that coding is one of many means at a programmer's disposal to achieve something greater. Then get a grasp on which field(s) of programming actually interest you.\n\nIf you like coding, which usually involves breaking down a larger problem into many small steps, you can think of programming as doing the same \"breaking down problems\" into manageable chunks, just at a grander scale. Trust me, it's just as fulfilling to see planned parts of a program work well together as it is to write individual methods that do what they are supposed to do.\n\nIf you still have absolutely no idea what to do, maybe think of a more-than-trivial, less-than-difficult business use-case and implement that into a program with an agile development style. A business use-case doesn't have to be money oriented, it can be anything you'd use in a business, including any open-source software idea that comes to your mind.\n\nWhile/after you get the right mindset how to approach program development, you can return to game development. If you do it right it'll probably involve having/obtaining some math knowledge that you aren't thinking of yet, which is why IMHO business applications are a tad more approachable if you just want to get the right mindset regarding project work, while doing some goal-oriented coding.",

When you dominate the syntax you start to develop a skill to write the code without thinking in the semantics but in what can be possible output. \n\nIt‚Äôs a process that takes time because we in normal days solving a problem we use the real logic but in programming you have the abstraction to representing real situations in a programming language. \n\nIf you think in closing a door, you imagine the door fiscally and the knob, but in an algorithm you could think in the coordinate of the knob or if the door is open or close or even if there is a door, so after you have this clear in you mind so you translate each action in code. This is a process to take time to become automatic, similar to drive a manual transmission, the first times you really think a lot when changing the velocity, but after you don‚Äôt think on that at all. \n\nFurthermore, if you don‚Äôt know something exists (a solution) how can you know about it. I mean, my point is I am very ignorant about some music if I never listen before, but the first time you hear it you can know if you like. Solving problems is like that, you don‚Äôt know the solution and even where to start, but with practice and learning how others approach the problem you will develop this sense of recognising patterns. \n\nA way to deal with this more in practice is learning how to debug and learning debugging tools, so you can see the step by step of the code and the output. \n\nTake a look at (python/C tutor)[https://pythontutor.com/c.html#mode=edit] try it and solve some algorithms there.",

Go with python. \n\nKeep in mind that once you have learned the general principles of programming (i.e learn to think like a programmer), learning a new language is very easy, because basically the only thing that changes is the syntax, and some quirks that each language may have, but the core concepts are always the same. \n\nPython is a good generic starting language to learn programming concepts because its syntax is not complex, and it has libraries for everything you might want to do. \n\nAs for resources, I would suggest first using youtube tutorials/books to learn about different concepts (variables, operators, functions, classes, etc.), then figuring out what the best language is for your use case, and trying to solve leetcode challenges. Leetcode is a very good resource to teach you algorithmic thinking and program optimization. \n\nAnother alternative for when you get decent is to choose an open-source project that you like from github and try to contribute to it, in order to learn about integration and work with real-world systems.

It's your brain literally rewiring itself to think logically. \n\nDon't give up yet. Give it at least 2-3 weeks of consistent practice before you decide anything. Python usually clicks around week 3-4 for most people, but everyone's different.\n\nAbout whether you should continue, programming skills are pretty valuable right now, especially with AI stuff happening. Even if you don't become a full time developer, knowing how to code helps in almost any field.\n\nAs for next language, worry about that later. Get comfortable with Python first. Maybe after 6 months you can think about JavaScript or something else.\n\nYou're not wasting time, just being realistic about the learning curve. Stick with it for at least a month before making any big decisions :)",

What you need to do is learn to write a function that takes inputs, aka parameters. The basic idea is that you write the code once using the functions parameters, and then you can call the function any number of times with whatever values you want. You can use parameters for anything that you want to be adjustable in the function. If you write a function that draws an enemy, you can use parameters to specify the location of the enemy, but also what color(s) to use, how many legs or teeth the enemy has, and anything else that could change from one enemy to the next.\n\nOnce you‚Äôve got a function that draws the enemy, you can create a list of sets of parameters. Then, you can use a loop to iterate over the list and call the `enemy` function with each set of parameters, and the function will draw all the enemies in the list one at a time.\n\nThis is one of the fundamental ideas in programming. Computers work largely by repeating simple sets of instructions, very very quickly, with different data.",

Recruiter in the tech space (building a tech talent community to upskill + place talent) here, and I work with a lot of junior devs trying to break into the job market.   \n  \nEntry levels are really competitive because of a combination of a couple things: 1) AI is replacing a lot of aspects of a junior role, 2) as a result of the AI influence, companies seemingly want more specialists vs generalists in the market rn (this is my opinion though from speaking with companies and seeing their sentiment), and 3) in general, less companies are looking to spend the time mentoring + training junior talent when they know they can use AI for a certain amount of tasks + hire intermediate/senior talent to come in and hit the ground running right away.\n\nWhat I'd recommend: build your projects and experience in a way that shows your adaptability to pick up new technologies/skills as fast as possible. Show that your insight, productivity, and understanding of how to solve a problem is there, something that AI cannot show! \n\nSome things you can do: build an awesome portfolio website to showcase your projects and present them in a case study like format (showcase your thinking and process), align your resume to the very specific skillset that the company is looking for and if you have some dream roles/companies, building projects very specifically towards that, and most importantly: build up your network. Reach out to people on LinkedIn/reddit/conferences/forums etc and build connections to learn and connect with them. You never know where a connection can lead to - I've had people that I met 6 years ago offer me a great job when I needed it most! \n\nAnd finally, as I always do, you can always check out our talent community where we help you upskill on exactly this and find directly recruited jobs for you (but ofc, you're welcome to apply outside of our community too). If you're interested, here's our website: [https://acetalent.io/join-like-a-monad](https://acetalent.io/join-like-a-monad)\n\nI hope this helps & feel free to ask any more questions!",

Learn the concepts, and what is left are the syntax and architecture the languages can use for the best. \n\nIf you are somewhat adept at coding as a whole, you will see many repetitive patterns when we talk about imperative paradigms. \n\nTldr: learn concepts and architectures as a whole and be flexible.

That's what happened to me: I was tasked with just data entry, but I saw the need for an extensive database of all companies in the NYC tri-state area for the data entry personnel, so I purchased a then CD-ROM -based business directory with appropriate data, wrote a custom utility in C++ to convert over a million records into a flat-file database format used by the company, converted all the data on my home PC and handed that huge chunk of data to my boss.

Switching to macOS helped me with moving closer to Linux, but grabbing a cheap laptop from Facebook marketplace and installing a dozen different Linux distros will get you further and faster. I suggest using a separate machine so you can go scorched earth.\n\n**No** because you should stick with whatever you're comfortable moving forward with. People may give up over the tiniest things. DO NOT accidentally kill your interest in programming by changing your environment so much that you lose faith in your foundations.\n\n  \nEdit: Forgot to mention that WSL is pretty good right now. When I'm forced to suffer through Windows I tend to use Git Bash for simple operations and WSL for anything that Git Bash can't handle. These days Git Bash for windows has the option to install a bunch of command-line tools that make life on Windows a bit more linux-like. Can't live without it.",

The exam is unknown so you'll need to use your best judgement and logic to put together a solution. Problem solving logic takes practice of similar questions to really perfect, but once you do it becomes a universal skill.\n\n1. As an exercise that combines these topics, I recommend making a small hangman program. Try reading the word from a .txt file, handling the guessing part in the console, and outputting your final answer + the amount of guesses it took to a new .txt file. This will cover comparing matching values between an answer/guess array.\n2. To cover some basic math and parsing, you could also try reading a string of numbers e.g. \"15326\" from a .txt file, then calculating the average and median (requires sorting), and outputting that to a .txt file.\n\nGood luck on the exam!",

So, I wrote a Python script to open each one, change the Id3 tag for the artist using a rule I defined (to make it shorter but still legible on the player), and then save it.\n\nThis was not a genius script by any means, but to me, writing something like this is 100x more rewarding than solving a \"leetcode\" problem. Will anyone else care about the code I wrote? Probably not; I didn't design it to be a general purpose tool. If I put it on GitHub it would receive exactly 0 stars and 0 forks for example (probably I would post it as a \"gist\" if I posted it at all), but I didn't write it to get points or something, I wrote it to solve \\*my\\* particular problem and it was fun to write. Also I learned about a cool Python module with a funny name - eyed3.",

The more you learn about a languages the more you realize that you will only ever know a pin drop and never be a 'master' of it. It's good that you have taken on a role for now, but I'd just set a time limit for interview prepping and just start applying for jr roles when they happens. \n\nThe industry is a bit rough getting into right now, so more exposure to interviews won't be a bad thing.

        "body": "I'll give 3 I can think of. Or 2.5, maybe.\n\n1) Honestly I'd already learned most of the important lessons the hard way before hearing advice around them. One piece of advice I can think of though that I didn't stumble into myself was that an engineer once said they view passing self/this to a method/function to be a smell. I hadn't considered that and I don't even really know why it's true if it is. Maybe it's true because it reveals a potentially unnecessary bi-directional dependency/coupling. Sometimes I can't figure out a way to prevent this where the pros outweigh the cons but sometimes I can and in those cases it seems to result in a much better design.\n\n2) Not advice per se, but, If I go back, as in really really far back to before I programmed professionally, I saw somebody diagram a program top-down before implementing it. This indirectly resulted in organizing the procedures by level of abstraction and exposed a mental model of the program to latch onto while implementing it. Thinking of things that way (or bottom-up works, too) felt like it unblocked me to create much more complex programs before drowning in my own mess.\n\n3) Some advice I got but debatably not \"software engineering\" advice, I would say it was actually a soft-skills thing. A product manager mentioned to me after a meeting that instead of saying things like \"we can't do that\" it would be more helpful/productive to say things like \"Do you think X would be a problem if we do that?\"\n\nIn other words, it really matters how people feel as a result of technical back-and-forth. I think this can be overlooked if you only interact with engineers. Seems obvious in retrospect but this helped me be more effective when communicating with non-engineers which actually made me a more effective technical lead as well.\n\nI think in certain types of software projects cross-team communication of technical mental models around the problem solution is crucial. So this was a breakthrough for me and arguably made me a better software engineer than any technical advice I'd ever received.\n\nSo I would say to your \"but I wonder if there's more\", YMMV but I would advise to focus on people stuff and notice that people problems are actually more likely to kill certain projects than technical decisions are. And also along those lines I think for certain projects the value is actually more in the understanding of the problem/proposed solution and effective communication around it than the implementation itself is.",

A gazillion people, many non technical, but also other devs, will want you to include something, make something happen.

Too many projects, industry and FOSS, die because of feature creep, because codebases bloat- and then blow-up.\n\nAnd people don't prevent it, because a yes-man seems to have an easier time getting ahead in his career than someone saying no, because coporate shills and useless consultants have poisoned modern corporate culture portraying saying \"No\" as something evil.\n\n----\n\n*\"Any methodology becomes useless when it becomes an ideology.\"*\n\nThis is true for everything, but by far the worst offenders of this in programming, are OOP, TDD, FP, and early optimization.

        "body": "Can you give an example?\n\nGenerally, it's a separate skill. Teaching as a TA or tutor helps practice; so does a client facing job like consulting. My first advice is to go in knowing your audience and what they expect and to tailor your level of detail to that audience. If the audience is non-technical or time is short, it's best to just give a recommendation or answer and let them ask questions. Maybe list the possible choices with a few pros and cons first. If it's an hour long review of said recommendation with a client technical team, be ready to go through the twenty considerations that led to that recommendation as they want you to be thorough. Teaching really does help. After you've explained polymorphism to freshman a few dozen times with a worked example, you can do it with an interviewer who already knows it pretty easily.\n\nMy other suggestion is that you want to keep a conversation going but at the same time it's fine to pause and frame your answer. There's a video of Tim Cook taking a question at a shareholder meeting where he literally sits at a conference table for almost a minute thinking before giving a twenty second answer. It was complicated and he wanted to check all the angles in his head and decide how to phrase his answer succinctly.\n\nIt's fine to use a whiteboard or paper if needed as long as you're not being rude. I get interview questions about how I'd design something complex and I'll do that with the interviewer. We'll basically sketch the landscape and they'll add things and ask questions as we go around.\n\nI will also stress that BSing technical interviewers usually doesn't work. You may be able to lie to them, but your answer will still be technically wrong and they'll just think you're confidently mistaken. I like people who say they don't know and tell me how they'd find out as long as the question wasn't too foundational. I say a lot of things like \"I've never used that product, but I assume it has X/works like X/can integrate using X/runs on X, right? If so, I'd find the docs and plan to implement it using \\[high level approach that works with the underlying tech\\].\" If it's weird they'll just tell me and I'll give an answer that works with the weird. Show you know the first principle or pattern and can learn new things.",

Don't hate yourself just because you failed an interview. I flat out froze up in my first two interviews, it happens.\n\nThe way you improve is by first looking up mock interviews on YouTube, and learning what a \"good job candidate\" is even supposed to look / sound like during a coding / behavioral / systems design interview. This is not one of those things that's \"obvious\" in the sense that you should \"just know\", especially if you don't come from a white collar background and aren't used to presenting yourself as a professional. You gotta at least see a good example.\n\nAfter that, you gotta do what you can to prep. Look up \"X interview questions\". Replace X with Python, Java, Springboot, Javascript, React; whatever you think may be relevant based on the job description. You usually don't need to be extremely thorough, just some skimming to be sort of mentally and emotionally prepared for the kinds of questions you're going to run into. If the questions do seem wildly off from what you know, just do the homework and try your best to study up.\n\nAnd beyond that, you need to be honest with yourself. Did you really know the answer, just not how to phrase it? I did a lot of random LeetCode / Hackerrank before I even did my first coding interview. I knew ***nothing*** about DSA though, I relied entirely on my intuition to solve problems. That ultimately meant I was bad at doing coding interviews, and I had to swallow my pride and work through neetcode before I got to a good spot with coding interviews.\n\nEdit: I also verbalize everything when I interview prep. I'm not a naturally good speaker, so I try to talk through everything to be good enough for interviews. It's important to not talk too \"hastily\" though, you typically want to talk like you're trying to hold a conversation.",

As long as you're aware of that, though, and have the instinct to check something with primary sources or \"up to date\" references that needs to be checked, I don't think this is as much of a problem as some people seem to make it out to be.\n\nNext, you cannot do common computing tasks on a book like \"Search\" (at least not in a print version). But for this, there is \"the table of contents\" and \"the index\" which may seem quaint but are actually better for learning, in my opinion. If you go to the index to find a term, for example, then your eyes will encounter other related terms and you'll naturally want to look up a few more and to increase your knowledge.\n\nPersonally I like the feeling of holding a book and flipping through pages. At least, to me it feels a lot more enjoyable than scrolling through pages on a screen. Maybe it's just because I use a computer for work so much, that doing something on the computer (looking at document) feels like \"work\", whereas looking at a book on paper (even about programming) feels like not work, even if some aspects of a physical book are more laborious, such as flipping pages or finding the correct page number.",

That is why everyone always suggests doing projects, because then you apply your recently gained knowledge, and then you learn!\n\nBooks have the downside that it is tempting to skip through the boring stuff, and only read whatever confirms what you already know. They can give you a feeling that you totally understand things, because the book explains it so nicely.\n\nInteractive tutorials like free code camp and others, have the downside that they only ask you to answer predefined questions, and you risk becoming like a monkey pressing switches, without any idea of why or what you are doing. And since they tend \"finish\" every topic without ever returning, you forget the first things you \"learned\" before the course is complete.\n\nVideo tutorials are mostly just watching someone else repeating a project they have done before - kind of like watching someone play a game they've already completed. It can be great for actually seeing what is going on, but like in life, there's a huge difference between seeing someone else doing things, and do them yourselves.\n\nMy recommendation is to look around, try some different things, see what you like, and then focus on applying the knowledge to projects where you can't just fast-forward or skip to the page with the solution. Then you are learning!",

I'd say with Go there's a slightly higher chance the interviewer wouldn't be as familiar with Go and might ask you a question about your syntax. Should be fine if you're good at it, though.\n\nPicking C as your primary language for interviews can occasionally be a weakness. While C is a great language, there are some things that are just a lot more tedious in C. Just about any problem that involves appending strings, for example, is more tedious in C, especially if you want it to work with arbitrary sizes and handle errors correctly - whereas C++ and Go have nice high-level string objects that you can easily split, append, and so on.\n\nIt depends on the problem.

You have until the end of the year (Dec 31) to complete it.\n\nRecall this is just an intro course although as intro courses go, it's a challenge (because it's Harvard). The key is to do the programming assignments. Those assignments can be quite lengthy to read so it may require multiple readings to understand what's being asked, especially in later projects.\n\nThe intro project is in Scratch which is normally aimed at teens, then several \"weeks\" in C, then a mish-mash of other topics like Python, database, some web stuff. There's a final project (I believe) that you are supposed to submit.\n\nThere's also CS50p. This isn't CS50x in Python.

Currently I am not aware of your future plans. i.e :- If you want a new job in an another field of programming , If you want are currently preparing for an interview or are planning to do so.\nSo, simple stuff, you said you made games, you can start from there, maybe study more DSA (or from the start if you believe you hadn't understood a thing.)\n\n\n2. Depends on what YOU want. Skillset or More Money from levelling up what your job requires.\n\n\nIf you have the same interest as the thing you work, that's the cherry in top. If not, you can work something else. Maybe strengthen your unity skills, one good indie game can make you hell lot of money. You can try freelancing and other things.\n\n\nAlso, as you said that your are finding new things everytime you learn something, don't get overwhelmed. I've been a unity game dev for 7 years and everytime I open Unity documentation almost always I find something new. Coding is such a thing that would not fully end even if you die. It's natural to get overwhelmed and fell lost but don't,my friend, it's a long journey.\n\n\nAlso please don't try to learn everything at the same time, like you metioned java, 5 other things, first master one thing and then move on the other.\n\n\n3. You can use AI to either make you an intellectual or completely destroy your brain, depends on how you use it. ONLY use it when you are stuck on a problem or a bug for a few 20 minutes. AI doesn't destroy anyone, they let AI destroy them, it has been the best thing that happened to me because I used it responsibly.\n\n\nThis was my answer, believe me , thing will get better, you WILL overcome the doubts you have, just believe in yourself,good luck and ALL OF THE BEST BROTHER, YOU CAN DO IT.",

A consulting company usually wouldn't care how you accomplish a task as long as it works. A product based software company will usually demand more as they have invested a lot of effort and resources in that product.\n\n> Now, I have found out that, that I'm really dumb. I had been using web servers for an year in JS and only recently I figured out the entire architecture when I had to build an HTTP server from scratch in C. It has been a huge challenge and still is.\n\nA common pitfall many new devs fall into. Do you really need to understand everything about everything? Don't get me wrong, I want to differentiate between you wanting to know how HTTP server works architecture wise and you feeling like you have to know how HTTP server works. One serves to broaden and enhance your skills while the other only serves to impede you.\n\n> If I learn how to apply a concept without first trying to understand it completely, is this a good strategy?\n\nIt depends on what you are trying to understand. Do you want to know if it is possible to do a task using a particular concept? Sure, you can implement messaging between two clients using BLE(Bluetooth Low Energy) by following a YT video. Do you want know the limits of what you can do with BLE? You then go and read the RFC for BLE, learn about it's specs, versions etc.\n\nTL;DR:- Both approaches are fine, it all depends on what you want. Want to get something done and don't really care for implementation details, go for application over mastery. Want to know what is possible and what isn't? Go for mastery over application.",

If you're reading a book and coding along side it and suddenly you get burnt out - move to video tutorials for a bit. If it's too easy or feels like review, skip to the next chapter.

WebGL has multiple versions and a bunch of extensions, and shares GLSL with other graphics APIs (Vulkan and OpenGL), each with their own versions - which ends up creating a mine field for LLMs.\n\nTrying to build something outside of your current abilities is a good way to grow though, it'll show you real quick where the gaps in your knowledge are and give you something to work on!

If there are designers, they will take care of most UX/design thinking, but you do get to participate and offer suggestions.\n\nDesigners often work out of figma or similar apps, which don‚Äôt really behave exactly like a browser, so they do need the programmers help. Designers also often expect people to behave predictably, and there always those ppl who don‚Äôt. \n\nI happen to have degrees in both engineering and graphic design and can tell you: if you enjoy coding , FE will be your cozy niche. If you enjoy creating the visual interface and interactions, but coding in general bores you, stick with graphic design.\n\nI CAN do some BE in Java, but it bores the hell out of me because it‚Äôs so predictable and stable and mostly boilerplate. Which is why I have never gone fullstack, and will continue to avoid it hopefully until I retire. FE is chaotic and I love it. It‚Äôs always new, every interface has its own problems to solve, ready-made component libraries only get you so far and sometimes they introduce more problems than they solve, and that one goal of less than 2 seconds to page fully loaded really keeps me going. Doing a website with React is easy, keeping those page loads under control is priceless.",

When you do an operation like copyto, the underlying code performs a loop requesting the amount of bytes to fill the buffer, it then moves those bytes to the specified destination. If the amount of bytes received was less than the number of bytes requested then it repeats the operation fetch operation until the number of bytes received is less than the number of bytes requested.\n\nThe idea being that some streams have an overhead for reading or writing, by reading a chunk at a time (rather than a byte at a time) you can avoid a lot of that overhead.\n\n  \nAlso have a look at r/csharp.

The whole \"use a thesaurus to avoid repeating yourself\" thing that English majors do in prose is actively frowned upon in comp-sci works. If you mean the same thing, use the same word again.\n\nAlso what happens in real settings is that rarely used words are just not as present as other vocab, so we either need to think for a bit (either to mentally translate or to search for the word) and this is bloody exhausting. Just reusing the smaller core vocab is kind of a defence mechanism then.\n\n> Listening, especially when there are native speakers, provides some challenges. By the time you understand something, the topic has moved on.\n\nBloody Welsh people. Yeah, natives with strong accents are very hard to understand.

I want to be able to actually do my job after getting it. Nobody would even give me a second interview if I didn't talk up my senior/lead experience. I was being honest. I have some experience leading projects. I'm very comfortable with it. I am not a person with *years* of lead/senior level work, though, and that's what they wanted to hear.\n\nSo I spent a few days running through the stories I had of my experience, and I rewrote them under the guise of *being* my tech lead. Same story, different angle. I know all the decisions we made on those projects, because I was a part of them. I didn't *make* the decisions, but now, in my stories, I did.\n\nI went from getting past recruiter screens 1/10 times to 10/10 times. It felt a lot more like interviewing 5 years ago. I still failed a lot of the later stages, but I don't care about having a 100% success rate. I only needed one job.\n\nIf the rest of the market is lying, then you have to lie as well. It's the same escalating race to the bottom as the leetcode grind.",

As someone with 10 YOE I agree with every bit of this. \n\nOne thing I'd like to maybe elaborate on is your point about lying on your resume. I think for that point it should be noted to not outright lie about things that can be verified (like schooling, certs, places you've worked, etc) however, embellishing your current (or immediate past) role is absolutely a must.   \n  \nIts important that you can speak confidently to that, however, so make sure you can answer questions about it at atleast an intermediate level in an interview setting. And this can also tie into your point on doing personal projects, which you can use that experience to fluff up your current role but it'll be worth much more if its part of your job experience (in an enterprise setting) than if its just a personal/home project.",

She recently invited me to a night out with some of her other doctor friends in the area, and you wanna know how early we planned it? *Three months ahead of time*.\n\nThat's the time she needed to get all of their schedules and time offs aligned just to have a single Saturday open for a full night of plans.\n\nWhereas for me *all* of my Saturdays are open. I'm actually the opposite, I prefer not to make plans that far in the future cause I often do things spontaneously. If someone messages me Saturday morning to see if I wanna meet for happy hour, I'm free. Only exception would be on-call rotation, but even then I still go out and do things, I just don't do anything that would keep me from responding to an incident within the hour.\n\nAnd the amount of hours she works... jesus christ. I'm a 40-hour-a-week man. Even the crazy SWE's that work themselves into the ground are only logging 60-80 hours. That's like a vacation to this girl.\n\nAnd you know something else she recently complained to me about? Rampant misogyny in her workplace. Leadership that was making stupid calls, causing all sorts of scheduling drama impacting her hours, ruining the workplace, etc (she left that job over it).\n\nThe *only* reason many medical professionals are working is out of passion. It's a miserable industry from what I hear. But they love it, they're helping people, they're saving lives, so their sacrifice *their own* life.\n\nBut all the things you seem to be complaining about (minus passion) exists over in that world and then some.\n\nThe grass is always greener.",

That's like... Principal SWE at least, and those roles aren't frequently hired externally. They may even be more of a fit for a Senior PM or an EM role.\n\nBut a regular run of the mill Senior SWE role? They're not gonna want to touch somebody like that with a 10 foot pole. They're too expensive. That person's shooting way below their belt if they're just looking for a \"senior dev\" job that isn't extremely specialized and niche to actually *utilize* their background.\n\nIf I had that experience, and I were trying to apply to \"regular\" jobs, I'd be fudging my resume to make myself look like the type of candidate that gets hired into those \"regular\" jobs. Know your audience.\n\nTheir experience also confuses me, they make no mention of how much professional *SWE* experience they have. I know they were a PM for 15 years, but that's not relevant to SWE. Their 10 years as an AI/ML scientiest may or may not be relevant either. So that would leave them with... 13 years of SWE? It might be a bit telling they didn't bother to mention SWE experience at all, and focused on a bunch of qualifications and non-SWE roles in their rant. I'm just making assumptions here though\n\nI have 12 YOE, and I apply to Senior SWE roles and get them just fine. Even in the market of 2024, which is when I last job hopped. When I can do the job just fine... why would they try to hire someone with 38 YOE that's probably asking double or triple my salary?\n\nIf I had 38 YOE, I don't think I'd be targetting the same roles I'm targetting today. Maybe I'll be eating my words when I'm up there though.",

Also depends on what he did specifically on the IBM Watson team, it might actually pigeon hole him into very specific/niche things where the only other companies doing that sorta thing would be places like OpenAI which have a lot of competition. Might not open doors in smaller companies if it's too niche.\n* Certification/Publications/Bachelors, OS, game engine, scripting language\n   * Generally won't be relevant to anyone that has long term work experience like this guy, unless the publication is specifically for the role he's applying for.\n\nA large amount of his development experience also won't be relevant to today either, because he's been working for such a long time. 38 years ago is 1987. I doubt any employer really cares about his experience from '87 -> 2010 in this market, as it probably isn't that relevant.\n\nLike there's plenty of ways you can screw yourself even with a resume like this in today's market. Not saying this guy couldn't learn or like pick things up, but if you have people with the exact experience you're looking for in the exact tech stack within the last 5 years, you'd probably go for that guy right?\n\nEspecially with a work history that long, he's gonna have to tailor his CV to every job he applies for to make it fit. I'd have cut all the project/program management stuff, the thought leader stuff etc and try and make relevant experience fit into a two pager, but depending on the order and timeline of his experience he might be screwed anyway.

I vibed well with my manager and team and it's working on something I really love. Couldn't be more happy. Plus, we don't have to eat into our savings and spend the next year building it back up. \n\nOur runway was about the same. I think after 3-4 months, I'd be looking at taking low paying SWE jobs or working at Costco to get by. \n\nCongratulations on the new job! Hopefully it's everything you hope for!",

Somehow I settled on law and began planning a career move.\n\n\nBut very quickly I realised it was the wrong choice. The law students I met seemed highly competitive and political, much more than any programmer I'd ever met, and there was a vague desperation to them. I read frank accounts of how numbing the work was and the crises of many lawyers who hit 40 and realise they're wasting their lives.\n\n\nI didn't leave technology in the end, I embraced it. I was looking for a career to fill holes in my self-image and try to counter my gnawing self-hatred. No job will do that. And I began to appreciate how creative I could be as a programmer once I accepted that I will never be perfect at it.\n\n\nOver the years I've become very thankful for this choice. Programming is what gets me up in the morning, there is nothing else like it for me. I will always be learning and it will never get boring.",

But then COVID hit and a bunch of tech jobs moved here, and it made the housing market go completely batshit crazy - and it was largely because a bunch of people with a bunch of money flooded the market.\n\nAt the same time, that drove salaries up - because to afford working in Austin, you need to afford living in Austin. The issue was that salaries didn't increase in every sector - so teachers and government workers got completely fucked. But us in tech? Doing great.\n\nNow, Silicon Valley and NYC are a different story - those are cities where that cycle of salaries -> people -> housing has been going on for decades now. Now things are someone shifting because jobs are moving out of Silicon Valley to lower cost areas, and that implications of that are going to be complicated.\n\nNow, offshoring - yes, it's 100% tied to cost of living differences. Not just housing - it's also food, services, healthcare, etc. But the same issue above at a city level also happens at a country level - countries with great quality of life and resources can offer better pay to attract more talented people who then have more money to spend on goods and services, etc.\n\nI do agree that the US has a ton of opportunities to lower cost of living - and I think you're right that housing is a big one (with healthcare being the other one).\n\nAnd I think you're also right that the nimby movement is extremely damaging to our ability to deliver affordable housing. I also do think there's a more global issue of real estate investing driving prices up and making it harder for people to buy homes for personal use.",

How cheap do you actually think good offshore devs really are? Latin Americans are now being paid almost as much as Western Europeans nowadays. Talented senior devs in India are making six figures. The truth is that offshore salaries have increased a lot in the past few years because as more work gets offshored the costs go up since there are only so many quality devs out there. Also, an effect of that is that the cost of living in places like Latin America, Eastern Europe, India, etc. is increasing because now that they have more money to spend, realtors can now increase the prices of rent and houses over there. So the cost of living in different countries compared to the US is not a static thing, and I think that there is good reason to believe that the cost of living abroad is going to catch up.",

That's actually huge for your resume, even if it feels overwhelming right now.\n\nThe \"solving hard problems all the time\" burnout is real though. At small startups you're constantly firefighting instead of building, which gets exhausting fast. The farm fantasy is totally normal lol. I think every developer has that moment.\n\nThe fact that you have real AI/ML experience from a startup is actually pretty valuable right now. Don't underestimate that. Sometimes you just need better work-life balance and actual teammates instead of being a one-person army.\n\nMy advice: don't make any big decisions while you're burned out. Maybe take some time off if you can, then think about what kind of environment would actually work for you. The skills are there, it's just about finding the right fit.",

They just don't have the support structure in place to help a junior get their footing which sets them up for either failure, burn out or both. I would use whatever PTO time you may have to take a break in the short term. Do something you like, something that will completely take you away from work. In the long term I would seriously consider switching jobs. I understand that it's easier said than done in the current market but at least with a current job it might make it easier and if you can pull it off it will be worthwhile in the long term. If you're getting burned out this early in your career, then that's a sign that something is really badly wrong as burn out rarely goes away on its own without major changes. So make the necessary change before you completely burn out.",

Speak in active voice and not passive voice. \"Created a custom partitioning service to optimize tests...\" \n\n14) Why do you give such useless info? \"This role included leadership responsibilities.\" That tells me nothing about what you did. \"Mentored and helped onboard new engineers by creating a X day plan, writing documents, pair programming\"\n\n15) \"And more\". Wtaf? \n\n16) \"Jenkins (Also jenkins api)\" lol\n\n17) Software *e*ngineer.

Useless summary in this bullet here.\n\n20) \"for internal use, for department's team use\"... ok. What did it do? One time I sent a LMGTFY link to someone at work for C# documentation, I could write \"Worked on a custom script that linked to documentation for internal team use\n\n21) \"Currently slowly taking courses in mathematics\" is just bad. Just list your courses and say they're in progress.\n\n22) cpp/c? Do you think the shift or caps lock button exists to be used when you feel like it?\n\n23) You told me you used Python... 5 times over this resume.\n\n24) Skills: \"Decision making\" leads to this type of resume?\n\n25) \"Working with vague requirements\" but made the most vague resume possible",

Title inflation is wild these days.\n\n\nIf they are genuinely looking for a tech lead, you aren't qualified for that role. You don't want to be in a situation where your employer's expectations exceed your abilities. It's a great way to lose your job. Take the big tech gig for experience and let them teach you how to be a TL. Then revisit the the startup scene in 3-5 years.\n\n\nEdit: I've been reading over your replies to other comments. You're making a lot of incorrect assumptions that will damage your career. I won't enumerate them again, as others already have done. Don't take the startup role. It's high risk/no reward.",

Everyone has already gotten new jobs; typically within a few months and typically for more money.\n\nAs another anecdote, I've also job-hopped recently and got multiple offers ranging from smaller companies to FAANG+ at 3 YoE. I\"ve also noticed an inveease in recruiter contacts since late lasy year.\n\nAlso anecdotally, we've been trying to fill a position in a major tech hub and we're really struggling to find qualified candidates. Almost 20 candidates have made it to the final loop and nobody was good enough to hire. We're not even asking for a lot; just some typical Leetcode medium/OOP/system design/behaviorals.\n\nNot sure why this sub's experiences tend to be negative. But imo, if you have several YoE, then the market is pretty decent - nowhere near the absurd covid period; but not bad either.\n\nNew grads do have it kinda rough; especially those without internships or networks to help them stand out. We have sent out job postings at a new grad level thay recieved thousands of applications within a day (though the vast majority were unqualified due to visa, no degree, etc).",

Learn the API and write them.  \n\nWant to make your own physical tools/parts/art instead of buying? Learn how to design with a 3d printer or other CNC-like device.\n\nSkills come along the way.  And I think creating your own solutions for your own problems outside of work translates pretty well to creating solutions in work.",

You got a job as a late-entrant in 2025! That is excellent.\n\nBe curious, take ownership of your stuff, and put the time in up front to show you are someone who gets stuff done. Once your reputation is established, you can switch back to normal\n\nCongrats again, and go night owls!!",

The fact that you're doing full-stack work right out the gate is hugee. Most new grads get pigeonholed into one tiny piece of the system. You're getting exposure to legacy systems, modern React, cloud migrations, testing... that's honestly a pretty well rounded foundation.\n\nAt Metana we see a lot of people get caught up thinking they need to learn every new framework. But honestly, the fundamentals you're building, understanding systems, debugging, working with teams, matter way more than knowing the latest JavaScript framework.\n\nFor leveling up income, give it 12-18 months then start looking around. Having real experience under your belt changes everything in negotiations. The fact that you've worked in sales is actually a huge advantage most developers don't have.\n\nYour current setup sounds like a great place to build solid foundations without the pressure cooker environment of some tech companies.

If you want to start working almost immediately, consider staffing firms, as they can usually get you in somewhere the same week. It might not be the best job or the best pay for the first 90 or so days before you go permanent, but I've found that's a short amount of time in grand scheme of things. If you have no interest in that, though, then yeah, just keep applying and preparing for interviews.",

It sounds like you have an awesome gig where the benefits are great and the pay is great as well. Personally, if I was in your place, I couldn‚Äôt say. That‚Äôs a lot of money but it‚Äôs a lot more work. What I would do is keep the current job and try to contract with these companies. Obviously your specialization is in demand and if the current employer allows it, this is a win-win.",

When contacted after hours did you make it clear that it was *after hours* for you and that you'd get back to them first thing in the morning?\n\nEspecially in a distributed world where people may be in different timezones, and where a lot of people are setting their own hours, some people just don't realize if it's after hours for someone else. That may be insensitive to not consider that before firing off messages... but it's not uncommon.\n\nEven on teams with a good WLB though, after hours messages happe from time to time, for various reasons. Sometimes it's urgent issues, sometimes someone just fired off a message without realizing it was after hours, sometimes someone was just sending a message before they forgot and aren't expecting a response until the nxt day. I don't guarantee to be reachablea fter 5pm, but f I get a Slack/Teams message after 5 I normally just pop in a quick response: \"What's the urgency on this? I'm not at my laptop (even if I am), can this wait till the morning?\"\n\nCommunication makes the dream work. which actually kinda ties into a secondary issue... are you even sure this whole after hours debacle had anything to do with your managers review? Were you having 1/1's with your manager talking about what was going well and what wasn't? Your manager not renewing your contract should not have been a surprise. Sure that's also a failure of *them* for not communicating, but communciation goes both ways.",

Especially if your only interaction with your actual boss is indirectly through your mentors and random after hours text messages. I wouldn't internalize the idea that you did anything wrong. They might not have the budget to hire you full time and are just making up a reason to get HR off their back about making a decision when they'd rather keep their budget for other things.",

Simple as that.  But before you join the \"fuck that toxic company\" chorus, keep a couple things in mind.  The firm doesn't care about you -- that is totally true.  But it might be different for individuals.  This is a natural opportunity to network with them.  People move, so stay in touch, make a good impression, and show them what you can do.  People respond to positive people, so try to keep that going.\n\nNow to the caveat.  In my experience (in the US), interns are usually non-exempt.  So I don't expect them to go past their paid hours.  If you have a boss that doesn't understand that, that's not good.  But ultimately, it's your choice.

If that's how you feel about them, then you need to give them that feedback during the internship so they can address it.\n\n>Also, we have a new boss (boss of my boss) and this guy totally skips my direct boss to text me always outside working hours (once it was 6 pm, another at 7 and the most recent was a message this Friday at 9pm) which I always reply at 8am in the morning, and he never replies until he just texts me days after after working hours once again, am I wrong here?\n\nThere are two answers here: the practical one and the ideological one.\n\nThe practical one: \"Hey big boss, is this something urgent you need done right now - and if so, by when? If not, is it ok if I get back to you tomorrow at 8am?\". You just *have* to ask. I've been doing this for 12 years and got a new VP 2 years ago and the first time he asked me to do something at 5pm on a weekday I immediately assume he meant that instant (because I've had bosses like that in the past), but I asked \"hey, do you need this right now?\" and he immediately went \"oh god no, no - do not work on this right now. This is a tomorrow thing - I just wanted to get that in front of you because I won't have time to chat about it tomorrow\".\n\nBut i've had VPs that would have expected an answer that moment. And then you have to decide whether you want the job (which means you should do it), or whether you think this is BS and don't care to work for a company like that (in which case you don't).\n\nAnd that's the ideological answer: if you don't want to work for a company that expects you to be on call without being officially on call (i.e., getting paid more for it), then you shouldn't just go along with that stuff.",

The mental health stuff is no joke and honestly sounds like you went through something really intense with that whole family situation realization.\n\nLook, the 3 year gap thing... yeah it's gonna come up in interviews but it's not the career killer you think it is. I've seen people with way bigger gaps get hired, especially in tech. The key is how you frame it. You don't need to go into all the personal details. Just say you took some time to deal with family issues and explore entrepreneurship, then pivot quickly to what you learned and why you're ready now.\n\nThe fact that you were getting recruiter calls right after graduation tells me your technical foundation is solid. CS First Class from a good uni + those A-levels? That doesn't just disappear. But yeah, 3 years is long enough that you'll probably need to refresh some skills.\n\nThis might be controversial but have you considered doing a bootcamp to get back up to speed quickly? I've heard Metana actually get a fair number of people who already have CS degrees that wants to update their skills or switch to a different stack. It's way faster than trying to self-study everything and the structure might help given what you've been through mentally.\n\nThe business thing with your friend though even if it didn't work out, you learned something about building products and working with customers. That's actually valuable experience, don't discount it.\n\nFor the immediate job hunt, maybe start with some contract work or shorter term projects? Less scrutiny on the gap, gets you back in the game, and you can build up recent references. Once you have 6-12 months of recent work under your belt the gap becomes way less of an issue.\n\nYour technical skills are still there, just need some polish. The mental health journey you went through actually shows resilience even if it doesn't feel like it right now.",

There were predictions that we‚Äôd have fully autonomous vehicles within a few years. Millions of truck drivers, delivery drivers, and taxi drivers would suddenly be out of work. Progress has been made, like Waymo‚Äôs driverless taxis, has been made. But, it has much slower and the edge cases have much harder to solve than anticipated. I think we might see AI play out similarly where progress is slower and the edge cases, which are kind of infinite when talking about general use AI, are harder to overcome than the hype masters hope. \n\nOr maybe someone will release AGI tomorrow. ü§∑",

If you're not eligible, that's bad since you could have talked your way into a US visa with communication skills. If you are eligible then it's good since bad communication skills w.r.t selling yourself won't result in a visa rejection. \n\nPlus UK doesn't have the country quotas which US has, so regardless of country of birth you can settle into a long term life after 5-10 years. If you're born in India/few other countries, realistically you'll be on a H1B forever in US which needs you to leave the country within about 60 days if you lose your job/annual renewal gets rejected. And comes with some challenges when travelling outside US",

You'll still need to be solid on your data structures and algorithms because they will test you on them, but these companies care way more about your ability to work with graphics programming, real-time systems, and domain-specific knowledge. The technical rounds often include questions about 3D math, rendering pipelines, performance optimization, and sometimes even creative problem-solving scenarios related to animation or game development.\n\nThey're looking for people who are genuinely passionate about the intersection of technology and storytelling, not just someone who can grind through algorithm problems. Your portfolio and previous work in graphics, games, or creative tech will matter just as much as your coding interview performance. I'm on the team that built [interview AI](http://interviews.chat), and we've helped people prepare for these kinds of specialized technical interviews where you need to handle both traditional coding questions and industry-specific scenarios that these creative tech companies throw at you.",

Not like a coffee chat with someone, but like you've delivered value to them somehow already and they're willing to take a gamble on you. To get my first job out of a boot camp I took a gig stocking shelves in a warehouse at a tech company, networked my ass off for a year internally, and got hired into the next junior role they had.\n\n\n2. Build useful things. Not a movie rating app, build something that you could charge money for. In fact, if you can actually monetize it, that's the best case scenario. Ideally, you'd build something that confronts some of the more challenging problems in web design. An app that solves caching problems with real time interactivity across users is cool and shows something, but your movie rating app won't count for hardly anything.\n\n3. Don't go remote. Anyone in the world can compete for a remote job, so it's orders of magnitude harder to stand out. Apply for in-office jobs with local companies who can meet you face to face. It filters out the competition and let's you make the process a little less sterile.\n\n\nHonestly, if you're 100% self taught, you need a bangin project. Even with boot camp programs you get some kind of \"OK, they know *something*\" assurance. If you're self-taught using online resources (which is what I would consider Udemy) you're going to need to be able to show some good work.\n\n\nThe good news is that if you *can* show good work, I think a self-taught dev that can build is always going to be viewed more favorably than a boot camp dev who can build, just because self-taught takes some grit.",

They'll be looking at your academic background, research projects, letters of recommendation, statement of purpose, fit with the program, GRE (if required), and stuff like that. \n\nI took a look at your philosophy of mind writing. It's... not good. You'll need to stop using chatGPT to help you write stuff. Even if you think it's your own voice and ideas, having an LLM rewrite your stuff will invariably introduce semantic shift as well as ideas that aren't your own. Using an LLM to help you write like this at all will instantly torpedo any academic aspirations you have. You're going to need to learn how to express your thoughts on your own. \n\nChatting with LLMs can make you feel like you're learning a lot and that you're making deep insights, but that's the sycophantic nature of chatbots. But it's actually very shallow because it doesn't understand anything. It's just good at generating sentences and paragraphs that looks good on the surface. It might seem deep to someone who's deep in the Dunning-Kreuger well, but it's mostly just superficial repetition to an expert.  \n\nYou didn't engage any other thinkers at all, didn't connect anything you're saying to any published work, and there's just zero rigor. Be careful \"self-studying\" philosophy in this way. It's not preparing you for an academic program in philosophy. This is the equivalent of someone self-studying about CSS and learning how to change colors and themes on a webpage, and thinking that they've made some insightful leaps in the theory of computer science. \n\nSo just be careful with that. If you want to learn how to do philosophy, you need to deeply engage with a large catalogue of serious literature. LLMs, pop writing on Buddhism, and Sam Harris won't cut it past a 100 level undergrad philosophy class.",

I think being in an academic setting and engaging with real professors and classmates would allow me to step past the stage I‚Äôm at currently which I agree is not very good.

You're not going to be asked to architect Netflix's entire streaming platform, but you might get something like \"design a simple URL shortener\" or \"how would you build a basic chat application.\" The key is understanding fundamental concepts like databases, APIs, caching, and load balancing at a high level rather than diving deep into complex distributed systems.\n\nFocus your prep on the basics: know the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases, understand what a load balancer does, grasp basic caching concepts, and be able to draw simple diagrams showing how a web application talks to a database. Practice explaining your thought process out loud because interviewers care more about how you think through problems than getting the perfect solution. Even if you stumble, showing logical reasoning and asking clarifying questions demonstrates the problem-solving skills they're really evaluating.\n\nI'm actually part of the team behind [interview help AI](http://interviews.chat), and we built it specifically for these kinds of tricky interview scenarios where you need to think on your feet and articulate your reasoning clearly.",
