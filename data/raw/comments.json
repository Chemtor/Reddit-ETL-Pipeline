If we could enforce rules right from the source, it would help a lot. \n\nIn practice, that would require a culture of the entire company agreeing on data practices.

SQL Server actually has columnar storage, which is useful for OLAP workloads, through using the \"columnstore indexes\".\n3. Extract logic: Python, could use some higher level framework like Meltano or dlt.\n4. Transformation logic: DBT, could be replaced with SQLMesh.\n5. Orchestration: Dagster.\n6. Git server: Gitea, could be replaced with newer fork Forgejo.\n7. Dashboarding: Metabase. It is much easier to use than Superset.\n8. Ad-hoc analysis: SQL, Python or R.\n\nIt worked perfectly fine on a single production server, although it was planned to split it into one server for production pipelines and one server for ad-hoc analytics, for more production safety.",

Analytics focused pipelines and business logic (more advanced dbt models such as mrr models). Technical overlap with the data engineers and business logic overlap with the analysts. Not so much focused on optimal usage of compute and so on but more focused on business.\n\nData analyst -> data modelling in dbt to the specifications of the analytics engineers and data engineers and most importantly of course: analytics. The analysts in our company also write similar models to the analytics engineers but usually with less of a focus on complex models and more of a focus on analyses. Though that can vary on a need by need basis.\n\nThe data engineer never does analytics or visualisations and neither does the analytics engineer. However, all are required to work with git and dbt. We also require knowledge in these technologies for analysts but most analysts would no know how to set up a dbt project or how to structure it. That's not their focus. But they still need to understand dbt well enough to create models and run tests, for example.\n\nData engineering is definitely still viable. Basically, they are the people that keep the data sphere clean from a technical point of view and most knowledgable when it comes to setting up infrastructure (the analysts will never set up a dockerized dagster ec2 instance to orchestrate pipelines, neither will the analytics engineers, at least no in our company). And everything downstream hinges on that technical ability. For example: I, as a data engineer, run around the dwh and pick up queries to optimise. I can often reduce runtime from something like 1 hour to 2 minutes by configuring materialisation and implementing proper requirements for partition pruning (snowflake). Analysts usually don't know how the systems work under the hood in order to effectively do this themselves.",

One thing that isn’t talked about enough here is that if you have on-prem it has its own costs that are slightly different from being cloud based, such as physical maintenance of the equipment as well as purchasing the equipment. I view it in the same way I do a legal capacity in a company, not every company needs to have a dedicated legal capacity available to them at all times, so they outsource that bit (in our case use a dedicated consultancy to run it all, likely cloud based for access). Over time they may bring in a singular lawyer to coordinate things and deal with the majority of the paperwork, but they’ll still need advice or capacity help (singular data person with consulting support probably still cloud based). Then you have a mix of stuff where the legal department expands all the way to a full blown department with dedicated head count and seat at the board (everything from a small data team who are cloud based to a dedicated data department who have at least one person for every role including maintenance because they’ve brought it on-prem) but even then that legal department won’t be able to cover every single base and will have to bring in external help on occasion, probably keeping someone on retainer (there’ll still be some workloads cloud based).\n\nWe all look at this as a purely technical and budget problem whereas you need to take a far more holistic view of the requirements of the individual business.",

No.\n\nThe original problem was two fold: 1) reporting was being done against transactional databases which slowed those transactional systems down noticeably and 2) it’s wasn’t spreadsheets it was extracts. Systems were very siloed in the pre-ERP days and all of these systems needed to be connected with data extracts - often time for reporting purposes. The extracts all were done at different times causing massive data quality issues. Data warehousing was invented to deal with these two issues. Spreadsheet technology was just ramping up at this time, and would soon become yet another challenge for data professions, but it was not the original challenge. Remember, in the pre-1980s the average office worker didn’t have a computer.\n\nEdit: the star schema was added early on to help BI queries execute more efficiently on database platforms at the time (and be more understandable to analysts as PCs became more widespread in the workforce). Star schemas are still very important today, but as our computing resources have grown the performance benefits are not quite as apparent.",

Many services, cloud providers, and other stacks will work natively with open formats in a DL/DLH. So you can always leverage or pivot different technologies.

For example, the above about DL/DLH are objectively better at transformation engines and scalability. However, if your users eat and breathe TSQL, and refuse to learn anything else.

There are certain ratios you are looking for to help those joins perform. For example, your fact might be billions of rows but dim date will always be thousands. Joining time dimension with date dimension to create a datetime dimension (at the… millisecond? grain) is really against the idea here. Similar to a degenerate dimension like a source system unique key - does it go on the fact or a separate dim? Well, if it’s a unique value per fact row (ie: it’s 1:1 with fact) then it should go on the fact, not in a dim. \n\nIf you take some time and revisit dimensional modeling points like these you will see that you are correct, and the idea here is certain ratios.

Not every source has timestamps at the second/millisecond resolution. Sometimes you just have dates. So if you build a datetime dimension at the second granularity, either you'd have to arbitrarily assign those dates to the first second of the day, which is misleading and wrong, or create a different dim_date dimension anyway.\n\nFor a similar reason it's sometimes useful to have a separate dim_month table with year-month as the key (can be created as just a view on the dim_date table.) If you get data that is only available at the month resolution, you can either assign it to a specific day (not ideal) or use the month dimension to faithfully represent the data as it was recorded in the source.\n\nRetain the timestamps as measures, use two dimensions as you have.",

This makes it very easy to gradually adopt dataframely in a code base (and, similarly, to get rid of it again).\n* Dataframely natively implements the definition of schemas instead of \"dispatching\" to pydantic. This allows for much more flexibility in the schema definition.\n\nSecond, dataframely provides a bunch of features that patito does not currently implement:\n\n* Support for composite primary keys\n* Validation across groups of rows (i.e. grouping by one or more columns, ensure that the _group_ satisfies a condition)\n* Validation of interdependent data frames with a common primary key (dataframely introduces the concept of a \"Collection\" here: invalid data in one data frame can then also remove rows from another data frame)\n* \"Soft-validation\" via `filter` which allows to partition data frames into rows that satisfy the schema and rows that don't\n* Structured info about failures that can be used e.g. for more debugging or advanced logging\n* Integration of the schema with external tools (e.g. export to SQL schemas)\n* Automatic data generation for unit testing, both for individual data frames and collections (in this case, dataframely takes care of generating rows with common primary keys to allow rows to be joined)",

Sure, spark sql can work as a general query engine, but it wasnt really designed for that.\n\nThere’s some differences under the hood, particularly around how spark executes in stages, and uses more I/O steps than Trino.\nEssentially, for ad-hoc queries that change frequently, or you rerun things to change and shape results, Trino will nearly always be more performant. You can make some tweaks with a spark application (and then run it interactively to try and do the same), but tbh, Trino’s entire design, really, is for extremely fast reads on object storage datalakes.\nSpark is better places for wide ranging transformations, that are potentially more complex in nature. A good example here is the fault tolerance nature of spark, which matters way more in big batch pipelines, than analytical ad hoc queries. Sure, data loss and the task fails, just re fire the query. In a pipeline, you cant manually do that if its all running automated. \nAgain, different horses for different courses in my opinion.\nI see it a bit like:\nSpark was a natural successor to Hive, for better big data transformation.\nTrino was a successor for something like Impala, as a faster query engine over datalakes",

In my opinion, the key differentiating feature between Trino and Spark is not the speed, but support for fault tolerance, which is required for batch workloads. As such, many organizations deploy two separate systems, despite the increase in complexity, added infrastructure costs, and the overhead.\n\nI think Starburst is well aware of this trend, and they are promoting Trino with fault tolerance suport. You can find some report that Trino with fault tolerance enabled works well in production and even saves the compute cost. From our own testing, however, Trino with fault tolerance does not work well for large queries (which it is designed for) because Trino coordinator crashes repeatedly. In any case, even Starburst recommends two separate deployments of Trino, one for interactive and another for batch. So, I think it is (and will remain) common to deploy separate systems for batch and interactive: Trino + Spark, Trino + Trino with fault tolerance, Trino + Hive-Tez, and so on.\n\nThat said, we offer a solution that simplifies operations and reduces costs by eliminating the overhead of maintaining two separate systems, with a single unified system. It's based on, well, Apache Hive (with the MR3 execution engine). If you are interested, please visit our website: [www.datamonad.com](http://www.datamonad.com)",

Instead of rebuilding everything to be streaming, would it be possible to just build the cheating detection as a real time alert?\n\nThis touches on another concept where real time alerting is required so the thought process is to make everything real time. However, I have always pushed back and highlighted these are two completely different concepts.\n\nMost data is used to look at trends over time which at that point, the recency of data is irrelevant since usually it is being aggregated up. Separately, you have certain events end users want to be alerted to immediately but you aren’t as concerned in the moment about seeing the trend, such as in this case you are trying to detect cheating. So what you could do is build a real time “cheating alert” which while yes, you are increasing the complexity of that, but there is justification for the cost and need because it isn’t ideal to wait to evaluate if someone is cheating or not.",

You can achieve all of that with your own system especially if it is encrypted because as you noticed, you can't use autoloader out of the box for that.

Focus on high level info (like this query takes transaction data and joins with customer information and customer returns info or something). Drawing chats can be really helpful, i use lucid chart through my company but theres free alternatives out there, or use a pen/paper. There's not really an easy answer (that I've seen) but you'd be surprised how much progress you can make slowly and steadily. \n\nOnce you understand the whole thing, then I'd create a new/optimized process in parallel so you always have the old one running in the background and can compare results over time. It can also be helpful to understand the sources of the data to get an idea of what each section is doing. You mentioned that there's no incremental processing, maybe look at some of the larger tables to see how you can process those incrementally or check if there are any obvious bottlenecks in the query logic and fix those",

You’d keep a simple table of processed file paths (or timestamps), and compare that during each run. Only process the new files, then update the table. It’s a bit (way) more work but gives you control\n\nThat said, if this becomes hard to maintain or scale, check out [Estuary](https://estuary.dev/solutions/technology/apache-iceberg/).

They let you schedule workflows using Cron and you can execute them via API call or manually as well. It’s fine for generally lightweight tasks that you’re not worried about long term and it gives you a good space to workshop some ideas. Actions are close to your codebase, you can easily use secrets and keys, and it should give you a quick overview of how these sorts of pipelines work. \n\nIf the jobs are not data streaming and are just scheduled batch jobs then it’s good training.",

For example, I’d like to get notified (e.g., via email) when a sensor value crosses a certain threshold, so I can keep an eye on whether the sensors are functioning properly.\n\nIn that case, I might need to look into the data around that event, but most of the time I wouldn’t be constantly querying the live data. The system doesn’t need to be real-time either – near real-time is absolutely fine. On average, I might just visualize a handful of values per day unless there’s an issue.\n\nWhat is important, though, is that I’ll download each day’s data as a file for later analysis. I plan to convert the raw data into an MDF format with a daily job and then process it elsewhere. So everything I store, I will at least once download.\n\nThat said, it’s really hard to estimate how often I’ll query or access the data, since that heavily depends on whether problems occur or not.",

Nearly every tool that can be orchestrated has an integration with Airflow, usually as a first-class citizen.\n4) If you have the budget there are services like Astronomer that make setting up and maintaining Airflow much simpler.

We worked with a Faroese company information platform that pushed all their raw events into Flowcore — and even though the events were pretty basic (like CRUD changes and updates), we were able to layer meaning on top during replay to build dedicated AI-optimized models. The result was that they now have an AI chat interface where users can ask super abstract questions, like *“Which municipality had the most new companies in 2024?”* or *“Tell me about this specific person and all the companies they’re involved in”* — and it just works.

Tooling in this case is probably irrelevant - you just need careful engineering and separation of groups of tables that are being synced. Typically migrations are handled by modifying writers which temporarily write to both DBs. I'd probably stay away from Kafka/other queues because they will increase your synchronization lag. I can probably say more if you provide more details. What maximum latency are you looking for? I'm looking at a similar setup in production right now (MySQL -> PostgreSQL) and I see that under load P95 latency (time of write in destination minus time of creation of item in source) is about 850 ms.

Sometimes it's impossible to avoid, like for example when you're developing a new version of an EHR system and medical personnel of both systems should see fast updates to the orders table to avoid double administration of a drug to a patient. Perhaps you can mitigate this by having a filter table for order IDs that has information about which system created an order to break the loop. It will be a difficult project :)",

CoW vs. MoR: For update-heavy workloads, merge-on-read is usually more efficient with Iceberg. But frequent small writes still hurt performance (you’ll want to buffer and batch). [Here’s](https://estuary.dev/blog/apache-iceberg-cow-vs-mor/) a detailed article about the two.\n\n3. Event stream + materialized views: Send CDC to Kafka, then process and materialize into your lake in micro-batches. Works great if “near-real-time” is good enough and you have the resources to manage Kafka, Kafka Connect and Debezium yourself.\n\nIf you want to stay open source, something like Debezium + Kafka + Iceberg + Flink/dbt can do the job. But it can be a LOT to manage.\n\nIf you’re open to managed tools, [Estuary](https://estuary.dev) handles full load + real-time CDC into Iceberg out of the box (and runs merge queries for you!), and deals with all the tricky bits like ordering, deduping, and schema changes. Worth checking out if you want to simplify the stack. Disclaimer: I work at Estuary - happy to answer any questions!",

What this mean is that you would have new “schemas” and “tables” in snowflake that are technically never loaded in Snowflake but only lives in S3.\n\nReason for snowflake to do this is that they want you to use their query engine to load the data and do anything else with it. And since they will allow writes to iceberg table, someone could just use snowflake engine instead of spark for example if they don’t want to spawn a spark cluster themselves.\n\nThey also all have their own catalog which will have “more” feature then the other which would lock you in a little because anytime you derive from the default opening table specification you list interoperability with other catalogs.",

However, the overarching point is that we can do these types of workflows because everything is designed to be composable. \n\nThe composability is enabled by the expression system in Ibis and Arrow standard that we can build interfaces around. Our primary usecase is portable UDFs (backed by datafusion engine) and optimizing workloads based on the engine choice. The asof join usecase just happens to fit really nicely and has an added benefit of performance and guarantees provided by the semantics (not just functionality) that is common in ML. In ML, you may require asof joins to safeguard against data leakage, particularly useful if you deal with time series data at an organization level. Here is the duckdb blogpost on how they optimized it \n\nWe currently support a handful of engines but Ibis (the expression system xorq is based on) support 20+ engines. It’s really easy for us to add support for another engine (SQL or Python) so let us know if something that may benefit your workflow is missing. \n\nWe believe this work is necessary to build pipelines that can be easy to reason about and optimized without tying to a single engine/ecosystem.  Also, composite workflows are super common so might as well do it right!",

The queries are written in a way that negative issues can generate rows. If all tests pass, the dataframe is ready to be written in data lake.\n\n7. In the data lake, we do another round of adhoc testing to double check if everything works well\n\n8. Once done, a PR is raised and the code is merged into the main branch. This triggers another github action workflow that updates the production docker image of our data pipeline.\n\n9. The same image is triggered via our production airflow. Since we already have tested on test environment, it’s just the same code running on production so we are mostly sure that it would run.\n\n10. The final dataset on production as scheduled data check and alerts using collibra. This helps us getting issues beforehand and fixing it.\n\n11. For logging we use splunk and for incident management we do pagerduty. The github action also handles linting and formatting of our code. \n\nSo, yeah, we do a few things for testing our pipeline.",

If it's clean and in one place, it shouldn't be an issue for them. Though it's worth testing at least one pipeline with them to ensure it's fit for purpose.

Do you want to produce a weekly calibration report and dashboard to show the machines are in spec? Do you have a particular kind of analysis that is repeated multiple times a day that you'd like to automate?\n\n\nFor the use case of calibration reports, we collaborated with lab management to have a technican use the machine's proprietary software to export the raw data and a standard analysis to a csv report, and we stored these csv's in a specific network folder. Periodically, a scraper searched the networked folder for new data and loaded it to the warehouse. An ETL cleaned the data and formatted it so that it could be displayed on the calibration status dashboard. The cleaned data were also available on the self service abalytics platform. \n\n\nLab data is challenging because it's ofte less structured than data from an API or service backend. At all times you need to make sure the extraction and transformation process is representative of something physical that really happened. It involves a lot of conversation and buy in from stakeholders and lab management to do this right. So, I'd recommend to start there. ",

I'd recommend having a folder structure by instrument name, date, and split it either by user, by the test, or by both e.g:\n\n`FTIR/01Jan2025/Test/file.csv` or `FTIR/01Jan2025/User/file.csv` or `FTIR/01Jan2025/Test/User/file.csv`\n\n(I label dates like this because for my sins I have spent time working in QC where I sent samples around the world and we needed a universal date format everybody understood)\n\nThis will be on your local network so all computers connected to instruments can dump the data there and then you have a single location to point your data processing tools to.\n\n> The output files are typically in a binary format. Instrument vendors usually don’t provide parsers or APIs, as they want to protect their proprietary technologies.\n\nThis is a huge ballache.  You'll want to put all unprocessed binary files into their own folder and convert them into a digestible format if absolutely required.  Bear in mind each file might need it's own process, hence, the ballache.\n\n> In most cases, the instruments come with dedicated software for data analysis, and the results can be exported as XLSX or CSV files. However, since each user may perform the analysis differently and customize how the reports are exported, the output formats can vary significantly—even for the same instrument.\n\nOne potential way is to have a standardised output.  I get this massively depends on the instrument and testing although if that's possible, it would make everybody's lives easier.\n\n> Even if we can parse the raw or exported files, interpreting the data often requires domain knowledge from the lab scientists.\n\nWhich makes complete sense.  What happens to the data after you parse it? i.e. do you email it to specific users, do you have it printed out? etc\n\n> Given these constraints, is it even possible to build a reliable ELT/ETL pipeline?\n\nI'd say yes, although there's a high level of complexity.",

In my previous life I was a molecular biologist and I quickly found out that essentially all of the devices I used “proprietary file formats” were literally just XML. Obviously I don’t know your equipment, and I might be saying something very obvious to you, but reiterating that you should actually check this, don’t assume proprietary format = binary. If they are readable, you can either write custom parsers, or find some online.\n\nThat being said. It is quite ambitious to try and reimplement a whole bunch of specialised lab equipment software at scale.

People like to think if they can touch their server or hug their storage, it is better than hosting it in the cloud. It just isn't true. There are more controls in the cloud for access control and security than I have seen in anyone's data center and I have seen many Fortune 100 companies data centers. Starting from physical security to data in flight & at rest to designs clouds are almost always able to be more secure. The issues come with knowledge and implementation. This is the same no matter the location.\n\nI have secured data in cloud providers where not even the CSP can get to them and they remain very performant. It just takes a bit of creativity on your part.\n\nFrom an architectural standpoint, splitting your analytic workload across a wide area network is a bad idea. The physics just work against you. The bandwidth between on-premises and cloud is never enough. Consider bouncing a 1TB table at one location against a 1TB table at a different location. Even with tricks like  predicate pushdown and column reduction, you will still end up moving quite a bit of data to compare/join the tables. That has to happen over a WAN instead of an internal bus. It just doesn't fly. Like I said, the physics doesn't lie and can't be bargained with.\n\n<rant>The term \"Lakehouse\" is a Databricks marketing term and not a technical one. I try not to feed marketing monsters. The concepts behind their particular flavor of DW have been around for a long time. Don't get confused by a new coat of paint.</rant>",

You can do essentially everything without coding or minimal coding whereas azure SQL you'll be building a database with code by code.\n\nBeyond that you're going to have to get familiar with azure portal and azure tools versus dynamics/dataverse etc. azure portal is in general much more complex than the latter.\n\nAzure SQL will shine when you have more experience and are in need of more throughput. An example being dataverse handles queries through fetch xml which is rather slow and clunky versus a traditional SQL query you can execute in azure. Relationships between tables is also annoying and superficial in dataverse.\n\nIf you are new dataverse is a good POC platform until you outgrow it.",

No... unless you are a service provider you does this and helps companies get started or mature their DG in a cost effective manner. But for many it is a necessary evil and those in such roles are not treated well or not prepared properly or not even qualified (many DG folks are typically business users with no real understanding of the regulations they are supposed to police). \n\nWill it be safe in the near future? Say 2 years or so likely it will be a better choice for some but such programs take a while to settle.",

Give me a real-world problem and I guarantee I will get you a proper solution.  \n\nI've also worked with engineers who can crush LeetCode and regurgitate textbook explanations of algorithms, but can barely create a UI or write state management logic.  \n\nAll that to say, you are a programmer.  You have a specialty and you do it well.  If a company determines that a LeetCode problem is how they will gauge how you do your work, then it's best to just find a company who will give you a coding assignment that matches what you are passionate about.",

        "body": "*This is long, feel free to TLDR and move on.*\n\nHere's the problem with interviewing programmers. Most of us work with a large codebase that can take quite sometime to learn and work with, partly due to its size, partly due to its organization, and partly due to knowing what the program does. Consider a tax program. How long would it take for you to learn the various tax codes used to determine how much taxes you owe? OK, maybe if the software was well-designed, that part would be isolated to areas where tax experts could work on that logic.\n\nBut in many other situations, as part of building the software (or, more likely, maintaining it), the programmer becomes the de facto expert.\n\nIf I'm interviewing you, I can't have you look at our production software. Let's skip past the fact that it might be proprietary. Simply put, in an hour interview, you can't learn enough to absorb even a fraction of the details (which is often why people feel completely insecure when they're hired and have to deal with software that they don't understand).\n\nIn the past, sometimes the key was graduating from a top university. If you went to Stanford and could answer basic questions, then that degree could get you hired. The reputation of the university was enough. \n\nIt was also common to ask people brainteasers (I'll give you one in a moment). It was thought if someone was intelligent enough to solve brainteasers, they would be good coders. Turns out, not so true. Some people love and are good at brainteasers (for example, I liked brainteasers) and this can make such people feel perfectly qualified. After a while, the so-called FAANG companies realized brainteasers didn't really help.\n\nThe technical questions that were often asked in interviews were often confined to intro courses up to data structures and algorithms. That's because the typical CS major takes a bunch of optional electives in their 3rd and 4th years (in the US). You can't assume a person knows SQL or neural networks or undecidability or even NP completeness (at least, proofs of such problems).\n\nThey'd ask basic coding questions, instead.\n\nBut with leetcode, they can ask similar kinds of questions that rely on data structures and algorithms. These problems are self-contained, and more importantly, can be programmed without learning much and done in around 100 lines or less.\n\nThis is clearly not the kind of programming most people do which is why you're not so good at it. This skill is kind of important, but it's like learning knife skills and being able to chop something quickly. Maybe a working chef needs this skill. Maybe it's nice if a home chef has this skill. But you can make a great dish without this skill. It's a nice to have that may come in useful in certain situations.\n\nYou can do a simple search `how to solve leetcode problems`. There's even a leetcode subreddit /r/leetcode. There's a YouTube channel called neetcode where the guy tells you strategies to solve leetcode style questions. It's popular enough that there are lots of resources out there.\n\nThese questions have become today's brainteasers. They share similar qualities, but they are also unrelated to most typical programming.\n\nFinally, I mentioned a brainteaser, so here is a common one.\n\n> You have eight seemingly identical balls. One ball out of the eight is heavier than the other seven identical balls. Your goal: find the heavier ball. Your tool: you have a scale that tells you three pieces of information: the left side is heavier than the right side; the right side is heavier than the left; the two sides have equal weight.\n\n> Next piece of information: If I put an uneven number of balls on either side, say, 2 balls on one scale and 1 ball on the other scale, then the side that has more balls is *always* heavier.\n\n> One restriction. Each time you use the scale, I will charge you money. You want to save as much money as possible. What's the fewest number of weighings you need to find the heavier ball? And, tell me how to find it?\n\nThe other kind has to do with estimation or weird mental puzzles. \n\n* How many gas stations exist in the US?\n* If a commercial plane had its wheels on super treadmills that could go very fast, but the plane stood still (just as a runner on a treadmill doesn't go anywhere), does the plane lift off? Explain your answer.\n\nSorry for the long reply. It was meant to show why leetcode questions are being asked and to explain that it has little to do with your ability to program, but has become this necessary evil (it's not evil, to be honest, as it's useful but not essential to know this) in programming interviews.",

All the knowledge I had accumulated up until then was an amalgamation of all the random things I saw on the Internet and in books.\n\nReading the docs actually gave me an overview of all the basics. And yes, there definitely were a couple things I just didn't know. And it made some things so much clearer.\n\nSo here you go, have fun:\n\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html",

        "body": "Some hard-won advice on this topic:  \n\n1. Have a good working relationship with your manager. Build trust. This will ensure they _actually hear you_ when you ask to take on opportunities to push yourself. Pushing yourself without this trust can cause your manager to view you as self-sabotaging (causing delays, \"biting off more than they can chew\"), which makes everything harder.  \n2. Identify the developers on your team (or close to your team, this includes DevOps, architects, and even senior QA) who actually care about the quality of their work. Like someone else in this thread said, many people work in software simply because of the pay. Sometimes the \"this is just a job\" people are very talented engineers, but it's not as likely. When you find the people who really care, pair with them on your work, go to them with questions, etc.  \n3. Don't waste time, but ask questions when you can. In particular, if someone more experienced than you has work you can look at (e.g. in a pull request), and their implementation doesn't line up with how you would have approached the problem, ask them (politely/when it's convenient) to help you understand why they chose their approach vs your \"obvious\" approach. A major strength of more senior engineers is their ability to perceive/understand complicating factors, with nuance (see the last sentence in #4). A word of warning here... don't ask endless follow-up questions/don't get really in the weeds on every little thing. You run the risk of being seen as overly pedantic, nitpicking, or wasting time (for the pull request example, keep in mind that often the PR is only a final \"does this make sense to everyone?\" check before merging new code. So a developer might not appreciate having long conversations on every PR. For this reason, having a conversation or DMing them is often better than leaving a vague question as a PR comment).  \n4. Get involved in the design process as _early_ as possible. If you have the opportunity to sit-in on a meeting with an architect/dev lead while they design a new feature/project/service, _do it_. You won't be able to contribute (probably), and that is fine. But especially if these people are the ones you identified in #2, watching them work through a complex problem from the beginning will be a great learning experience. A big part of having engineering expertise is knowing what's important vs what is not important to the actual business requirement(s) (especially as it relates to the existing constraints of your application), not just knowing the ins and outs of your language/framework.  \n5. Talk to your coworkers about the work and build up your reputation as someone who cares. When you discover cool language features or software development practices, bring them up with people (\"I found this cool HN article the other day talking about <.NET feature>, do we use that here?\"). Then, when other devs are working on something new, they'll think \"I bet /u/Spiritual_Donkey_521 would love to hear about this.\" This can help get you exposed to parts of dev work you wouldn't normally encounter until later in your career.",

Make it known to the seniors around you that you're really invested in learning, ask to take on harder tasks, be willing to say \"I don't know how to do that but if you give me a chance I'll figure it out\" and sincerely mean it.\n\nI think the big thing that stops juniors from becoming seniors is a lack of ambition - some people, a lot of people even, are content to just do their job and not stretch themselves to learn or do anything new. But if you show you've got intelligence and motivation and are eager to step up, the opportunities to do so are usually there - they just usually aren't handed to you.\n\nA lot of this depends on the specific work environment you're in, of course. Big tech focused companies tend to put more thought into how to develop talent, but if you were employed there you'd probably already be asking whoever you report to during a performance evaluation instead of asking us. But at smaller companies or non-tech focused ones, you might have to be more forward in hunting down opportunities to grow.\n\nI am writing this assuming you're already professionally employed as a software developer.

It does not hold your hand and allows you to make mistakes and shows you really how computers work. After that, build difficult projects, don't watch step by step tutorials or copy code. It will be a struggle, but you will learn a lot when you force yourself to do these exercises. I suggest things like a web server in C, Building an ORM in any OO language.

What language, and libraries do you have to or want to use? Systems development? What tools do you want to build and what hardware will you be supporting? One reason people get hung up on where to start is they don't know what road they are on or even where they want to go. Answering these question will narrow things down considerably. Once you know what road you're on, pick a destination that interests you, something that you would enjoy building and may even use yourself when you're done. If you want to get even more spicy then build something for someone else to their specs. \n\nOnce you've determined your environment and what you're building then start small and keep building. Most big projects are a series of smaller projects that are fit together to form a whole. List what you need in the order that you will need it. For example, a website to provide a public bulletin board would need:\n\n1 ) A landing page that explains the purpose of the website\n\n2 ) A login page that consists of a page to create a login, a page to actually login once a login is created and a page to recover a forgotten password. \n\n3 ) An admin page that allows a user create, modify and cancel their postings\n\n4 ) A postings page that shows the postings from the various users.\n\nThat's a simple example, and far from complete, but you get the idea. Each of those steps can be a separate mini project on your way to creating the whole project.",

When I first started programming, all of the programs I had to write were for things that didn’t interest me or were not practical at all so I didn’t really care.\nOne of my interests is investing in the stock market. One day I was wondering whether there was a way in which I could predict the direction in which a stock could go and whether I could achieve this with a program. I found a tutorial online that did it with one stock, but I changed it slightly, so it worked with another stock I wanted to see.\nIt didn’t really help at all because you can’t really predict anything in the stock market with absolute certainty, but it was still really cool to write a program that accomplished this.\n\nTLDR: Think about something you really care about/are interested in and try and find ways to write programs that help you understand more about that topic(s).",

Having a cheat sheet is helpful.\n\nSo, work with git is done locally in your local folder where you store your source code. When ready, you explicitly send your changes to the master copy on the remote git server. \n\nTo open a code project (and any of its branches) locally, you need to copy it down to a folder on your local machine. That’s what git clone does. It makes a local copy of a remote repository that you will then work in. You generally use it once when you join a team working on a codebase or if you get a new laptop or something.\n\nOnce you clone, you get to the second command: checkout. In every other source control system I’ve ever used, checkout means you want to edit something and want to prevent or inform other users of that. In git it means either you want to switch to a certain branch or you want to make a new branch from the current branch. Just remember that. Checkout is for local branch switching and changes nothing in the remote repository.\n\nHere are the basic commands for doing local work and explicitly communicating it to the remote master copy:\n\nFetch - I want to update my local list of branches and their history so I can view what my coworkers did and maybe checkout someone else’s branch if needed.\n\nPull - I want to update my current branch with the latest changes from the repo. This may prompt a merge if there are conflicts. You often do this to update your local copy of a main develop branch and rarely the one you’re actually working in.\n\nPush - I want to send my committed changes to the repo for other people to use. This may trigger build automation.\n\nStash - I want to preserve select changes in a local side store while rolling back the files for tracking purposes. You do this to preserve a draft for future use.\n\nMerge - I want to move changes from my current branch into another (e.g. I’m done with my feature and want to merge it into the main dev branch). This is done locally. You pull dev first. Then commit and push the merge into it. \n\nThat merge btw, is often done using a process called a pull request which puts a review request in front of the merge.",

Nothing about what's on these exams, nothing about the types of questions you're consistently getting wrong, or any other information anyone here could use to help you. \n\nJust a general \"I can't figure out programming.\" What does that even mean?

It doesn't matter how simple, or whether it has been used before.  The first games I wrote were:  A top down racing game similar to Rally-X.  A top down shooter similar to 1942.  A pong game with powerups.  A pong game played on an elliptical playing field where both players could move around the entire ellipse and the ball changed colour when you hit it (so you lost points if the ball went out of the ellipse when it was your colour).\n\nThese were all simple games, and some of them never got finished, but it taught me a lot about how to build things, and projects like these helped me land my first job as a graphics dev.\n\nFor school, make sure you pass.  Go to office hours.  Find other students you can study with.  There were times during my university days when I locked myself in my room for 2-3 days.  No computer.  Just a textbook and some paper.  I read the textbook and took notes by hand.  Then I read the textbook again and took more notes.  Then I copied my notes and cleaned them up.  Then I copied them and cleaned them up again, until I was at the point where I could probably write them out again without looking at the textbook.  I did whatever it took to learn the material.\n\nIt will take time.  Find time every day to put some effort into it, even if it is only ten minutes.  After I had three kids, I wondered how I would ever be able to learn something new again.  Then I realized that even ten minutes a day adds up to \\~60 hours per year.  The first year I realized that, I taught myself how to play the guitar just by spending 10 minutes a day practicing.  Then piano the next year, then flute the year after that.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that it will take effort and time, but you can do it, and it will be worth it in the end.  But it starts by choosing a project and building it from scratch.  Then rinse and repeat as many times as it takes until things start to sink in.",

I never did and I hate that I never did. Now, years later, I'm amazed that I had a person ready to answer literally any questions I have about the subject of computer science. Anything. It's crazy.\n\nIf youre having trouble understanding what you don't understand, to the point where asking questions at all is hard, I do have one trick to take with a massive grain of salt: explain what you can to AI and ask it to rephrase what you say or point out what areas you're leaving out the most. Honestly, the act of explaining things to someone often shows me what I'm missing, but it also helps me when my brain is mush and I can't even begin to explain my lack of understanding. I'll do my best to explain what I can, even if it's between curses and insults and self-admonishment, and it's usually able to parse through the mess and pull out a bit of self confidence. It reminds me I AM absorbing something, but it also forces me to look at what I'm missing. Don't rely on it to spoon feed you the information because it's been proven that this negatively effects your ability to find the information alone, but having it rephrase your knowledge can help with your thinking of it, and, importantly, give you keywords to help your real searching, which you should always be doing outside of AI.",

For coding I find it too difficult to condense notes into really short fragments that you can quickly glance at over and over again to drill concepts from short term memory to long term memory. If the notes are too long, I'm not gonna end up returning to each of them 20+ times.\n\nNotes work so much better for something like language learning or philosophy. For language learning you can write word lists where you feasibly will return to every word 20+ times and reach that long term memory. And for philosophy you can do the same with 1-2 sentence long quotes.\n\nAlso, (for most of us) coding is our profession and not our hobby, so in a good way we are kind of forced to get that long term exposure to CS concepts anyways through our work that will lead up to the concepts sticking in our long term memory.",

Identify something you want to create or solve using programming languages as a tool and then plan it out and develop it. You said you want to build everything you want - what’s one simple thing you can start with?

Avoid copy/pasting code and try to do your own version of what is being taught. My partner has been a dev for 10+ years and in his free time works on projects to continue to solidify fundamentals. Especially when he's learning a new programming language. \n\n2.  Use pair programming with others to practice your technical communication and problem solving. There's no pressure / learning quite like working with another person. You can join this slack group if you want to meet a community of developers who meet to pair program (https://join.slack.com/t/codesmithx/shared\\_invite/zt-344q2e9dd-HtR4EmgU5U\\_q3dBYgc28yw) Full disclosure: this is related to the company where I work, but I do feel it's an excellent resource and we have folks at various levels looking to pair program)",

You just might be the latter, since you put an emphasis on wanting to build something. Leetcode is most definitely for the former. \n\nUse AI. To learn (not to vibe code). Ask it what it needs to know, and learn what you don't know from there. Then ask it how to build what you want. But don't just copy and paste everything—read the code, understand it, and then type it out yourself. Repetition makes perfect. \n\nAlso, everybody learns and understands the world differently.

The specific choice here doesn't matter. Just pick something. You'll learn.\n\nStep 3: Start from the beginning and Google where you get stuck. First, you might need a window. Do you know how to do that? Google if not. Okay, now you need to draw something. Do you know how to do that? Google if not. Rinse and repeat. You will be doing a lot of googling. This is normal and expected. Be patient. And work on it until you're done. If you do find you overestimated what you can accomplish, just shelve the project and consider an easier one before you pick it back up. You do not need to give up on the idea entirely.",

You usually don't use classes in Python, but you will need to structure the classes. Think of the Service Class as the class that defines the functions you use in the Application Class. The Application Class is supposed to be the one that is run and will provide the UI and functions that are built on the Service Class.  \n2. Learn How to Use UML Diagrams. UML Diagrams will be very useful in the long run as they tell you all the functions you need to program with. Here's an example structure:  \n  \n\\------------------------------------------------  \n|                       Class Name                           |  \n\\------------------------------------------------  \n|            Variables in the Constructor            |  \n\\------------------------------------------------  \n|                Functions in the Class                  |  \n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n3. Think of the Language as Python, but instead of tabs,     you use curly braces {}. You also must not forget to add the include for the scanner. The scanner is like the iostream C++ library. It provides functions used to take in input. Make sure to reference the scanner by using Scanner scannerName = new Scanner(System.in); \n\nSo those are my tips. If you have any questions, please reply to this message or ask ChatGPT.",

Therefore, c^(k+1) ∊ O(cᵏ) cannot be true, which in turn means that O(c^(k+1)) cannot be a subset of O(cᵏ). Therefore, by the definition of set equality, the two sets cannot be equivalent.",

Here, **O(c\\*(k+1)) = O(c\\*k + c)**. Here,  **c\\*k > c ie c\\*k** will be **asymptotically bigger** than **c ,** because c,k are variables and nonetheless will be positive, and since in Big-O, we care about the dominant term, therefore it will be **equal** to **O(c\\*k**). An example can be c = 10 and k = 10. c\\*k = 10\\*10 = 100. c \\* (k+1) = 10 \\* 11 = 110, which is asymptotically equal. \n\nHowever, for the other case ie **O(c\\^k) Vs O(c \\^(k+1))** ; here **O(c\\^(k+1)) = O(c \\* c \\^ k)**. However , c is a variable and **not** a constant. Therefore, **c\\^(k+1)** is **not** asymptotically same as **c\\^k**. Therefore, **O(c\\^k)** and **O(c \\^(k+1))** are **not equal.**  An example can be c = 10 and k = 4 . c\\^k = 10\\^4 and c\\^(k+1) = 10\\^5 ; a **10 times** increase in the running time**.** \n\nThis is my interpretation , I could be wrong as well. Please correct if my approach is wrong. \n\n(Also, note that though c,k are input variables, when we use them in Big O , it is expected that they are large positive values, because we care about the asymptotic growth as the input size gets large. So all inputs are expected to grow larger and larger. For people who are not familiar with the word 'asymptotic', in general it means that how fast the running time will grow when input size increases. Take two functions : n\\^2 and n , where n is the input. For some duration, n\\^2 and n will run in parallel, but as n increases, n\\^2 will grow rapidly compared to n , then we say that n\\^2 is asympototically larger than n. )",

What would you need to do in order to receive a full-time offer?\n\nIMO it's somewhat unprofessional/odd that you were not given that feedback: part of the job of a manager is to make sure every employee knows if they're meeting expectations/remove uncertainty about where they stand. But that's by-the-by -- I think the important thing here is to get direct info + directly ask for the feedback you're looking for.\n\n> I’ve been doing a programming internship at a big, globally known company for a year now\n\nThe length of your internship is pretty unusual. Maybe this is a regional thing, but at least in my corner of the world (US west coast), most internships last ~3-4 months, typically during the student's summer break.\n\nIn any case, I do think it's reasonable for you to be feeling burnt out. I don't think it's reasonable to expect you to juggle both schooling and work for this amount of time.\n\n> When I landed this internship, I had zero technical knowledge and was just starting my degree.\n\nI'm a little surprised by this, tbh -- somebody with zero technical background doesn't have the ability to contribute in a meaningful way in a programming role. It's an odd pick for an intern; usually you want somebody with partial experience so the intern mentor doesn't need to spend time covering the basics.\n\nDid the company know this when they hired you + ask you to go through some training program? Or was this more of a hybrid internship, where you applied some of your other skills in in addition to programming? What were their expectations?\n\nTBH my first instinct here was that the company did not set you up for success by hiring you at such an early stage in your career.\n\n> I made mistakes, of course,but no one really explained what I was doing wrong or how I could do better. \n\nAny internship program worth its salt should assign you a dedicated mentor. Do you have one? If not, can you ask your manager (or whoever is managing the internship program) to assign you one?\n\n> over time, I’ve started to feel like I’m being excluded. Nothing direct or obvious, but there are signs. I try to contribute, show interest, ask questions… but everything I do seems to go unnoticed. [...snip...] Despite being an intern, it often feels like we’re expected to deliver at the level of someone with years of experience.\n\nIt's hard to tell what's happening here without more specifics.\n\nFor example, maybe what's happening is that you rose to the occasion and people are treating as you as having roughly the same skill as a junior engineer -- and maybe they're leaving you alone since you seem to be doing fine and are not realizing you're actually struggling to keep up? Or alternatively, maybe they're disengaging because they need to focus on their own work now, or are burnt out themselves with teaching and mentoring? It's a bit hard to say.\n\n> Lately, I’ve been thinking that maybe I should try working at a smaller company—somewhere with a slower pace, less pressure, and where I might actually be able to learn and breathe.\n\nUsually an internship has a concrete end date; I'd try sticking it out until then. If yours does not, then I'm not quite sure what's going on tbh.\n\nOther things to try:\n\n- Quit to focus on your schoolwork. Find another internship next summer.\n- Add your current internship to your resume; use it to help you find an internship at a different but similarly well-regarded company.\n- Ask if you can transfer to a different team. Maybe the working culture will be different there?\n- Tell your manager that you're struggling to balance school and work and seeing if they can help adjust your workload. You're a student -- it's reasonable and correct for you to put your education first.",

But you'll also hit periods of this at new jobs, when joining new teams, starting new projects in parts of a product you haven't worked on before, when using new technologies, coming back to old technologies you haven't used in a while that have changed underneath you, on a Tuesday when the stars don't align just the right way...\n\nBasically, get ready to feel like a big ole dummy a lot of the time. And it never stops feeling awful when it happens, no matter how good you've become at the things that used to feel so difficult and complex.\n\nBut I promise: you *will* get better at what you're doing right now. In a few years you're going to look back at what you didn't understand or what you've misunderstood and wonder \"why did that seem so hard? It's so simple, it's so clear to me now!\"\n\nAnd you'll also get better *at getting better*. That feeling of *none of this makes sense and it makes me so mad* might only last a few month, or weeks, or days.\n\nNow, to improving your current predicament. You mentioned not getting feedback or support. It might be time to start asking for it directly from individuals. Here are some tricks I use:\n\n* \"Hey, I did <whatever> this way and it just feels wrong to me but I don't have enough context to know why or what would be better. Do you hav some time to go over it with me?\"\n* \"I'm about to start <whatever task>. Are there some other places in the code we've done something similar I could base my work off?\" Then see who wrote this and ask them for help too.\n* \"I could use some help just getting started. Do you have 30 minutes to [pair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) with me to get me going in the right direction?\"\n\nIf you don't feel comfortable asking directly, ask your manager similar question but ask them who would be good to speak to get answers. Then go to these people and say \"I'm doing <X> and <Manager> said you could help\" or ask your manager to ask them on your behalf.\n\nIf your teammates and manager won't help, it might be time to start asking in more public forums at the company. There are likely helpful people on other teams or in other parts of the organization. If *nobody* can or will help you your company might be, and this is the technical term, *fucked.*\n\nIt sounds like your career is already going to benefit from the reflected glory of the company. While money is nice, the most valuable benefit of working somewhere this early in your career is access to people who will help you learn and grow. It could very well be time to start looking around.\n\nFinally, once you're past this slump: work to model the behavior you wish you were seeing right now. Maybe someone is going to help unblock you or maybe you're going to power through on your own. Either way, hold that door open for the next person.",

The tech field is notorious for being a bunch of socially useless guys. \n\nIf you understand the field and are socially not dead inside, you will be fine. Communication is really important, combined with the explicit knowledge. \n\nWhat I recommend is, instead of seeking help, try helping others. For me, I could learn so much better if I could explain stuff.",

I would (based on what I know) not consider it the equivalent of CS50x which is based on a Harvard course. That is, it's not aimed at a Stanford CS major (with Stanford being one of the highest regarded CS programs in the US), and therefore might be too challenging for a typical beginner. It feels like it's more beginner friendly and slower-paced.\n\nIn that case, I'd probably do CS50x. CS50p you could even do along with CS50x but they have different emphasis. CS50p is more like a series of Python exercises and is not CS50x in Python. CS50x is trying to introduce computer science concepts including programming, but covers other topics (later on) beyond just programming.\n\nI would recommend CS50x. Search for `cs50x edX 2025` and you can sign up for free at any time, and go at your own pace.\n\nBecause you've already had a year of programming, you should find the programming assignments (called problem sets) easier than most, but they are still fairly challenging. Most of the core material is in C though the first \"week\" is in Scratch which is a visual language aimed at beginners. Although the course is broken down in weeks, you can go at your own pace, either as fast as the course goes or much slower, depending on how much time you have available.\n\nThat's my two cents.\n\nOtherwise, you can look for courses in data structures and algorithms.\n\nMany of the courses you've mentioned are aimed at beginning programmers with no experience. CS50x, admittedly, is fast-paced. The nice part is you'd learn some C on top of Python you already know, which could be useful.",

The reality is you earn college credit by paying for it, but as an admitted college student at Harvard (the yearly tuition is about 60,000 US dollars which is around 52,000 Euros). In any case, it's an introductory course at Harvard, so it's not worth a whole lot.

Where do we start and where do we end.\n\nLet's start near the top, and cover the upper level bit.\n\nWhen you fire up your web browser, you basically get a blank canvas.\n\nYou type in the Domain Name of the website and hit go/enter.\n\nThat domain name is then looked up using a name resolution system called DNS (rabbit hole one) to get it to resolve to an address. This is very similar to you looking up your friend Bob in the contacts list on your phone, since names are easier than numbers.\n\nThe browser then sends a request to the server(s) residing at the address it got to download your web page. (Another rabbit hole here). This is done using the HTTP protocol (more rabbit hole), the web page is then likely to be created using HTML as the markup language (more rabbit holes). The HTML might inform the browser it needs additional bits which require additional requests to the server or even other servers. These include things like stylesheets (CSS) to make things look pretty, code (JavaScript), pictures (PNG, GIF, JPEG, etc), videos (MPEG4, etc), sound/music (MP3, WAV, etc), and others.\n\nAfter the first HTML page is downloaded the browser will start to render the page and all the content and the code may start to be executed. The code might do nothing until you interact with the page, or it might send a request to a server for some dynamic data, which would be another HTTP request to some server somewhere.\n\nEach HTTP request might involve a different server which we don't have the address for yet, so that would be another set of DNS requests to look up those addresses.\n\nThat's the near top level of how a website works with your web browser. \n\nYour next question might be how all these abbreviations, protocols, and the like work and how they all work together and for that we have a variety of central standards that specify how these work so everyone that needs to can implement their own. The majority of these are what are called RFCs (requests for comment) managed by the IETF (internet engineering task force) and we also have the w3c (world wide web consortium) and a few other organizations/groups made up of industry specialists like IANA (they're more involved in the DNS side).\n\nWe have a generic model for a lot of this called the OSI model, and that allows us to navigate the rabbit holes and find the occasional breathable pocket.\n\nHope that helps, Wikipedia has a lot of the extra information you might want to learn about, but beware of the rabbit holes (they're everywhere).",

        "body": "You might be jumping a bit ahead of yourself here... Here's a brief rundown of how this all works:\n\nYour PC has a network card. That NIC uses some black magic to establish itself as a given IP on your local network, let's assign it as 192.168.1.20.\n\nAny traffic on your network will be able to talk to your network card using that address, and if your computer talks to anything else on your network then the recipient will see it got a package from that address.\n\nOne such device on your network is a router, which is also connected to your ISP's network.\n\nWhen your computer tries to make a request to something not on your local network, say.... 8.8.8.8, then it asks the router if it knows how to get to 8.8.8.8. The router then asks the ISP, the ISP knows and then tells the router which tells the computer, the computer then sends the packet to the router to give to the ISP to give to 8.8.8.8.\n\nA similar process works for resolving domain names to server IPs.\n\nSo when you go to google.com, your browser asks your network card to ask your router to ask your ISP if that's possible. It is, and a request is sent to whatever address that google.com resolves to, \"Give me your home page.\"\n\nGoogle's server receives that request and after some processing sends back an HTML file, and probably a css and a JavaScript file. So an HTML file comes from Google to your ISP to your router to your network card to your browser, and a web page renders. Then your browser also executed the JavaScript that got sent and applies the css, not necessarily in that order. The JavaScript can then phone home by asking the browser to ask the card to ask the router to ask the ISP to give a message to Google, and so the cycle continues.\n\nTL;DR: By the time you get a webpage, a connection to the server has already been made at least once. The browser handles most of the details of connecting. The JS can make subsequent requests if the programmer deems it necessary",

But usually no they don't, because they're implemented in hardware which only supports a few precisions.Traditionally, those have been 32 bit and 64 bit. With machine learning, we're seeing a lot more interest in really, really low precision because it still works \"pretty dern good\" for big fuzzy matrix multiplies. So you'll see FP16, FP8, BFLOAT16, and other variants. But those are mostly confined to GPU tensor computing, not general purpose processing.  For 99.X% of general purpose applications, the hardware is super super fast and you don't care that much about precision. If you do care, you should probably be using fixed point.\n\nA good way to think of floating point is as a fraction between powers of 2. So for numbers between 32 and 64, you get 32 \\* 1.XXXX. That [1.XXX](http://1.XXX) fraction is the \"mantissa\" and the power of two is the \"exponent\". The number of bits in the mantissa gives you your precision. It's very precise near zero, and it gets a lot less precise for really big numbers. You can simulate any arbitrary precision you want in software though by just storing all the mantissa bits and simulating the floating point operations with fixed point.\n\nAnother interesting bit is that for machine learning, they do care a lot about the buildup of errors from layers and layers of floating point. They normally fix that by normalizing the output to be between 0 and 1 at each layer rather than messing with the precision of the multiplications.",

Also, it's a lot easier IMO to manage env variables, bash scripts, cron jobs, the list goes on. Linux and mac are just a lot more prevalent in the open source community and install instructions for libraries often assume you're using unix, or the windows instructions are an afterthought. That said, I wouldn't sweat it too much.

That being said, I think Go would be a good language to write a lower-level implementation of these tools, it's jsut that it would require a deep understanding of the filetypes you're concerned with converting between. If you want the challenge, I'd pick Go, C++, or Rust (in that order because I've never used Rust yet). Also you can't beat Python's simplicity and elegance, if production level speed isn't a concern, or you don't expect to need to batch operations, then you can write these tools out fully in pure python. Writing your own conversion software in Python then trying to use it for heavy work might feel sluggish if you're not very particular about optimization.",

Commit the stable files to the repo by running `git add $FILENAME` follewed by `git commit`.\n\nNow you have a snapshot of those files saved in your repo.

For example, a RESTful API endpoint is best written as just a standalone procedure rather than being a class method, since the API is inherently stateless and thus there is no state to encapsulate.

Honestly, it’s one of the most effective ways to land your first dev job. If you don’t already know people in tech, start building your presence: share your projects publicly (on GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn), write about what you’re learning, and try to connect with others working on similar stuff.

This way, it is closer to the function header, so everyone can see what kind of data is expected when looking at the header. Also, it reduces code complexity because.  You will generally need less (nested) if conditions. In this case, the if-clauses are greatly simplified because you don't need to check for the lower bound.\n\nSecondly, you don't need else-if clauses. The return statement kind of has an implicit 'else'-effect. Everything after a return statement is unreachable code, so the program will only reach the next statement if it did not go through the return statement.\n\nThirdly, this kind of code can probably expressed as a loop or even a one liner, because the if statements are very repetitive.

If you turn the knob all the way to the left, the musical notes generated by the sequencer will only be one musical step long.

The overall look and feel are on point. The way you’ve implemented functionalities, like task clearing intervals, is really smooth, and the light/dark mode toggle works flawlessly. Seriously, great work—I'm genuinely impressed!\n\nNow, just sharing some feedback and more of the approach I usually take:\n\nOnce the design is finalized and everything’s working as expected, I like to take a step back and imagine I’m just a user—not the creator. I try to look at it from a fresh perspective and ask myself: *What could I do differently? What can I learn from this?*\n\nSo, doing that here—on the initial “The Toh Do!” screen, I noticed the white space is quite prominent. The left side is dedicated to a vector graphic, while the right side houses the task list. If it were me, I might consider removing the vector and instead using that space for something functional—like a dashboard or a timer countdown panel, which could add value and balance out the layout.\n\nOne cool thing I picked up from your code was the use of Redux Persist. I’ve typically just used localStorage directly, but seeing how you’ve integrated Redux Persist has definitely piqued my interest. I’ll be exploring that for sure—thanks for the inspiration!\n\nKeep up the awesome work—this is a solid project and you’re off to a great start!",

        "body": "I am always blown away by the fact most people see videos, audio, and other formats outside of purely programming as time ill spent, or not a viable option. I see others refer to it as useful, but not as useful as other mediums, which I could agree with at times, especially for books. The other point I see other's highlight is that someone may not be as engaged with this content, but ultimately I believe that is up to the individual more than the content itself. \n\nPersonally, I find various formats useful, as staring at code for over 8 hours a day and then continuing to seek the same benefit from just coding seems to have diminishing returns based on focus levels. Arguably, YouTube may not be the best source of knowledge, but any exposure to coding concepts can be useful. \n\nIf you are seeking to learn material based solely on AI and ML I would highly recommend [CS50 AI](https://www.edx.org/learn/artificial-intelligence/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-with-python), and if this is too difficult at the moment, starting with [MIT CS Intro](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python) or [CS50](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science). At work, I have been trying to build out some AI solutions, and have studied up on material related to LangChain, leading me to find this video series that was helpful, [LangChain Master Class For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF9kGESAi3M).\n\nOn the other hand if you are feeling burnt out, I find some YouTube channels to be more hands off. At the same time, they can still be helpful for keeping up to date, or learning topics you may not be familiar with. They can also be purely entertaining, but still in the realm of programming. Here are a couple:\n\n*  [ThePrimeTimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen)\n* [t3dotgg](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg)\n* [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship)   \n\nFrom there you should be able to find other channels as well. As a last addition I enjoy listening to podcasts such as [Software Engineering Radio](https://se-radio.net/) and [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/). Depending on your interests you may find these enjoyable as well. Ultimately, being exposed to other professionals, their approaches, thought processes, presentation, and other tangential skills can be very useful in exposing you to new ideas, at least in my opinion.\n\nTo answer your question with how much time to invest, that can vary quite a bit. If you find you have more time to study something, you may go several hours. Other weeks you may spend hardly any time. To give you a personal metric of mine, I would say I invest about 20 hours outside of work on some weeks (2 hours per weekday, 5 hours on weekend days). This can vary based on if I need to know the material sooner, if I want to finish a resource in a timely manner, or lack the energy to focus. Often, I find that I will go back and reference this material again, possibly rereading or watching sections as refreshers, so it is not a race. Best of luck.",

I got there slowly, I was never overthinking stuff, my plan was never do it full time, at least from the beginning. I just wanted to build things.\n\nSo first I wanted to build an android game, that forced me to learn Java and Android studio. When I build a few silly apps like a custom flashlight, calculator, Todo lists, meal planner etc. I decided I want to make games.\n\nSo I picked up C# (guess what, it was really similar), I was watching Brackeys and I learned a lot about Unity3D, I learned to 3D model my assets in Blender, texture stuff etc. I made a few games (tower defense, endless runner and then I even published one game on App Store where you had to draw symbols on screen in order to destroy stuff that was falling from the sky)\n\nThen I decided that I would like to build a web app so my friends and family can use it. So I picked up JavaScript, then React. Made a few projects and web apps. (I already had 1 year old kid at this moment)\n\nAt that point I told myself. Man you're kinda good at this thing and you really like it, let's make a living out of it. So I started to apply.\n\nAnd here I'm, working as a fullstack from home for an awesome company with awesome people and a boss. \n\nThis journey took me about 6+ years of my life.",

That is so others can reproduce or at least understand your setup.\n\n\nYou mentioned \"ue5\" toward the end, but I had to google that to figure out you were talking about unreal engine. So probably you are working in C++, if I am not mistaken.\n\n\nC++ uses low level system data types. This can actually vary between system or machine architecture! But for the most part you are gonna have signed or unsigned ints, either in 32 or 64bits. These may be referred to as int or long, but make sure to check your specs.\n\n\nBut if you were working in python, integers support arbitrary precision by default. So 2\\*\\*1000 will spit out a number about 300 or so digits long, and 2\\*\\*(2\\*\\*1000) will just hang your system, because there's not enough memory in the universe to write that number down in base 10 format.\n\n\nSo even with arbitrary precision, there are practical limits. That's why it's called arbitrary precision not infinite precision.\n\n\nThere are one or more arbitrary precision libraries for C/C++. The one I have used is GMP. But it may be easier to just setup a python interpreter in many cases.",

Software engineering was a huge growth field in the 1990s, and people looking for a good career chose it.  Manufacturing has been in decline for decades, and so people should look other places for a good career.\n\nSoftware engineering is still a good skill for people who have been in the industry.

If you insist on treating the world as it was 30 years ago, you will be left out.  Don't go into manufacturing.  Don't write CGI scripts in Perl, or VB Forms or whatever.  Do data science, or focus on highly scalable data processing, or installing green energy sources like solar.  Whatever it is, look at what the world actually needs, and don't demand the world changes for you.\n\nEdit: it's been a long day for me.

I started obsessively documenting everything I learn and build. If others can understand the problem, they can solve it. \n\n3. Finding the right team culture matters more than the paycheck. Search for jobs that respect work life balance. A service like Applyre might be helpful here. I took a slight pay cut for a team that genuinely respects work-life balance.\n\nTech doesn't have to be a trap.

It isn't easy becoming a great software engineer and it isn't easy maintaining your edge by keeping your knowledge up to date.  It changes far faster than literally any other field in the world.  Being always on edge is a problem.  You need to learn to detach yourself a bit if that's how you feel 24/7.  You sound burnt out.  It's critical you learn to handle this cause it'll keep happening if you don't.\n\n1) Meditation, do it 30 minutes a day every single day.  Unplug, turn off your phone, no computer alerts, no tv, just meditate for 30 minutes every day.  Look up some videos how to if you don't know yet.\n\n2) Go into nature at least 1 day a week ideally but if you can take a walk in nature multiple days a week that's even better.\n\n3) You shouldn't be on-call all the time, there should be a rotation at the company.  If there isn't an on-call rotation, find another company cause the one you're in is toxic and unhealthy or if you have some seniority implement an on-call rotation and refuse to be available when it's not your day/week.\n\nThese are the strategies I use to manage it.

The downside of this role type is that when revenue falls or growth stalls, this is where the first layoffs occur.\n\nIf your work is not tied to revenue generation, it's seen as an operating cost and companies are always looking at finding ways to reduce operating cost. This role only exists because they can't fire you...yet. The upside here is that these roles are more protected from layoffs since your work is required for continued operation.\n\nIf you want work-life balance, stability and security, publicly funded work or unionized/protected work is (or was) your only option.\n\nIf you think things are different in other fields of work, think again. The only difference is that current market conditions make some fields more stable than tech is today.",

Everyone flaunts about how being a generalist is the way to go when in reality, big tech are the only companies who dont care about what tech stack you use or experience. Every other company that is not big tech wants someone well versed in the stack they use.\n\nIts not about the market being good or bad,  its always been like this. No one wants to hire a front end dev with 5 YOE to work backend unless its node.js if their backend is in java they will just hire a java dev.\n\nIts the similar principle to people who say they have 6 years of experience but in reality its a 2 2 2 model where they have 2 years of experience in different stacks and then all of the sudden you aren't qualified for a senior role because they want someone in that particular stack with the experience to match. I will die on the hill that specialization is the way to thrive in this field if you are not targeting big tech.",

Are you trying to get them to understand that you may not be able to achieve the goals set for the team? Are you trying to get help? Are you just venting?\n\nYour manager asked you to help fix the team. That means she’s probably already aware something is wrong with them and is looking for you to help come up with solutions or at least help identify what they’re doing wrong. If you need extra resources or to change the roadmap or need her to back you up on process changes, my guess is that’s all on the table, but she’s looking for your guidance and some semblance of a plan. Going back to her and just saying “this team sucks” isn’t helpful to anyone.\n\nIf I was your manager and you came back to me and said, “The team is broken and I can’t fix it. Please move me because I don’t want this on my resume.” I’d honestly be pretty pissed and it would impact our relationship. I’m looking for your help with a problem at your current job and you’re telling me no because you’re worried about your next job. If you came to me and said, “Here are the problems I see. I think we need to focus on fixing this tech debt for a while which should allow us to deliver faster in the future. If we can get one more engineer on the team I think that would help too.” That would be much more well received even if I couldn’t make that happen.\n\nVenting to your manager a little bit is fine, but most of the time if you’re bringing a problem to your manager you should also bring at least one suggestion of how to solve it. If the problem is something that they’ve explicitly asked you to help fix then having some ideas on how to fix this is almost mandatory. You can almost always bring problems to your manager as long as you frame it in a way where you’re trying to be part of a solution.",

I entered CS off the tail end of a failed academic career, so I've had a very strong toolkit for working on ambiguous problems and teaching myself things, plus I spent several years in my PhD learning how to program and math/stats.  Academic trainng is extremely just super helpful for any knowledge work job\n\nOther than be extremely good at what you're currently doing, having a natural interest in CS, and trying out random things all the time, is a huge benefit. For the last decade plus of my career I've really just followed the oppurtunity, and each step was just a different role in the process of building web applications. So I have done several different roles, but taking a step back, my skillset is unified under a broad \"develop web technologies in emerging domains\".  \n  \nThat said, for every transition, I've always narrowed in on one thing I want to do, and just apply to jobs of those types. Like my last job I was a team lead of an infrastructure team, and didn't really like that, so I decided my next job would be some sort of product engineering. That got me in to a big tech company, and now I get paid enough to just focus on leading a team, and besides a reading group and some side projects, I don't really stress about keeping my skills up.",

Got canned end of 2023 after taking a month-long parental leave. I took most of 2024 off to raise my newborn. I tried to convert to Data Analyst, didn't get much success, one place rejected me after I passed their leetcode because I lacked biomedical signal processing knowledge; did 4 interview rounds with an industrial imaging company before getting a reject (I passed their take-home programming test in round 3 but failed their coderpad test in round 4. My programming speed is my weak spot, I'm great at applied math/stats/machine learning, not so great at cooking up timed leetcode solutions). I'm also fed up with the grind mentality in tech and the frankly vexing way a startup runs. \n\nSo I decided to change career back to engineering. I registered as engineer in training with my provincial regulatory body. I'm already getting more replies and interviews. I just did round 2 at a firm in the energy sector. That's the final round.

And they need to do something about LLMs confidently giving you the wrong answer before anyone will trust them.\n\nBut let’s say they iron out all the kinks; I’ve heard upwards of 60-70% of jobs could be replaced.  Our systems are not setup to handle such massive unemployment.  All these giant tech firms are not going to give up their earnings to contribute to any form of UBI, the line must go up!  There are too few politicians that aren’t bought and paid for that will actually stand up and do something.  \n\nIn the long run this is all just another big tech bait-n-switch.  They can run at giant losses for years, maybe even decades as they continue to subsidize everything with the parts of the business that make money.  They will sell a restaurant a waiter bot with the latest wAIter model installed, but it can only stand at the hostess podium, and tries to seat people at already occupied tables 30% of the time.  Human Robotics promises it will replace your entire wait staff in 5 years so a few people lose their jobs.  But turns out the wAIter model was just a chatGPT wrapper making API calls the entire time. Human Robotics is running out of seed money, so now before the robot will seat your customers they must watch a 30 second unskipable ad for the McDonalds across the street.\n\nIt just seems like if everything works out the way the big tech companies want it’s the worst possible outcome for humanity.",

I had nothing to lose so you can do that sometimes. \n\n2nd interview - COO is involved.. Very open honest discussion, great discussion. Dude knew I achieved what I wanted in EHS, looking for an opportunity into business side (non-ehs), was bored, etc. \n\nHe tells me I am overqualified and that I am better than Safety. While some may have gotten offended, I did not because I agree lol. Nothing against my EHS brothers/sisters.. I just have always been bored and found it not challenging enough (I am director level currently). He was just spot on with everything and we were just starting to converse.. At this point, my interviews are not your typical \"give me a time you had to use decision making in a high-stress situation\" but more conversational, management style, personality assessing, etc.  At least in my experience the last 2 job changes. \n\nI get rejected, but while being rejected for role I interviewed for, they tell me there is another opportunity that they would love to discuss with me if still interested. I checked their website to see what jobs were listed, and it was only a handful and none of them would match any I would fill. I believe the COO I connected with is throwing me a lifeline for a career change. They know how much I currently make and that I would not take less (3 small kids, wife to support), but he must have seen or heard something that caused him to throw me a potential bone and transition into a new career. I am very much looking forward to learning more, but it feels good that this even happened and that my skills and abilities are easily recognized by the C-Suite in at least one company lol\n\nGreat post OP.. Glad I am not the only one going through this! I have never been in a situation like it so hoping I make the right decision.",

You could be in any career, in any field, in any position and still get laid off. This is just the way of the world.\n\nWith your YoE, you should be getting messages from recruiters on LinkedIn and other platforms that can easily land you interviews. Try premium for a month, spruce up your LinkedIn and add all the common skills you see across the job descriptions you are interested in. Even if you don’t have the skills, read up on docs and just get a basic understanding so that you can speak to it during interviews. Add those skills to your LinkedIn and Resume, I guarantee your profile starts getting hits from recruiters. Talk to the ones who supply Job Descriptions you’d actually consider taking. This is genuine advice that worked for me. I found a position after about a month and a half with 7 YoE (NYC area) which is really the same as 5 in the grand scheme of things.\n\nI’m sick of hearing people cry that CS careers are over. There will literally always be a need for SWEs. If you think AI will replace us, then you clearly haven’t used AI very much yet. It fucks up a LOT, and is really more of a tool than a replacement for people.\n\nThe job market will eventually recover and you will be able to get a good job with good pay. Stop dick riding FAANG as well. FAANG is what made the market what it is because they over hired and over paid for people and set unrealistic expectations for what SWE careers should actually look like. They set a standard for unrealistic hiring practices that is not reflective of actual work we do on a daily basis. We’re grinding LC for months just to do a job where we do basic system design and basic logic. It’s absolutely ridiculous.\n\nAlso, FAANG looks good on resumes, sure, but so does experience in any real job where you can back up that experience with technical knowledge. If someone is gonna hire you just because your resume says FAANG, then they’re an idiot and you probably shouldn’t work for them anyway.\n\nLower your salary expectations a bit, you have to realize that you’re in competition with a ton of other people who were laid off and are all expecting to make more money than what they were making than when they were laid off. It’s better to have a decent paying job than no job at all.",

Feeling out of your depth sometimes just means you're growing.  \n  \nThat said, it’s also okay to want something a little different. Some folks find their groove in more stable, documentation-heavy environments; others thrive on the chaos of building fast and figuring it out later. Neither is better—it’s just about fit.  \n  \nIf you're unsure, try talking to other engineers (in or outside your org) about their day-to-day.

That ranges from marketing your achievements (resume and interview), Leetcoding better than most other applicants, etc.\n\n> Great, so educate us about what engineers do. \n\nNow on to the original question, there's actually **alot**. And it **varies**.  Meetings definitely happen and they take a lot of time but meetings encompasses a lot of things we do. Meetings can be technical discussions or product discussions for instance. They can also be pair programming, debugging sessions, bug finding sessions... so many things. \n\nAs to some things AI cannot do well compared to a mid level programmer? They are terrible at writing code that scales well and they are terrible at high level context (use them in big code bases). This is why when I use AI, I make it do more specific tasks that way it understands the context better and its more limited in scope so its easier to refactor to be good code. Or I use it for throwaway code for MVPs at which point it doesn't matter if the code scales or not.\n\nAI is still great though and is a good productivity boost but its nowhere near a replacement for any competent mid level dev.",

I would say your undergrad degree is funky, idk what that even is, but companies want CS / eecs / or software engineering degrees (a newer degree). However you're getting interviews so I guess they don't care that much about the specific degree. \n\nYour issue is interviewing. Have you asked for feedback from every rejection? You don't have to be a good coder to get a decent job, you have to be a good interviewer though. \n\nLeetcode til your hands and brain hurt. Actually do and learn the blind 75. \n\nUse Blind as a resource, you can find posts about interviews at specific companies and tips on what they're looking for in interviews. \n\nLeetcode also has tagged questions that are similar to what you'll be asked in company interviews. \n\nRead grokking system design. As a new grad the focus will be on coding and some minor system design. If you know system design super well that will really make you stand out. \n\nRead tips on behavioral interview questions. \n\nLearn from recruiter feedback from failed interviews.\n\nDo practice interviews. It's especially useful for new grads. If you have friends in the industry ask them do mock interview you. There's also pay mock interview services -- never done that personally but ymmv. \n\nResearch the company before you interview, have good questions about the technical aspects of the company-- read their engineering blogs and core values. Be excited about the company and job when interviewing.\n\nDon't lie in your resume about tech skills -- a good interviewer is going to discover it and rail you. \n\nDon't be afraid to say you don't know during an interview. If they ask a question and have no idea, tell them you're not 100% on it but \"this is how I would approach \" solving the problem. Think aloud, they want to see your thought process about how you approach the problem.\n\nTarget swe jobs at non-tech companies (like banks, healthcare) -- the interviews tech to be easier. \n\nGood luck! The first job is always the hardest to get.",

It even made a suggestion for an improvement that I probably wouldn't have bothered to look at. That would have taken me half a day at least. Then I had it create tests for the new functionality and it did 95% of what I had to do. It also helped me update the user documentation, which is something I always dreaded.\n\nIn the end, I did two days worth of work in about 4 hours. \n\nSometimes I have a task that involves doing mundane stuff like create a function that displays the members of an enum as text. That's mindless work that I'm happy to offload to \"AI\".\n\nHere's where it sucks and you need to be very careful: Asking it to write code from scratch to perform anything complex. In most cases, the code will be nearly useless or it may sort of work but will have taken an awfully sub-optimal way to do it. That, you really need to do yourself. For example, I asked it to help me write an optimal bytecode VM. It wrote something that kinda worked, but was obviously awful in terms of performance.

Especially if you have been at your company a while. And if you trust your manager, you should tell them that you are going to. Here is how you can frame it: \"I have been pushing myself hard and accepting everything that's been thrown my way, and I've been trying to do things as quickly as possible. I think I need to stop doing that, and instead be honest about how much time and availability I have, otherwise I'm risking getting burned out.\"\n\nI have literally been told by my managers (as in, multiple have said this independently over time) that it's okay to go slower, and in fact, sometimes it's preferable. The only thing it's not okay to do is not communicate.\n\nSo for example, if you get a Slack ping that's like \"hey, I'm seeing error X in app Y, can you please take a look?\", instead of saying \"I'm on it!\" and then frantically trying to chase down error X, say, \"sure thing, I can look in [a little bit/30 minutes/this afternoon/tomorrow/when I'm back from lunch]\". If that isn't good enough, the person asking is going to explain why. You can also literally just say \"sure thing, when do you need info by?\"\n\nThe same is true about projects. If you are not particularly interested in a project, it is okay to step back and listen and only speak up when you have something important to say. As long as you are aware of what's going on, learning when your input is needed and when to let others speak is a valuable skill. (Personally, I still struggle with it.) People will notice if you are obviously disengaged, ignorant about what's being discussed, or making them repeat themselves. They won't think to themselves after a meeting, \"Boy, YonghaeCho sure was quiet,\" and if they do, it's only for a fleeting moment - and if you spoke once or twice because *you needed to*, they won't think that at all.\n\nOverall: It's not just okay to slow down, it's good to slow down. You will feel better and be better at your job in the long run.",

        "body": "Never take Glassdoor reviews as truth. The one and only thing you should use them for is to help you formulate questions to ask during the reverse interview process, and so you know what you keep an eye out for. Then based on the reverse interview you need to form *your own* opinion on if the company sounds like it has any of those negative traits you read about.\n\nThe obvious reason why you shouldn't take those reviews as truth is they're often by disgruntled employees, or employees pressured into leaving good reviews by HR while they're working there. Neither end of that spectrum is reliable. Rarely does a content employee just think unprompted to themselves \"You know what would be fun? Let's go write a fair, unbiased review about my very average employer!\"\n\nBut beyond that, companies change over time. A review that was accurate even last month, might not be accurate today. All it takes is a single change in management, and a team's culture can shift literally overnight. So just because someone said they worked long hours, doesn't mean people are still working long hours. The reverse is also true, just because someone said the WLB is great, doesn't mean it's still great.\n\nTeams within companies also vary drastically. Even at small companies. I worked for a startup once that had \\~30 engineers, spread across a few teams. The team I worked on was super laid back, modern stack, essentially no red tape so we moved very quickly, etc. Even pre-pandemic, we'd only come into the office once or twice a week, and nobody was watching us so sometimes we'd just WFH all 5 days and it wasn't a big deal because we got results. But another team was the polar opposite of us. Their stack was older, they had a *ton* of red tape, they moved very slowly, produced very little, and they were straight up told by the CTO that they need to be in the office strictly 3 days a week because they needed to get their shit together.\n\nSo if you read a bad review about Team A, it doesn't mean Team B will share those traits. You need to talk to *your* hiring manager about *your* future-team to figure out what that team is like.\n\nThe startup I mentioned earlier had a fair amount of negative reviews on Glassdoor talking about nepotism, and it being a boys club, and that if you're not buddy buddy with the CEO you'll never have any career growth. When I interviewed with my hiring manager and the CTO I didn't get those vibes at all. The culture seemed amazing, which is why I decided to ignore those reviews and join them. Lo and behold, the culture was great. I was absolutely *not* buddy buddy with the CEO, or anyone for that matter, and my career skyrocketed at that place. I've gotten the biggest raises I've ever seen there. It was a great place to work. The person complaining about nepotism probably just sucked at their job and got fired, and decided it'd be an easier pill to swallow to blame nepotism instead of themselves. ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯",

On that last point, it really drives me crazy, but when you have managers/stakeholders in the room, you need to speak to them with a language they understand, about concerns they care about, and at a granularity level that matters to them.\n\nI have one guy on my team, great developer, who spec'd out an EPIC level feature set, and wanted to present that to a manager. The only problem with his presentation is that it was way to granular, and talked about tickets in progress, focusing on the details of the how, and not the what/why. That's going to confuse the shit out of any manager whose trying to make sure the high level plan of the team is aligned to what they believe should get done.\n\nThat's one thing, another is example is someone on my team shipping a feature without good product rationale, like the feature was just sort of garbage and we couldn't tell either way, and not backing down or and providing weak evidence that the feature was useful. What they said was basically: \"since we don't have data it's not good, we should keep it released and just observe\". Lol, I don't have data that my Greyhound can't drive a car, you think I'm letting him drive?\n\nFinally, the last thing which drives me completely crazy, is when people don't understand the purpose of meetings, and use the time in the meeting for something else. This just happened, where I was trying to run a planning session with the team, and an engineer goes: \"oh one more thing, u/justUseAnSvm can you navigate to the dashboard so I can show u/<the manager>\" No brother, if you want a meeting to discuss this, schedule.  \n  \nAnyway, these are just some examples of things I notice in ambitious and competent engineers, that will otherwise be leadership material someday. I'm a real stickler for keeping things on track and not wasting peoples time. Your approach, listen, observe, and write it done, is a good one. Next step is to just ask for larger feature work. Don't forget, these skills take years and years to develop, so don't compare yourself wit any one else, just focus on making progress!",

Highly rated competitive programmers use C++ because it provides you with fine-grained control over memory (pointers and such), which allows you to develop the most efficient solution to the problem. If your goal is to just get good at algorithms, then you don't need to concern yourself with those optimisations.\n\nAny language whose standard library implements arrays, hashmaps, priority queues, stacks and references will get you to the level where you want to go. This is why many people use Python for competitive programming because the code is more readable, and you don't have to type as much.\n\nHowever, if you are already good at Java, then don't learn another language just for CP. Stick to Java and master it. Personally, I use C++ and Python, but only because C++ was my first programming language, and I had to learn Python for a project I was doing 13 years ago.",

Look at internship and new grad roles for each company. Then, go and talk to the recruiters, express interest in the company and those roles. You're a freshman, so you basically have no shot at actually securing those roles, but the recruiters will give you some advice on what you can do over the next year to be prepared for those roles.\n\nDo this for every career fair. Listen to the feedback the recruiters give you. Eventually, you'll have the relevant skills and you will be able to secure a role. It is imperative, that when you express interest in these roles, you sound like you've done your homework about what these companies actually do.",

That probably doesn't help you right now at the moment you need a job, but medium/long term, I would definitely look at lateral moves to other functions.  I think being early in your career actually helps you here because you'll be on the junior side for whatever you do.  Do some dev work in your spare time if that interests you at all.  Actually, even if it doesn't interest you, it's probably a good idea.\n\nThere are two kinds of SDET jobs I see these days:\n\nOne, what we used to call \"white box\" - someone who has dev-level skills and has written source code or close to it.  These people can stand up a test framework from scratch and pipeline infrastructure for tests to run and report.  These have a little more staying power and tend to have the opportunity to become other kinds of software engineering roles - devs, devops, release eng, etc. - when the business outgrows the need for dedicated QA.\n\nTwo, jobs that are basically QA and mostly manual testing, but for companies that know they need to step up their testing game and need a stopgap while they either scale up their automated CI/CD efforts or offshore manual efforts.  You can tell by the way I've described it that I don't think these roles have a bright future, but you might get to hang on for a while at a company that's struggling through that process.\n\nObservability, monitoring, and deployment tools have come a long way in reducing risk in software delivery since I started my career.  Issues can be seen early and fixed quickly.  Unit tests are fast and cover a lot of ground.  There's still some use for end to end testing, but I see a drastically reduced need to have a specialized function for it that introduces additional process and the overhead of handing work off to different people along the way.",

I put the accurate dates of when I was employed but kept the reasons why I had a gap to myself unless someone asked me. \n\n2. Prepared a rehearsed answer to why do you have this gap? Something along the lines of:\n\n“I had a great experience in my previous role, it allowed me to grow a lot as a developer and accomplish xyz (keep it brief) however I had some personal circumstances that forced me to make the very difficult decision to step away from my job to take care of my personal life. I’ve used the last x amount of time to fully take care of everything and now I’m ready and excited to start my next adventure.” \n\nYou can just run your own circumstances through ChatGPT and make it better for your specific situation. \n\nWhat I would NOT do? \n\n1. Give any specifics about why you took the break (you should not be sharing medical information with a prospective employer to avoid putting yourself in a position you could be discriminated against due to health reasons). \n\n2. Make it sound like you’re not ready to get back to work (it’s okay if you need accommodations later on, but for the initial conversations you want to give the impression that you’re ready and excited to get back to work). \n\n3. Don’t sabotage yourself by offering any of this information unless explicitly asked. \n\nIn my recent job search I spoke to almost 20 companies. Out of all of those only 3 actually asked me about the gap. I gave my scripted answer and they seemed satisfied enough with the answer to not bring it up again. Only 1 recruiter was kind of rude about it (Amazon) but he still moved me forward in the process so it didn’t hurt my chances at all. Don’t believe them if they try to neg you for having a gap. It’s not your fault, you’re doing your best and you WILL get back on your feet soon.\n\nI was open in my language about my “previous experience” and “in my previous role” but for most interviews nobody even brought it up and they have your resume so they know when you were employed it’s not up to you to over explain and if anything I think that would hurt you because you want to focus on what you bring to the company now, not what’s set you back before. \n\nOne last thing, if you do have negative experiences with any company due to your break, you want to make sure you take that into consideration before accepting any offer from them. If they’re rude to you based on a gap on your resume, I can only imagine they’ll be worse if you ever have issues in the future and if your problem is something like ibs you want to make sure your next company is fair and understanding about medical accommodations. So take all that into consideration before accepting any offers. \n\nBest of luck! It was thought getting back into the industry as a mid level engineer with a gap, but everything worked itself out and it was so worth it to focus on my health first and foremost. \n\nEverything’s going to be okay! ",

Some companies apply a flat percentage for promotions; companies I’ve worked at, for example, used a flat 10%.\n\nOther companies have set salary ranges and will use comp ratios to determine the increase. They also consider your current compensation. Generally, managers and the comp/HR team aim to bring employees close to a 1.0 comp ratio. For high performers, they may go higher. However, some managers or comp/HR folks might think that bringing someone straight to a 1.0 is too large of a bump, so they might offer a lower comp ratio instead. They may also feel a candidate needs ramp-up time or isn’t fully qualified, which can also justify a lower comp ratio—though there’s usually a floor, such as 0.9.\n\nComp ratio, short for comparative ratio, is a measure used in compensation management to compare an employee’s current salary to the midpoint of a given salary range for their position. It’s calculated by dividing the employee’s salary by the midpoint of the range and is usually expressed as a percentage. A comp ratio of 100% means the employee is paid exactly at the market or target rate. Below 100% may indicate they’re underpaid relative to the range, while above 100% suggests they’re paid more than the midpoint—possibly due to experience, tenure, or performance. It’s a useful tool for ensuring pay equity and making informed salary decisions.",

        "body": "The risk of the offer being rescinded over a *reasonable* negotiation is very low. It doesn't make you seem greedy. Note I said \"reasonable\", if you go at them with \"I want 50% more!\" that is much more likely to rub them the wrong way. Ain't no way you're seriously negotiating 50% more without expecting them to just rescind. And the reasonable-ness is relative to the *offer*, not the market. Even if they offer you 50% below market, asking for 50% more is not going to fly.\n\nThat said, even though the risk of the offer being rescinded over reasonable negotiation is very low, it's still non-zero. There is still always a chance of the company going beyond playing hardball, and just fully rescinding. It happens. Not often, but it absolutely happens.\n\nSo the question becomes, are you willing to take that non-zero (but close to zero) risk to get some more money? If so, negotiate. If not, don't. It's all about your personal risk tolerance.",

You can also learn most popular languages pretty easily if you understand C# well. Most software engineers change languages as frequently as they change jobs.\n\nLearning some JS, Ruby, or Python might help, as those are three extremely common languages on the backend.\n\nIf you specifically want to build custom tools used internally (not client-facing), there are a ton of those jobs. These days web tools are probably more common than desktop programs, but in some industries the latter is probably still common. \n\nIt might be hard to seek out “internal tools” jobs, because some of those roles involve building things for the core client-facing product as well.

Knowing how parts of a system work together is something you’ve already done, you just have to abstract that to other types of systems.  \n\n2. What type of system design question you’ll be asked will vary greatly on the scale of the company, the seniority of role, and the type of roll. You should not expect load balancing questions if you’re doing a front end engineering system design interview. If you’re doing backend at an established company, they probably won’t be asking about load balancing (because they’ve already solved that), but will probably ask about problems you’ll be expected to solve. \n\n3. Unless you’re doing system design or architecture or tooling, they probably will just want to know that you can think in terms of systems. The specific database or asynchronous job or whatever other part won’t matter so long as you know how they interact or at a higher level what pieces are interacting. They care most that you’re able to grasp the whole system rather than that you remember the names of specific tools to build the system (unless they specifically list technology they use, then you should totally know about those technologies at a conversational level).\n\n4. ChatGPT is a great tool to prep for interviews. You can prompt it to create a series of questions for you for the seniority level and type of roll  and company and interview type (systems design) you’re interviewing for. If you have the job description/company, that can help it be more specific. You can ask it to give you feedback or to help you fill in gaps in your understanding.",

You'll have to put in more personal effort with a bridge + Masters, because you need to learn the entire CS undergrad curriculum in only 2-3 semesters and also Masters are obviously inherently harder than bachelors. I would also imagine it would take longer + cost more. But you do get a better degree.\n\nI think either are fine really, would decide based on other factors like which schools you're deciding between, their costs, how much you'd want to attend that school, etc. \n\nFWIW some schools (eg [UPenn](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/degrees/mcit-online/)) offer a CS Masters aimed at students from non-CS backgrounds (it's also entirely online at UPenn), so you wouldn't even have to do a bridge.

        "body": "I imagine the issue is my resume, but I do understand that the market is just not great right now. I was a bit scared to post perhaps because I was afraid I'd be told to give up. Software Development is about the only job I've ever enjoyed, so I'd like to continue in that direction. I will take other perspectives under advisement though. I apply through, Dice, Indeed, LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter, Robert Half, and Otta using \"c#\" and \".net developer\" as search terms.\n\nHere is a link to my resume https://imgur.com/a/GPCOv1Y\n\nI know it's not ideal, but anything would help. The 2 year gap is due to personal reasons. My mental health was not great at the time and dealing with multiple family things lead to it being a not great time. One major reason I was not immediately applying was due mostly to my own naivety in believing \"you've got a couple years of experience, you should have no problem getting another job.\" It didn't help that the layoffs would start right as I started applying again.\n\nAs for the *other* 2 year gap from my graduation to my first role as a QA Analyst, I honestly don't know. My days were go to work, come home, apply for jobs, go to sleep, repeat continually thinking the job was right around the corner. Again, likely naivety in thinking a degree would be enough. Likely lack of projects, proper internships, or a network to go through were the cause, but that's all irrelevant now.\n\nI ultimately chose to do that coding bootcamp due to a couple reasons:\n\n* I was admittedly a little rusty\n* I thought showing I was actively doing something while working at the same time would show initiative to interviewers\n* Someone at my former company migrated from sales to development from doing this same bootcamp so I figured, success story right there.\n* It was recommended I do a bootcamp by a couple tech friends\n\nThe bootcamp was mostly a quick refresher for me and I used the spare time to help out the other people there, guiding them as best I could. These were good, motivated people who sometimes just needed some guidance in the right direction or needed something explained differently. It's a good feeling helping someone understand a problem and seeing it all click, I have to admit.\n\nI've had my resume worked on several times each by a professional with credentials to make me believe they know what they're doing, same as the professional before them. This latest version came from a technical interviewer from said coding bootcamp.\n\nI did just notice that I have \"over 200+\" listed under QA Analyst which seems redundant. My other main thought is I remove the summary of the most recent company since that seems to mess up ATS sometimes.\n\nAs for projects, I am working on one atm, a small MAUI app to help my friends and I calculate card draw odds with multiple factors. I'm mostly working out the formulas currently, but I figured that'd be an app with a real world user base, albeit small.\n\nMostly my days are very busy with work and I am usually exhausted when I get home, so I will need to work on either getting something better, or carve time out of my day to work on projects/upskilling/applications.\n\nI've had interviews since finishing that bootcamp and some I think went very well, even the technical portions, but they lead to either (polite) rejections or ghosting. Unfortunately, there's no prize for 2nd place in job hunting. I have considered emailing a couple of those places back and see if anything has popped up.\n\nI know this was a lot, just trying to answer some questions that may arise. I appreciate any help anyone can offer and best of luck to anyone else searching.",
