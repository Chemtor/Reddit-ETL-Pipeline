My initial reaction to it was how well thought out it was and how well documented. It felt like a db platform built to address the pain points of battle weary DW practitioners.\n\nThroughout my career I've seen \"Tech X is better than Tech Y, why can't people see that\". It depends on whether those advantages are relevant to your business. There are always pain points. What impact, if any, do these have on your business and do they negate the advantages.\n\nI worked for a consultancy that was a Snowflake partner. We worked out how to run Snowflake, and other SaaS tech at very low cost.  As a Snowflake partner, this made us as popular with them as hemorrhoids in a spacehopper race.\n\nWhat people forget in Tech X vs Tech Y arguments, particularly in the SaaS world, is that both are watching each other, evolving, copying/stealing features. Yesterday, Tech X was ahead, today Tech Y is ahead, tomorrow, who knows?\n\nRemember too, it isn't the size of the wand, its the magic of the magician.  Lets suppose you can query infinite data infinitely fast. Management take one look at the results, don't like them and send your team off on weeks worth of wild goose chases to determine why the figures don't match their perceptions if what ought to be. Even if you prove the figures are accurate they are likely to insist they are wrong because the data on which the results are based didn't include other factors.",

If your processed data already resides on their platform, it's understandable you get dazzled by these new offerings because it is easy to use all of them and even faster to get a POC out in front of the executives.

At some point, I was also praised by my manager that I have a knack for explaining technical jargon into layman's terms with non-technical stakeholders.\n\nBecause of my background as a data & BI analyst, I consider myself fairly decent in business understanding & communication but in reality, I'm just trying to wing it lol as business isn't really my strong suit. I have to try really hard to make sense of everything business related as my brain is really naturally wired for technical stuff.\n\nWhat made me decide to switch to data engineering is that I just find it more interesting and this is where I see myself growing. As I've mentioned, my brain is also naturally wired for being technical than being business oriented. I also dislike building dashboards and would rather write automation scripts and ETL pipelines. I also find talking + presenting to business stakeholders rewarding but very draining so I prefer just being left alone coding. I guess being a DE is just a perfect alignment of what I'm naturally good at and what I'm interested doing which make it a good fit for me.\n\nI don't know why but I sense that you want to do something else that's not exactly DE related with the way you describe yourself as mediocre and not being able to build pipelines like the others. If you really want to be a DE, by all means work hard for you to get the right skills or maybe you just need to find the right environment that'll support your growth.\n\nThe more important question is that, is that what you really want to do and where you want to grow? No one started as a good DE because the skillset required to be a good one is something that you can learn over the years as long as you have a learning mindset.\n\nThe others already answered what possible paths to take but of course you have to identify first what you want to do. Just ask yourself: What am I interested at? What sparks my curiosity? Where do I see myself growing? What do I like/dislike about this role? What kind of projects/output interests me? What problems do I want to solve? What kind of hardships/challenges would I rather face?\n\nGo out there and explore. You might find the path that's the right fit for you. You define your own career.",

Put unique indexes on keys, do atomic partition swaps/overwrites, and track processed batches in an audit table so reruns are safe.\n\n\n\nMonitoring that works: alert on freshness, row-count deltas, and schema drift; suppress flappy alerts with consecutive-failure rules; include runbook links and owners. Do canary runs on a small slice before full loads.\n\n\n\nWe used Airflow and dbt for orchestration/transform and Fivetran for some sources; DreamFactory helped by auto-generating REST APIs over legacy databases so ingestion and auth were consistent without custom adapters.\n\n\n\nShip guardrails first; the transforms are the easy part once the rails are in place.",

The hard stuff isn't writing ETL, it is visibility into how data changes across systems, understanding why it broke, making reruns sfae, and keeping people aligned on what \"good data\" even means. Basically, the fundamentals that make a system trustworthy.\n\nUntil vendors take that seriously, every new \"modern\" platform is just another flavor of the same problem.

As many posts on here talking about how they use the latest tools to create the perfect database following all of the best practices, what you're seeing is what databases look like at most places.

You'll just learn to work with it over time.\n\nWhat you'll also learn about those posts that make it seem like everything is perfect, is that a lot of times, their little domain has been set up the way they like it. But the rest of the org is still a shit show. Like, I work in healthcare, and my piece of it looks great, imo. Not perfect, and I'm limited by the tools the company pays for, but it's neat, and clean, and makes sense. And I could present that to you and you'd think \"wow it's not so bad there.\" But you'd be wrong. Because I don't control every pipeline. I can't, healthcare is too complicated and too big. Tons of special rules and regulations. And a lot of the other functional areas look like what you're describing. And they look like that despite some legitimate good effort on some DEs parts. \n\nAnd be careful what you insult or call bad practice. Once you start trying to work with this stuff, you might find out it's like that for reasons outside of your control, and someone has done the best they could with what they have.",

This is very valuable.\n\n  \n2) You mentioned trying to keep up with standard practices at your previous job, this will likely have gotten you much farther than you think. A lot of folks don't really think about these things or appreciate why they are used. Beyond just that, it also demonstrates curiosity, which is very valuable.

Data engineering is the intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering. A *data engineer* manages the data engineering lifecycle, beginning with getting data from source systems and ending with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning.\n\nData engineering as a fundamental concept is always going to be the same, but how this is accomplished has evolved and changed over time. The scale of data has become larger, the requests for data have become more complex, and the data engineering solutions have changed. \n\nThe decoupling of compute and storage has been a big deal over the last 2 decades. The rise of columnar storage has made OBT a viable solution over Kimball's strict dimensional modeling. Kafka has changed how data can be incrementally ingested. \n\nMore recently, there has been a mainstream shift towards data mesh architectures, eliminating a need for a centralized data warehouse. Policy driven access control and dynamic data masking has changed how data governance is enforced. Snowflake and Databricks are continuing to gain market share. LLM's are changing what needs to be delivered to stakeholders.",

Connectors is the biggest gap: there’s no magic “one lib fits all.” It’s usually case by case, pyodbc or sqlalchemy for relational, boto3 for S3, azure-storage-blob for ADLS, google-cloud libs for GCS, requests for SaaS APIs, etc. I haven’t seen a universal package that matches ADF’s connector library.\n\nFor orchestration, Airflow and Dagster are the go-tos. Prefect is nice if you want something lighter with better DX.\n\nHonestly, even GitHub Actions or cron works fine for simpler setups if you’re disciplined with retries/alerts. Hosting wise, containers on ECS/Kubernetes give flexibility, but I’ve also seen folks run Python EL pipelines on Azure Functions or AWS Lambda when workloads are small enough.\n\nThe headache is always secure on-prem access. ADF’s IR is very convenient, and replacing that usually means standing up VPN, jump hosts, or agents that your orchestrator can reach. That’s the bit most people underestimate.\n\nI used to burn days wiring retries and metadata logging until I made it part of the design from the start. You probably already know, but building a little audit table for run\\_ts/run\\_id helps a ton when debugging.\n\nCurious are you mostly moving SaaS/db data or do you also have on-prem sources in the mix?

Initially you had the software developers maintain databases and manage ETL processes. Almost everything we used was self-developed and the size of data could not justify 3rd party solutions.\n2. The role of analysts was executed by the respective stakeholders who needed the data E.g. the finance team was pulling data with SQL directly from the databases for their own reporting purposes, the risk guys did the same ,etc. If something needed to be automated, changed or structured in a different way, they raised requests to the devs. The people who wrote SQL for data analysis were not dedicated only for data analysis, they were also experts in their own field with a sprinkle of SQL skills. \n3. Around 100 people we started looking for a dedicated data engineer and hired analysts within the respective teams that would use the data (again, finance got their own, risk got their own, etc.).",

What would be the point of having different \"modes\" if you're writing to the same prod tables? If you're testing in prod you're not actually testing\n\n>How many times do you guys test ETL pipelines\n\nMore than zero but less than or equal to the number of times required for me to prove to myself and others that it is working as expected\n\nNow, for the big hurrah:   \n\n\n>!&#x200B;!<How do you test ETL pipelines?\n\nCase to case. I don't think unit tests apply to data eng/ETL like elsewhere in software engineering. I think you would be really surprised how far you can get with QA when you pick a record in the source, dump it to excel then look at the target and see if it matches the expected behavior (and then repeat for a few records). And then find records in your source that have certain edge cases and confirm your pipeline handled them correctly by looking at the exact records in the target",

You could do a inmon style data model, data vault or directly into a kimball structure. Inmon and Eata vault give more flexibility but require a lot more work in building them. While straight to Kimball is the simplest and quickest way of building data. It depends on your businesses skill sets and time constraints. \n\n\n- gold layer - kimball data models with surrogate keys\n\n\nIn terms of pipelines youre main aim is to have the easiest estate to maintain and manage. This to me means having minimal pipelines. This can be done by building a metadata driven ETL making your pipelines parametised and driven by configuration tables. \n\n\nIn my experience its best to have configuration tables stored in an Azure SQL DB to allow easy transactional data changes, and ease of inserts and updates. \n\n\nWith Azure pipelines you can typically do one extract pipeline (or a couple of parent child pipelines) per source system type and authentication type (e.g. Oracle and Windows auth).\n\n\nEnterprise/Silver pipelines you can have one pipeline.\n\n\nPresentations a pair of parent and child pipelines. ",

Use ADF to schedule and parameterize ingestion (Copy to ADLS Gen2 bronze), store schema in metadata, and handle schema drift. Do transforms in Databricks: one notebook per domain or stage, promote to silver (cleaned, conformed) and gold (query-ready), with expectations/tests and job clusters via Databricks Workflows.

For dev/test/prod: separate workspaces/storage, Key Vault, Git + CI/CD (params per env), synthetic data, data quality gates, and monitoring to Log Analytics with alerts.

In cloud stacks you trade that GUI clarity for scalability, and sometimes the trade doesn’t feel worth it.\n\nIf you want something closest to that old-school feel, Coalesce is probably the best “modern PowerCenter” I’ve seen. You still end up with SQL under the hood, but the GUI gives you traceability that’s hard to replicate in pure PySpark. Matillion works too but the lock-in stories are real, and Informatica Cloud is… still Informatica, so you know what comes with that. Apache Hop is worth a look if you want open source with a GUI—less polished, but flexible.\n\nThe reason folks keep pushing dbt is because it hits the sweet spot of modularization + lineage + testing in SQL. Add dbt’s semantic layer or a canvas-style GUI (dbt Cloud if you’ve got budget) and you get part of that PowerCenter experience without losing code discipline.\n\nIf your gold models are the bottleneck, I’d maybe pilot Coalesce on a hairy one and compare cycle time + auditability against your current PySpark/dbt flows. Sometimes just seeing the impact analysis in a GUI saves hours of detective work.\n\nCurious, are you leaning toward vendor-backed tools (Coalesce, Matillion, Informatica) or would you consider open source like Hop or even something hybrid? We hit the same frustration with lineage when syncing ERPs/CRMs into warehouses, and it’s one of the reasons we built [Stacksync ](https://www.stacksync.com/)with audit trails baked in otherwise you lose days explaining how a field was derived.",

I feel like the DBT stuff should be set up as a job within an API trigger and then your DAG hits a “stg_daily_stocks+” to run it.\n\nAfter transformation, I’d expect something from the marts data to be extracted in some way and then pushed to a place for users to access. That could be into a sheet with gspread, or a slack channel, or somewhere else with an http endpoint. You can layer AI onto it at this stage too which would demonstrate experience with AI APIs.\n\nIMO, a better DAG would be:\n\nExtract_from_api >> run_dbt_job >> run_analysis >> communicate_to_team",

It is especially useful for scenarios where the database does not have timestamps, and you don't have other application-level events.\n\nDatabases store every change that happen to them in some form of a changelog, roughly a file that has the changes applied to a row, sth like this:\n\n* table: `users`\n* operation: \\`UPDATE\\`\n* id: 42\n* email: [`old@example.com`](mailto:old@example.com) → [`alice@example.com`](mailto:alice@example.com)\n\nCDC is the idea of using this change dataset and replicate the same events for analytical purposes in other places, e.g. your BigQuery or Snowflake.\n\nThere are various ways CDC can be implemented, the most common open-source software for that being Debezium, which reads these events from the database changelog and publishes them to other destinations such as Kafka. This allows people to start consuming the changes even if there's no domain events being published from the application.\n\nThis way of retrieving the data is especially useful when you do not have reliable timestamp columns, which is very common in enterprise settings. CDC allows avoiding any changes to the applications themselves and still replicate the data into the destination in an efficient way.",

At the simplest level, it just means capturing row-level changes (inserts/updates/deletes) from a source system and pushing them somewhere else.\n\nHow it’s done depends on the tech. Some databases expose their transaction logs (Postgres logical decoding, MySQL binlog, etc.), and CDC tools read from those. Others use triggers or periodic queries. So you’ll see CDC as both a *concept* (keep downstream systems in sync with source changes) and a set of *implementations* (Debezium, Oracle GoldenGate, Fivetran, Estuary, etc.).\n\nCompared to microbatches: microbatching polls the DB every X minutes and compares timestamps, which is simpler but usually heavier load and not real-time. Event streaming is closer in spirit, but those events are usually app-generated, not DB-level changes. CDC is nice when you want the “truth” from the database itself rather than relying on apps emitting events.",

I was serving a corporate meeting dinner and spilled a whole gravy boat down some important person's suit jacket.\n\nTo echo what my old manager said to somebody who kept apologising, nobody wants to hear apologies.  Everybody just wants to see improvement.\n\nFirst thing is hold yourself to high standards.  Give yourself a rule - you're allowed to make mistakes once.  Once you mess up, you make adjustments to fix it.  I am quite forgetful and give myself a lot to do although I've found writing down a list of actions for a project, prioritising them, and then going through them one by one was great for my organisation.\n\nSecond is to also be kind to yourself.  Care about what you can control, accept that shit happens for things you can't.  If you miss an edge case that you can't predict, then honestly, there's no point beating yourself up about it.  \n  \nI'll give you another story - I was getting a user reporting a migration \"wasn't correct\" even though it was 100% exactly the same as it was before.  \"I don't see these characters that are appearing before.  They're there now.  The migration has failed\", they said.  If you look at it with the naked eye, you'd be right.  They don't exist...IN THE SQL DATABASE.  When converted to parquet they show up.  Shit was literally invisible to the naked eye and to the IDE looking at the text in SQL, but if you go and look at the fucking location specific character encoding and convert it, it is 100% there.\n\nThis comes with experience.  Some things cannot be helped.  Mistakes will always happen.  It's how we handle them after which defines us as people.",

You can parameterize everything and template your way out in Informatica as well, though their git support is not always as nice as I would love. \n\n\n> Does informatica integrate well with DBt?\n\nYes.\nYou are however talking about different services. Data catalog is obvious; given DBT's focus on metadata. I see no reason as to why it should not be a breeze, though I have not used CDGC and DBT together yet.\n\n> Can we kick of DBT loads from informatica after ingesting the data?\n\nYes. You can execute your tasks on command line or use the API and track the jobs through there if you need. \nBut if you already have an orchestrator, why push that into Informatica? Informaticas catalog can get lineage etc anyway.\n\n> Is it DBT better or should we need to stick with snowflake sps? \n\nNot sure what you mean. \nDepends on situation and circumstances.\n\n\nYou can use cdgc, data lineage, data quality and profiling in Informatica, without having Informatica to handle your ingestion or transformation. Or you can if you wish. Remember you can go to docs.informatica.com and download the scanners' document on DBT if you you wan't to know what is supported.

Given you are comfortable and focused on saving time, use a system that:\n\n* allows you to import all of the original data and schemas, and\n* build incremental transforms that will turn that messy data into conforming data. \n\nOne option is to dump everything into a data platform (snowflake here) and clean it up there, although that will skyrocket the costs. Another option is that you use an open source solution to process this before loading it into snowflake. Options include systems like delta lake and tabsdata. \n\nBottomline is that whatever you do, it should lead to operational dataflows that will continue to work after the current backlog is finished to ensure that the systems stay in sync until the legacy ERP is retired (which, brace for it, may never happen).\n\n(Edit: formatting)",

What if the API is not available or taking too long to respond?  What if the ETL assumptions you make are no longer valid? While none of these issues may immediately prop up, they invariably eventually will. Unless you are building a product that can be widely deployed for such use cases (which would require significant over engineering), you will end up making assumptions one after the other that eventually become invalid and cause failures. The solution will eventually lead to more patchwork etc.\n\nAnother example - what if the requirements, which are arguably very simple now, change down the line. At that time, you may not see it as your problem but your employer will unfortunately.\n\nHope you see the point. Given you have simple connectivity and you are comfortable with python, I strongly suggest looking at tabsdata as a possible open source solution that will help you focus on your domain/ETL logic and can use the connectivity you provide. Most other systems will split the ingest and transform into different layers unless the transform logic is trivial.",

Do a two-step flow: validate/transform first, then post. Add retries with backoff, timeouts, and a circuit breaker; failed records go to a dead-letter table so the run can keep going. Version your transform with Pydantic models so schema drift blows up loudly. Log a correlation\\_id end to end and ship structured logs. Do a daily reconciliation: counts and a checksum/hash by vendor to catch silent misses.\n\nIf you don’t have native connectors, tabsdata is a decent middle ground to keep your transforms in one place; otherwise a light orchestrator like Prefect beats Task Scheduler for retries and alerts. I’ve used Airbyte and tabsdata, but DreamFactory helped when I needed to expose legacy ERP tables as clean REST endpoints without writing glue code.\n\nPoint is: make it idempotent, add state + retries, and use a lightweight orchestrator so maintenance stays sane.",

Each persons changes remain separated (in their own branch) until they are reviewed and merged to Prod. \n\nFor #2, it doesn't work that way for our environment. As soon as a dev tests and passes their code to stage/uat it's in a singular branch. So, if three different devs have merged their code to stage, but only two of their changes have been reviewed by a UAT resource (let's say the 3rd devs code needs to be reviewed by a different UAT resource), we still can't merge the code to prod because there's a pending change in the branch that hasn't been reviewed yet. Make sense?\n\nThis wouldn't be an issue if the team was smaller. But since this dbt project covers multiple business applications, sometimes one UAT resource approves changes but another hasn't had time to look over remaining code changes in the stage branch.",

The team that stayed needed elastic SQL at high concurrency, cross‑cloud, mature Spark, and better CI/CD; Fabric Spark jobs were slower for them, pipelines felt young, and workspace isolation made dev/prod clunky. Also test for throttling during heavy Power BI refresh windows; we hit capacity collisions.\n\nOP, run a 3-4 week POC: pick a heavy SQL ELT job, one streaming workload, and a BI model; baseline cost at target concurrency; validate git deployment, lineage, RLS, private endpoints, and backup/restore/failover. Fivetran for ingestion and dbt for transforms worked well; we also used DreamFactory to expose warehouse tables as quick REST APIs for app teams.\n\nIf Power BI + governance consolidation doesn’t deliver clear savings and simpler ops, stick with Snowflake/Databricks.",

Ship a CLI that outputs both JSONL and JUnit XML so GitHub Actions/GitLab can surface failures inline, plus per-check severity (warn vs fail) and exit codes. Add partition-aware filters (like lastndays or where on a timestamp) and a tiny state store (sqlite) to track baselines for freshness/volume z-scores. For CSV, consider running via DuckDB so DB/CSV share one SQL adapter, and add a statement timeout and optional EXPLAIN to catch accidental full scans. An Airflow operator and a dbt post-hook would make it drop-in; also support sampling and row\\_count deltas pre/post transforms. For messy schemas, ship a “hints.yml” that maps ugly names to semantics so Claude prompts stay deterministic. With dbt and Soda Core for assertions and anomaly checks, I’ve also used DreamFactory to spin up quick REST endpoints over Snowflake/Postgres that a tester can hit in CI.

They write large columnar files optimized for S3 GET efficiency, not millions of small objects that would destroy economics with API call overhead.\n\nThe flat rate hides the variability underneath.

If you are new, having strong fundamentals is a lot more important because somebody who can quickly pick up how things work is a lot more likely to be somebody who is a valuable contributor than somebody who is sleepwalking through certificates and courses, not really being sure what to do.\n\nOnly ones I do recommend is do the free AWS cloud course.\n\nThe next question is - well, how do I stand out? Get on the phone and speak to recruiters.  Go and build rapport and sell your experience that way by showing you know more than your CV lets on.  At the end of the day, everybody needs each other.  They're the gatekeeper who wants to let people in so they can get paid, so it's in their best interest to place you provided you meet the criteria.\n\nMore often than not, it's giving the recruiter confidence to put you forward more than being 100% qualified for the job.  Nobody in the job advert will ever say \"Will take somebody who can program, lives in the UK, and isn't an utter bellend\" although sometimes that's exactly what they're looking for.  Only the person in the hiring process will tell you that.",

I'm extremely biased as this was my main skill before I got my first role, although I think webscraping is a great base skill to have as it makes you can build datasets from what is essentially a bit of a mess.

Streams/Tasks help keep it fresh.\n\n\\- Generate a date spine per entity (join keys × dates between first\\_seen and last\\_seen).\n\n\\- Join spine to changes and compute running metrics with window functions (SUM/COUNT/MIN/MAX over partition by entity order by date rows between unbounded preceding and current row). For “cumulative sets,” LISTAGG over a window is simpler than ARRAY\\_AGG; then SPLIT to array at the end if you really need arrays.\n\n\n\nARRAY\\_AGG downsides for backfills: large rows, re-sorting costs, and tricky partial updates. If arrays are mandatory, store them by (entity\\_id, as\\_of\\_date) so you can upsert only affected ranges, and recluster on (entity\\_id, as\\_of\\_date) to keep scans tight. For huge backfills, process in daily or monthly buckets and only for changed entity\\_ids captured via streams.\n\n\n\nI’ve used Fivetran and dbt for ingestion/modeling, and DreamFactory to expose the cumulative table as a REST API to downstream tools without hand-rolling endpoints.\n\n\n\nBottom line: set-based spine + window functions, processed in chunks, beats loops every time.",

Why:\n- being too specific with LLMs kills their agency. Semantic/metric layers often even define how you sort the data. It’s good for dashboards and such but not for exploratory analysis usually triggered by prompting — recommended read: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents\n\n- semantic layers are (due to how specific they need to be) are long and never ending projects. AI is moving faster, you don’t want to block AI to when semantic layer is ready (never)\n\nWhat do you think?",

Think Airflow for orchestration, Terraform for infra, Git workflows for collaboration.\n\nThe mistake most teams make is building custom internal tools nobody uses. Instead, adopt standard open source with good docs. Your value is curating datasets and maintaining platform, not building bespoke ETL frameworks.\n\nStart small: pick 3 high-value datasets, build them as self-service products with clear schemas and documentation. Iterate based on what users actually request. Scale the patterns that work.\n\nAvoid the trap of trying to build everything before launch. Ship incrementally.",

It's Conway's Law applied to data teams. Your architecture will mirror how your org consumes data. Build a data lake with APIs when business units want self-service SQL and you built the wrong thing regardless of technical excellence.\n\nStart with access patterns not technology. Survey the dozen most common requests. Dashboards, raw exports, real-time streams, or ML features? That tells you what to build. Most 300 person orgs need a data warehouse with dbt for transformations, not streaming Kafka sitting idle.\n\nMid-level team is your advantage. Senior engineers overbuild. You'll ship Postgres with Airbyte and dbt in 8 weeks. Senior teams debate Snowflake vs Databricks for 6 months then build custom Spark jobs nobody maintains.\n\nYour bottleneck is governance not technology. When 50 technical hires pull data you need contracts, documentation, access controls. Build the boring stuff first. Data catalog, CI/CD for transformations, automated testing. Those determine success more than storage layer.\n\nAvoid custom APIs for data access. Every team tries this and regrets it. SQL access with permissions is enough.",

The Dev environment needs to have prod data.  My team uses dbt for our sql models, and we configure our dev environment to pull in prod data\n\n\nOkay, so now you have a dev and a prod SSIS environment.  You need to configure your environment variables in the SSIS project. This will allow GitHub later to switch between environments based on the git branch.\n\nYou can use Github actions to build the ci/cd.  The action is just a yaml file that gives github a list of instructions to perform.  \n\nHere is the workflow. You push code for your local repo, les call it ticket SSIS-001.  The ticket changed the column name in a table.  When you push the local changes to the remote branch, aka SSIS-001, on the remote server.  The Github actions will kick off the instructions.  The goal of the instructions is to confirm of the deployment is worked as expected.   You will probably want to run some test that check if any of your transformations fail.  If any transformation fails, the entire pipeline will fail. When this happens, the ci/cd will stop.  This means you can't merge SSIS-001 into prod.\n\nSo, now you go back on your local branch and fix the issue and push the changed back to the remote SSIS-001  branch.  The pipeline passed, and now you merge into master branch.   The master branch will run a pipeline that is the same and then push the dtsx package to ssis server and done.\n\nCheckout Azure DevOps that might where you want to handle the ci/cd.  But if you google github actions or Azure dev ops for ssis you will get a yaml file that will look exactly like how you deploy manually today",

Warehouse contention matters too: backfills competing with micro-batches. We split Snowflake warehouses (EL vs T), add resource monitors, and throttle backfills via Airflow variables.

        "body": "Off the bat there really aren’t universal “best practices” - Data Engineering has historically been a very “dirty” area in IT. You will need to be able to adapt to kind of whatever your company throws at you/wants from you. It’s definitely getting better, tools like Dagster, dlt, dbt (R.I.P. this open source project…) together with [PEP 318](https://peps.python.org/pep-0318/) (and associated RFP) have really helped to push DE closer towards SE in design and implementation. As such you are best looking at best practices around software engineering principles and adapting to your work.\n\nTo answer your questions, please see below:\n1. This VERY much up to you as the DE to decide. The OLTP -> HDFS/S3(-like) storage is a very common use case and as such has a lot of choice for you as the DE. In saying that it’s easiest to usually use what you have on hand/in production already. Have SSIS - you can start with that, only have Python - use that. What you are really asking here is how do I ETL - just google ETL OLTP to storage etc.\n2. For you (or your architects/plats guys if you have them) to decide, but I personally would want separation of services since I’m not trying to deal with noisy neighbours etc. You really don’t want to add more ways for your Production OLTP server to crash/underperform IMO. So I would recommend a seperate VM/dedicated file server/service with proper subnetting etc.\n3. Will once again depend on use case, but almost always will be read-replica if they exist in your corp. (You can take this as - Yes, use your read replica(e).\n4. You will need a VPN gateway (unless you are running some ExpressRoute etc). Also you will need to give the cloud storage a Private IP address (and check subnetting/peering etc) Your network guy(s) will know what to do/should really be doing this for you.\n5. Just more ETL - this time file system to cloud storage. Once again you decide.\n6. 🤷 Up to you. I personally don’t use them as they quite expensive and don’t seem worth it to me and my practice, but if your company is on board and you feel more comfortable using them go for it.\n\nEdit: I want to point out that it entirely possible to this all on-premise (and open sourced 😊) if you need/the cloud aspect is the most frustrating portion.",

Depending upon what the data stored in the cloud is used for, you may need a different strategy altogether (snapshots, append, replication, etc).\n\n> Would I extract files from the database through custom scripts (Python, shell) which access the production database and copy data to a dedicated file system?\n\nBetter to use a system that can query your database and send that data to destination system. Commercial solutions like fivetran or open source systems like tabsdata could be used. Try not to have your own managed staging area as that creates complications and management overhead.\n\n> Would the file system be on the same server as the database or on a separate server?\n\nIf you still do that, don't put data on the system where the db is, use a spearate system.\n\n> Is it better to extract the data from a replica or would it also be acceptable to access the production database?\n\nDepends upon on the db load profile. Use the replica if it is readily available unless the load on the production database is low enough that you can query it directly for data extraction.\n\n> How do I connect an on-premise server with cloud storage?\n\nThere are data movement systems you can and should use for this. No point in reinventing the wheel as it will get complicated very fast.\n\n> How do I transfer the extracted data that is now on the file system to cloud storage? Again custom scripts?\n\nAgain, if you insist on going this route, I would still suggest using a data movement system to pick it up from local file system and sending it to cloud.\n\n> What about tools like Fivetran and Airbyte?\n\nThat is a good idea. Use them. Other open source tools to consider - apahe camel and tabsdata.",

At deploy time, read the registry and build assets with consistent keys like source.table; new tables mean a small config change, not new code. Use SourceAsset for cross-repo dependencies and auto-materialize policies to keep downstream models up to date.\n\nPartition raw by ingestion date (daily/hourly), then map partitions downstream; avoid per-table custom partitions unless there’s a real reason. Cap fan-out with multi-asset nodes for shared transforms. Sensors: file sensors for landing zones, plus a “schema drift” sensor that diffs metadata and opens a PR to update the registry so assets get generated on the next deploy. Testing: unit-test asset functions with buildassetcontext, add asset checks for row counts/nulls, and layer Great Expectations or pandera where needed.\n\nI’ve used Airbyte for ingestion and dbt for transforms; in a few cases DreamFactory auto-generated REST APIs on top of legacy DBs so Dagster could pull from them without custom services.\n\nShort version: keep core assets static, generate raw assets from metadata.",

Objectively, if you are somebody who works in engineering or science and spend a lot of your time crunching numbers and interpreting spectra/graphs/lines on paper correlating to values, then mid level is absolutely for you because you already have one part of being a DE drilled in - interrogating generated data\n* If you do not have any experience of working in a data focussed job (perhaps you're a service worker or manual labourer with a big interest in programming, automation, and data), then start as a data analyst, get used to working with data, and build from there\n\nSo, in your case, it'll be option 2 by the sounds of it.",

This is paramount.  Aim to complete things already in play before you start new things.\n\nI'd drop the product.

This is like one of those things when at work everybody says \"I need this tomorrow!\" so you bust it out and then it turns out they didn't need it tomorrow.\n\nPrioritise what's important.

You can't contract, progress your career, and build a product at the same time.",

If you're still in the beginning phase, you can just learn a thing, and them muck about for a week making lots of silly little games with the thing, and then learn another thing. I used to make silly Star Wars games in STOS BASIC where you flew circles around and fired lines at other circles, and then you blew up the death star and it make a bit expanding flashing circle you had to outrun. Or menu-based simulation games, where the interface was just entering numbers in the terminal. The trick is to get just far enough that you're actually enjoying playing the things you make, and then you'll naturally want to hack it to do some new cool thing you thought of.",

At university, you will learn way more complex DSA than when you are self taught.

That's the real benefit: I know what to look up, and when I need it.\n\nOther topics that I know \"enough\" about to gain a massive speed boost, should they become relevant, include how operating systems work, how the network stack works, basically all math that will ever be relevant to me, how compilers/interpreters work, and probably a lot more passive knowledge I forgot about.\n\nEDIT: \n\nYou absolutely CAN learn all of that by yourself, but generally people don't (and it takes quite a while longer without good lecturers, tutors, fellow students, dedicated time and pressure to learn things you don't particularly enjoy)",

Let's say they get 2000 applications for an open posting. They need to cut it down to, say, 10 to call in for an interview. If half of those 2000 don't have a B.Sc. in Comp Sci on their resume, it is easy to toss them in a bin and cut your search space in half. Will you throw away some applications from great candidates? Absolutely. But their priority will be whittling down the pile of resumes to a more manageable number as fast as possible so anything they can filter on is great.\n\nNext to that hurdle, there's just that university comes with lots of networking skills. You'll make contacts - especially if you do an internship, but even if you don't if you have a good reputation in your program the other good students are going to remember you. And might give you a recommendation if you try to get in where they work. The whole \"it isn't what you know, it is who you know\" is at least partially true in every field.\n\nOkay, social/employment considerations aside, what actual learning advantages does University have? There's a few.\n\nFirst is time. Between classes and studying and assignments, you'll probably spend 5000 hours over 4 years on comp sci as you go through the degree, which I think is probably the bare minimum you need to get competent. A lot of self-taught people are trying to cram in all their learning into just a couple hundred hours and that's super unrealistic.\n\nIn addition, when your work is being evaluated by others it helps you figure out if you're actually learning anything. Good professors (and they aren't all good) will design assessments that are really testing if you understand the material deeply. Whereas I see so many people \"self-teach\" themselves and learn *nothing* because their knowledge is never put to the test and they never realize they've just been copying tutorials and never actually internalized anything.\n\nIn terms of actual subject matter, yeah, fundamentals, data structures and algorithms, that type of thing self-taught people tend to miss out on. But there's like a *million* books you can pick up that'll teach you those. The employment angle and the \"actually forcing you to spend the time and effort instead of just convincing yourself you're learning\" parts are the far more important aspects for most people.",

Is it programming small microprocessors to make an LED blink? \n\nC is an awesome language and the possibilities are endless. You can do a lot of low level things and learn a lot about hardware architecture. Most of my suggestions above almost *require* C at times. Maybe that’s your thing maybe it isn’t (it *is* my thing if you can’t tell). Unfortunately school classes are not usually good at helping us find *what* we want to do with programming. \n\nStruggling in a class is another thing though and very rough. So I’m sorry you’re going through that. It’s especially hard when it’s something you thought you’d like. Try and see what school resources you have, sometimes they have free support systems for people who want to help struggling students. Sometimes it takes in-person help to really wrap our head around complex subjects. Programming can take shaping your brain to think differently for those who don’t already think like a robot.",

Theory of code is great. It’s nice to understand concepts. But truly understanding code comes from writing it. Seeing the same error and then eventually clicking “oh it’s because I put this here, or oh, I see how to refactor this into less spaghetti”\nAdditionally, while C is a backbone language it is considered low level, and you might benefit from taking what you know and applying it to another language. Some are much easier to learn than others. For example, writing a webpage with basic functions (like say writing a blog post) is significantly easier in my opinion than the majority of things you could build in C. Not only is the syntax easier to understand and master, but you get immediate gratification in seeing what you’re doing as you work and change things. E.g. changing the size of text or a container can be immediately seen when you reload the page or even faster if you use a plugin like Live Server. (Refreshes page every save so you don’t have to manually reload the page). Anyway, my point is don’t fret on not understanding all of the conceptual stuff. Some of it will come in time. There’s still theory far beyond me and I’ve been employed and coding projects for about five years now and again I need to note I didn’t return to college and pick coding back up until my mid twenties. However, I started with Python and then quickly moved into data cleaning with python libraries like NumPy and Pandas. Then web development, then swiftUI, and now I actually mostly use react (JS library), and for personal projects a lot of godot so gdscript.",

It includes:\n\n\\- Communication server and client in C - supporting both Internet sockets and AF\\_UNIX sockets for easy testing  \n\\- Packet construction and parsing modules for a custom userspace payload protocol  \n\\- BigInt Math library including not only ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV but more advanced stuff like Montgomery Modular Multiplication, to do math on gargantuan numbers with thousands of digits each..  \n\\- Cryptography library implementing Diffie-Hellman prime search and shared secret generation, chacha20, blake2, argon2id, stuff like that.\n\nAfter this is done, I'm planning to do a project that has both low-level components like FPGA / kernel modules, as well as high-level components like a website (whose webserver i'll write in Assembly of course, frontend in CSS/HTML/JS) to control the embedded board remotely from anywhere or something. It would be cool to have a project that goes through the entire specter from lowest-level programming to high-level javascript. :D",

It gets into an \"operations\" problem.\n\nThe short answer: just make a file on a Local Area Network (LAN), (usually just on your home network somewhere), and then access it by that local network's IP address.\n\nLong answer: By _default_, nothing has a domain name on the internet.  You have to apply to get one of those if you want it to be public, and it's a whole process.\n\nBy _default_, everything on the internet has an IP address.  This address allows the computer to figure out what other computer to talk to.\n\nMost (home network) LANs have an NAT (network address translator), which takes all the requests sent to it that are destined for the WWW, and translates them so the data gets sent back to said NAT, and translates it back to the LAN address.  This NAT is usually in a Router (a connection between two different networks.)\n\nWithout this router, you cannot connect to the LAN from the internet, so it is not public.\n\nWith this router, the stuff on your network is only public if you change the router settings to allow incoming connections (usually with Port Forwarding/Triggering)\n\nThus, routers have two different IP addresses.  One for \"the internet\" to communicate with it, and one for the LAN, to communicate with the LAN.\n\nAny computer connected to the LAN can talk to any other device on the LAN with its IP address.  This LAN address usually starts with 10., or 192.168., depending on how the router is set up.\n\nSo if you save the website on a local computer, then use the computers LAN IP as the URL on any other computer in that LAN, you get what you want.",

Nobody's going to accidentally discover that, but copying IPv6 addresses around is kind of a pain and the people you're sharing it with may not even have IPv6 access.\n\nThe easiest thing to do is just to not worry about any of that.  Get a domain name, run a server to serve your web page, and put a password on it.  Practically every web server will allow you to require a username & password to access a page, so you can just set that and then also give those out to anybody you want to access it.",

Every time you think you have solved all of the problems, you will discover a new problem.\n\nMany people probably chose poor time representations for their systems. And you need to talk to those systems.\n\nYou proposed Epoch time. Two immediate questions. How are you going to store the time zone? And what if you want to store just a date and not a time?\n\nWill you store the time zone as number of hours away from UTC? You better not because that’s a mistake. Daylight savings time rules vary from place to place. So you need to store the actual time zone (eg: Eastern time) rather than “UTC-5”.\n\nIf I put in “October 15th, 2025” and I’m in eastern time, how will you store that in Epoch time?\n\nAnother fun detail: weekends vary from country to country. Much of the Middle East used to have Thursday/Friday as the weekend. Friday is the day of prayer. \n\nBut a lot of countries in the region switched to Friday/Saturday so that they would share more working days with the rest of the world. \n\nOh. Brunei is an exception. Their weekend days are _non contiguous_. Friday/Sunday. \n\nYou thought that country was enough? Hah. No. Indonesia. Different regions of Indonesia have different weekend days. Varies by the predominant religion in the region.",

It's a good video.\n\nBut really it's because the thing you call \"time\" isn't just one thing. The measurement unit and restriction physicists and astronomers need and grapple with isn't really identical to the social construct involved in your alarm clock. The laws of physics, the laws of a country and the laws of an economic zone aren't even laws in the same sense.\n\nE.g. one difference between unix time and UTC is [leap seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second). There are a few different strategies to dealing with this on computers, like making the seconds slightly longer throughout the day, or adding a 61st second to a relevant minute, which may be enumerated as either `59, 60, 00` or `59, 59, 00`. All of the options fuck with software that has no clue what a leap second is.\n\nAnother example: [Sidereal years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_year) aren't the same thing as the thing you're used to thinking of as a year (here's a nice [veritasium video on that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUHkTs-Ipfg)).\n\nAnd those are just physics problems. In addition you've got all the social problems involved in timezones as the other commenters have gone into.\n\n\"Time\" is a simple word hiding a lot of horribly complex ideas. So the implementations wind up complex too.\n\nAnd then usually they get something wrong, or become unwieldy in attempts to become more correct, and are replaced with something that is promised to be more pleasant to use.",

For game engines, there are plenty of tutorials you can watch.\n\nI also learned at 14 in 1998 with QBASIC on DOS. There was no Google and I had a \"secret codebook\" with some simple programming details, and I taught myself from there until I took a class in high school on C++. It's *way* easier to learn now. So yes, I would argue you can definitely do it!\n\nThe key thing is to start small. Take things one step at a time. Don't add a game engine before you know what a variable or condition is. You don't need to finish the whole [Harvard CS50 course](https://www.youtube.com/cs50) before you open a game engine, but at least a few intro videos can be a big help.\n\nFor game engines, both Unity and Godot are popular for beginners. Godot is easier to start with (simpler, no setup), Unity has more jobs/resources. Both are great choices.\n\nEither way, I'd take one of many online programming courses in Python or C\\# before jumping into an engine, or perhaps dig into the CS50 course for more structured learning. A game engine adds a bunch of concepts on top of programming that are specific to the engine. If you want to jump in with both feet, that's fine, but you may struggle with information overload. If that happens, I recommend taking a break from the game engine and going back to programming basics, then trying the engine again when you feel more comfortable.\n\nGood luck!",

The current LTS are Java 21 and Java 25.\n\nAnd similar version changes have happened also to Spring Boot and other things.\n\nBut as we know, the real life shows that companies are still using old versions because most of the development funds go to adding new features and fixing bugs. Infrastructure upgrades are of lower priority for the management level.\n\nMaybe somehow big thing was Log4Shell vulnerability that affects Log4J versions between 2.0 and 2.15. If you have any projects using Log4J from these versions then update your stuff. That Log4Shell was a catastrophe level vulnerability. Or, just learn to use vulnerability checking tools like OWASP Dependencycheck or Trivy scanner if you are not doing it already.\n\nOther than that, the world is quite same in 2025 as it was in 2017.\n\nWhen it comes to an AI then that is what you need to learn to use. Everything else is just version upgrades.\n\nThere is free ChatGPT tier you can use. Also Google AI Studio is free to use (better than free ChatGPT tier). Just try it out. See what it can do and what it can't do. I would say that the current AI is on a Bachelor student's level. So, imagine working with a Junior developer. Sure, it is a helpful tool when it comes to debugging stuff, brainstorming, etc. Also when it comes to automating simple things. But do not fully trust its output. Be critical about its answers. Imagine doing a code review to a Junior developer.

Many of the AI tools can access the Internet. BUT it does not mean it will do it. It is lazy. Unless you demand from it to look up information from the Internet it will not do it. It tries to rely mainly on its training data (which can be outdated). It also hallucinates when it does not have an exact answer to something. It starts generalizing stuff and making up answers.\n\nSo, be critical with what the AI is telling you. It is a useful tool but do not fully trust it. The same way how you do not fully trust Google Search results. Verify over, when possible.\n\nYou can also use Claude Code that can work with your projects in your own machine. But all the pros and cons of AI apply also to Claude Code. You will tell it to do things and it will then display code changes with a git diff. Then you will either approve, reject, or correct it with your own input on this.\n\nEdit: That answer is based on what concerns backend development.

I know some people get ergonomic mice for this, but I opted to change my workflow.  I started using Linux with a tiling window manager and multiple monitors, a mouse-free text editor(Emacs, and later Neovim), CLI interfaces when possible, and the Vimium C browser plugin for the bulk of my web navigation.

Only one packet can be sent by one host at any given time, since there’s only one wire to talk on.\n\nRather than send EVERY packet on your local lan to EVERY host on your local lan, a switch pays attention to the traffic (including some special packets) and figures out who’s on which physical outgoing cable, and sends packets only to their recipients.  But that’s just an optimization.  It does the same *job* as twisting 8 sets of wires together, like the hub was doing.  Purely a local-network thing.\n\nYou can see how this is totally different than inspecting packet headers, consulting routing tables, and forwarding a packet along on its way to who knows where.\n\n[I guess that’s a long way of saying that a router routes IP packets on the global network , and a switch “routes” Ethernet packets on the local network.

This isn't talking about some real physical router, **this is talking about the abstract concept of a router's core function**. The network layer is where packets are moved around between separate 'local' network segments.\n\nA 'switch' is a layer 2 device, because that core functionality of a 'switch' belongs on the OSI model. Layer 2 is about connecting the physical devices together on the local network.\n\nReal, physical devices that you actually use, almost always operates at ALL layers.  A router will have a physical connection to other devices, it will will have to be using something like Ethernet to connect, it will have a networking protocol like IP, IPX or something obscure for its primary functionality.  But it will also have a management interface, and often it will have some support for network services like ntp, dhcp, dns, etc, meaning it will operate in layer 4-7.\n\nMany of the devices called 'switches' you will have access these days also can operate as routers, have packet filtering and so on. Many devices that are called 'routers' and used for home networks include a switch.  I could take a random computer and put in a few network interfaces in it, and with Linux turn it into a router, or switch.  What something is called is more about what you believe the primary function of the device is.\n\n> even though switch comes after router. \n\nWhen looking at the OSI model, you must evaluate it individual for every single device between the source and destination.  A computer L1-7 will be often be connected to something acting as a switch L1-2, which will be connected to a router L1-3, which which may be connected to another switch L1-2, which may be connected to another computer L1-7.\n\nOn a typical wired network you will have some kind of physical connection, your Ethernet frames between nodes are happening at layer 2, the Ethernet frames contain Internet Packets, Internet packets will often be TCP or UDP, Your TCP or UDP packet will often contain some kind of application playload.\n\n>  Im confused on why the architecture was designed in a way so router have to look into higher layer just for it to encapsulate it again and pass it to lower level device.\n\nThough it is mostly used everywhere these days, it is very important to remember, that the world isn't just Ethernet.  A router can connect different types of networks. A 'switch' is basically an Ethernet only thing.\n\nIt used to be very common to have a T1 (serial), or frame-relay, or some other type layer 2 network connect to the router, and maybe a token ring network on the 'local' segment.\n\nFor people with a cable internet connection (DOCSIS) they will have a router with a cable interface and an ethernet interfaces. Or maybe you'll could have a DSL connection so you'll have a router with a DSL interface.\n\nDSL, DOCSIS, frame relay, fddi, token ring and many more are not Ethernet. They operate differently at layers 1-2.",

Trying to operate at an ethernet (layer 2) level across billions of computers around the world sounds like a bad time. \n\n> it feels weird how router is on layer 3 but switch is in layer 2 even though switch comes after router. \n\nI am not sure what \"switch comes after the router\" means here.

Ethernet is what most of us think about and is extremely common in home and business networks.  But there are many more.  High capacity fiber links, satellite networks, cellular networks, even USB and Bluetooth, all have their own implementations and their own particular way of sending data between devices on those networks.  \n\nThe Internet Protocol accepts the fact that network operators won’t always agree on what devices and protocols to use, and that new network innovations might occur in the future.  The Ethernet protocol is actually younger than the IP protocol.  There were other types of networks in use when IP was developed, some still in use and others not.  \n\nWith IP, as long as devices are able to send an ordered sequence of bytes over a network they can handle IP traffic, and a lot of details necessary for how those bytes are moved in the network are left to the lower layers.",

Of course the answer is no, there's more that goes into it.\n\nMore generally if you're asking about like building a solution for something that already exists, whether it's a product or a library, there are tradeoffs. Of course doing it yourself is more work, but the tradeoff is you understand it more and have more control.\n\nIt is true that as the industry matures more and more we ought to converge towards just using libraries for everything and writing less code overall, once all the primitive challenges are solved. But today in the real world we're still probably not even close, and every application usually has a combination of requirements that are solved and unsolved, even if the unsolved requirements are just simpler domain specific issues.\n\nSo basically I wouldn't worry about it too much, you can try things one way and then try them another way.",

There are patterns for building roofs to deal with all sorts of different kinds of weather, but you have to pick one; there are patterns for storing data for financial transactions, for IoT telemetry, for social media -- but you have to pick one.\n\nOther patterns are niche, or create some specific effect you might not even want.\n\nIf you are at the level of experience to ask this question, almost everything you do will have been done by other people enough times that it's possible to talk about a pattern.

Once you know the basics, use AI to speed up work (scaffolding, tests, explanations).\n\nIf you want to learn frontend connection and use AI in development, a practical way is to build a small, deployable app end-to-end. You may or may not follow a course for the app idea. Utilize platforms such as Replit or Lovable or similar, to prototype a frontend for your backend. Those platforms provide code for the generated frontend prototype. Use ChatGPT (or another model) to clarify each generated code block and how it could integrate into your backend application. Write the code(implement it yourself, not copy) in your backend developed application. Reading, running, and editing the code is how you learn. Use AI as an assistant to make your app better.

Use a secure, unique password, with 2FA if possible. Don't fall for phishing attacks that seem like they're coming from your registrar but aren't really.\n\nThe other is the privacy of your registration information. ICANN requires that all domains have valid contact information, including a mailing address, and that information is made public through the \"Whois\" database system. If you don't want your details to be public, you may want to use whatever privacy forwarding service that your registrar provides. (If you just provide fake info, it's possible that you'll lose access to the domain when the contact info can't be validated.)\n\n----\n\nEverything else depends not on the domain itself, but what server you're pointing its DNS records at.\n\nIf you're using a static file host such as GitHub Pages, then there's not much to be concerned with. Any attacks would go to GitHub's servers, not yours, and there's not much risk of a security problem affecting your data specifically. All you really have to worry about is inadvertently publishing information that you want to keep private, but that's true of literally any digital communications.\n\nIf you were to have your own webapp running on your own server, then you would have to be a lot more careful with security, but that's true whether or not there's a domain name pointing to your server.",

Take 2 equations: f(x) = 100x + 10, g(x) = x (the simplest function we can represent with the same degree as f(x)).\n\nThe largest exponent for both of these equations is 1, so we can apply the above rule. Let's choose a constant of 105 for c.\n\nFor some values of x, f(x) > c * g(x). Take x == 1 for example. F would be 110 and g would be 1. 110 > 105 (1 * C). However, at larger values of x, this doesn't stay true. At x == 10 we get f is 1,010 and g is 10. So, for these values, f(x) < g(x) * c, since 10 * 105 is 1,050 and 1,050 > 1,010.\n\nBasically, this just sums down to the idea that a functions growth is capped to its largest exponent, which is why Big O notation always ignores constants (except for O(1)). So, even something like f(x) = 1,000,000,000x, the Big O notation would be O(x), because there exists a constant C and a value of x X0 that f(x) < c * g(x).",

If you can represent the data in a way that makes sense and start with that, it becomes easier to do the rest. \"Great programmers worry about data, not code.\"\n\nAn example might be, if you want to make a picture editor. The data you want to manipulate is an image. So you think about how you might want to store the image in memory. Maybe as an x/y grid (a 2d array)?\n\nMaybe start there, and get it showing on the screen immediately so you know it's working as expected. Then you can start adding other stuff. Don't try to plan and write it all out at once.. get your data on the screen so it's easy to manipulate, and work from there.\n\nThis can be applied to most kinds of programs.\n\nFor me, there is a strong connection between computing and humanities. A computer is probably the most powerful artistic medium ever created. Programming itself is a creative medium. But just as you can't write ideas without first learning an alphabet, you have to learn some basics about manipulating bits to wield the power of programming.

Stick to it until you have a good grip and you’re able to build a fairly robust app. \n\nAfter you can look into other languages and specify into what you want. It’s not crazy hard to change later once you know what you want to do with the new language. \n\nPersonal recommendation:\n\nIf you want to build mobile apps go with Java and Android Studio. It’ll do a lot of the heavy lifting for you and it has a drag and drop GUI builder. \n\nIf you want to go the longer route and get the basics down start with C. Try CS50x (Harvard’s free course), that’ll bringing you through C fairly well (to start) and cover a bit of html and Python, I think it uses flask towards the end but I can’t remember. \n\nI like Python alright but I wouldn’t recommend starting there, you don’t need to define types and it’s an interpreted language so you don’t compile to find errors which is a big lesson in learning early on. Also it is a bit different from how key features work (tuples, indentation, for loops). I’d stick with a more traditional one to start. \n\nJavaScript unless you want to go full web-dev I wouldn’t go there either (not really a fan). Again like Python it’s interpreted. It will run on any browser but I’ve only done the bare minimum when I’ve had to use it. \n\nMost importantly check back in 2 years when I’ll be advising you that JS is the only way to go, after getting out of bed on the other side or something. \n\nBut really getting a start on any of them and sticking out the hard parts is the way to go.

Syntax isn't difficult, what is difficult is problem solving and that's what programming is at it's core. If you pick up a good book or a good course, that course will not just teach you the technology but how it works and why it works and how to use it. For example, I did CS50 and it's great, it's really good. It doesn't just teach you C and Python and SQL, it teaches you why those tools are useful, how to use them, how to solve problems with them. The course focuses more on what programming is, other than what language are we using this week.\n\nI believe that learning how to problem solve and how to write code will teach you so much more than just doing a Python course and moving on. Once you learn the fundamentals of programming and the concepts every other mainstream language will look pretty much the same, of course some of them will have differences big or small but most of the concepts carry over.

You can do this over and over until they're small enough. That'll give you a kind of plan.\n\nFocusing on this skill first will let you realise you can split things into pieces and then do them in whichever order you like.\n\nThis is a skill that's totally useful for all programming tasks.\n\nThe second thing to learn is \"make skeletons\" or scaffolds — that's to say make it real as soon as possible. The way I do this is I get the minimum viable thing that can do **anything** in place first. When we first learn programming we learn how to do hello world because it's this; the minimum working program.\n\nFor your example, get a single hello web page up, served, online. Get that done. Ok. Now make it two pages that interlink, now make it slighly pretty, now add some graphics, now another page, etc etc. All the while your **big** aim is to build your finished website you have a plan of, but at each step of the way you're making it real, you're getting a serotonin hit from finishing tasks and you're feeling good because you're building things in reality, without doing too much at once, and this lets you get feedback early, too (from both yourself and other people). As you proceed, you may feel the pull to go down rabbit holes and add features, but you should really just add the features to your future list, and possibly change yours plans if it makes sense, and pick the next thing to do based on priorities of getting your project done according to your aims.\n\nAt any time you're free to tear it all down and start again, but this prototyping style of development is extremely useful in **any** kind of development (not just software), and will serve you well for the entire time you develop software of any kind. Get good at these two things, and then when a really big project comes along, you'll be equipped to tackle it by doing a bunch of little prototype experiments on the things you don't know how to do to prove to yourself you can do them, then break the project into pieces and build it bit by bit getting feedback along the way. (\"Agile\" development is really nothing more than keeping the list of next things to do prioritised on your end goal, and allowing for the fact that time is limited and you **may** actually never finish all the features because you run out of time).\n\nThere are other recommendations, but these are the two most important, in my opinion.",

I like the struggle (masochist >,>)\" This is the best attitude you can have. As long as you're enjoying the process of learning, it's just a matter of putting in the hours, hands on keyboard. So, don't stress too much about things, keep having fun.\n\nSecond piece of advice: It's really useful to have a concrete goal in mind. It sounds like you have this right now, but are getting pulled in a few directions by wanting to learn everything, that's okay. I have this issue when I'm working or learning, I'll get these great ideas for new features, projects, things to learn, etc. It's really easy to get sidetracked by them, since a lot of them are genuinely good ideas. My approach is when I'm working on a project, I keep 3 separate todo lists:\n\n1. What are the next steps for my project *right now*. These are things I *need* to get to in the next 1-3 days working on this project. If I am working on a feature and think \"Oooh, I can't forget to update this other thing or it will all break\" I write that down in this list. \n\n2. A list of future features for this project that might be fun to work on later. This could be something like \"Ahh, I want to redesign this component, maybe next week\".\n\n3. A list of other projects I want to work on, or things I want to learn. If I see a cool programming book. Or I have an idea for a cool new website to build. I'll write it down in this list.\n\nBy keeping these three lists, it really helps me avoid going down too deep into rabbit holes. I have a great idea, but instead of getting sidetracked for hours, days, weeks following it, I take a minute or two to get it into the appropriate list. \n\nAlso, lists #1 and #2 make it much easier to jump back into whatever I was last working on the next time I sit down to work on the project. For that reason, I try to keep a list #1 and #2 for each project I have, and I store them in the project itself, so they're always nearby.\n\nHope that's useful!",

I got my first internship in game development right after my final year. At that time, my skillset in game dev wasn’t very strong , even though I had been learning it on my own for almost a year and had even taken a course at university.\n\n\n\nAnyway, once I was surrounded by senior developers during my internship (which later turned into a job), my skills started improving rapidly. I’m a passionate person, and having great seniors around me helped a lot. I took their mentorship seriously, never hesitated to ask questions, and treated projects personally. I often worked after hours on related stuff to improve myself.\n\n\n\nAfter just a few months, I cleared interview for another good job, not only better in terms of pay, but also because of the senior developers I got to work with. Being around skilled people and working on the same projects as they do gives you a huge jump. I even managed to handle the responsibilities of a senior with 5 years of experience who had resigned.\n\n\n\nSo in your case, I can see that you’re passionate but you just need the right environment. I realized that about myself too: I’m passionate, and I need a place that helps me grow. Even though I received another higher-paying offer, I didn’t leave, because I want to focus on building my skillset in these early years.\n\n\n\nWhen you work with brilliant people, you grow much faster , no tutorial or course can give you that. Starting from scratch alone can easily frustrate you because you don’t get that sense of achievement. Seniors usually have strong foundations, so when you learn from them, you learn the right way.",

Learning by building is arguably the most effective way to solidify your skills.\n\nHere's my advice, blending both of your ideas:\n\n**Don't choose between building and learning—do both in a loop.**\n\nYour plan is solid, but instead of just jumping into your big project, use a \"build-learn-apply\" cycle:\n\n1.  **Build** on your project until you hit a wall (e.g., \"How do I fetch user data in Next.js?\").\n2.  **Learn** that *specific* thing. Pause your project, find a good tutorial or read the official docs on just that topic. The official Next.js \"Learn\" course is a great place to start to get the fundamentals down before you dive into your own app.\n3.  **Apply** what you just learned directly to your gym tracker.\n\nThis way, the theory you learn has immediate context, which makes it stick.\n\n**As for your project, here’s how to start:**\n\nBreak it down into the smallest possible pieces. Don't think \"build a gym tracker.\" Think:\n\n*   **Week 1:** Can I make a Next.js page that just says \"My Gym Tracker\" and has a simple form with a button? (No backend yet).\n*   **Week 2:** Can I connect to Supabase and get it to handle a user sign-up?\n*   **Week 3:** Can I make that form actually save data to a Supabase table when I click the button?\n\n**On using AI and making mistakes:**\n\nYour caution is smart. Use AI as a Socratic tutor, not a code generator.\n\n*   **Bad prompt:** \"Write the code for my gym tracker login page with Next.js and Supabase.\"\n*   **Good prompt:** \"I'm building a login page with Next.js and Supabase. What are the key steps and best practices I should be aware of?\"\n\nAnd don't worry about making mistakes you can't see. You will. We all do. Your first version will be messy. The goal isn't to write perfect code now; it's to get something working and learn so much in the process that you can look back in six months and know exactly how to improve it.\n\nYou've got a great plan.

The short answer is: **do both!**\n\n\"Learning by building\" is absolutely the most effective way to make things stick, but diving straight into a complex project without any foundation can be incredibly frustrating.\n\nHere’s a balanced approach that works for many people:\n\n**1. Learn the Prerequisite, Not the Whole Stack.**\nYour goal is a Next.js app. Next.js is a framework built *on top of* React. Before you even think about Next.js or Supabase, spend a few days learning the fundamentals of **React**. Go to the official `react.dev` site and build the simple tic-tac-toe game or a basic to-do list. This will teach you the core concepts (components, state, props) that everything else relies on.\n\n**2. Start Your Project, But Break It Down.**\nOnce you have a basic grasp of React, start your gym tracker. But don't try to build the whole thing. Your first goal should be incredibly small. For example:\n*   **Goal 1:** Create a new Next.js app that just displays \"My Gym Tracker\" on the homepage.\n*   **Goal 2:** Create a component for a single exercise entry (just a text input and a button). Don't worry about saving it yet.\n*   **Goal 3:** Learn how to add that entry to a list on the screen (using React state).\n\nBy breaking it down into tiny, achievable steps, you're still \"learning by building,\" but you're learning one specific concept at a time.\n\n**3. On Using AI:**\nYour caution is smart. Use AI as a Socratic tutor, not a code generator.\n*   **Bad:** \"Write me a component to log a workout with Supabase.\"\n*   **Good:** \"I'm trying to connect my Next.js app to Supabase. Can you explain the steps and show me a minimal example of how to set up the client?\"\n\nYou've got a great plan and the right attitude. This approach avoids \"tutorial hell\" while giving you the foundational knowledge you need to avoid getting completely stuck. Good luck",

This is a great question, and honestly, your plan is one of the most effective ways to learn. \"Learning by building\" is a fantastic approach.\n\nHere's my advice, broken down:\n\n**Don't learn everything first. Use a hybrid approach.**\n\nYour intuition is spot on. Don't spend months on tutorials without building. Instead, use a \"just-in-time\" learning strategy:\n\n1.  **Build** until you hit a wall or a concept you don't understand (e.g., \"How do I save form data?\").\n2.  **Pause** and do a focused \"deep dive\" on that one concept. Watch a quick video or read the official docs about it (e.g., learn about React's `useState` hook or how to make API calls in Next.js).\n3.  **Apply** what you just learned to your project and continue building.\n\nThis way, the theory has immediate context and sticks much better.\n\n**A Simple Roadmap for Your Gym Tracker:**\n\nThe \"where to start\" feeling is totally normal. Break it down into smaller, manageable chunks:\n\n1.  **Static UI First:** Use Next.js to build the visual parts of your app with dummy data. Make a page for logging a workout and a page for viewing past workouts. This gets you familiar with Next.js routing and components without backend complexity.\n2.  **Make it Interactive:** Use React's `useState` hook to manage the form inputs for logging a new workout. Don't worry about saving it yet, just make the form work on the page.\n3.  **Connect to Supabase:** This is a huge step! Set up a simple table in Supabase (e.g., a `workouts` table). Focus on just *reading* data from it and displaying your dummy workouts from the database.\n4.  **Implement the \"Create\":** Now, make your form actually save a new workout to your Supabase table. This is a massive milestone!\n\n**How to Use AI as a Smart Tutor:**\n\nYour caution is wise. Use AI as a guide, not a code generator.\n\n*   **Bad prompt:** \"Write the code for a gym tracker app with Next.js and Supabase.\"\n*   **Good prompt:** \"I'm trying to fetch data from Supabase in a Next.js 14 Server Component. Can you explain the best practice for this and show me a simple example?\"\n\nAsking \"why\" and \"explain this concept\" forces you to learn, while still getting unblocked.\n\nYou have a solid foundation and a great project idea. You'll definitely make mistakes, but that's how you learn to debug—which is 90% of a developer's job anyway.\n\nYou've got this! Just jump in and start with step #1. Good luck",

I also have terminal ADHD.\n\nI firmly believe that almost anyone, including those of us with ADHD, can learn almost anything with the right resources and learning strategies. Those resources aren't guaranteed to be available to you, and you aren't guaranteed to find the right learning strategy if you go looking, but there is a very good chance that you are capable of this.\n\nRandom notes in no particular order from what you've said:\n\n* You're \"supposed\" to learn TypeScript, Rust, JavaScript, Python, React? Why? It is far more valuable to be a good dev in one tech stack than a novice in 10. I strongly suggest picking one set of technologies that you feel suits your purposes and sticking with that. Jumping languages and frameworks every 5 seconds is exhausting and doesn't really teach you anything useful in my experience. It's also much easier for a good Python dev to become a good C# dev than it is for a polyglot novice to become good at any language, IMO.\n* Find a practice/learning style which suits you so that the endless learning doesn't become too much of a chore. For me, implementation is everything. I don't often \"get\" things unless I practice them myself, so if for example I'm learning some new data structure I'll usually hand-code an implementation of it rather than importing someone else's and prove to myself first that it works as I expect, and second that I've gathered enough information to create it. I also use this with programming for other things - my mind is a sieve when it comes to calculus, for example, but writing programs that *do* calculus really helps me crystalise the knowledge.\n* Respect the ADHD. A lot of people aren't going to get it and will give you advice that amounts to \"just keep trying\". Ignore them. I strongly believe that banging your head against a wall or burning yourself out trying to force your mind to act neurotypical is a net negative for learning. If you find yourself struggling for more than, say, 15 minutes on a problem you're quite possibly reinforcing the struggle rather than the progress. Learn when to be gentle with yourself, when to give up and look up the answers. There is such thing as trying too hard.\n* Drink water, sleep, exercise, socialise, rest and relax! Too many junior devs treat their health like shit and then are surprised when they feel like shit. Your concentration and working memory are already compromised by a neurological condition - don't make it worse.\n\nI think I've rambled long enough - please feel free to ask any questions you might have.",

And the time taken to traverse the filesystem and open the file is even tinier. (Profiling will tell you just how tiny.)\n\nAnd as a counterpoint, whenever you go from having a single source of truth (e.g. the filesystem) to multiple separate data stores (the filesystem + a separate database), you increase the number of opportunities for complexity and bugs to creep into your system.\n\nFor *interactive* use, it might well be desirable to maintain a DB with metadata and indexes, so that you can quickly search for individual files. But for a big batch reprocessing job which is going to be slow anyway, I think it makes sense to just treat what's in the filesystem as authoritative, instead of relying on a DB that might potentially become out of sync if there's a bug. The difference in performance is likely to be small.\n\nIf the performance does actually matter (e.g. because you want to re-run your reprocessing job frequently) then what I would probably do is just maintain an index of paths/timestamps/checksums which are known to be \"good\" (don't need re-encoding). This allows you to avoid repeatedly scanning files that haven't changed. But the index itself contains no important data. If it gets lost, or stale, or corrupted, it's extremely unlikely to cause any kind of inconsistency or bad behavior; the worst that will happen is redoing unnecessary work.",

From my understanding, this would put you in competition with people with 4-year degrees, and even the fresh grads here are facing friction.\n\n3.

While yes, people make it work, the tech workforce is still largely made up of 4-year degree holders.\n\n4. Again pre 2020, this was more viable.

If it is a relatively simple CRUD application then it does not need microservices. If it has distinct independent parts that function separately from each other and serve a specific purpose, then you can consider building microservices. \n\nYou can go first with multimodal monolith and see how it works out. If one of the modules becomes too big and starts having way too many that-module-specific-only functionalities, then you can take that module out from the monolith into a separate microservice.\n\nYou can have your monolith running from inside a Docker container and be maintained by Kubernetes. You do not need multiple microservices for that. \n\nMQs or Kafka are needed when you are having separate microservices/monoliths. Although, by an idea, you can set up these also between your modules within one monolith.\n\ngRPC is not always needed. It is much less needed than the other things you mentioned. You are more likely to use REST and then SOAP (with older systems).\n\nIn terms of what you should learn, then pick all but gRPC. And use MQ only when you need it. You can have your senior project running as a monolith inside a Docker container and be managed by Kubernetes and you'll do fine.\n\nThere is a good likelihood that you will be using Docker. It is a must to have. Kubernetes is also a good pick because even with older systems these can be migrated over to Kubernetes when the client is willing to put money in it. With multiple microservices/monoliths and/or multimodal monolith, you are also likely to encounter either some of the MQ tools or Kafka. But as I said, use it in your project when it makes sense to use it. Do not just drop any and all kinds of technologies into your project. It will be an unnecessary technical bloat. Your client will not pay you for stuff that serves no actual purpose (sometimes he is not willing to pay even for meaningful things/upgrades).",

For those not familiar with shell scripting, this course provides an overview of common Linux Shell Commands and shell scripting basics.\n\nIt sounds like it will cover the basics, but it will also go deep into using Bash as a full-fledged programming language, which is probably overkill for what you need. And, after you finish it, you will probably still be left confused about some of the Python- or application-specific commands for running different repositories, which are probably not built-in Linux commands.\n\nIf you'd like to focus on the problem that you mentioned, I'd recommend simply Googling the specific commands that you're confused with, and spending a few minutes learning about each of them. I imagine that terminal commands will never become your main focus in programming, and so this way, you'll simply learn about the ones that you need.\n\nHowever, if diving deep into terminal commands and Bash scripting is still something that you're interested in, the course definitely does seem helpful, so definitely do go ahead and take it if you're interested.",

Then came the mouse.\n\nOn a modern computer, you can open virtual terminals. You can type in them, use the mouse to select text in them, but it’s basically a text thing.\n\nInside the terminal, you are usually discussing with a shell. That is a program that takes your input and acts on it. The form you give to that input, the language, is characteristic of the shell.\n\nOn Windows, the shell today is PowerShell. You get a terminal with that by clicking on the >_ icon somewhere. You can write scripts to be executed with PowerShell, so that you can use its power without having to type everything repeatedly.\n\nOn Linux, there are a number of different shells, but most resemble the original “sh”, and “bash” is indeed one of the best known. As with PowerShell, you can write scripts, and learning to do so is quite worth the effort if you are going to study CS.\n\nYou can certainly also use bash on Windows, but I think you have to install it.\n\nI hope this helped to clear up the basics.",

Since you’ve got 30 months of GI Bill left, that’s plenty of room to double down on a second bachelor’s or even stack a master’s on top, all while keeping benefits coming in.

Local universities could work, but if there’s a real chance you’d run out of GI Bill before finishing, I’d avoid the risk. Game dev at SNHU/Full Sail sounds fun, but since you already love coding, you can chase that hobby on your own without burning GI Bill benefits. Personally, I’d maximize what the GI Bill covers in a way that keeps me employable and debt-free—CS + MS through WGU would probably give you the best return.",

        "body": "The One Definition Rule says there can only be one definition of a function or method. `inline` grants you an ODR exception. C++ also recognizes \"normal\" functions and \"inline\" functions.\n\nBeyond that - `inline` doesn't actually mean much. It's SUPPOSED TO hint the compiler that call elision is preferred (don't generate a function call, just instead integrate the inline function body directly into the point of the call), but the compiler absolutely does not have to honor that. Hell, even non-standard compiler extensions like `__forceinline` STILL won't guarantee call elision, simply because it's not always possible.\n\nIn practice, the compiler internally maintains a list of the two different function types, and when using heuristics to determine if a call should be elided, it will pick either a more conservative or more ambitious value. These values are always adjustable as a compiler parameter, so you could just set both of them the same, so that EVERYTHING is elided just as aggressively as everything else.\n\nYes, this implies that even normal functions ARE candidates for call elision, `inline` doesn't grant that like a special power.\n\nI should also point out that a shitload of function types are all implicitly inlined, so an `inline` decorator is strictly redundant. Template functions and methods, for example.\n\nSo why do you want an ODR exception? Because C and thus C++ do not have whole-program compilation. Every Translation Unit is an island, wholly isolated from all others. If you want the COMPILER to elide a function, then the COMPILER needs the function definition visible IN THAT TU, in order to decide whether to elide it or not, and also just to HAVE the statements that it is eliding there and then at compile time.\n\nIn order to get the function definition into every TU, you need an ODR exception.\n\nAnd suddenly templates make a hell of a lot of sense, because when you `std::vector<int>`, or whatever, you implicitly instantiate that template in every TU as a concrete type - it's compiled into object code into every object file - how else could you do that without an ODR exception? (Hint: there are ways - advanced programming techniques that also cut down compile times.)\n\n---\n\nSo normal functions are considered for call elision, too, and you can fuck with the heuristics without fucking with the source code.\n\nAlso - since C++ doesn't have whole-program compilation, that means we don't get TYPICAL Whole Program Optimization. But we DO get A version of WPO, and it's called Link-Time Optimization. It's strictly inferior. What the compiler does is it decides to bundle the compiler flags and source code in the object file. When the linker comes across these bundles, it invokes the compiler. With the linker's perspective, the compiler can decide whether to elide a call or not.\n\nSo now you don't even NEED an ODR exception to get the benefit of call elision, even across TUs.\n\nBut I can do you one better: unity builds. Basically, you configure your build system so that ALL your source files are included into ONE source file, thus making a SINGLE TU. This has the effect of putting all the source code in the same scope at once. The compiler can do a much better job at compilation, heuristics, dead code elimination, and reduction than you can get with a link step. The machine code and object code is superior to an incremental build with LTO, and less error prone. Unity builds are preferred for smaller projects ~20k LOC or less, and that number grows with faster hardware, and they're preferred for release builds, since you're always going to build a release from scratch - no cached object files. Incremental builds are ONLY useful for dev cycles on large code bases.\n\nSo this basically renders `inline` useless. For every reason you would want it, there are always better ways to leverage first. Always configure a unity build - and in 30 years I've never seen a reason not to. Do prefer to fine-tune the compiler from the configuration, not the source code - what is good for one compiler is bad for another. Let the optimizer do its job and don't assume you're smarter. If the optimizer can't figure it out, your code is more likely bad than the optimizer is dumb. Don't be hinting the compiler from the source code. YOU don't know WHAT compiler I'm using, so get outta here with that shit.\n\nOh, and we have profiler driven builds, where performance is measured from a test build and the heuristics is catered per function. At that point `inline` heuristics are irrelevant.\n\nSo the only thing we can guarantee about `inline`, the only thing we know it's good for, is an ODR exception, and so you have to ask yourself why do you want that? What technical problem are you solving for by turning off safety, that's better than being protected? So far, I've never seen a use case.\n\nIf you see `inline` in source code, you've got some developers with some dogmatic beliefs, because indeed, there was a time - in the 80s and 90s from which I hail from, that compilers and optimizers were indeed FUCKING TERRIBLE, and YOU WERE smarter than the algorithms. But that's just not the case anymore. Even new developers come up incorporating what they're being told without EVER critically thinking about it or reading about it or looking into it whatsoever.\n\nAnd yet people are attracted to C++ because they \"really care about performance\" but cannot accept that this belief in particular is dated and wrong. Yeah, dogma won't get you there.",

        "body": "You can freelance jobs in many languages, one is not better or easier than another. It's mostly about what kind of job you want.\n\nIn general:\n\n* Python -> Data Science, AI application, Web Backend, Automation\n* C#/Java -> Desktop and mobile dev, game dev, Web Backend\n* JavaScript -> WebFrontend, Mobile Frontend (Technically Web Backend, but everytime I see that, it's a mess, so... I suggest you don't)\n* C++ -> low level stuff\n* PHP -> Web Backend\n\nThere are a lot of other languages, but in my experience, those are pretty common examples. So yeah, Python is a good choice, if you are interested in one of it's applications.\n\nVideo game modding is heavily dependent on the game. You can probably, technically, mod any game you want in C... but that's beside the point. Most games have a modding API, either officially, or inofficially. Most often, those APIs are meant to be used in the same language as the game was written and/or scripted in. C++ is the most common, as most major enginges are written in C++ under the hood. C# works for Unity modding, iirc, and some smaller game engines use lua or GdScript (Godot specifically).\n\nSo, in both cases, freelancing and modding:\n\nIt's not about one language being better than all others. That's just not how it works. That's like saying \"The saw is the best tool ever!\" and then attempting to drive a nail into wood using it. If you want to do a job, there are tools that are better suited for that specific job. But, as I said above: If you really want to, you can probbaly mod any game using C (after copious and unnecessary amounts of reverse engineering), just as you COULD use C for Data Science, Web Frontends (WASM), App Development, Automation, etc. It's just not the most ergonomic tool to use, and that's understating it.\n\nEDIT: \n\nAlso, don't fall into the wrong assumption most people have, that programming languages are hard to learn. They are in fact, not. If I (or any developer with only a little experience) want to learn a new language today, it will literally take me a weekend. They all pretty much work the same, and once you understand all key concepts, you can switch langauges as you please. Sure, the tooling will be unfamiliar, and some conventions will be too, and you will take a little longer to get into a groove, and the first few weeks your code quality might suffer a little, but it's really not hard. \n\nThe reasons most people assume it's hard (I think), is because they think it will be like learning their first programming language(s). When in reality, the first langueage(s) you are learning are not hard, because languages are inherently hard to learn; It's because you are learning to program. And programming is hard. It's problem solving, a lot of theory and background knowledge. You can spend multiple lifetimes learning non stop, and still not know everything there is to know.",

(If your program spends 0.1 second per minute computing something and the rest of the time waiting for user input, it's probably not worth speeding up the 0.1 second part at the expense of making the code harder to read. If it's doing that 0.1 second task several thousand times per minute and maxing out the CPU, then speeding it up is more important.)\n\nThinking about how to make things better organized, for you and for whoever will use the program, is another big win.

Syntax is just the tool we use to bring our solutions to life.\n\nSo, you want to build a workout routine app? Perfect. What’s the big problem here? It’s something like, “Creating a program that allows you to track your workouts and even generates workouts for you.”\n\nBut that sounds pretty overwhelming. Where do you even start?\n\nThat’s where breaking things down comes in!!!!\n\n\n1. Creating the Program\n\nAlright, now we’re getting somewhere. Fire up your IDE and create a new project folder. Maybe call it WorkoutSmart, or whatever the heck makes you happy.\n\n2. Tracking Workouts\n\nOkay, so how do we track workouts? Are we taking user input? Sure thing! Let’s build a simple flow.\n\nUser flow example:\n\n1. The user types a workout into the input field (for example, “Push-ups”) and clicks Submit.\n\n⬇️\n\n2. The workout is added to the program, either in the background for now or visually on the user interface.\n\n⬇️\n\n3. Add buttons for Sets and Reps, each with an increment counter.\n\n\n\nNice! Step two is coming together well. Push your progress to GitHub and call it a night. 💤\n\n\n3. Keeping Workouts on Refresh\n\nThe next day, you might notice something. When you refresh the page, all the workouts disappear. ☹️\n\nBingo. That’s your next problem to solve.\n\nNow it’s time to make the data persistent.\nYou might start Googling something like “how to keep data after page refresh JavaScript” and build from there.\n\nAs you gain more experience, things start to click. You’ll begin to recognize patterns and might even plan out an entire project in Notion or on paper before writing any code. The plan will change as you go, but it gives you a solid blueprint to follow.\n\nI hope that all made sense.\n\nHonestly, I think this approach is a beautiful metaphor for life itself. When things feel overwhelming or anxiety creeps in, break your problems into small, manageable pieces, and calmly tackle each one.\n\nHappy coding!",

Pick a Web framework that you are most comfortable with. There are many to choose from and no one option is the best option. Just pick one that you are most comfortable with.\n3. Using that web framework, write the most basic application, one that just loads the home page with the text \"My first web app\".\n4. Get that most simple app working.\n5. Now go to your to do list and pick one of the items from that list. Try to implement that feature. If you get that feature working, cross it off the list, otherwise just move to the next item in the list.\n6. Rinse and repeat until you've managed to cross off all the items from your list.\n\nUsing YouTube or any resource found on the internet is fine and will not be cheating. Just don't be tempted to turn to something like ChatGPT or any other AI tool, as that would be cheating and you'll end up learning nothing.\n\nAlso expect things to go slowly at first, but what you should find, the more you try the better you'll get at solving problems and faster things will go.\n\nDon't get discouraged when thing get tough as this is to be expected. When you do run into problems try to use google or YouTube to solve those problems. Problem solving is a skill that is needs to be learned, so this practice will make you a better programmer.",

The definition of a `weight` is not itself an instance of any one particular `weight`.\n\n    class weight_extractor: std::variant<std::monostate, weight> {\n      friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &is, weight_extractor &we) {\n        if(is.tie()) {\n          *is.tie() << \"Enter a weight: \";\n        }\n\n        if(int v; is >> v) {\n          try {\n            we = weight{v};\n          } catch(const std::invalid_argument &e) {\n            is.setstate(std::ios_base::failbit);\n            if(is.exceptions() | std::ios_base::failbit) {\n              throw;\n            }\n          }\n        }\n\n        return is;\n      }\n\n      friend std::istream_iterator<weight_extractor>;\n\n      weight_extractor() noexcept = default;\n\n    public:\n      weight_extractor(const weight &) = delete;\n      weight_extractor(weight &&) = delete;\n\n      weight_extractor &operator =(const weight &) = delete;\n      weight_extractor &operator =(weight &&) = delete;\n      \n      operator weight() const { return std::get<weight>(*this); }\n    };\n\n    static_assert(sizeof(weight_extractor) == sizeof(weight));\n    static_assert(alignof(weight_extractor) == alignof(weight));\n\nThe semantics of a `weight` describes all that it can do - you can add weights, you can multiply scalars, you can insert weights into a stream. But extracting weights directly from a stream is problematic; if extraction fails, you can have an invalid weight. This extractor helper class cannot be instantiated by you directly - only the `std::istream_iterator` has access to the only valid - default, ctor.\n\nThe `weight_extractor` is an example of \"encapsulation\", aka \"complexity hiding\" - we hide the complexity of extracting and validating a `weight` behind a simple type. \"Data hiding\" is a different idiom not demonstrated here - that the class members are `private` is NOT data hiding.\n\n\n    weight operator +(weight l, const weight &r) noexcept {\n      return l += r;\n    }\n\n    int main() {\n      weight my_fat_ass(190);\n\nSee? Now we're talking about a specific `weight`, `my_fat_ass`, as opposed to anyone else's... Let's get your fat ass into the picture here, too.\n\n      if(std::input_iterator<weight_extractor> iter{std::cin}, end{}; iter != end) {\n        weight your_fat_ass = *iter;\n\nYou will likely never have to use a raw stream iterator in your life. Instead, the standard library has views, like `std::views::istream<weight_extractor>`, which itself is implemented in terms of stream iterators. You can `std::views::take` 1 or you can use `std::views::single` to get just one value.\n\n        auto a_whole_lotta_ass = my_fat_ass + your_fat_ass;\n\n        std::cout << a_whole_lotta_ass << \"lbs.\\n\";\n      }\n\n      return std::cin && std::cout << std::flush ? EXIT_SUCCESS : EXIT_FAILURE;\n    }\n\nIn C++, we don't use primitive types directly - they are there so we can describe our own types and their semantics. We make types and behaviors and implement algorithms to create a lexicon that describes our problem domain, and then we describe our solution in terms of that. An `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`.\n\nSo to address your question directly - you need to distinguish between your phone book vs. my phone book vs. any other phone book. If the whole program is to have just one phone book, you'd make it `static`, but often that is a very poor design decision.",

A general answer would be that there is no requirement that a C++ program contains any objects whatsoever, if you don't want it to. It's a multi-paradigm language. If you're using C++ in an object oriented way, the memory for those objects will need to be allocated somewhere. There are different storage durations (e.g. static, dynamic, automatic) which define how long the memory lives (e.g. entire program, custom lifetime, life of stack frame, respectively). You pick the one that's most appropriate for your object(s) when you create them.",

        "body": "I mean it sounds like you already have a query language which is capable of expressing the complex queries you want to do, namely SQL. But for some reason, the external system is rejecting the **valid** SQL queries that you want to do, because of unexplained \"security concerns\".\n\nI don't think inventing a new domain-specific query language, instead of just using SQL, is going to address your real problem. The real problem is how to **efficiently** extract only the subset of the data that you need from your underlying database, when you're being forced to go through a layer that is trying to prevent you from doing that. \n\nIf you did come up with a custom query language, then you would just have to translate it to SQL anyway in order to actually execute it, right? (Since Lucene's query language is nowhere near sophisticated enough to express what you want.)\n\nSo I think the answer is going to depend on the specific details of the restrictions that the system is imposing on your SQL queries.\n\nFor instance:\n\n> Pick this one if its status is \"open\" or if it's linked with ... which has 5 descendants and at least 2 descendants have at least one linked child of type biological.\n\nIt's fairly straightforward to express this with a SQL query involving nested joins. When you pass a query containing joins to the DB, the DB can optimize based on the details of what you're querying and the available indexes, so that it doesn't fetch more data than necessary. This is crucial for efficiency.\n\nWhat is the specific limitation you're running into when you try to write such a query? When you say the system rejects \"complex queries\", what is the actual definition of \"complex\" that's being used?\n\nFor instance: Suppose the system doesn't allow joins at all. Then you would have to implement your own query engine which queries tables individually and then joins them together (e.g. using a hash join). This will almost certainly be much slower than letting the DB perform the join itself. In order to mitigate the performance cost as much as possible, your query engine needs to decide what order to perform the joins in, and it needs to \"push down\" the join criteria to become filters on the individual table queries. (Of course, you will be limited in your ability to do this because you don't have access to all the low-level data that the underlying DB engine does, such as index statistics.)\n\nIf the actual restrictions you're facing are different from \"no joins allowed\", then you would have to design around those other restrictions instead.\n\nBut the *implementation* of this join engine doesn't really depend much on how you *express* the queries that you want to perform. So for expressing the queries, you might as well stick with SQL, or at least a limited subset of SQL.",

Define a small JSON AST with and/or/not, cmp ops, exists(relation, where), and count(relation, depth, op, value). That lets you say: risks where exists hazard with category = biological and count(descendants, depth=2) >= 5.\n\nPerformance: don’t hit the source for complex logic. Set up a read replica you control. Either a graph DB (Neo4j/JanusGraph) or SQL with a closure table/materialized paths for ancestor/descendant counts. Sync via CDC (Debezium or Airbyte), precompute transitive closures per project, cache id sets, and stream rows with keyset pagination. Batch relation lookups using a DataLoader-style layer to avoid N+1.\n\nI’ve used Neo4j and Debezium for this pattern; DreamFactory helped auto-generate REST endpoints over the replica so the UI could query with OData/RSQL consistently.\n\nMain point: adopt OData/RSQL plus a graph-capable backend and a small JSON AST with exists/count.",

This post is not saying \"all young kids suck\", but rather explaining how so many people completely unable to do any CS work are getting degrees. They aren't slipping through the cracks, admins chiseled out a crack and swept them towards it.\n\nBy the way, those great students? To a T, all of them were eager and hard working. Not all of them were obvious geniuses - they just worked really hard on a lot of things because of the love of the craft.\n\n---\n\nCollege CS professor here.\n\nIn the last 10 years, we've seen an absurd increase in the amount of pressure put on us to just pass students by admins chasing retention and graduation statistics. I had a student who literally never showed up to either of my two classes he enrolled in a semester, never turned in a single assignment.\n\nSo I failed him. \n\nSo he filed a civil rights complaint. \n\nI then had to spend a total of roughly 60 hours defending myself from this, having meetings, collecting every email I ever had with the student and their advisors (plural), recalling dates of the two conversations we had, and rebutting outright laughably obvious lies like the student claiming that I locked them in my office and said they weren't allowed to leave until they did their work (the student didn't even know where my office was) - work that was never completed and he couldn't produce.\n\nMore than a few professors, would I relay these stories, tell me , \"just don't fight these battles, give them what they want\". Which is even more frustrating because it means when those professor students get into my class, they can't write a for loop by themselves in an advanced software design class.\n\nAlso, (noting I'm teaching faculty and not research faculty), teaching evaluation is almost entirely boiled down to student evaluations and student evaluations are negatively correlated with the difficulty of the final exam. And let me tell you, they put no effort into this analysis. They just look at in a 30 question survey, the average of one question. And my 700 person undergraduate class is treated as apples to apples to a 12-person grad level research team course. They only look at above average or below average, nothing else. So, your incentivized to make the class as easy as possible so the students give you five stars. It is the yelpification of America, and it creates the worst possible incentives. Like, my student evals can average to 4.1 out of 5, But the average for the entire department is 4.3, so therefore I'm a bad teacher. My average being brought down by a very large number of one-star reviews from shock of all shocks people failing the class.\n\nSo we've created an entire incentive structure where students seek out the easiest classes they can to get the piece of paper that says they're entitled to a job, and faculty are pushed towards making those classes as easy as possible rather than actually teaching, and anyone who bucks that trend will have an admin ride their ass at the end of every semester because their student evaluation score is .02 less than last year, and \" maybe you could try bringing cookies to class\" (serious suggestion made by someone with a six-figure salary)\n\nBasically, goodhart's law remains undefeated.",

        "body": "Part of the issue, I believe, is a lack of understanding of shifts in technology. If you’ve been working in technology for long time you’ve been exposed to lots of things, lots of languages, lots of libraries, lots of methodologies, etc. and then you zoom in on one very, admittedly simple thing like basic understandings of JS for someone who has been working in JS or any arbitrary simple thing that isn’t necessarily cross cutting between technology implementations.\n\nOn the surface that seems simple: why doesn’t this person understand this thing when they’re working in that space? In reality, you’re looking at it from a biased view. You have a huge repository of internal knowledge and experience. Meanwhile on the daily basis, they may be doing their best to understand baseline assumptions across dozens of technologies and implementations they’ve never been exposed to. Things you take for granted likely, maybe they need to deal with managing certificates, or connecting to a remote Linux system, or something else. Everyone’s going to have varied levels of exposure over their education and careers to certain things. There’s a good chance they have a *firehose* of things they’re trying to understand that they’ve never dealt with before.\n\nIn addition to that, if you’ve been in tech for say 15+ years or longer, software wasn’t a huge space the further you go back. There was a point in time in the 90s and early 00’s where pretty much everyone alive used Apache HTTPD. Fast forward today and there’s all sorts of HTTP server implementations, but during that period of time simply knowing Apaches HTTPd server in and out gave you baseline knowledge almost anywhere you went, which was learned experience, so new problems you had in that work environment could get more focus vs having to understand a layer of some service on-top of understanding the actual unique problem at the workspace (I’m just using this as an example, there are lots of domains where some almost monopolistic technology reigned supreme, and things didn’t shift that often).\n\nToday I can think of probably a dozen popular implementations out there people use, sometimes even library based services, SaaS options, so on just for HTTP hosting, all of which with all their own little idiosyncrasies and domain specific knowledge around them. Again this shift is true in many (most?) technology spaces (e.g. databases, etc.). Software variety and knowledge surrounding those popular concrete implementations has exploded.\n\nAs a result, all sorts of businesses out there are likely to use some unique mixture of “base” (to them) services “the whole world should understand.” Someone experienced these days may even struggle shifting between environments because of variation in tech. You know some things, but there’s some variety of tech you simply have to learn, in addition to doing your actual job, which isn’t accounted for, it’s just assumed you know it. It’s a very common bias in tech I’ve seen.\n\nIf you’ve also been working a long time you’re picked up a lot of these things and expanded your pool of knowledge. You’ve seen and used several database systems and services, you’ve seen and used several http servers, front end libraries, so on. You had the benefit, to some degree, of watching these things grow in popularity and catching up as they became popular. None the less, it’s not possible to know all these systems anymore due to the growth rate of tech implementations. So even experienced engineers have issues with these now.\n\nI see this bias often with people who tend to work in one or two technology spaces and have the luxury of garnering deep understanding of something. You tend to forget that things that come “simple” or should be “basic” to you aren’t inherently as simple or basic to other people. These kids have little to no experience and are jumping in a pool that doesn’t have good discrete skill specialization (software engineers should be broken up into multiple disciplines when you consider the range of knowledge assumptions, in my opinion).\n\nSo all this is to say, give the kids a break. It’s like they just finished med school and are applying for open medical speciality positions ranging from cardiologist, to neurosurgeon, to dentist, etc. and being judged as if they had “base” specialized knowledge and experience around each profession yet they have to apply to all of them just to attempt to get employed and hope for the best. It’s especially true in today’s market where you cast a wide net (they’re applying to anything and everything, they need to eat). Thankfully medicine isn’t like that or your dentist may be like “oh I usually do hearts but let’s get this root canal underway, should be similar, veins n such!” Maybe all their past experience was on embedded systems work and all of the sudden, they need money to eat, so they’re now doing their very best to do React frontend work. In software businesses do this in an attempt to reduce labor costs (there’s also practical reasons specializing doesn’t work, your specialty may be dead in a year) and because the impact usually isn’t someone’s life… it’s some not so life threatening feature or service being unavailable, so whatever. But the challenge is somewhat similar (obviously in software we’re more tolerant of failure to some degree).",

I make too much to quit or even change jobs, but I'm not super thrilled with what I'm doing so I wouldn't even be that mad if I got laid off/pipped.\n\nI am doing 0 towards principal even though my manager is pushing me towards multi org projects which are just unfun and like pulling teeth. I like doing projects with the boys (and girls), making our code better, and launching new features. Doing shit in other peoples code bases is just awful.",

That's how that whole shtick works.\n\nSomeone like a fashion influencer can just follow the fashion trends. There will *always* be people obsessing over buying fashion, and as a result, there will *always* be companies desperate to sell fashion. That industry doesn't die. It just changes forms.\n\nLeading up to the pandemic, and especially during the pandemic, there was a ***huge*** audience that wanted to buy the idea of being a SWE. Make $500k, chill around the office playing ping pong 90% of your time, etc. An easy way to riches.\n\nSo the audience was there. And the people paying influencers to influence that audience were also there. The US government was desperate for people to major in CS/STEM, the universities were thrilled that everyone and their mother wanted a degree now, the big tech companies wanted more talent to hire, everyone was tyring to cash in.\n\nPost-pandemic, when the market crashed.... none of that demand exists any more. The audience has noticed a CS degree isn't quite what was originally sold to them. The government doesn't want to shove more people into a degree with a high unemployment rate, and the big tech companies have an enormous pool of talent to choose from now, and Universities *really* don't want a bunch of people going to their college to end up unemployed and kill their numbers.\n\nThat *idea* of being a cushy-SWE has dried up. Unlike something like fashion, it's not forever. It had an end. And we hit it.\n\nThere's simply no more money in being a SWE influencer.",

Devs on your team should be moving tickets faster with you there.\n\nThe reward becomes harder to see and it's not for everyone.

You need people who can guide other engineers, break down hard problems in a way that are tangible to less experienced engineers, and mostly when you’re building a piece of software, it’s rarely greenfield, but more about building a piece of the jigsaw puzzle in a larger ecosystem, so you need to talk to other people (who own the other neighbouring pieces of your jigsaw puzzle) to make sure you design the piece in a good way, and these skills are hard to come by, a combination of tech competence, understanding the system well enough to be able to decide the direction you want to take it in, is a harder skill than people understand. In reality it does sadly look a lot like jira tickets and docs/slides, but youre not becoming useless, unless you’re being passive, because you’re (somewhat) in a driving seat.",

        "body": "There's some meme somewhere about junior devs wanting to be invited to more meetings and senior devs wanting to not. The progression is natural, but you can carve your career a bit based on your own goals. If you want to maximize career growth, you have to align yourself with business goals and impact, and the way to do this is rarely to output more code but instead be a multiplier- train up other devs, lead initiatives, set up processes to streamline things. Part of this may in fact be figuring out ways to trim down meetings but still maintain same output and quality. This may mean you decline meetings that aren't useful.\n\nAlternatively you can also drive impact by being very technical and the expert on one technology. At my internship (circa 2017) Docker was still somewhat new and some guy named Sheldon learned about it at a meetup and introduced it to the company and he was the \"Docker guy\" who people would go to get help.\n\nOr you can choose to just focus on doing what you want to do and not min-max career development. My first job out of college was low 6 figures, and feasibly that was enough to never \"career develop\" again from financial aspect. If you are financially where you want to be, then no reason to let the corporation decide what you get out of your \\~8 hours a day you're giving to the company.",

It's pretty standard.  \nI've seen a LOT of new hire offers and they are very consistent cookie cutter offers.  \nIt's really rare to see an offer that is out of line.\n\n b. Should you be offered an L3 position or L4? It's debatable and sadly a bit subjective across interviewers.\n\n15+ years ago Google would hire at L4 for a new grad with a PhD or a strong interview with an MS. That changed when some of the new grads were really just L3s and needed experience actually building things. Some L4s were performing just like an L3 and required additional time to get to L4 level. So a change was made to hire new grads at L3 regardless of degree level. Exceptions definitely exist but are extremely rare. MS and PhDs typically, but   \nnot always, got promoted faster than BS/BA grads at L3.\n\nGoogle also hires low if in doubt. You have experience that is probably/possibly in line with L4. You probably got interview feedback of Strong Hire @ L3 and Weak Hire @ L4.  \nThe circumstances may have changed since your interview: You added another year of exp and finished your MS (nice work btw). But none of that really changes what you did in the interview and that's the person that Google is hiring. Takeaway: advanced degree does not   \nautomatically warrant promotion to the next level. Google promotes on performance, gated by quotas these days (sigh).\n\nLastly regarding promotion time frame. It does depend on what tasks/opportunities that  you are given and how you handle them. If your work is in fact L4 and your manager has credibility then your manager needs to carefully point out hiring committee feedback, tenure, advanced degree. But these things really only matter if there are concerns   \nabout time to evaluate your progress. I have seen promotions as soon as 6-8m after hire for   \npeople with experience who interviewed on the border. Mean promotion time for L3 the last time I looked was 19-21 months.",

This has happened multiple times, good feedback, good relationships, good work ethic and productivity, it’s just market shifts and the company trying to be strategic.  \n\nI had to get clear about what I wanted… and that’s stability. I started looking for opportunities in stable, but growing sectors, i stopped taking interviews with small companies or companies known for their leanness or competitive firing practices. I reached out to people at the company to know what type of culture I was signing up for. During the interviews, when they asked me what I was looking for, I told them… a stable place to grow in my skill and to develop a long-term relationship with a company.  \n\nThis may sound sexist, but I looked for companies that had a lot of women and parents on their team and good paternity leave… to me, this is a signal that the company cares about investing in people rather than the bottom line. If they’re willing to hire women (who may be out an extended period after/around pregnancy) or parents (who have stricter schedules and can’t do the 9-9 grind), they believe in investing in people rather than the short term setback of human life being inconvenient.  \n\nI looked for companies that didn’t do boom/bust hiring waves. How long have jobs been posted? How many jobs are posted? How frequently do they post? Does this company have a history of downsizing?  \n\nI think the world has definitely changed a ton since Covid.

The reason is bc a company can just decide to pivot or cut a digital product too easily.

Businesses that get their revenue from making sure their customers can meet regulations always have work if those regulations change frequently. \n\nIt's hard bc these types of jobs will not pay as much as tech jobs. They'll be overly boring and frustrating. But think of lost income from being in between jobs. You'll have a lower salary but less gaps so over 5 years, it might even out \n\nAlso just to be safe....never tell anyone you're looking for another job except if it's a coworker you're close with and you don't want to blindsided them. Always try to appear cheerful and optimistic. Don't be the squeaky wheel either. Sometimes it pays to be a \"yes man\".

So rather than focus on which \"false bugs\" they filed, be a professional and ignore it. Come up with plans which prevent the DevOps from accidentally applying the wrong config file. If it's not your job, you can propose the activity to your and the DevOps manager.",

You don't name names, your don't blame, you get to the root cause and figure out how to stop it. \n\nCommit to your boss to write these yourself, on top of your regular work, on the condition that 1) the docs are reviewed as a team, during which the final list of actions is agreed to; and 2) s/he commits to making time to execute the agreed-upon actions within a month.

First of all, you’re treating H1Bs as a monolith, when in reality, there’s two “tiers.”The bottom tier H1Bs don’t work directly for big tech. They work for WITCH companies, insurance companies, oil companies, etc. They are modern-day indentured servants. In this case, if their employer can’t easily replace them by sponsoring someone else, it would stand to reason their wages would rise, not fall. They already couldn’t get sponsored by other companies. Not how it works for this caste. \n\nOn the other hand, there are H1B recipients who already worked for Big Tech directly overseas. They get sponsored. They insource their job with them. They were never begging for table scraps. They’ll just self deport and outsource their job with them if they get a $100k paycut. Moreover, people like that create other jobs. We’re outsourcing an entire team’s worth of jobs with them. \n\nYou’re also ignoring the consensus amongst economists as to why SF became the tech capital of the world. Why it outcompeted the hub around MIT in MA. Because non compete agreements are illegal in CA. You presume competition is a bad thing. Maybe it is for entrenched, enshittifying monopolies in isolation. But even those monopolies had been paying a premium to bring the world’s top talent to the place where they weren’t a big fish in a small pond. If they wanted to entrap their higher tier H1Bs, they would’ve done what all the employers of lower tier H1Bs did: moved them out to some godforsaken shithole in TX or NC, refused to sponsor applications for green cards, paid them below market rate, etc. At some level, even the monopolies realize competition is good.\n\nWe issue under 100k H1Bs per year. That’s it. And they don’t all go to IT/CS jobs either. India and China have nearly 3 billion people between the two of them. Do the math… We’re only getting the top 0.01% of them, for the most part. There are some serial abusers. The WITCH companies in particular ought to be permanently barred from H1B. But really, the problem with H1B is how abusive it is to the recipients. We should be more like Canada and just give them green cards when they arrive. Unironically. \n\nWhy do we make it so fucking hard for talented people to come here and pay tens of thousands of dollars a year in taxes, while some barely literate economic migrant from Venezuela just says the magic word “asylum” and they can come stay for years in a free hotel, no questions asked? It’s insane. Both sides of the immigration “debate” in this country are fucking unhinged. Guns and immigration are the only two issues where I’m an obnoxious enlightened centrist, I swear…",

A couple thoughts that may help from what I’ve seen:\n\nNeed to look at companies that are solving macro problems such as smart mobility, health insurance, public utilities or even large consulting that operate at a large city/state/country scale.  \n\nThe tasks that you excel at are typically handled by “data scientists” in the research or engineering subteams of the broader product team. Most of the time it’s run through a platform like snowflake with some basic trendy algos applied and then call it a day, with little interpretation or understanding of the results.\n\nAs strange as this sounds you may want to hunt for UX Researcher roles.  If you dig into the requirements a lot of what they are asking for there is a lot of overlap and it at least is adjacent to your skill set.  \n\nOne of the hardest things, as this thread has shown, will be articulating your value.  Most hiring managers for these roles will have come up through a more vanilla CS background so having a paragraph ready about what the current state of the industry is, why it’s leading teams and products astray and how your deeper understanding makes a difference will be critical.  You are a PhD level data scientist who looks at the world through a sociology lens and that brings inherent value.\n\nLastly, the job market actually is pure ass right now.  It’s all of us and not just you.  If you have any folks from your cohort that went private sector they probably have some good advice on how to modify message for what folks are looking for now. Sadly keywords matter more than concepts in the initial stages.\n\nGood luck and you got this. Hope all this helps.",

Use a napkin and draw something out if it helps. \n\n\nIf I'm doing it right, it should be the easiest interview they've ever had. It hardly feels like an interview... I'm just like a slightly overenthusiastic fan of their work. I'm trying to help them demonstrate all the awesome stuff they have done. \n\n\nIt's not a sales job. There isn't any benefit in them practicing to prepare. The questions I ask are all over the place and are specific to their project and their previous responses. I'm intentionally asking questions that will let them demonstrate a breadth and depth of knowledge. It's not a prepared slide deck they could practice with. The way to crush this interview is to fully understand the ins and outs of a sufficiently complex codebase, or at least, section of codebase, AND the languages, frameworks and tools they'd use. \n\n\nPracticing for my interview would be exactly like practicing for the job. And our conversation is basically the same as I would have with a coworker who wrote XYZ in our codebase, except, ya know, I'd be less interested and ask fewer questions, but it's really really close. \n\n\nI've personally watched people who aced our technical problem _because they had seen it before_ get hired and be mediocre. I've also lied about a candidate who failed his whiteboard session miserably because they were nervous, hadn't prepped and hardly communicated anything, but during our 'culture fit' spent 45 minutes convincing me that he was an experienced developer who didn't do well under pressure. He was a great hire. I'm old, and he's actually progressed further in his career than I have. \n\n\nMaybe I've just been lucky, but I've never had a decently long chat like this with someone and thought 'Wow, they really know their stuff' and been wrong.",

I've had this happen where they throw a 'gotcha' and all of a sudden you're in a different vertical than what you thought they were going to test you on. Big fat waste of time for everyone involved because you can't code something you're unprepared for within less than an hour window, even though you could do it within 3 hours and a bunch of Googling. If you're going to build a Wordle game, tell them before. If they're going to fetch data, manipulate data, filter data, and display a list, tell them beforehand. These are two very different things and you could be super sharp at one and not the other.\n\n\\- Live technical test with AI. The key here is to check whether or not they are blindly accepting prompts from AI. Take the time to ask questions around what the code they just accepted is doing and why they think that is a good solution.\n\n\\- Timed test (take home/alone). Give them a quite complicated technical test and 3-4 hours to complete it with a submission deadline. They will have to use AI to solve it in that time. Then you follow up in another meeting to discuss the solution and why they did what they did.\n\n\\- Take home test. Make it complicated as above. They will use AI but how do they handle state management? How do they fetch data? How do they handle errors? Is it scalable? Etc. You can ask for more if you're permitting AI.\n\nYou can effectively assess someone's ability even when they use AI. All you need to do is ask a bunch of questions around the solution to see if they know what they're doing. Overall, just remember that you're trying to hire someone, you're not trying to catch someone out who can't remember a certain method on the spot, that won't tell you anything other than your process is an act of gatekeeping. If you judged a fish on it's ability to climb tree's you'd believe it was stupid so ask yourself if you're setting your candidates up for success.",

Mental stress is no laughing matter. Just because you never experienced it does not mean it is not real.\n\nAt the most stressful time, I literally woke up at night and could not even feel my legs let alone move them for a few minutes. And that happened twice. Shits scary as f. Suddenly the world view changes and you care nothing else at all when your legs might stop functioning. Your body actually breaks down from stress itself. You tell me if money is worth losing your legs.\n\nPeople vastly underestimate how scary extreme mental stress is. I know in one of the startup talks one of the founders stated that he had a period of time in which suddenly his eyes stopped working and he had trouble seeing with his left eye from all the stress. And that's when he stopped everything because anymore stress and he would lose his left eye functionality.\n\nSo yes. People leave stressful jobs all the time. Stressful jobs can legitimately destroy your body. Just because stress is mental does not make it any different. Human body will legit break down after a longer period of extreme stress.\n\nWhen you are a college student and never actually worked these stressful jobs all you see is numbers. You have this delusional belief it's high pay or basically homeless (wtf?). That's not how reality works.\n\nYou only live your life once. Don't waste your life chasing solely money. Money is important to function in life but once you are in comfortable means of being able to provide yourself, food/healthcare/shelter/etc, then other things take priority. It's great if your job pays a lot and you enjoy it and all but that's not the case for everyone. For others, the high paying jobs are legitimately destroying their happiness.

The alternative becomes this:\n\n\n> Hey everyone, I really like CS and I want to get a job in CS but I am not getting hired.....\n\n\n\"Bro - learn a trade\"\n\n\n'My Mom is a nurse.

All the new grads, all the people taking bootcamps/self-teaching trying to break into the industry, and all the people that have been in the industry for a little bit of time but not enough time to be very attractive as a candidate. It's a cesspool of desperation.\n\nI stuck it out at my new grad job until I had \\~3.5 YOE. During my job search I did 10 applications, got 3 interviews, and 1 offer in the span of a month. My new grad job search was nowhere near as easy as that.\n\nKeep in mind it's not a hard rule or anything across the entire industry, and YOE isn't the only metric companies use to evaluate resumes. Some candidates might start having an easier time at 1-2 YOE, some at 5 YOE, some might never have an easy time and will struggle until the day they retire.

And more of the lending is going to private equity, not businesses in the real economy.\n\nSometimes undoing a problem like 0% interest is not fixed by raising interest rates, and similarly, lowering interest rates don't necessarily fix the problems exacerbated by raising them so quickly.\n\nIt'll take a major fix in the economy for corporations to want to invest in people to make things again, and idk what that realistically looks like.",

I think industry roles often have a similar level of pressure / slog to academia’s “publish or perish.” Plus a lot less job security, and a different type of politics which can be exhausting. \n\nThe other consideration is that it will probably be easier later on to go from academia to industry if you change your mind, than vice versa, especially if you’re going to a non-research industry role.\n\nContext in case it’s helpful or you want to ask questions: I left my phd program a few years in without completing it, for an industry job. I’ve had a good career so far, and it’s been fun and interesting and I’ve learned a lot (mostly interpersonal stuff and management skills), but in retrospect if I’d had a real option to continue the phd and go into   academia, I would have.

My burn-out wasn't from research per se, but from the feeling of doing research alone. Working in an industry AI lab has completely changed my relationship with research. I am in a significantly more collaborative environment. The flavor of research is quite different though, but turns out I find math-circlejerk research (theory-heavy) and simple-at-scale research (experiment-heavy) equally fulfilling. There's a certain joy to pulling out a seemingly random idea in literature that, with the right clever modifications, ends up working well in practice at O(10k) GPU scale.\n\n\\- The main downside to industry, imo, is politics/drama. The AI industry is rife with them at the moment. You'll also sometimes look at what your company is releasing product-wise and question whether you're on the right side of history.\n\n\\- You definitely lose out on the mentoring/teaching aspect in industry. You will meet the occasional brilliant researcher fresh out of undergrad/masters that you can take under your wing. But it's significantly less frequent than as an actual advisor.\n\n\\- Are you sure you'll enjoy being a research professor?

Like you, I was burned out and had gotten tired of the publish-or-perish race, even though I'd been told that if I were to stick it out a while longer, I'd have a really great shot at a TT position. There were some other factors for me that you likely do not have to deal with, but I don't regret pivoting to industry. To directly address some of your concerns:\n\n* On flexibility:\n   * Yes, most industry jobs will afford you much less flexibility in how you schedule your daily life. However, industry also pays you a fuck ton more money so that you can actually enjoy your time off. I don't know about your finances, but when I was in academia, I basically didn't take regular vacations; my \"vacations\" were always tacked onto conferences and involved me blowing off one day of talks and/or staying a day longer before flying back.\n   * It is also much easier to change jobs in industry, which affords its own flexibility; I know people keep moaning about the industry job market, but it's still way easier to jump jobs than to jump institutions if you happen to hate where you're forced to live. TT positions are not a dime a dozen, and you may need to take what you can get; if you don't like the location, then you're likely gonna be shit out of luck for at least a few years. (This is assuming you don't have to do the postdoc hazing ritual that involves moving every 1-3 years.)\n   * WLB in industry is much better than in academia, and at the end of the work day, you can disengage from the work. Even if you're on-call, you don't really need to waste brainpower on it. In some ways, I feel that while I have lost some flexibility during the weekdays, my time off is much more my own. Being able to spend time guilt-free on my hobbies has improved both my physical mental well-being tremendously, which itself feels like freedom; I honestly didn't even really know how unhappy I was in academia until I left.\n   * At $400k-500k, a high savings rate, a smart investment strategy, you will have the option to retire in less than a decade, which would afford you the maximum flexibility.\n* On being able to work on what you're interested in:\n   * I won't lie. Some of the work can be **very dull**. However, as you get promoted, you'll hopefully find yourself in a position where you'll be addressing larger business questions and architecting solutions, which I have found to be relatively engaging. I mean, I don't really *care* about the subject deep-down, but I also can't say it's boring.\n   * With a CS PhD and a specialty in a hot field, you can keep applying to jobs and try to pivot to a research-focused industry position, which may be more up your alley.\n* On teaching and mentoring:\n   * Not gonna lie. I really miss teaching. Mentoring new hires doesn't scratch the same itch. With your degree, you do have the option to pick up an adjuncting gig, and I've considered it, but I'd feel bad about taking a job away from some poor sucker who actually needs it. I've thought about going back into teaching once I have enough FU money. But another option might be teaching or tutoring folks for free at local libraries if you've a mind to do it and don't mind teaching basics.\n\nI have many friends and a sibling who have remained in academia in TT or postdoctoral positions. I chat with them regularly. Academia does have its pros, but having spoken with them, I don't think I would've been happy even at a TT position. Happy to speak more, but this post is getting long, so feel free to just DM me if interested.",

Think about it you can be the engineer who gets good reviews from other Jrs. Or the engineer who gets good reviews from Jrs and Srs/Principals. Guess who is getting the promotion if they only have enough for 1 more person\n\n\\- Find out the go to people and ask them questions. Your first few months should be figuring otu the right teams to ask questions, maybe you have a mentor who helps you find those people. Once you figure it out, cut the umbilical cord yourself and just go to those teams and ask those questions. Dont go striaght to the mentor anymore so he/she can baby sit you.\n\n\\- Take as much shitty tasks as you can. If a principal is working on somethign that sounds cool, ask him for even small tasks about it. Let him know that if there is anything you can do even if it's small and tedious youll do it. You want to dip your toes in everything you can.\n\n\\- Make sure you are known by other people on other teams. One of the biggest things managers appreciate is hearing someone's name in another team that has nothing to do with you. because it says you have become a go to person for your own team. If upper management keeps hearing your name from other teams or how they went to you and you helped, that goes a long way. Basically the key is making sure your name is always mentioned when your boss has meetings with his bosses.\n\n\\- Be good at getting yourself unstuck from situations. The biggest issue Jrs have is they get stuck and just sit at their desk for 2 days and say nothing. Dont fall in that trap, you get stuck, give yourself an hour to figure it out and if you still dont have it ask even a small question. In stand up, bring it up from the start and expalin it well.\n\n\\- If you work on something learn it back and forth. You can become an unoffical SME of your part of the codebase. The larger the section you master the more irreplaceable you become.\n\n\\- Make up your own work if you have to. Find something in the code that could use refactoring but nobody had time to do it. Suggest it to your manager like \"hey i saw this in the code and i felt it could use a bit of refactoring, mind if i work on that on the side?\".\n\n\\-Dont just get good at coding, get good at leading meetings. This is probably one of the bigger ones. Because JRs tend to be in the background and wait to be told what to do. if you want to move up quickly, start making meetings and presentations to display to your teammates. One advice i got was, if you complete something ask for 10 minutes post-standup to display it to the team. Because if you want to be a senior or principal that's what they will look for.",

Since you are a junior, the expectation is that you can pick up well defined low to medium complexity work and finish it with high quality. It doesn't matter what stack you use, a lot of concepts end up converging at some point.\n\nLearn one thing really well (e.g. your team's service) and understand why it is designed that way, start coming up with proposals to improve it operationally, understand how it fits into the scope of the company (how it benefits the business and how other teams consume/use it). Get to the point where you are PoC/owner of one subject area.\n\nFrom there you can be a little bit more senior and start influencing your team's success and at some point you will be able to mentor juniors who are new to the stack.\n\nOnce you stick your nose in the right places I think FAANG HMs will start to get a sense that you can not only join but excel in that type of environment.",

You can say Big Tech, at least that's definable. Also land of the biggest layoffs.\n\n>I also leetcode on the side for an hour a day as a long term plan for FAANG interviews.\n\nIf you apply to the 5 out of the 495 Fortune 500 companies that want you to know algorithms you'll never code on the job then okay. Else you're wasting your time. In fact, stay in your current job if you don't hate it and don't get 2% raises 2 years in a row. Moving is a risk and not being a job hopper makes you less of a hiring risk.\n\n>DSA feels like a skill I’ll need regardless and I want to be able to ace OAs / coding rounds in the future.\n\nIt is not. I'm mid-level and half my interviews have zero coding. It's talking through business challenges, tech stacks and maybe a design problem I draw on a real or virtual whiteboard. I don't know what \"OA\" is and I didn't know \"DSA\" meant when I got to this sub. I learned all data structures and algorithms I've ever needed from the classroom. My coworkers don't know what FAANG or Blind or Leetcode are. Coding tests are practical.\n\n>For those of you who’ve seen juniors rise fast:\n\nI saw one junior rise fast because he took smoke breaks with the senior manager. All of a sudden he became our manager. I saw another junior gradually move through the ranks. Stayed at the same employer for over 10 years. She was an average programmer but good at office politics and being well-liked.\n\nAll you got to be is average at coding. You can be an excellent problem solver which for me comes from work experience. You can be very well liked which is also insurance against layoffs. You can drink the company Kool-Aid and embody stockholder ideals. Like be married to your job. Those are all paths upward. Interviewing skill / soft skills carry you further the higher you go.\n\nProblem is, getting paid 20% more to work 50-55 hours a week sucks, on top being responsible for work intake and training of new hires. I had 12-15 hours of meetings a week and my manager had 30. Doesn't include 1:1 mentoring sessions.\n\nOh and promotion track is real. You will be told if you are on it. I was, once, then my manager got transferred and the replacement one didn't really like me.",

Map stakeholders: who approves, who can block, who just needs updates; name an alternate if someone is OOO. Log decisions and tradeoffs as lightweight decision records (ADRs). Estimate with ranges (P50/P90) and list assumptions; keep a change log when scope moves. Set up a 15-min adjacent review with owners of neighboring systems before you commit a schema or API. Digest the codebase by tracing one critical request end to end, build a thin vertical slice, and use tools like Cursor/Sourcegraph to surface patterns.

Something that AI can't easily replicate is our ability to engage and improve culture across teams, promoting automation through pipelines or playbooks or what have you. AI can write the code, the boilerplate or templates, but it's never going to be able to convince or cajole or influence people into actually buying in to better ways of doing things.\n\nIf you're looking for advice, i'd suggest you learn some Kubernetes if you haven't yet, fuck with some Helm charts, and be able to write some basic Terraform, and then take a look at some SRE listings. I haven't seen a systems engineer opening in forever and ever, but I believe there's going to be stuff for you and I to do for quite a while still. <3!",

You are new to the dev world. Take it and start gaining experience. After a year, start looking for something else, job hop and increase your pay that way. \n\nPersonally, I started out at a really low paying job. But I worked my butt off. I learned the entire stack (building a server, configuring the network, building code, testing code, creating the CI/CD pipelines, deploying the code, [get blasted for not testing well enough], iterate on the code, redeploy, maintain the code. Then as time progressed, I learned more about micro services, cloud tech, load balancing and ways to handle very very large amounts of data. I got to the point where I knew the entire pipeline of the entire setup, I was then able to communicate with customers about what was possible and know how to fix stuff when things broke. \n\nIf you want to be the person everyone goes to, you need to gain the experience and know how to solve complex problems and more importantly be able to communicate the issues and ways to solve it in a way the customer understands.",

They’re not perfect, and quality varies greatly, but what else are you going to do? Hope you can find a stranger with enough free time who is also good enough to give you free training?

So you provide them with optionality.\n\nSo my professional opinion is that you should focus your learning on what interests you most, and explore various domains.

        "body": "I’m a principal engineer at Salesforce. For those looking to join Salesforce as an IC engineer-\n\n1. Know that they made it REALLY hard for engineers to get promoted after April 2023. They’ve added a metric called “biz justification” wherein the manager has to justify why your promotion is justified from a business/operational perspective in your org. They use this easily defer/reject your promotion for YEARS.\n\n2. The environment at Salesforce isn’t “chill” anymore, in general. Some teams are still chill, but the company pivoted to a high performance culture last year. PIPs are on the rise. Many engineers are working 10+ hours.\n\n3. RSU refreshers have mostly stopped, except for very high performers and PMTS+. The engineering management takes all the RSUs, leaving very little for ICs.\n\n4. There’re re orgs every few months. An acquaintance of mine was hired into one team, went through a re-org a month after joining and was put in a completely different time with a completely different tech stack. He’s miserable.\n\n5. RTO is 10 days/ quarter for US engineers and 36 days/quarter for India engineers. The Indian tech leadership is fighting to make it uniform for everyone, so who knows what’ll change. Also, it’s possible they start tracking how long you spend in office using WiFi info. The office space is extremely small compared to the number of people coming in. You'll be sitting elbow to elbow, with every person beside you in meetings, distracting you.\n\n6. The company is trying to brand itself as the biggest AI enterprise company, but internally, it’s a known embarrassment. They simply take one product, rename it and repackage it. They’ve done this thrice to the same product now. The AI models developed in house are a joke. The good ones are simply wrappers that call OpenAI’s APIs. They’re good, but the company doesn’t disclose it (it doesn’t need to), but it parades itself as some great AI visionary. It isn’t.\n\n7. Another pain point is there're too many manager levels - Manager, Senior Manager, Director, Senior Director and VP. The first 4 just talk all day with almost zero understanding of the actual tech and contribute to red tape between teams. The politics is crazy.\n\n8. Product management leadership is another problem. The actual PMs are pretty intelligent, who went to innovate and get stuff done. The VP+ in PM are extremely laid back and lack vision. As a result, you'll see our competitors bang out features. A year later, Salesforce PM leadership lists all those features, takes the top 2 or 3, asks engineers to implement it and then pat themselves on back as being innovators in the CRM space. They aren't.\n\n9. If you're on the main engineering tech stack (called 'Core'), you'll have a horrible time. It is a huge monolith. Skills won't be transferrable.\n\n10. Some orgs (called \"Clouds\") are much more toxic than others.\n\nSo - come here only if you've no other place to go",

Generally rule of thumb is higher paying the job the worse the company culture is. However, my experience in tech and finance is there are a lot of high paying chill jobs out there its just a matter of landing in one. I am a risk quant (kinda like data sciencE) so I straddle the line of both industries.\n2. Do you have a visa problem, given the current political environment in U.S. it might be hard to get a work visa.\n3. People will talk about health care and other benefits possibly being better. These people are usually talking out of their ass and have not lived in multiple countries.  Generally health care in U.S. is through the employer and most corporate a jobs have reasonably good health insurance and often better many ways in Europe i.e. specialist visits and the like. What America's problem is the the quality of health insurance is entirely a function of where you work and what plans they offer and generally poorer people do not have access to high quality health insurance either due to it beign cross probhibitive  and for small businesses they may not offer it (for example a small restauarnt does not have to offer health insurance to their workers if they employ fewer than 50 people). What you will find in America is if you are in teh top 1/3rd you are substantially better off than anywhere in Europe or Canada, and if your in the bottom 1/3rd you are substantially worse off. The middle 1/3rd is ???. Software engineering is one of thsoe occupations where you are generally in the top 10 percent.\n4. For salaried jobs for mid career professional the normal vaction in software engineering, data science, ML would be something like 4 to 6 weeks of vacation.\n5.

I was positioned well and absorbed a ton of product knowledge (was on a core framework team) before transitioning. I'm also of the opinion devops works best when there's buy-in from multiple angles (if not org-wide in the first place).\n\nI'm of the opinion the best DevOps engineers are SWE first and infra/automation second, and I will often introduce myself as an SWE with a passion for DevOps. As a DevOps engineer you build natural buy-in by understanding the stack and making developers lives' easier and velocity faster.\n\nMy particular company is a dinosaur in tech years (been around since the 70s in some form or another -- 5+ name changes over the decades). We are a tech company, and yet we're relatively unknown. There are people that have been here 30-40 years. There are still moments where it's difficult to break old patterns of monoliths and shared dev environments. Tools like Git and Docker are sometimes difficult to get them to use properly -- while Cloud lives and breathes containers, I introduced them to Dev just 5 years ago. Dev only just moved to git around that same time (from SVN and before that MKS).\n\nThese days transformation is key. We're seeing the transformation with AI, now anyone can be an SWE or DevOps engineer. Real SWEs are problem solvers and evolve and adapt to the problem to be solved.",

This isn’t 2020 anymore, you most likely won’t land a dev job because you know a bit of react. \n\nIf you genuinely want to become a dev, do the comp sci WGU degree, get CRACKED at leetcode/system design, have projects under your belt and showcase it to the world. If you genuinely become cracked than nothing can stop you, the issue comes when you think doing the bare minimum will still get you a good dev job.

It’s obviously not true but somehow still true at the same time: applications to a job take a lot less work than to a college (also college applications take money). Most problems asked in coding interviews are honestly not Leetcode hard level for big tech. You can get unlucky but they ask a lot of medium with follow up to hard. The interviewers are just people working their job every day and they don’t want to ask a question nobody can understand, there’s no joy to sitting awkwardly for 45 minutes.

Managers will manually review the 100 applicants down to 20 they are interesting in doing phone screens with. The phone screens are ~15 minute conversations where the manager asks some very basic questions.\n* **Interview Stage**: 4 - 6. Managers will conduct phone screens with the 20 applicants and from that pick around 5 +/- a one or two that they want to interview\n* **Interview Rounds**: In my group we usually do two rounds of interviews. First one is typically remote unless the applicant lives nearby but the second one is always mandatory in person. Each round is pretty similar but with different groups of engineers. The managers will sit in and watch but let the engineers do all the actual interviewing. The actual interviews are about 30% behavioral/personality and 70% coding checks. The coding checks are pretty simple. Nothing from leetcode. Just basic programming questions or prompts to write simple functions. We are mostly just looking to see if you actually know how to code and didn't cheat your way through college. The questions barely get harder than fizz-buzz level and yet still like 50% of the applicants fail massively at this stage.\n\n\nSo if we use 2K as the total number of applicants. Then ~5% of resumes are actually looked at by a person. ~1% make it to phone screens. ~0.25% make it to interview stage. Keep in mind these percentages include all the non-eligible candidates which are all automatically filtered out.",

Most fin-techs operate more like tech companies, but as they've grown they are starting to build out some of those risk and compliance functions. Some of them act as vendors to banks and are effected by bank regulations due to having to provide turn key solutions, so they are effected by model risk functions. For that reason they are familiar with banking background and more likely to also employ people from the banking space.\n\nAlso as someone whose been in quant model development at large banks, its very common to exit from mid-tier banks into Big Tech. You just need to brand yourself more in the tech lingo and bank acts. Certain banks wear the tech company cosplay like capital one and its relatively easy to move from those places. I've seen people of all levels move from banking to tech from model validation or quantitative model development, usually in some kind of data science role.\n\nI also think some of this is how you sell your self. I mean lets be real what is teh difference between model risk and AI risk conceptually?",

It’s one of the easiest entry points into tech because it builds directly on what you already know with organizing data, spotting trends, and presenting insights. You can start by learning tools like Excel (advanced level), SQL, and Power BI or Tableau. Once you’re comfortable, you can move to Python and basic statistics. Yes, data analysis includes some stats, but you don’t need to be a math genius. You just need to understand basic ideas like averages, percentages, and trends.\n\nFor courses, check out Google Data Analytics on Coursera, IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate, or freeCodeCamp’s Python and SQL tutorials. They're beginner friendly and look great on a resume. As you learn, build small projects like maybe analyze public datasets or create dashboards so you have something to show employers.",

For banks and insurance companies, look up their local branches or regional offices and find the IT managers on LinkedIn - they're usually more responsive than corporate recruiters. Credit unions are actually goldmines for this stuff, way less bureaucratic than big banks and they're always looking for people who can modernize their systems. Manufacturing companies are another sleeper hit, especially if you can stomach learning some legacy systems - places like John Deere, Caterpillar, even local manufacturing firms need people who can bridge the gap between old school operations and modern tech. The key is positioning yourself as someone who can work with existing infrastructure rather than someone who wants to tear it all down and rebuild it. Also don't sleep on government contractors - they move slow but once you're in the ecosystem it's pretty stable. For getting past the portals, try reaching out to people with titles like \"IT Manager\" or \"Systems Administrator\" at these companies, they're usually buried in work and would love to have someone competent join their team. The certification thing depends on what you want to do but honestly your startup experience is probably more valuable than any cert, you just need to frame it right.",

That's why they still give you technical interviews. Referrals are *character references*. It's somebody the company already likes, saying another person isn't crazy and will be a good fit for the company. That's a *huge* benefit for the company over hiring a rando off the street.",

Entering into business partnership is like a marriage, and there is a non-trivial chance that the friendship will end if things with the company go sideways (which they likely will given startup failure rates) \n2. Do you care about the equity? Usually if you get 200k+ in base salary, you’re not going to get the kind of equity you would if you started for minimum wage and lived off ramen for a year. Even in the best case exit, the equity may not be life-changing unless your friend is naive enough to give you both generous salary and generous equity \n3. Are you willing to devote your entire life to this project for at least a year? Six months isn’t enough to get anything done, and being a founding engineer is all-consuming. I did it as a young man, but after I got married, I started turning down early-stage startup roles because I can’t afford to make work my entire life \n\nIf you’re ok with the downsides that come with all of these questions, then yeah, take a risk and do it!",
