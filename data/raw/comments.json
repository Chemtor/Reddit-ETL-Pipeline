A little story time: Our team once had a major pipeline outage (fun fact: it was when we upgraded our Hadoop infrastructure to a new major version, what a mess 🤦‍♂️). Suddenly, everyone in the company understood our value, because they saw what broke when our tables and processes went down.\n\nUp until that point, I often struggled communicating our value to stakeholders. Then, during a sales call with a third-party company, they asked me, \"What are your data products?\", I heard it the first time and thought it was just management speak. But actually, it became quite a useful tool for me.\n\nWhile software engineers ship visible features, data engineers build invisible infrastructure. Our work powers decisions, reports, and systems behind the scenes. That makes it hard to demonstrate value.\n\nTechnically speaking, I'd define a data product as a composition of assets that, taken together, deliver a result with business relevance(!). Assets can be anything involved in the process: input tables, queries, processes, models, intermediate results, etc. If we're talking Airflow specifically (because this is well known by most), that means tables, Dags, tasks, everything involved in delivering the outcome.\n\nFrom a data engineering perspective, data products are a communication framework to make our work visible. Simple concept, but powerful for explaining what we actually deliver.\n\nFrom a management perspective, a data product is a measurable business asset with clear ROI and accountability. It's something you can point to during budget discussions, assign ownership to, and track performance against defined SLAs.\n\nHowever, not every table, task, or Dag is a data product, but it might be part of one. It's a good exercise to identify them by looking at: Business impact (if this disappeared tomorrow, would executives notice? Would customers be impacted?), orchestration complexity (we had a super Dag triggering lots of other Dags, that was a clear sign for a data product), and high-value consumption (multiple teams depending on it, feeding executive dashboards, etc.).\n\nLook at all your data assets, try to group them together as data products, and also learn what value those data products generate (e.g. what are the tables, reports used for? Is there any measurable impact like revenue, cost savings, increase retention times along the chain?). This will help you to communicate the value of your work, be it internally or when applying for a new job and it helps understanding what needs monitoring and observability.\n\n**Basically: When they work, they're invisible. When they break, everyone notices.**",

You'll be faster using Prefect or whatever other python orchestrator than you will with n8n. Why? Because n8n wasn't built for complex data pipelines. Your boss can choose; would he rather you spend your time building out more exciting use-cases or grappling with trying to force a square peg into a round hole.\n\nAs someone who has built a declarative saas Orchestra-tion tool (I am not saying what it is but you can guess which one!) I've often struggled conceptually to define why we're better than something like n8n for data use-cases, and I think fundamentally it just has to do with the level of abstraction.

What you're describing sounds typical, maybe even kinda good? Don't expect to find a job where you are free from dipshit architecture and handed up to date documentation of your data assets in day 1, maybe those roles exist somewhere but I haven't seen them.\n\n\nIf you think in terms of business value, I'm wondering if your org's move to the cloud was a bright idea. If you're not a fortune 500, a not-terrible on prem warehouse is perfectly adequate, and a better investment in data might have actually been to document what you have and work towards a medallion architecture just within the dwh, which would have given you the opportunity to systematically unpick the sources and transformations, embedding business logic and documenting it as you go. But dipshit architects with a vendor in their ear are far from rare, anywhere you go.\n\n\nIt feels universally accepted that if you're on prem you're not a real DE and execs and architects believe it's a fundamental truth that the cloud will unlock value. In your case it sounds like your org had a not-terrible thing going already, and fucked yourselves with a lazy lurch into the cloud that just lifted and shifted your existing problems.\n\n\nMaybe the question to ask is what it is that you like about DE. Today you've got big problems to solve and lots of business value to unlock, a management structure above you that's floundering and will think you're a wizard if you help them by implementing some common sense basics, and a pretty typical set of issues that will be familiar in any role.",

Depending on the size of the company and your relationship with them, talking to your boss’s boss is an option but could backfire if you don’t already have a working relationship there. \n\nHaving been on both sides, depending on how frequently you’re trying to get clarification/how it’s being done I could potentially understand the manager’s side. I’ve had employees who seem to reach out with questions whenever there’s any kind of decision that needs to be made or they run into any kind of roadblock, rather than trying to figure it out themselves first, and it can be draining when it ends up being a regular interruption. Ideally a manager wants to be able to point you in the right direction, answer your questions up front, and then generally let you do your thing. \n\n\nI think it’s also worth acknowledging the difference between effort and results. If I have an engineer who is “lazy” but gets things done without issue or automates things to make their job easier, and another that is always working hard but seems to struggle a lot, I’ll take the lazy one every time. \n\nNot trying to doubt what you’re saying or anything, just some things to consider. \n\nAll of that said, if you think your review did not reflect your actual performance, and the company doesn’t value you, then absolutely find a job somewhere that does value your talents. It can also be the case that your manager is incompetent or a jerk, and there’s no obligation to stick around.",

This plan contains only user's statements, commands, etc. Actual schemas appears (resolves) only after the so called \"analysis\" stage when Spark replace user statements by actual tables, columns, etc. Analyzed Logical Plan is materialized only on action (or on explicit call to do it, like to call \"explain\"). You can easily write the code that read CSV, select non existing column and write it back. And you will see the \"Analysis exception\" only on action (or an attempt to force analysis stage, like call of \"explain\")\n\nThat is a nice picture: the first \"Unresolved Logical Plan\" is fully lazy.

But it comes with a huge distributed overhead. There are better solutions for single node case that can work in out-of-core mode (Polars in streaming mode, DuckDB, DataFusion that can spill to disk, etc.)",

The thingnis, those queries were slow when they ran it in US, close to MySQL server, and totally collapsed, when I had to run them in Europe. I, a beginner with databases reverse engineered those messy queries, cleaned up the logic and rebuilt them so that they ran faster here, than they used to run over there. My boss said \"It's so... clean.\" And to this day it's one of the best compliments I got for my work.",

There are plenty of excellent data tools out there. Cloudera believes in openness, building a platform that works seamlessly with those great tools. At the same time, it is probably one of the very few vendors that can deliver a truly end-to-end data platform both on-prem and in the cloud. While Hadoop, and the architectural principles behind it, remain the backbone of big data, today the focus is on the powerful open-source technologies that sit on top of it and enable modern data architectures: Spark, MPP DWH engines, Iceberg, Airflow, Kafka, OpDB, NiFi, a lot of niche tools and the full set of UX augmentations, security and governance capabilities that unify everything under one roof regardles the infra underneath. And if you need more, Cloudera provides private, on-prem, or cloud-based environments for running your data applications, workbenches, and ML/AI models, all while keeping your data and applications securely within your own premises (or cloud account).\n\nThanks for reading my sales pitch.

I worked with a Microsoft MVP (recent MVP), author of several books, and expert level. His academic training is religious studies.\n\nIt’s also true that a non-computer science background puts you at a disadvantage you should consider. It would be wise to strategically plan how you will overcome this gap - and which areas you need to cover in what order. Surely, you don’t need to go back to school and major in it - but you also can’t ignore it. \n\nIt sounds like you are approaching this in a very logical manner. I suggest you spend some time looking at real colleges, reviewing their requirements for computer science (classes) and look through some syllabus’s. The outcome of this exercise is to gain visibility in what you are missing - essentially benchmark. Then you can look at this and see what you think is relevant to you. For example a class in TCP/IP may not be so important for data engineering. This should  all your anxiety by helping you to understand how you fit. Once you find some classes you think you are missing, just look at the syllabus, find the book, and buy the previous version of the book on Amazon for $10. Read it, study it, master it - move on. \n\nI really don’t see computer science degrees teaching data warehousing - so keep this in mind. You might be better off starting with Kimball (follow my same instructions). I would prioritize star schemas over compilers!\n\nEdit: a computer science degree isn’t a finish line, it’s a piece of paper. Looking at my peers, 20 years later, some of them were brilliant and really accelerated in their careers. Others got A’s on tests but couldn’t do hands on. They didn’t survive in the real world. I did very poor on tests, well on labs, and great post university. It’s all about how you apply your knowledge - the piece of paper only gets you the job interview.",

Much easier to maintain, can be unit tested using duckdb or polars, etc. Can write dynamic for loops over your time buckets to simplify the repeated features that just change 1 dimension. You also get the benefit that you can write your features once and switch query engine later as needed, which brings me to #2.\n\nFor #2, SQL Server is not going to scale well for what you’re trying to do. I think a better columnar query engine would work better especially for wide datasets like your features. If you use Narwhals for #1, you can then test out some others including Polars and duckdb that don’t require any special infrastructure beyond installing a Python package. You may find that by doing your heavy joins in SQL then dumping to a file/in-memory, these other query engines are better suited for generating the features.",

You aren't going to have a \"Stripe\" module, but there is an \"InvokeHTTP\" module, where you can make any type of HTTP call, so just like you'd have to set the request type (POST, GET, PUT, etc), API enpoint and HTTP headers in Python, you'd have to set those in NiFi as well.

SSIS can handle on‑prem migrations, but you’ll write more glue and own the failure modes. If you stick with SSIS: use the SSIS Catalog (project model), environment variables, SQL Agent with retries/alerts, CDC components, bulk-load to staging then MERGE, and a metadata-driven pattern (BIML helps). I’ve used Informatica and Talend for this; we also used DreamFactory to expose legacy DBs as REST so apps stayed decoupled during cutover.

Many companies are not big enough to have a team dedicated solely to EDI, but I have seen a lot of companies outsource it.\n\nAs a DE, I’ve only worked heavily in EDI at one company, but that’s because I was the “go to” tech guy for just about everything. I basically setup up the field mappings to our ERP, did some testing with vendors/distributors, and handed off to the respective department. That department then owned the process from there.\n\nEDI could be a nice to have on your resume if you come across it in the wild, but I don’t see a lot of companies asking for it for DE roles.

One day you will want to add unit tests for the transformation, for corner cases, etc. and having logic in pure functions (functions that takes DataFrame and return DataFrame) will simplify things, because you won't need to mock i/o, but can just write tests.\n2. Move configuration logic away from transformation logic. You can create a singleton \"context\" class or an abstract class for the \"job\" and re-use it everywhere. When I say \"configuration\" I mean things like partition dates, input schemas or s3 paths. Again, it will simplify both maintenance (anyone who wants just to check a path or a config do not need to dive into transformation logic) and testing (you can test config and transformation separately).\n3. Do not write a very long chain of pyspark transformations, it is really hard to read. Instead separate logical parts into small functions. Simplify reading the code, transformation and testing.\n\nOverall: the main benefit of using PySpark DF API over SQL is that you can benefit from all the Python tooling for working with growing complexity of the codebase (functions, classes, imports, objects, tests, etc.). So, such a migraton, imo, makes sense only if you are going to use this benefits. In other words, you should start thinking about your ETL as about the software product and use the correspondence best practices. If you just convert SQL to DF API calls it will be much worser: you won't use benefits of DF API, but you will suffer from downsides of DF API.",

However, I pretty much made my living undoing the work that people like this did. I don't really have the bandwidth to get too involved, but if you want to DM me and connect, I'd be happy to review whatever approach you get recommended by said freelancers and give my thoughts.\n\nIn all data projects, the most difficult part isn't so much the technology, but rather understanding the inputs and outputs. To hire a freelancer or get some better feedback from us here, you'll need a comprehensive list of all the platforms you want to source data from, the available methods of extracting that data, where you want to send it, and how you want to interact with it. For example, do you just want to run consolidated reporting from the various platforms you've mentioned? Do you want to push data from one into another?

Ideally once a year so that you can can use the latter one to look for improvements or failures.\n\nI've found this to be extremely successful, with comments from users like this priceless one: **\"the metrics aren't well-organized or very accurate so whenever I need a metric I look for multiple redundant metrics and just average them together.\"**\n\nI then took the survey results, formatted them into insight categories, and used them to create some projections, like:\n\n* Query writing cost:  20% of the 200 users provided survey responses, we'll assume that this is a representative sampling.  Based on this it appears that new queries take an average of 2 hours to validate we're using the data correctly, given X new queries per month this translates to Y total time and vast friction.  Given improvements in the data model & data catalog we believe that we can get this down from 2 hours to 15 minutes - which saves us Z total time.\n* Data quality cost: same approach\n* ETL & modeling cost: same approach\n\nGood luck!",

If you can't really measure the impact of cleaning up the data model and there is no organizational pain from the current mess, it is kind of hard to justify spending time on the activity when you could be spending time on more measurable revenue generating or cost cutting items.\n\nMy suggestion would be add an additional 20% of effort to each initiative on your roadmap that the engineers can use addressing technical debt. Specifically, my suggestion would be for them to simplify the model as they work on delivering on the roadmap initiatives and focus on decluttering one entity in the model during each initiative.\n\nAlso, a nice side effect will be downstream items consuming the model will break as you make the updates. Some of those will go unnoticed and will give you more visibility in to what is actually being used. This will help you prioritize your work in the future.",

Run one entrypoint script via Task Scheduler or SQL Server Agent. Add retries with backoff, row counts/hash checks, and write logs to both a file and a SQL table; send email or Teams alerts on failure. Keep secrets in Windows Credential Manager or Key Vault. Wrap everything in a single CLI, pin dependencies, and document a simple runbook so the next co-op can operate it. If you want extra safety, containerize the job and schedule the container.\nIf leadership insists on Azure, keep it minimal: one ADF pipeline that triggers a single Function or Container App to run the whole script; skip the Blob staging.

The Backend and Tasks seem to be the main expansion of your transactional data, so your processing bottleneck will hit there first. I don’t think your CMS and Docs will expand on an exponential scale compared to the other 2.\n\nExplore docker, kubernetes and Airflow, then see if you can have your ETL/ELT processes organised for them to be running in parallel or sequence. I’m not too sure cost-wise if it’s cheaper to run via EC2 instances or directly using the services directly in cloud (Google Composer). Use airflow to produce an aggregated table so that the BI reports pull the required info quickly.\n\nFor the 60 man organisation, ask yourself if the staff are well versed to write their own queries, or are they excel-dependent. Can they write their own views? But also subject this to some form of approval before running it directly in the database. A SELECT * will incur costs to the moon very quickly.\n\nYou need to assess if transformed data is sufficient for now (data warehouse), and considering transitioning to a data lake after when you are integrating data from other sources.\n\nI hope that offers some direction for you.

It has helped us accelerate onboarding time, reduce debugging, optimize pipelines and rationalize compute. Instead of provisioning multiple large personal clusters on databricks for each contributor, we can do the same with a single SQL warehouse serverless and some k8s, for a cheaper infrastructure cost.\n\nI witness a lot of poor Dataiku deployments with poor architecture choices, relying on the underperforming DSS engine for most task.

I understand there are a lot of good reasons in favor of being opinionated by default, but that's a separate matter. Re performance, I suspect if duckdb is using indexing or parallelization, which is not yet implemented in zsv, it could be much faster in elapsed time where core/CPU is not maxed, but I can't see anything from these quick tests suggesting that DuckDB is faster in total CPU time or in a single-threaded environment, or in an environment where all CPU cores are otherwise being maxed out. I'm not even sure DuckDB's output is correct when it doesn't report an error (see above example with the extraneous text in the output)-- I see plenty of recent issues reported that DuckDB does not handle double-quotes correctly, though at least some seem to have been resolved. That said, I'm very interested in any evidence anyone finds to the contrary of this brief dive!",

Also we had some expensive Oracle contracts for the platforms we did have, so I think it's more or less a wash cost wise for us.",

Your job becomes tied to the collective outcome of your team, and managing people, which can be more challenging than writing ETL pipelines sometimes.\n\nYou mentioned you're completing your SWE degree, and have concerns about your growth due to lack of a manager/repetitive job process.\n\nI'd start asking myself:\n\n1. Do I still want to grow my technical skills? If I become a manager, would this hinder my time capacity to juggle both technical projects and managing people at the same time.\n2. If I become a leader - what kind of leader should I be? Should I stay technical and handle 50% of the implementation, or focus more on the high level architectures and strategies of the team.\n\nI'd also encourage you to discuss your concerns with your CDO - since he has more context on your situation. Communicate openly about your goals, and create an actionable plan on how you can achieve them.\n\n>Should I explore an alternative career trajectory, such as transitioning toward a Data Scientist role?\n\nOnly consider this if you're interested in Statistics/Quantitative projects. A big part of Data Science is story-telling and communicating results to business stakeholders.\n\nI personally stuck with DE because I love the software part of the job; building pipelines, optimizing Spark jobs, managing AWS/GCP costs etc.\n\nMost people don't realize Data Science has more to do with communication than technical - that's why many Econ/Social Sciences people do well in data science (not talking about MLOps or hard core data science PhD jobs of course)\n\n>What critical internal questions should I ask myself to ensure I make the most informed decision about my future path? \\*Should I ask for a salary update? of how much? 15%?\n\n15% raise is reasonable for promotions or \"very good\" performances. In general, single digit raise for non-promotions is normal. Double digit for promotions, exceptional or new job.\n\nFor salary negotiations, I'd start with having a X number, where X is the highest you'd want. Then ask for slightly higher than X. Also have a number Y which is the minimum salary you would accept,\n\nDuring salary conversations, try to center the conversation around your future responsibilities at the company, and re-defining your current scope of job to match that new salary.\n\nHope this helps!",

That setup gives you second-level latency, but it’s a lot of infra to maintain and debug.\n\nIf you’re okay with a few minutes delay, it’s usually easier to land raw CDC tables in a warehouse using a managed connector and build an incremental dbt model that joins them together. You can re-materialize the wide table on a schedule, and it’s much simpler to manage than a full stream topology. For 500M rows, ClickHouse will handle this fine if you pick a good sort key; BigQuery works too, but watch out for costs on frequent MERGE operations. I wouldn’t rely on triggers in Postgres unless you have a very low write rate. they’re painful to debug and can slow your OLTP side.\n\nWhat kind of latency do you actually need, and are those 7 tables small dimension tables or all large fact-like tables? \n\nAs a fully managed solution, you could check out Estuary. It can handle log-based CDC and any of your destinations + a bunch of cool features like schema evolution. I work at Estuary, so take that into account.",

Create a denormalized representation of this, and then describe it using something like jsonschema for the data contract.\n   * Whenever any one of these attributes changes, generate the domain object and publish to something like kafka/kinesis/etc.\n   * The consumer can subscribe to the feed, redirect it into a file or table, etc.  And from there are in a better position to perform additional transformations on the data.",

I had to learn to observe negative space, proportions, values, and all sorts of details that I wouldn’t have even noticed if I hadn’t trained my brain to think that way. It is a completely different way of thinking (and seeing the world) from programming. Switching between the two ways of thinking I found to be incredibly difficult and mentally exhausting.

AI, at least right now, is prone to bad coding style, prone to bugs, prone to weird decisions. A person who lets an AI do his task for him and does not oversee the result, he also will leave such nonsense in his project. And it will be visible to recruiters. Some recruiters for sure will leave out such people.\n\n2)interview stage: when a person does not know what he is doing it will be much more apparent during the interview. He can't explain why he wrote his project the way he wrote (well, the way his AI wrote). He is unable to make changes when asked. Sometimes the interview will give him Leetcode exercise. As he did not solve his assignments on his own, he will be unable to solve these Leetcode exercises on the spot.\n\n3)probation period. First 4 months or so. Then the team is testing if the person is even suitable for the job. A person who just relies on an AI will generate more nonsense to pull requests. He will have more issues with his task. Perhaps the internal team blocks certain AI-tool-related communication and he can't even use the AI tool. Because some projects are proprietary and the client has not given permission to use cloud-based AI tools. The person most likely will fail in these 4 months and has to leave.\n\nSo, do not care much about such people. Concentrate on your own studies. They will not have an easy shortcut to a paycheck.",

But when you don't really have any interest in the subject, the last thing you want to meet is the tryhard dude that has 100 expectancies of you, when you just want to pass... Maybe team up with simiar colleagues.\n\nAnyways man, be good and stay safe!",

It’s pretty easy to go to C++ with an uunderstanding of C, but hard to come back to C when you’re accustomed to things like vectors, stdlib functions and so on.\n\nI urge you to have atleast a minimal amount of pure C programming in low level fundamentals like memory, containers like arrays and so on. You can continue using C++, but you’re still being abstracted away from low level, just that you still have an option should you choose it.\n\nBy extension, learn a tiny bit of assembly as well.

You’ll learn way more by diving deep into data structures, algorithms, and systems programming than by trying to juggle two paths at once.

        "body": "I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering.\n\nComputer Engineering is a sub-discipline of Electrical Engineering that branched off in the 1960s and 1970s. It focuses heavily on electrical theory and its application to digital systems. Main focuses are electronic components, signalling systems, control systems, circuitry, embedded and integrated systems, logic design, and system programming. Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering students will typically have a high degree of common courseload.\n\nComputer Engineering students at most universities will do a lot of VHDL/Verilog programming, as well as a lot of C programming. CE programs often include a number of compulsory Software Engineering courses focuses on operating systems and data structures; at some institutions these courses may fall under Computer Science.\n\nComputer Engineering is not for the faint of heart. It is brutal, but if you enjoy the guts of computers, you will love it.\n\nSoftware Engineering is a fairly new Engineering discipline and is still not as widely accredited as Computer Engineering. Software Engineering is an endeavour to apply the principles of engineering (ethics, public interest, safety, principled design, etc...) to what has historically been a tradecraft.\n\nPurist arguments aside, Software Engineering focuses almost exclusively on the practical aspects of programming and software development with a light dusting of multi-discipline studies.\n\nA spate of high-profile and high-casualty structural failures (bridges, buildings, viaducts, waterworks, etc...) during the early 1900s taught us that traditional engineering disciplines needed to be carefully regulated to ensure that members of the public weren't put into danger by people who had no idea what they were doing.\n\nA spate of high-profile and sometimes high-casualty software and/or control system failures (Therac-25, Cherynobyl, Three-Mile Island, the entire company of Boeing, Mars Climate Orbiter, etc...) during the 1970s through 2000s taught us the same thing about software development. Everyone involved in critical design and decision making needs to have their eye on the ball at all times; failing to do so can result in death.\n\nComputer Science is a field of applied mathematics and is more concerned with theory and abstract concepts than practical application of those concepts. I once worked with an individual with a PhD in Computer Science who hadn't done *any* actual programming; his interests were largely data driven business analytics.\n\nWhereas Computer Engineering and Software Engineering are accredited Engineering programs with a fairly standardized level of instruction across institutions, Computer Science is not. A Computer Science program at one institution may be radically different than a Computer Science program at a different institution.\n\nIn Summary,\n\nIf you think you might enjoy Computer Engineering, buy yourself an inexpensive FPGA development board such as the [Terasic DE10-Nano](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=167&No=1046) or ask for one for christmas. If you enjoy mucking about with that, then Computer Engineering is the field of study for you.\n\nIf you think that you might enjoy Software Engineering, start biting your teeth on C and C++ if you haven't done so already, do some tutorials in Qt (or any other application development framework), and get familiar with POSIX operating systems\n\nIf you think that you might enjoy Computer Science, study the differences between binary search trees, B-Trees, and B+-Trees. Read up on the latest AI craze. Try and understand what a Quaternion is and how it is used in 3D graphics.\n\nFeel free to throw any questions my way.",

It is focused the most on coding and software development as a field. This is what most people actually want. \n\n  \nSpecial mention goes out to the IT and Networking degrees that will also introduce coding classes, but also focus on other aspects of how computers interact with the world at large.",

In most cases, there's huge overlap in these majors.\n\nThat is because these programs tend to focus mostly on skill-building. It's useless to just have knowledge if you can't \"run\" fast enough, or \"jump\" high enough, mentally-speaking, to do actually code at an effective level. That's why using generative AI to help too much is basically  shooting yourself in the foot, as you're wasting all that time and money for no actual gain.\n\nComputer Science mostly involves math and logic.

Programmers like to write/talk about the parts of coding they like. This is why you'll find recursion or other advanced topics in introductory materials.\n\nWriting about debuggers and coming up with follow-along exercises of using a debugger for a non-contrived program is tough and tedious and programmers don't like doing it.

Pick a stack and stick with it, i suggest picking something you have already worked with because you will already be familiar with it.\n\nDo some small projects without AI, just using your problem solving skills, documentation, and stack overflow if you need. You will still need to identify a problem, identify multiple solutions, and decide which solution is best applicable to your problem. \n\nYou wont git gud tomorrow or next week.

Get to the point where you can make the problem happen every time. If possible. Understand the inputs and other things that cause the failure.  \n\n   There are some bugs that are intermittent. Those are the worst. You can learn about [race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) someday, but not today.\n\n   If it's your thing write a test case which generates the bug.\n\n2. Try to figure out exactly which line of code caused the bug. If you get a traceback or other error message, it can tell you this. The top line of the traceback (bottom line in Python, why, Guido, why, did you do this backwards?) probably shows you the source file and line number where the problem occurred.\n\n3. Eyeball the code and the error message. Read the error message three times carefully; it often tells you exactly what is wrong in a language you don't quite understand.\n\n4. Learn to use a debugger to step through your code line by line. Start stepping (set a breakpoint) a few lines before the suspect line and do step step step. \n\n5. Try putting in a fix to the problem.\n\n6. Repeat these steps.\n\n7. If you get frustrated after doing all this, take a break. Get a good night's sleep. Sometimes the answers to my bugs have come to me in dreams. Seriously.\n\nMost importantly:\n\n**Always remember that debugging is harder than programming. Don't use all your cleverness programming something, because you'll never be able to debug it.**\n\nYou got this. Welcome to our great trade.",

Use what you learned, automate something, build a useful little app that makes your life easier.  \n\nIn this moment i’m learning python, but i really hated the dependencies and setting up the venvs and the testers and testing. So i went a little deeper to really understand that part and automated it. So now if i start a new project i run a makefile and it sets up the venv, main dependencies, linters, and a basic unit test. So i can start a new project or tutorial without worrying. While i learned a lot about dose parts. Next up ( i’m a devops engineer ) is setup the same thing for a basic CI/CD to eventually get my python code up into docker on my local homelab. These things i spend about 20/25% of my time on, i learn something for my job, i learn more about python and in the meanwhile i make my own life easier.\n\nMain get away is, enjoy the process! Have fun! Build things you like or miss. Then you can do a lot without burnout. Burnout does not really happen when it’s fun, it mostly comes from forcing your self to do things X amount of time while not enjoying it.",

Like when you play tic-tac-toe, you both see the actual board with Xs and Os, and you imagine how the board will look once you place your next mark.\n\nThat is also how software works, there is some sort of output, if not explicitly graphical or visual, at least observable in some way, and there is an invisible internal representation, that you can't experience, but that the program \"knows\" and uses to decide its next move, or determine who won. \n\nAnd in both games and programs there's input that manipulates the internal model - often with very different results, depending on the previous state of that model.\n\nAnd of course, games have rules - often you follow an actual algorithm when playing a game, or at least you have some fixed pattern of steps to perform, and there is, if not an algorithm, then a fairly strict way of determining a winner or loser, or if the game should continue.\n\nAnd most important of all for learning - there is a lot of repetition in games, both as a player and a developer you are iterating a lot, gradually improving, and always trying various combinations. So often you work a lot more with a game than any other program you are creating, you actually enjoy playing your own game, and try to beat it - whereas with a CRUD system for Student administration or a Car Rental, you'll just build one feature and get quickly on with the next one as soon as it seems to work sufficiently.\n\nSo there are a lot of similarities between playing games, creating games, and building programs.\n\nAnd they are often fun to create and use!",

If you get to the point where the language performance is the bottleneck, then count yourself as successful. At that point you can afford a rewrite.\n\nScalability is not really a language feature. That is more related to architecture. Scale can be done in whatever language, or be hindered in all languages given you do the wrong thing.\n\n>  I’d love to hear your thoughts. Which language/framework would you recommend for high-performance APIs? \n\nAgain, I disagree with the question. Go is a solid and pretty safe option IMHO. I've never been a fan of Python, so of the two, I'd choose Go.\n\nBut beyond that, I don't really think the choice matters.

Scaling the number of users, the number of requests, the frequency of requests, the number of services involved in each request? Scalability isn't just a word you can slap on the entire application, you need to be more specific. Also, it has more to do with the chosen architecture than the programming language - every language can scale to billions of objects without issues.\n\nWhat should the AI do? And why is that part of the REST API? There is usually no AI in REST, on the contrary, REST is (mostly) supposed to always return the same responses to the same requests - something AI doesn't really do.\n\nAnd finally - what do you actually mean by \"build my own REST API\"?   \nEvery single time you create an application that accepts HTTP requests, you kind of \"build your own REST API\" - it is literally just accepting requests and returning responses. Are you perhaps confusing an actual application with the interface to talk to it?",

If you really want to scale up to black-friday volume, take a look at the HAPI framework.

If you are totally new to programming, what I have been doing is first identifying what I want to gain from said language, (for me it was Golang, I want to build software, develop \"engineers\" mindset, and get hired). \n\nThe one thing I have learned overall about programming, is that fundamentally it is the skill of problem solving. I have used python before and when I solve problems, I don't even see the language anymore, I see the problem. I have 3-4 different resources I am using for go specifically. Learn go with tests, learn go the hard way, and Exercism. Each resource fills in gaps for the other. Exercism helps you develop the problem solving skill that is fundamental to programming, Learn go the hard way is a total beginners book on programming with go. Learn go with tests is a more intermediate book I go through after I finish the same topic in both exercism and LGtHW. Its allowed me to immerse myself and not just \"learn go\", but develop the problem solving and engineers mindset. \n\nAll this to say, find what works for you. If it is a text based courses and books, then great, if it is a video course, then great, if it is building something, then great. Just experiment around with a 3 different resources max and see what works for you the best.",

Then i start breaking down the pieces into smaller pieces like declare array etc. Until when i read the comments it looks like the program or lines of code i try to build.\n\nThen i start building lines of code for every comment, if i forget a step i write a new comment etc. I investigate every line and just write what i think should work. I do not think about perfect code or the shortest or cleanest. By going line be line i encounter errors, fix them. Till i have the output i want.\n\nThen i read/watch the tutorial. Apply what i learned on that code. If it’s part of a bigger tutorial i go to that project and apply it there. Then scan the ret of that code and see if i can apply it there. While most of the time cleaning up the code as well.\n\nThen i feed those parts to claude, to see if it is by best practice if not i google around and find out the better ways. After all of that is implemented i go to my own side project and apply it there. \n\nThis way in learn to think about problems and solve them, after that i learn to apply it and hopefully save it to memory a little bit.\n\nI make a simple not about what i learned and add a code snippet or useful links to my wiki.\n\nSimple stuff takes about 30 minutes, sometimes it takes me all evening. But i’m actually writing code instead of copying. So it’s about understanding instead of producing.",

Data is pushed to this system rather than the system pulling data into it.\n\nThe implementation of this can certainly use a queue, and in reality a system like this will likely use multiple queues and/or stacks along and way.\n\nTL;DR a stream and a queue are really just different things, not necessarily a replacement for each other. A stream is some data coming from a source which may or may not have an end, whereas a a queue is just a FIFO mechanism for processing data. Consider an example outside of programming:\n\n- A “stream of people“ would describe many people passing through some point at some rate without necessarily defining a start, end, or quantity\n- A “queue of people” would describe a line for people to wait in a FIFO fashion. There may not even be any people in the queue at some point in time\n- A stream of people may be entering a building to go wait in a queue, to go wait in one of many queues, or do something else entirely\n- A long and fast moving queue might be described as a stream",

That is, the consumer will receive chunks data in the same order as the producer sent them. That’s a stream.  TCP is such a system. You can rig, I dunno, RabbitMQ or MSMQ or whatever to provide that kind of service too.\n\nBut a message queuing system can generalize beyond that. You can have many producers and one consumer of data. You can have many consumers, and distribute the messages to them to balance a load. You can have lossy queues—that makes sense for some applications. You can replay events from the recent past. And on and on.\n\nEither one can handle data in near real time. \n\nA stream is systems-architecturally much simpler than a more generalized queuing system. Your Saturday night production incidents will be easier to sort out with streams instead of queues. (Unless you build custom software to do what a properly configured queuing system product does, thus re-inventing the flat tire).\n\nFor these engagement events, a message queue design involving multiple producers makes sense. We’d have to know a lot more about what you are trying to do before suggesting lossy queues, replay features, or multiple consumers.",

Check diet as well if you eat brain food every day. And check if you are just busy or productive and getting small pieces of tasks done every day.\n\nImpostor? For sure. You got into top school and you are in top class and you already got job. Do you really need a validation from others or applause for that? Some people need 4h of sleep, some 6, some 8 or even 10 and if you sleep less than your body needs that itself will put you out of balance with emotions all over the place.

I dont think you are in the second group, you just put that label on yourself and time to remove it.

If I tell you to order a list of numbers from smallest to largest, you can just do it, right? A computer *can't*. You have to explain *exactly* what you want it to do before it can solve the problem.\n\nBut, if you want to know what you need to know about C, the main thing is pointers and the second thing is manual memory management (malloc/free), but don't worry about that right now.

Because then you can compare the versions and you too will see and understand how much you are improving.\n\n**Now to your question.**\n\nWith the current code structure, it is difficult to create an enum and then switch on that enum value, meaning it is time to write a new version of this code.\n\nYou could achieve this result using a `map` and an `enum`.\n\nHere is information on how to use a map: [https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map.html](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map.html)\n\nTo do this you would create an enum:\n\n    enum class Months\n    {\n      Summmer,\n      Autumn,\n      Winter,\n      Spring\n    };\n\nThen declare a map to map each month to an enum value:\n\n`std::map<std::string, Months> months;`\n\nThen you just load the map:\n\n    months[\"January\"]  = Months::Winter;\n    months[\"February\"] = Months::Winter;\n    ....\n    months[\"December\"] = Months::Winter;\n\nNow you can use this map to get an enum value for any user input and then switch on that enum value.\n\nBut make sure you also cater for the case where the user input is not found in the map.\n\nAlso consider making the map lookup case insensitive.",

But you can revisit those same problems later using the lens of topology, and make some of it easier and some of it harder.\n\nAdditionally, functional programming typically comes with some very strong guarantees on mutability and which operations are dependent on each other, stronger than can be made in *arbitrary* non-FP contexts. This enables a different class of compiler optimizations.

You can sorta code with \"responsive HTML\" that adjusts itself to the width of the screen, but that's more UI tweak than fundamental design. Use a framework/toolkit/library to help you with that. You *should* know which ones if you supposedly have HTML/CSS/JS experience. \n\nSo, how would you design a calendar app? It's just a database with UI. So you need some sort of database backend. Pick one that fits your needs. (Complicated: Firebase. Simple as heck: SQLite)\n\nThen you need some sort of middleware linking database to the UI. That's what you program the \"webapp\" in. And you need to learn THAT. The combination of database and middleware and UI is sometimes called a \"web stack\". For example, the MERN stack is MongoDB as database, Express.js and Node.js as Middleware, and React for UI. No, not suggesting that. It's too complicated for your needs. Figure out the right stack for your project is YOUR responsibility. \n\nHow would an app send you message? Well... WHAT TYPE of message? Text Message cost money, notifications don't, but routing it to yourself requires going through some sort of OS API. Again, your own research. \n\nYes, I've kept things vague for a reason. I want YOU to finish the research. I merely gave you some ideas to get started.\n\nEDIT: If you still don't quite get it, I want you to NAIL DOWN the requirements first. Right now, your requirement is kinda vague. Write the requirements down, into a requirement document. You need it written down and set in stone (well, mostly) before you start. Else, you'll suffer \"feature creep\". \n\nTHEN you think about HOW TO MEET the requirements with your design, BEFORE you start coding. \n\nOnce you have the design and architecture of your app down, THEN you start picking it apart, and code it piece by piece. (and test piece and piece if you can). \n\nAs the cliche goes, (you eat an elephant) \"one bite at a time\".",

Without VPN connection, even if you'd know the URL, it would time out.\n\n2. Authentication. May it be via JWT tokens, session tokens or something else. Sure, you can have the URL but without being authenticated, you'll get 401 error.\n\n3. Authorization. Fine, you figure out how to get authenticated. You make a new user. You are using its JWT token. But you are not added to relevant access groups. Maybe you can access your guest / new user related endpoints but nothing else. You might find an admin endpoint but as you lack access rights, you'll get 403 error.\n\n4. Rate limiting. You get this funny idea that you start scanning the host or start brute forcing or something. Your requests per second will be used up and you'll be either banned or timed out for time being.\n\n5. Hosting it behind some weird port. You'd expect a website to sit behind 80, 8080 or 443 port. What if I put it behind 49157? You typing in the URL without correct port will default to 80 and you will get either 404 error or some default placeholder webpage or something. My real service sits behind 49157.\n\n6. Region blocking/whitelisting. Let's say our client gets scam calls and emails from India. He has no business there. Then we can a)blacklist the whole India from accessing the service and Indians will get 404 or b)whitelist only these countries where our client makes his business. Many US services are blocking traffic from the EU because they do not want to comply with European cookie policy. Yes. you might say \"But VPN. I will use my xxxVPN account to appear from Uganda instead!\". Well, a list of IP addresses can and will be associated with certain VPN services. These can be also blocked.\n\n7. VPN blocking. One can use deep packet inspection tools to block people using VPN even when the traffic is encrypted.\n\n8. Honeypots. One can set up a fake environment. Go ahead and scan it and hack it and try to do whatever you want with it. Either you gain nothing with it or you'll leave traces about you behind. Honeypots are there to attract script kiddies and such.\n\n9. Throttling. Alternative to point 4. Instead of getting blocked or timed out your requests will slow down to an unusable level.\n\n10. Security services like Cloudflare. One can leave all the protection to such services. They will deal then with attack detection and mitigation and such.",

There’s effectively no real way to guarantee that and anyone dedicated enough would be able to defeat it.\n\nWhat you should likely do is create a user auth system, where users create/log in to an account and that’s validated by the API before the backend processes it. The API layer should also have some rate limiting/throttling to prevent spam or abuse. \n\nI do again want to stress that this doesn’t limit someone to only making requests from the extension, someone could just as easily make HTTP requests and include the auth token and pretend they’re using the extension. The point of the authentication layer is that every request is now tied to a user which prevents bots from just spam requesting and lets you ban abusive accounts. \n\nYou should also likely have some form of IP blacklisting to ban suspicious IPs, for your case where this is just a chrome extension it makes sense to also preemptively ban the IP blocks used by the major cloud providers, regular users won’t be using those and it’ll ban bots that are running on servers hosted by them.",

I'd recommend python as a starting point over Java or other options. It's a scripted language instead of compiled so will take less time to get off the ground. \n\n\nAs far as options are concerned long term, education is somewhat mandatory to make it in industry in the US but I'm unfamiliar with the market differences in South Africa so that may not mean much.\nAlso don't worry too much about math background and prior education. The bare minimum is understanding some algebra and that's about it. The rest will come naturally with time and effort.",

What people are going to hire you to do is solve a specific problem, and it's up to you to figure out how to do that.\n\nHonestly, you'll have better luck learning something technical that doesn't necessarily require any coding at all - like learn to set up a Wordpress site, or a Shopify site. There are millions of small business owners that need a website and don't even know how to use a no-code drag-and-drop website builder. You could learn to do that in as little as a few weeks.\n\nPart of the trick is learning about various options and steering clients to the right one. Someone with a blog with several different authors would be a good fit for Wordpress. Someone selling handmade jewelry might be good for Shopify. A small number of clients really do need a custom website built from scratch with a React frontend - but most probably don't need that.\n\nIf you want to go that route, though, more than half your time will be spent running a business: marketing, advertising, talking to potential clients who never pay, chasing down payment, and even things like doing taxes and paperwork. Don't get into freelancing if you're not okay with that being half of your job.",

So in general it’s good to keep them separate.\n\nThat said, there are tools that integrate a language and GUI framework pretty seamlessly, and languages that are meant only for use within a particular platform. Logo defines its own drawing environment and has a lot of built-in drawing functions. HyperTalk (from the late-80’s) was meant mainly for defining UI within the HyperCard environment. Visual Basic was very Windows-specific and integrated with a GUI editor.\n\nIf Kotlin was recommended for your project, use it. It’s a good model for how most GUI programming is done.",

They aren't built into a language because many programming languages are intended to be available to write programs for more than one OS/platform, and including a GUI library would make the language's library quite large.  GUIs for the various operating systems can also behave significantly differently, with different philosophies, so making a standard GUI library that works with everything would be fairly complex and not very practical.\n\nSome developers write command-line applications (without a GUI), so for those reasons, language designers typically choose not to include GUI capabilities directly in a programming language.",

Like in the beginning, there was just the console terminal, and people had to write programs that moved the cursor, colored parts of the screen, wrote text on the screen buffer.  Then framebuffered graphics cards became a thing, and then all of a sudden there were window managers and bitmaps, but the languages pretty much stayed the same. Libraries of course helped create an interface between the language and how data was represented visually.\n\nThere will always be a separate layer between the general purpose language and the UI. Also, people have different ideas of how a UI should be represented. For example, the Win32 API lets you call the OS layer to draw windows, buttons and style them according to the OS, but that means you can't use your program code as-is on another platform like Linux.\n\nLibraries like GTK and QT attempt to solve this problem by creating their own API, which calls the underlying OS to create some of the OS-layer objects like windows, but does the rest of the display stuff itself, in order to have a consistent cross-platform experience.\n\nSo most language rely on separate libraries or frameworks, like C#/.NET having WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) that is Windows-only, or AvaloniaUI which is cross-platform, and MAUI, which is... well...\n\nThen different libraries have different ways of abstracting the layout, so WPF uses XML or rather XAML, Kotlin has it written as code.",

There are frameworks for building GUIs with imperative code, but they're not great to work with. \n\nDeclarative languages, however, are great for building GUIs. For example, HTML.

Better to get ahead of it and be proactive. If fact this might even be praised. \n\n\nBe shamelessly curious at the start of a new position.

Makes it seem like you are genuinely trying and not asking to just be walked through something. Senior developers generally don’t like holding your hand through every step of a process if you haven’t tried. Though if you come with your previous steps, I’ve noticed they are pretty happy to help.\n\nThis period will end soon, in a month I swear you will feel 100x better! Best of luck.",

I'm seeing that you're systematically doing things instead of just \"given this, give me this\".\n\nI'm just worried that your first instinct is to ask AI about the error instead of going through the code first or using the error logs. If you use AI last, that's fine. But it is very important for you to not use AI as much as possible as early as possible as it sounds like you're just learning Java for college.\n\nI suggest that you review the fundamentals again. You can even use AI to create a guideline for you. Just double check its output for accuracy. Then you learn how to debug. Then once you get the fundamentals down, you can go with more complex lessons like OOP, Java-specific things, etc.  You'll know you understand it enough when you start paying more attention to what AI outputs, and you go \"wait, why is it done this way instead of this?\".\n\nAlso I haven't mentioned it yet, but people would agree that another method to learn faster is to find a mentor or ask in Reddit or Discord communities. I don't really know any Discord communities, but I know Java enough, so feel free to ask me questions in the DMs. I'm good to help whenever I'm available.",

Debugging code is where you actually start to build your diagnostic muscles.\n\nAny programmer will have tales of woe of the time they spent hours, if not days, hunting down something as trivial as a badly declared variable.  However, that suffering will have made them better programmers and probably taught them innumerable things they didn't realize at the time.\n\n> I ask AI what I can do too make the program better.\n\nWhile an LLM can barf out code that does stuff, it achieves this feat by stealing all available code from programmers it can find.  Fixing code is something an AI does far less well.  They will, of course, offer suggestions with complete confidence; which is kind of worse.\n\nComputer generated code has always sucked.  Now it's more clever about it, but a human can still put the bots to shame.\n\nA \"better program\" is also rather subjective.  Do you want clearer, faster, or smaller, all of which tend to fight against each other.  It should be what you think is better.  The more you program, the more of an idea you'll have of what your \"better\" is.  The AI's idea of better should not be yours.",

Have you seen the problem or a similar one before? How kind were the interviewers for that particular loop? How desperately do they need a role filled?\n\nHowever, I reject that there was ever a problem with testing how someone does under the pressure of being reviewed by another. In practice, that's what professional development is all the time. Pair programming, collaborative problem solving, and explaining your reasoning to people who are both technical and non-technical. If you freeze up during an interviewer because the interviewer is seeing the code you write as you write it, that's not a problem in the interview process. It's working as intended. Could interviewers do a better job of putting their candidates at ease? Absolutely, but we shouldn't write that skill set off as 'not relevant'.\n\nIt's been a while since I've conducted an interview. But given the recent advancements I'd be inclined to allow my candidates to use coding assistants. A good interviewer was never testing if you solved the problem in the perfect way. They were testing your reasoning and communication skills. And the coding assistant doesn't change that in any way. If you can use the AI in a way that is simply beyond asking it to solve the problem for you, show me that you're capable of reviewing and understanding the code it produces, then communicating that solution to me clearly and engaging in a thoughtful discussion about the solution you'll get a pass in my interview.",

It could be something as simple as Hello World, and you add in getting the user's name, and finding out the current day & time, so that it says \"Hello, <user>. Good <morning/afternoon/evening>. How is your <day of week> going?\"",

First, find out how to read from the keyboard - usually you'd then get a variable representing which key was pressed.\n2. Then you need to determine what should happen for each key - no matter what you decide, it is probably going to be rules that only you know, so you have to find some way of telling the program what the rules are. But begin by writing them out on paper for yourself. e.g. \"A\" should add 1 each time, \"S\" should add 10, \"D\" should subtract 1, and so on.\n3. Begin by writing a program that only understands two of the rules, like \"A\" and \"S\" or whatever makes sense to you. Probably something like a set of if-statements.\n4. When you have that basic program working, it is time to expand with all the rules - but writing 102 if-statements are going to be annoying! Hopefully you can see some sort of pattern, like if key 'x' is pressed, add value 'n' to the number ...\n5. Maybe you can use a data structure like a `dict` in Python to pair up the key 'x' and value 'n' values, and then find the pressed key in that `dict`, and add the matching number. This will take a bit of research into dicts, but it will be time well spent!",

Yet when I add frontend side to it, then I have to take many steps back because I do not feel comfortable with stuff like React or Angular. I can get my tasks done but it is out of my comfort zone.

If just looking directly at the requirement, it seems like the minimum parameters would be the item number and location to be delivered to. It does make sense to also parameterize the \"1 hour\" part assuming folks using the API would be interested in other time frames, too.\n\nI think I prefer /centers as the end-point, since presumably a list of that resource is the return value, and the rest as query parameters treated as filters. They could even be nested as filters to make it explicit. Or they could have filter added to the query parameter name.\n\nI would not do it as 2 queries without knowing more requirements that would justify an API like that. You'd want an API like that for various reasons. But without any reasons, you may as well just make the API as friendly to the user calling it as possible. 1 call is certainly more friendly than 2. It's also almost always more performant, though I wouldn't worry about performance without a specific reason to.\n\nSince it's your API, you can of course require the user to pass the item ID in. Since the requirement is so open-ended, I would just assume the user has an item ID, unless there's some reason to think they don't. If you don't have an item ID I'd change the end-point to /items and add a search query parameter.",

Where does that leave us?\n\nMaybe \n    `GET items/{itemId}/availabilities?deliverTo={}&maxTime={}`\n?\n\nThe `Availability` entity could include things like Time, Center, etc.\n\n> do you think it is okay if we require the user to provide IDs of the entity they are seeking as query parameters?\n\nYes it's expected that they would know the id of the item that they need more information about",

I mostly agree with you but having been in the industry a bit longer, maybe I can offer some perspective.\n\n\n- \"more than a year\" is not that long, especially to see the fruits of your hard work learning the trade. I think it's pretty normal for it to be overwhelming in the beginning, too.\n\n\n- don't stop learning new technologies just because there are new ones coming out every other week. The opportunity cost of switching technologies is pretty high for a company (depending on how deeply integrated it is) so chances are in your career you will sometimes work on stuff that is not bleeding-edge, and having learned a varied set of tools is likely to be if use eventually. Not to mention you will start seeing patterns at some point, which will make you grow as a dev\n\n\n- AI: sure this is transforming the profession in many ways, but try not to over-rely on it as a junior. Some things have to be learnt the hard way. Never keep going if you don't understand what you're doing. It's fine if it's AI or not your idea, but take the time to understand it first. Challenge it if you can. Also yes, many investors and execs would love to completely replace developers with AI, and this is making the market more difficult for junior developers. But if we want seniors tomorrow we need to train juniors today. I mean not everybody agrees with this but it is an argument worth making in my opinion (in interviews, etc)\n\n\nAnyway I hope this helps. This is just my two cents, I'm sure others will have other ideas",

One type of data hat you need to store is posts. Another type of data is user settings, including friend lists and privacy settings.\n\nLet's imagine user A is being harassed by user B. User A first removes user B from their friends list, and then makes a private post to their friends about the harassment. Those two separate operations involve separate writes to the database, involving data which is likely to be in separate shards. If the database doesn't guarantee that writes are seen in a consistent order, then it's possible that when user B opens their dashboard, the webapp reads from the database and sees the post but not the friends list change. That means B will see the post that was supposed to be hidden from them.\n\nOr as another example, consider a storefront with a webapp that writes orders to a DB, and a fulfillment system that reads orders from the DB. If the DB doesn't guarantee consistency, then it's possible that the fulfillment system might see data in one shard saying that an order is in the \"ready for shipment\" status, but data in the other shards about the items to be shipped might be in an inconsistent state that doesn't match what the user saw when the order was placed. Or maybe there was only one item left in stock, and two different users both placed an order for it, but one of them was seeing stale, inconsistent data. So you incorrectly charged two people for the same thing, and you have to detect the situation and refund one of them.\n\nThese are just a couple of examples of how things can go wrong without consistency. The exact details of the failures will depend on exactly how the system is implemented. You can also have similar issues with replication, when different replicas of the same data item get out of sync.",

Email is simple but I would not call it reliable as a way to track progress, shipping, etc.\n\nEach vendor has a phone most likely therefore internet. They can receive an email/text that they received an order. From there they use their email to login to see the order and mark it as received, then in progress, then shipped with a tracking number. They should estimate each of those with a number of days to facilitate 1: We received your order, 2: We are working on your order, 3: Your order has shipped, here is your tracking number.\n\nA simple order entry system works for this. Just a form with the order details and which vendor it is assigned to. The email/text gets sent to the vendor which starts the process above.\n\nAn API needs to be built which effectively fills out the order form and that kicks off the automated process via Shopify integration.\n\nShopify is handling payment from the end customer, but you are going to have to pay the vendor at some point. Your order entry form should allow you to mark orders as paid so you can pay the vendors and keep track of what has been paid. This is going to be the trickier part because different vendors are going to accept different forms of payment. Most of the non-traditional payment methods do not have APIs. I think Venmo might.\n\nYou can probably setup a Stripe account and have your vendors added as sub-accounts. They need to enter they bank routing and account numbers to receive ACH payment. That is one way to automate payments to your vendors.\n\nI hope this helps.",

Now I need to link it to a database, how? Now I need to add function to add a record, etc. Don’t just consume knowledge or force yourself to do raw coding activities. Intertwine a purpose (ie. an app you want to make) with your struggle, and you will find a way through. \n\nOn the other hand, if you really feel like coding is not your forte but you still are knowledgable in the field due to studies, you can see relevant options such as Business Analyst, QA, UI Designer, etc. They all benefit from having coding knowledge so your learning is not wasted.\n\nAll the best!

Writing software is easy, once you figure out what you want to make, you can bang it out pretty fast. LLMs make this part even faster, which can be nice, especially when I have writer's block.\n\nBut.\n\nI have to go back and read through everything it wrote, make sure it works properly, make sure it caught all the weird edge cases specific to our codebase, make sure it matches our coding style, make sure it's going to be reliable, make sure it didn't hallucinate. I usually end up having to rewrite a decent amount of the LLM generated code.\n\nThis sucks because reading software and auditing it is much harder and more intellectually draining than writing it.\n\nFiguring out what you need to write is the bulk of your job, understanding the specs, understanding the context of your changes within your codebase. Making sure all the weird edge cases you know are handled. Writing docs. Coordinating with other folks on the team.\n\nTo get good at that, you need practice, and you need to write stuff yourself, and you need to see it fail yourself. I don't think it's going to actually replace me or you any time soon. I could be wrong, I wouldn't mind retiring early lol. So far, it's been years of threatening to take my job, but no real progress towards that goal.\n\nThe job market is tough right now and companies are blaming AI for layoffs they would have carried out regardless. Tough hiring market at the same time as AI does not mean one caused the other. And so far the companies that actually did lay people off to replace them with AI have ... re-hired everyone a few weeks later.",

Most are just a promise that someone has touched upon basic data structures, algorithms, database concepts, and programming in one or two languages.\n\nIt doesn’t guarantee they write good code, maintainable code, performant code, or code that even meets requirements. It doesn’t guarantee they can design a database schema or design a system, or even that they understand what a message broker and event streaming platforms are, much less how they fit into a system.\n\nIt’s always been like this, though, and AI hasn’t really changed anything about that dynamic. Sure, I can design a spec and pop it in the magic Copilot machine and get code that’s close to correct, but I still have to spend time paying attention to what it’s doing and checking its output, while with most junior engineers I can reasonably expect after the first couple months of their career that they didn’t just hand me a pile of dog shit that appears to do what the requirements are asking, but actually falls apart the second I run or test it.\n\nFor now, it’s just a shit economy, and hiring is going as you’d expect it to in a shit economy. In addition to that, software engineering is no longer the golden ticket everyone acted like it was in the 2010s to the early 2020s. More people have been trying to enter that career, and demand has not kept up.\n\nCombine this with a shit economy and it’s no wonder most CS grads are doing anything but software right now.",

In return, instead of containing China, the same countries that were working with the US are now entering into agreements with China and each other.\n\nThe US stock market has been so important and risen so high thanks to the US's economic dominance. As it fades I'm expecting to see a similar fade that we saw as the UK dismantled the remnants of its colonial empire in the post war era, and as Japan's population inverted and its economy stagnated in the 90s and 00's after being an incredibly fast-rising force in the 70s, and 80s.\n\nLook to that for our future, and extrapolate to what that implies for all businesses. We'll probably end up a regional power like we were back in the early 1900s.\n\nSo yeah, long term I'm expecting leaner times as the endless growth that fueled our on-average 8% YOY growth levels off.\n\nSave your money y'all.",

A few of them were obvious showstoppers which meant they hadn’t touched the code at all for five of those “day for day slip!” weeks. It was schedule drama to cover their own issues. \n\nThey did this nine times in a row before they found one bug I hadn’t already fixed and created a tagged release for. Every one before that was known bug, upgrade to 2.0.4 or later to get the fix. I think we ended up with a 1:11 ratio. By then the API was fixed and the test coverage was high so it was mostly performance or security fixes. \n\nEventually everyone in my division caught on to what a clown car they were.

Use chatgpt to help you write a base one and then use it some more to tailor your resume and cover letter to the specific opening. They likely are using AI tools to scan your resume so fight AI with AI.\n\n-Apply for hybrid positions. There's too much competition for remote jobs. You are competing with the whole country and possibly the world. \n\n-Use your network. Ask literally anyone you know. You never know who has a connection. The guitarist in my band works as an accountant for a financial accounting company who develops all their software in house. He ended up being my referral and I would never have known about this company otherwise. And he obviously isn't a developer or technical at all.\n\n-Be confident in your interviews. Let your personality come out. You don't need to know all the answers but you can always draw on past experiences to at least relate to \n\n-I didn't do any leetcode (or any coding at all) and was mostly asked about my skills, history, projects, and experience. Idk if I got lucky or because it was a senior position or what. But anyway make sure you can tell your story and sell yourself. \n\n-Don't forget the interview goes both ways. Think of some questions to ask about the team or the company and flip the script on them. Make them sell to you. It's an old sales tactic. At the very least you'll have more information on where you are potentially going to work and if it's really the opportunity you want. A good interview should feel more like a conversation than a grilling. I walked away from a couple of companies just because I didn't like how they were conducting things (showing up late, acting kinda adversarial, etc). Anyway it's your interview too.\n\nIdk. Your mileage may vary, but I didn't have a problem finding a job. I didn't really see what everyone was saying with the bad market out there and everything. I never would have known the market was supposed to be bad if I haven't been on the Internet. I ended up beating recruiters away with sticks toward the end of it.\n\nGood luck!",

The thought was if I'm already working crazy hours, I might as well get paid more. Then my old utility field started blowing up due to electrification of everything and I received multiple offers on linkedIn for 40-50% pay bumps (after a 2 year stint not working while going back to school). Left my CS program with about a year left due to class timings and now I have a great work life balance, much higher pay, fully remote and I can use the programming skills I developed to automate a lot of my current work load. Ended up working out well for me. \n\nFor those that are curious, the utility industry is a good place to be right now.

The problem was that the intended way of using a library scaffolding tool was to properly design a schema, but nobody did that and instead used a escape hatch feature of the scaffolding tool to blindly autogenerate a naive API, and the implementation caused all sorts of problems for the \\~300 services that used these bad libraries. And to make things worse, this was a \"cancerous\" type of technical debt, aka the number of bad libraries kept growing over time because people kept using the scaffolding tool the wrong way to create more and more bad libraries.\n\nFixing it was a colossal effort, involving a lot of automation to do the migration heavy lifting and also a lot of manual code changes and manual testing, impacting a ton of teams.

When I was at Compass we went from 150 to 440 engineers in a year and I sat through probably hundreds of technical screens. The correlation between leetcode performance and actual job success is... not great.\n\nWhat I've seen work better is giving them a real problem from your actual workflow. Like pull up some messy production data and ask them to write a query to find something specific. Then watch how they think through edge cases, ask clarifying questions, handle nulls and duplicates. For Python, give them a small script you actually use - maybe something that parses logs or transforms data between formats. See if they can extend it or fix a bug you introduce. The best candidates will ask about the business context, not just dive into coding.\n\nAlso consider splitting the time - 15 minutes on a practical coding exercise, then 15 minutes discussing their approach to debugging, testing, code reviews. Ask about a time their code broke in production and how they handled it. Or show them a piece of your actual codebase and see if they can understand what it does. These conversations tell you way more about whether they'll succeed than watching them reverse a linked list. I've hired people who bombed leetcode but were incredible at understanding business problems and writing maintainable code that other humans could actually work with.",

If you’re struggling, let your manager/senior know rather than failing silently. There is nothing wrong with struggling. But there is something wrong if you cry in quiet and put your team and deliverables into risk. If you let them know, they can also communicate with whoever is necessary and take action earlier. This way, if you deliver stuff, perfect move on to the next thing. If you struggle and let them know, you will get the help you needed and everyone will still be happy because they know they can trust you.\n\nAnd second part is learn to be independent and you need to carry some of the burden the team have. Your existence should not be a burden for someone else but rather help them to carry it. Few examples of this could be, actively review pull requests. Don’t wait someone else to tell you to fix something if you see a problem. Write documentation if you know something. This is kinda related to company size but if you are working with different teams from different departments and they need help, be the guy who they get that needed help from.",

        "body": "60 hours a week is a solid chunk of time to become good at anything, which equates to about 3120 hours yearly.\n\nNow here's the kicker, you either like your job or you don't.\n\nIf you do, then you need to apply 20 extra hours to working more (if you're salary, if not then up to you),\n\nor if you don't like your job then apply that 20 extra hours on another subject.\n\n  \nIf you choose not to apply that time to your job then you're looking at roughly 1000 hours a year, which is what you need to \"master\" or \"grab the hammer\" I call it.  Some guys spend 20 years in C++ optimization and still find new things out today, so they are \"masters\" or \"able to drive nails in one hit\".  That's truly how I look at it, can you walk into an environment and within 10 minutes narrow down a root cause.  If you can't find something that quick then you haven't spent at least 1000 hours studying.\n\nIf you choose to apply those skills to your job then you also need to make sure you aren't a slave to it, then people can control you and make your life a living hell.  If anyone questions why you're there so late/early, or you login for a lot of time, then you can gently slip in that it's part of your \"professional education\".  Literally use those words.\n\nIf you're Indian or Asian (in those countries) then I would be careful with what you give your boss, they could become abusive.  If it's an American employer then feel free to work for free.  Why? because you're not working for free, you're making yourself look better (job security) and you're progressing your skillset.\n\n  \nThe Key:\n\nDo not think that your devotion to the company will result in that job security or professional progression.  You're using them for education while paying your bills.  Companies will chew you up and spit you out so be careful with how you practice things at work.\n\n  \nThe Middleground:\n\nStudy outside of your job things that will make you useful then either grab tickets you know you can do, or communicate that you want to try this because you've been working on it alone.  Why not just self-study and keep it private? Well a homelab isn't going to teach you how to upgrade pods and update images in a production environment, you can mock something like it, but when your boss is breathing down your neck and crap is running down your leg then you'll be glad you worked in a real env.\n\n  \nThe Takeaway:\n\nTake advantage of having a job and a place where you can see things break live, that's where the money is made, not when everything is running well.\n\nIf you are truly just a curious individual then forget everything I said and protect 20 hours a week to explore whatever you want.  Having a job means you can buy GPUs, electronics, hardware, etc. maybe not the best but something for you to work with.  No one skill will make you permanently secured in your job, no one job will make you automatically rehireable, but constantly learning new things and \"getting a hold of the hammer\", will keep you happily employed.\n\n  \nMe? well I'm unemployed because well...I don't know really...actually I suck at Leetcode and haven't used NodeJs a lot.  However, if you have a job then you're in good standing.",

I had to show my offer letter to confirm the number and had to basically do a review to ‘justify’ it, but not only am I still here, I even switched teams with no issues internally. \n\nThe external offer I received came from a position I was reached out to about on LinkedIn, and I took the interview as practice to make sure I’m on top of my interviewing skills and be on top of any subjects or topics relevant. It was NOT to leave. \n\nHowever, the offer I did end up getting was too good to pass up, and I would have been an idiot to pass on it. I was open about this to my manager - I didn’t want to leave, but I’d be an idiot to say no - and they wanted to keep me enough that they worked with me to get a counter. The counter almost completely matched it, and I’m having a good time where I’m at.\n\nI don’t know if I’m the exception, but hopefully that helps. Honesty paid off here the most for me personally, but just remember that no matter what, you’re taking a risk if you accept the counter offer. I’d be prepared for anything.",

I probably would have learned more. The only issue with that, is that the courses push you further than what you might do on your own. For instance, I'm still learning CS, ML, and math concepts, I'm just not spending 20 hours a week on it.\n\nOne additional point: I already was a PhD dropout when I got my MS CS, so I had research exposure, knew how to make arguments with data, and didn't really need help with research or academic skills, it was really the content that helped the most.",

If a product doesn’t do well but the engineering team did a good job, they will likely be fine, but the pm likely gets fired.  On the other side if a product gets crazy successful, the PM is probably going to advance faster.",

There’s limited real desire and opportunity to get to those levels.\n\nTo be a “true” senior you need to be leading the team and product in all technical aspects, training others, and being “the man” on the team. That requires a lot of dedication, and frankly, down right hours on the keys at the desk that most people aren’t willing to put in.\n\nMost teams will end up with their senior engineers being the longest tenured engineer on the team or someone rotated over from another team who was either a rising “true” senior engineer or more likely: just one of the longer tenured engineers who is backfilling another person’s position. Most engineers with a senior title are mid level engineers who haven’t left.\n\nTo be a “true” staff engineer, you’re doing everything a senior did, but expand that across team’s through your entire department. Now take the hours you invested in your original team to be a senior, and multiply it by number of teams (roughly). That’s way too many hours for most people to want to invest to reach this level. Even after you make it to this level, your desire to stay here might wain and while your titled a staff engineer because you were performing at that role, a few years later you’re essentially a senior again because you don’t want to keep investing the hours.\n\nI quoted “real” everywhere because titles mean different things at different companies and the lower the max TC a  company offers: typically the lower the bar is for a higher title.

If you believe you are experiencing WLB (Keep it to yourself and please do not broadcast your great manager to bad managers) and treat it as just a temporary hallucination that you are experiencing that will fade away soon to those not in the know.\n\nNow with that in mind there are some really great managers in the company that actually do try, keyword being try to establish a real work life balance within reason.  Unless this is being pushed from the L8 and L10 levels it will be very hard to sustain long term by an L7 as they all eventually fold under the executive pressure cooker as they try to make it to L8 themselves.  Only then can they and do they have real power to enforce WLB in their org.\n\nFor yourself you will need to set hard boundaries and never become a yes person for too long or you will be crushed due to taking on more work than you can actually do.  I've seen it happen so many times with the courageous happy faced yes people, then 3-6 months in they are burnt out and depressed because they are way overdue on their projects that they agreed to do and management is holding them hard accountable for it due to work being in motion.  \n\nYou let things slip then you get dinged for bias for action, ownership, and deliver results which massively dings your ratings (max HV1, maybe LE) then if it happens again in the next quarter you are put in focus, pivot, and then your done for.\n\nSo if you want to flip the coin, do it for the work experience.

It is the most widely known MSCS program, because of its great price and typical program ranking. Many recruiters are aware of the lax acceptance rates (reported to be +80%) and that it is essentially a degree mill. There are many folks with near limited CS experience who have taken a couple of cc courses and enrolled within the program with hopes of breaking into the industry, slapping on the school name onto their resumes.\n\nIt is certainly cheap enough for a try, especially when the closest alternative is an overpriced bootcamp. How many GATech MSCS resumes (online part omitted of course) do you think recruiters see nowadays? There are plenty of people straight up spamming applications with GATech MSCS on their resume without even having taken a single course yet.",

        "body": "Hey, I’ve been through similar experiences and have a few opinions to share.\n\n1. You’ll improve code quality on the job. The alternative is to look at more code (open source) but I don’t recommend that unless you’re really passionate about it. Otherwise, it might add more stress. So, just try to criticize and improve your code base at work. Practice articulating what looks good and what looks bad, and why. Experiment with new ideas and you’ll learn faster. There are many signals to look out for in a codebase: does any part of your dev flow slow you down when building new features, are any parts confusing if a new dev were to work on it, do you have to update multiple places in code for a simple feature, etc. If you have few complaints then maybe your structure is solid after all. If you do identify issues, chances are that it’s something someone else ran into and found a solution for, so it’s always worth searching for how others approach things.\n\n2. The only way is to study and to practice. There are tons of online resources. One that I’ve used is GreatFrontEnd, but try googling or searching this sub to find some structured learning resources. Also, ChatGPT is a great tool to ask dumb questions and get good feedback. Chat is also a great tool to ask your exact question : “how do I rebuild my fundamentals in a structured way.”\n\n3. Similar answer: study and practice, using online resources. I’ll bet you know a lot more than you give yourself credit for, but maybe don’t have the language to articulate ideas. Again, you can treat AI tools as a dev buddy: before developing a feature, create your rough design idea and ask Chat for feedback. (Typically this would be done with colleagues, but if you don’t have other devs as resources, AI is a solid tool imo.)\n\n4. I recommend stopping your weed consumption until you feel less anxious about your career. If you can’t cut it out completely, I recommend reserving it for a specific time and in smaller doses, like at night after all responsibilities are done for the day and you’re ready to wind down for bed. This is a nice middle ground because quitting cold turkey can lead to relapse and a negative spiral. Reserving it for night time only is a guilt-free window for you. This way, you’re using weed as a reward rather than a coping mechanism. Just make sure you have a solid and consistent waking schedule. :)\n\n5. This is more life advice than just career advice: we’re human beings with finite time in this life. You’ll never have time for everything so a good skill to learn is time management. With this career revamp you’re working on, write out everything that’s on your mind, and then choose the ones of highest importance (it’s subjective and only you can decide that). For each item that you’ve prioritized and deemed important enough to focus on, break it down into smaller chunks. Rinse and repeat until you have less overwhelming and more actionable tasks. And most importantly, do the tasks! If they’re small enough to complete, it helps you psychologically build momentum. If tasks seem daunting it’s usually because they feel more ambiguous and that’s when our minds resort to coping strategies (like smoking weed or scrolling on your phone). In these cases it’s okay to dive in and try things out until it feels less ambiguous, and from there you can continue the process of identifying and breaking things down into a todo list (aka backlog).\n\nOne last thing, I’d recommend looking into therapy as an additional resource. I know that it can be expensive and might feel useless, but here’s my take on it: it’s not some sort of silver bullet solution to all your problems. If you can consider “cutting down on weed and strengthening my SWE foundation” as a long-term project, then therapy is a great resource to use along the way. It’s similar to what you did here, you posted how you were feeling and some advice and strategies were recommended. But with consistent therapy, each session is like a check-in: here’s what we talked about last time, here’s what I tried, and here’s where I struggled. It’s a continuous, iterative development process, much like how we build good software products!\n\nGood luck, you’ve got this!",

The simplest, hardest, and most effective place to start is to quit weed entirely and start running, or anything you can tolerate that gets your heart rate up.

The whole functional programming paradigm, ES6, components, props, how renders work, Redux - all of it felt like trying to drink from a fire hose. I had anxiety and panic attacks over it. So I want you to know: this transition is genuinely hard, and you're not failing because you're finding it hard.\n\n\nThat perfectionism/ADHD piece your therapist mentioned is huge though. Modern frontend development, especially in complex codebases, IS a constant stream of \"wtf is happening\" moments. Even seniors get lost in deeply nested components with no documentation. The difference is they've built up tolerance for not knowing and can sit in that discomfort longer.\n\n\nAlso, you lost your mentor. That's massive. You went from having someone who understood the codebase to basically being on your own in a system with minimal documentation.\n\n\nThe isolation is probably making everything worse too. Even if you go to the office and those people don't understand your specific codebase - they've been through what you're going through. We all have, even if we don't show it or are too proud to admit it. You could try working from coffee shops sometimes too, just to break up being alone all day.\nFor me, it took 1-2 months of really intense, focused work before things clicked. But what forced me to lock in was when the stakes got really real. That kind of pressure made me focus in a way nothing else does, but it's also not sustainable or healthy long-term.\n\n\nYour manager's job is to help you thrive - you could try being really open with them about needing more structured support after your mentor left. Pair programming helped me a ton - you get to ask questions in real time and it actually makes both people more productive. If you ask your manager or even just another dev to pair with you on some tickets, most people would probably be down. And when you're stuck solo, timebox it - give yourself 30 minutes to struggle, then ask.\n\n\nYou're 9 months in. That's still early. But you also need to be honest with yourself about whether this specific situation is set up for you to succeed.",

I have been called a high performer and even told that I was the SWE that they compared others to in the company.  The company was a private non-tech company in non-tech city.\n\nThe bar was pretty low for entry as we didn't compete for talent hat could get jobs at actual tech companies.  I may have been a \"high performer\" at this company, but realistically I was still a pretty shit SWE with 15 YOE when compared to SWEs at actual tech companies.\n\n> had disagreements with management that ended up costing me my job. \n\nDepending on what the disagreements are management may be in the right.  I lost a job because of \"disagreements\", but it basically came down to I called the out on their shit.  There as a lot of lip service to burnout and shit like that, but nothing every changed because the \"project is too important\".\n\nThe project is so important that we were 15 months late getting FDA approval on the medical devices and still got a company party celebrating the victory.  Never mind there was 0 effort to figure out why were were late as to no repeat mistakes.  It was probably the right decision to just let me go.   \n\nFunny thing was, after the left me go over the next 10 months 5 out of 7 Senior SWEs left along with 2 other midlevel SWEs. \n\n> I am already struggling to get responses since losing my job. I know I need to be prepared to be job searching for 6 months, but other people I talk to that have experience seem to have no problem having recruiters reach out or getting responses/interviews.\n\nIt's a tough market out there and everybody is different.  Maybe you are not marketing your value well on your resume or applying to the wrong jobs.  If you are only looking at top tech companies then you have to expect competition for people working at other top tech companies.\n\nI have also been looking for a new job over the last couple of years and this year I got very few calls to interview from my applications.  I worked on safety critical medical devices for 15 years and have lead teams over that time in addition to being an IC.   I'm basically an embedded application SWE working with mostly c and c++ which is not really what the industry wants.\n\nIt's not even an issue of only wanting remote work as I am more than happy to go into the office, but sadly I cannot just relocate anywhere due to family reasons.  That doesn't mean no relocation, but the city needs to be a place the whole family is in on or people are going to have a bad time.\n\n>So far, I have gotten nothing but 2 rejections (no interview), and 2 ATS rejections from LinkedIn easy apply jobs. I'm not just using easy apply, but maybe something is wrong with my resume?\n\nThat's nothing you have barely started interviewing.\n\n>I'm not just using easy apply, but maybe something is wrong with my resume? \n\nPost your resume in the resume review thread or on resume review subreddits to get feedback.  Things like use STAR and show impact is a common comment.\n\n>Is the job market just that toast right now, even for people that have a little bit of work experience? \n\nCompanies are hiring, but the supply of candidates is large and hiring managers are being selective.  They feel the need a close to perfect fit because if you are not it then somebody else probably is.   \n\n>Is it because its the end of the year and about to be holiday vacation time?\n\nProbably part if it as hiring slows down around the holidays and picks up in the new year.",

        "body": "Yeah, I usually see them as MLOps Engineer or Data Science Engineer, though they can also be listed under more generic AI/ML Engineer, or even occasionally as Data Scientist, depending on the organization. But there's absolutely a career to be made in the space.\n\nCandidly, I find that ML Engineering as we're discussing it isn't really an entry level role, but more something that a software/data engineer or data scientist will lateral into if they have an affinity for it. While as an ops/deployment person you won't need to have the same familiarity with the statistics/math as the data scientists and researchers putting together the initial proofs-of-concept and models, you're going to need enough familiarity to be able to sense check things, collaborate effectively with the research side, and, from time to time, optimize the approach without negatively impacting the model capabilities.\n\nKey skills include traditional software dev, including the usual system design, engineering, testing, etc., with a few other things. For embedded, there's additional nuances around programming on custom boards, signal processing/cleaning, and to some extent hardware tinkering, and for cloud/forecasting stuff, parallelization and distributed computing comes up with some frequency. Some of the more relevant challenges I see day-to-day are around model instrumentation/tracking metrics, managing cloud costs, runtime, and wrangling tech debt that inevitably spawns as the model pipelines keep changing.\n\nI'd personally want to take a software engineer with a few years of experience working in the cloud, or someone who's done some lightweight embedded stuff, and get them up to speed on the ML-relevant side. I could probably take a data scientist and do it, but I've found that most professionals that grow up on that side have pretty terrible programming skills. It's easier to beat data quality and validation into an engineer's head than to get someone up to speed on formal engineering, I find. Though if our nascent ML Engineer is bad at math and logic, their career in ML will probably be pretty short lived.\n\nEdit: For LLMs, I think that there isn't much reason (apart from political organizational reasons) to have ML/DS teams responsible for applied LLM implementations and deployments. You'd think that people who should notionally be familiar with the math would be more clear-eyed on what these models can and can't do, but that doesn't seem to be the case--so in my mind, there isnt't a reason to bother having a data scientist involved in the implementation from a technical standpoint. Any decent engineer should be able to integrate an LLM into the broader system with some thoughtful design and extensive testing.",

Not to mention if you wanted to pick up some tasks in the other tech stack, you always had the option to do so. \n\nOverall though, it's hard to say if just specializing in one platform will be an issue, given how relatively young the mobile field is (what is it, like 15ish years now?). However I do know many devs that have specialized purely in mobile across the last decade and seem to be doing well. It is probably a good idea to branch out eventually into a T-shape skillset though",

And I'd feel silly and hilarious to wear a suit.\n\nThe place was laid back, very informal. We would always go out to lunch together. Occasionally working until late at night during deadline crunch we would share a beer in the office. I learned and grew a lot. Got promoted a couple of times while there. They would sometimes fail to pay our salaries on time, always on the cusp of failure. But I was having fun and it fit my life as a 24yo. I would absolutely hate that place today.\n\nThe second job I'm going to mention is my current one. Healthcare industry related. Chill, remote friendly. Very few meetings. I get to work on my tickets at odd hours, so I can be present for my family. But there is some good engineering happening and opportunity to stay sharp. I've worked at other chill places where after a year or two I felt like I'd have to be very creative to write a single bullet point about that job.",

His first question was always \"how do we prevent this from happening again?\" Not \"why did you mess up?\" That psychological safety was everything.\n\n\nHere's the thing though - the work itself was an absolute shit show. The technology was this custom mess that practically functioned as its own language. Hard to understand, impossible to debug, nightmare to optimize. The product team was perpetually confused, and we were constantly building the wrong thing.\n\n\nBut my team? We were in it together. We kept trying, kept pivoting, and most importantly - we all had each other's backs.\n\n\nI'm at FAANG now and have been for the past 6.5 years, and I'm grateful for it.

Happy hours multiple times a week, great people and made many friends while working hard and learning a lot.\n\nNew favorite is my current job. Tons of perks and events, also in a great part of the city, 15 minute bike commute or 15 minutes by train. Lots of money and bonuses going around, free snacks and meals, smart people, up to date tech, good tools, documentation, and support. We routinely get hockey/basketball/concert tickets in a suite, and people really value the work we do because it makes a positive impact for people. \n\nIt's three days a week in office, but the office is so nice and the bike ride into work is enjoyable so I don't mind going in for a few days. I've even gone in when I didn't have to because the building is so nice. I've made some friends and referred a friend to work with me. It's been a good time.\n\nLast job sucked and I got laid off with 30% of the company. I was able to get severance and had a new job with months of severance left. Their loss.",

Although some interview questions lend themselves to specific architectures, we don't necessarily ask you to design systems with anything in particular, you're supposed to put your best foot forward and design a system that makes sense given the requirements.\n\nPrep guides love to tell you to list FRs and NFRs and put an api gateway in the middle of the fucking diagram etc etc, but you'd be surprised at how frequently people don't actually know what they're talking about beyond the initial keyword vomit. Getting caught bullshitting is an easy way to get disqualified.\n\nI usually ask people to sketch out the system end to end, and then dive deep on some area. Frontend folks sometimes treat the entire backend as a black box, and we focus on frontend things, up to API layer. But not always. There are plenty that can speak backend too, to varying degrees.\n\nOften it depends on the specific requirements for the job. Some teams want a strong frontend expert, others want someone who's more full stack. General bar for us is \"we want a software engineer, not a react dev\". Mind you, also, this is for high pay roles. Other companies with lower pay bands often have easier bars, especially for frontend, whose interviewers tend to not be as strong in full stack, end-to-end system design themselves (not throwing shade at anyone, just my observation from having spent a lot of time in this space).",

If I were to do a personal project, I would build something that I want to build that addresses something I care about - and if other people found it interesting and used it, great, but I would 100% ignore any requests to build stuff that I don't care about, or are too difficult, etc.\n\nThat's what a lot of personal projects are like, and the problem is that most jobs just do not work that way - you don't get to choose the path of most fun and least resistance. \n\nNow, mind you - those personal projects are still good in their own way because they allow you to showcase your more pure technical skill. But from an overall \"how will this person do at this job\", they miss a big chunk of it.\n\nWhen I see someone who built something that was clearly based on a user request with real-world, annoying ass constraints? That's when I'm really interested. \n\nI think an app built for doctors kinda fits that, because that's not a group that is going to use something for unimportant stuff. So if you're going to get users, you're going to have to be able to handle annoying shit that most people don't want to deal with (e.g., HIPPA compliance).",

I'm still testing it. If I were to monetize it, I think I would go with ads that target doctors while i grow it. Single small ads for expensive cancer treatments, devices, conferences, studies etc. I haven't gotten that far yet. \n\nI have a big advantage with her to constantly bounce ideas off and to teach me exactly how this all works and what they need... plus her network of doctors. I'm trying to utilize each angle I have. \n\nI would be looking for a job because, well, why not? I am going to keep on working on this full-time but I can send out applications at the same time.",

Learn Python and Postman at least. I think those will be useful for the foreseeable future. Knowing Java and Jmeter, at least last time I checked, was *really good* in some niche situations if you needed to validate data being put into a SQL database. Like, one of the best tools I've ever found for specifically that, which is weird since it's nominally a load testing tool. It's was also surprisingly easy to write your own plugins. That was a few years ago now, though, so I don't know if anything better has come along in the mean time.\n\n\nKnowing a bit about how http/networking works behind the scenes is also a good idea if you do any appreciable rest or network testing. If you're going to be working with that sort of thing at all you really don't want it to be just a magic black box to you. I don't see networking going anywhere either, since the cloud is a thing. I interviewed a guy for QA one time and while I was talking to him I realized that he had a fantastic amount of knowledge about networking and network protocols. I suggested hiring him based on that and told him later that he was underselling himself on his resume because no one else I'd ever interviewed had ever demonstrated the level of networking know-how that we were just casually chatting about.",

The evidence is these hyper-specific bullets. Be ready to talk in detail about everything you say you have done. It is really easy to tell when someone is talking out their ass about a resume bullet point. If the interviewer is doing their job they will ask you to get specific. Specificity, detail, depth of knowledge.\n\nThe best way to get these bullet points is for every single job sit down for at least thirty minutes and just write every single technology you used and every single thing you did. Be painfully verbose in your listing of things. Once you have that you can go back and create bullets like the first one I showed you.\n\nI would focus on LinkedIn (shocker), Dice, and Indeed. Dice and LinkedIn are where most of my 'in bound prospects' come from in terms of job opportunities. Dice has actually been really great for me.

Your resume will likely get lost in the sea of other applicants. I wish it was not this way. When I was looking for a job when I got laid off earlier this year I was doing 200-300 a day or more. You will find out eventually that most recruiters look at the new job postings Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday so Saturday and Sunday are GREAT days to slam job postings but you need to be ass-in-chair submitting till your fingers fall off every single day. Do as many easy applies as you can stomach then start moving toward the regular job applications. APPLY, APPLY, APPLY. It sucks, it is boring, it is a numbers game. I had 10+ interviews a WEEK for almost a month when I was doing this. It works.\n\nHave two or three references ready to go that you can submit if recruiters or job applications ask for them. Let them know you are applying to a TON of places. It speeds things up if you don't need to ask every single time.\n\nBack to the resume thing. It is a good idea to have 2-3 developer 'archetypes' you want to apply for. I have 'Full Stack Python focus', 'Full Stack TypeScript focus', and 'Full-stack AI infrastructure focus' archetypes ready to go. Then you can go to LinkedIn and type 'TypeScript Software Developer' and crank through applications.\n\nAlso, I like to have at the top of my resume a little blurb that shows what I am:\n\n\"Software Engineer with experience building AWS-native Python applications to automate critical workflows in the insurance industry as well as large-scale video analysis for customer POCs, securing $10K+ MRR deals, and developing a Python-based DAG-driven AI inference engine for deepfake video analysis.\"\n\nThe HR person or whoever is looking for X type of developer and if you can put that in front of them your chance of getting a callback goes way up. Do EVERYTHING you can to show them you are what they want.\n\nOne more thing, on LinkedIn it is a good idea to filter by 'Jobs Posted in the last 24 hours'. I applied to some of those earlier this week and within an hour got a call from a recruiter for one of them. This has happened many times.\n\nThis is how I hunt for jobs, it works for me. It is alot of work but its pretty straightforward once you have the resume and profiles ready to go.\n\n  \nAnd I don't mean to be an ass by bringing this up but I make $150k a year, graduated late 2024 with my CS degree. I landed this job in a tough job market. Or, rather, I created the preconditions of job offers and was ready when they inevitably appeared. You can do this. Employment is an emergent property, like flight.",

The most I've ever made was 90K. It would be amazing if I could find a job making around that same figure. I was hoping my last contract would roll over into a full time position making 160K but it didn't happen. It was with a large telecom client that you've likely heard of, it's a great company to work for but apparently very hard to land a full time position with. So alas I'm back to looking for work.

Also I had a decent amount of overlap with cs students and the IT coursework was pretty easy. Upon graduation I was a SWE for a year before rotating to our Company's DevOps team - which is a great fit with my degree, imo.  \n\nIf you put in effort to specialize your course load to a specific discipline/area (i did a lot of infra, cloud, and programming courses) you can come out ready for junior roles - but often you will find yourself needing to spend extra time and effort specializing your skill set for the specific role you want to fill.",
