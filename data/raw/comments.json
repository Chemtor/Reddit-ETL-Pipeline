Even if you’re not using it day to day in a DE role, you’re likely to encounter something of a systems design interview with at least some of the companies that you’ll interact with where you’ll be asked to describe the system you would have implemented and how you’ll go about scaling it. If anything, having the ability to do this will give you a significant leg up on other candidates.\n\nAnyway… I was previously in similar shoes as yours, and the way I went about prepping for interviews \n\n- picked up a few Raspberry Pi devices, installed Ubuntu \n- installed k3s as a lightweight kubernetes distribution\n- used helm to install Kafka, debezium, spark, minio, Postgres\n- went through some tutorials to wire up a basic data pipeline \n- built out a CDC pipeline from Postgres to debezium, to Kafka which was batch ETL’d via Spark to Hudi tables hosted on minio block storage \n- then hammered the hell out of it with test datasets from Kaggle and similar sources to flex and stress the pipeline, lathered, rinsed, repeated\n\nCould be an unpopular opinion ^^ but food for thought ;)",

Instagram just deprecated their “plays” and “impressions” metrics and replaced them with a new metric called “views”.\n\n“Plays” was already a replacement for an older metric called “video_views”, and “plays” measured initial plays on Reels only. The new “views” metric includes replays. There was another metric deprecated called something like “reels_aggregated_plays” which included replays on Reels and therefore matched the new “views” metric.\n\nAlso new “views” populates for post types that traditionally wouldn’t get “video_views” because they aren’t technically videos: think carousels, images. New “views” are basically “impressions” but they’re higher than impressions for reasons we don’t really understand yet.\n\nFor almost a decade now we’ve been charged with creating cross-platform data sets that measure total video views. How do we do this when the metric you’ve always used for video views no longer exists, and views happen for more than just video? What we’re saying was a video view in March 2025 is not the same as what we’re saying was a video views in May 2025\n\nMy point is: this sucks ass. How are you going to validate these changes and explain the data to stakeholders? It’s great that you’re working with sources with well-defined schemas, but social media platforms do not keep things consistent for long, always introducing and redefining metrics and post types. Keep all the columns.",

We have on-prem data, some data is in Oracle or db2, and my division mostly lives in Synapse.\n\nThe Synapse data is often pulled from those other sources (via Synapse Pipelines or stored procedures), cleaned (usually in SQL, sometimes in pandas), and finally dumped into a table.\n\nNotice - there’s no bronze layer. I think this is the definition of ETL since we transform before we load. I could be wrong.\n\nWhat’s nice about this workflow: it minimizes costs and it reduces cognitive burden since, there’s fewer intermediate tables.\n\nWhat stinks about this workflow: it’s hard to reason about data lineage and there’s little to no audit trail. Where does this variable come from? Have to dig deep in some low level db just to find the source. If a table churns out questionable data, where did the mistake happen? Is it in the transformation logic, or was there some miscommunication with the source table? Again, tricky to understand. \n\nSo while having a dumping ground for raw  data seems redundant and can introduce extra expenses, sometimes it’s worth it. I believe that pattern is called ELT, since you load the ugly raw data into a new source system before cleaning it.\n\nAnother benefit of the bronze layer or ELT approach is that it can reduce the number of ad hoc queries against the low level transactional database, which slows everything down. And having the raw data under the same roof as your data warehouse’s clean data, again, opens up new forms of exploratory analysis.\n\nA nice compromise, instead of having permanent intermediate tables, is to have trunc and load tables that are refreshed at regular intervals. That way the data doesn’t eat up so many costs, but there’s still an audit trail for testing and observing data lineage.",

The reason is not so much the pleasure of starting a new project with them or the time it saves when starting. It is rather the ease of on-boarding a new member into an established tool, instead of spending months training the person to a highly specific home-cooked solution.  I am also speaking from experience of being on-boarded into this kind of home-made complex ETL.\n\nScala had some history as a DE language because Apache Spark main UI used to be its Scala API. Then it introduced a Python API with similar performance, so the complexity of Scala could not be justified, and the language is globally dying for all its niche use cases, as far as I know.\n\nSo for me, it's not really a question of language, Python and SQL are consensual kings and here to stay.

Real world data doesn’t always have nice structure to code up as some nice fixed schema and you still need to be able to handle it.\n\nThat said certainly there is a move within Python to use pydantic as the core serialization and deserialization system that builds basically better data class objects.

        "body": "I was a software engineer for nearly 15 years. Worked in mobile, desktop, web development. I write network and security automation stuff for fun. My final role as a software engineer was a team lead in an insurance company. We had legacy C# desktop stuff, legacy web stuff (ASP.NET/PHP/ColdFusion), and more modern web stuff for the time (ASP.NET + Angular). I still used to write a lot of data engineering-like tasks in this job - financial services, so tons of integrating with SFTP servers and writing/ingesting XML everywhere. Heavy SQL Server stuff underpinned all of this, which is how I ended up in data.  \n  \nMy track in data was BI developer -> data engineer in wealth mgmt (Python/BigQuery/dbt) -> data consultant (Azure/Databricks/Synapse) -> tech lead in retail (Python/BigQuery/dbt) -> senior engineer in security for retail org (Python/BigQuery/dbt for analytics, Splunk for SIEM + security automation).  \n  \nI am a very code-heavy data engineer. Everything I do is in code except for dashboards, which I wish I could change. Regardless - and I get downvoted into oblivion here a lot for saying this - I don't view data engineering as anything close to software engineering. The needs, requirements, and use cases are all entirely different. Your average software engineer will fail even the most basic data modelling task these days. Most don't know SQL or even touch a database directly. Your average data engineer will struggle with anything beyond a basic CRUD app. They are different specialties and the code for data pipelines is simpler by many orders of magnitude. I have watched this time and time again with data engineers thinking they can just switch between the two. I even think if I tried to go back to my old ways in the C# ecosystem I would have a really hard time (forgetting that I'm about 10 years older now...)  \n  \nAny pivot is possible, but keep in mind it will take a long time. It took me something like five years to fully move to data engineering after a complete reskill, and that was still with my prior SQL history. I was just lucky that I had all the soft skills in my back pocket so I could get promoted easily. re: stakeholder stuff, I've always had to do things and figure out requirements on my own, so I think you need to develop that part of your brain a bit.",

In that meaning I think that data engineering is a subset of a software engineer, you need to know which SWE tools you should focus to solve your specific problem. That is the same for any engineer such as a front-end, back-end, computer graphics or embedded devices.\n\nPersonally having experience as both for me makes me able to talk with any kind of engineer to understand how data is generated and how it can be integrated in any part of a system (from internal data generation until front-end). \n\nOf course each company has a different concept of the same role. In this case I believe that what your company takes in consideration for a DE doesn't align with what you are expecting for your career.",

The part the DE is mosty bind to will heavily influence its work taks. \n\nThat parts are:\n- Ingestion of data: could be low code and config driven. This part has a lot of SWE potential if not low code especially if your company has its own ingestion framework.\n- transformations - depends how and data is transformed, if by some declarative way like sql then the role feels like analytic engineering more. If transformed in python, then also depends how custom is the transformation framework. The more custom the more SWE. Here also a lot of data analytics and modeling.\n- Serving data’s - same as ingestion\n- infra - more dev ops\n- security …\n\nSo to sum it up: data engineering is very broad discipline. Depending on the size of project, your role in it and how your company treats data engineering - the role could feel much different.",

Using Python, for instance, lets you make use of many different tools that work well together, it will let you take an imperative approach to calculating things, and you'll be able to easily write output data to files and review them using csv/jsonl/parquet formats.\n\nYou would also be able to set up long running processes to be done incrementally. Say you create a list of all systems 'A' to calculate the distance to all other systems 'B' - if this would take a long time, you can store a table with which 'A' systems have been done. Then your imperative program can just find the next 'A' system to calculate, and do the calculations for that. This sort of chunking might make processing more resilient to timeouts or memory issues.\n\n> if making multiple smaller tables with a few columns (5-10) or a single one with all columns (30-40) would be best\n\nIf you land on columnar storage like parquet, or duckdb's internal storage, then it doesn't matter how many columns you have. Their data layout means that all the data for a column is stored together, so it can completely skip over columns you don't need. The general tradeoff with columnar systems is they often make it a bit slower to pick out individual values. So if your main way of using the data is to grab out the data for a specific system, this isn't as efficient.\n\nIf you have a row-based store then you might be better served with multiple tables if you can organise columns into groups that are often used together. For example if coordinates aren't often used in conjuction with other columns, but you want to do a lot of work comparing coordinates, then you could split that off to its own table. If all the tables share the same primary key, and you make sure they are all indexed the same, it should be fine to perform joins between these tables. This is likely a relatively small optimisation, since it really just makes disk reads a bit more efficient.\n\n> The best database option that would basically be read only...\n\nThis mostly means that something based on columnar-storage will be fine. You aren't updating rows, so you don't need anything transactional. It doesn't preclude row-based systems either, so essentially everything is open to you.\n\nIf postgres is working for you, just keep it in there. That's fine.\n\nSQLite probably won't work - it doesn't have a compressed format, and you'll likely run into issues with the large data volume relative to disk size.\n\nIf most of what you are doing is running through lots of data at once, then you could convert the tables to parquet files and query with something like DuckDB, Polars, or Daft. Each of those also make it easier to script with python and exchange data from an sql processing model to an imperative one in python. Daft may have a benefit that it has a built-in method to spread execution to multiple processes on your machine, so if something goes oom it can recover and retry, and can spill intermediate steps to disk.\n\nOr, as others have mentioned, you could add an extension for duckdb to get data via postgres.\n\n---\n\nIn general, I'd leave things in postgres for now and see if you can point things like DuckDB at it, and see how their processing model works for you. Polars [can connect to a database](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/api/polars.read_database.html) and [so can Daft](https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/stable/integrations/sql/). If you're going to hit OOM issues it will happen in this processing step regardless of how the data is stored, so if you try out a few different processing engines working off of the existing postgres data, you might find what works for you.\n\nIf any of these tools work for you, then you might consider shifting the data to parquet format as it may be smaller to store and more efficient to read. Every one of these can write data out to parquet ([duckdb](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/guides/file_formats/parquet_export.html), [polars](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/api/polars.LazyFrame.sink_parquet.html), [daft](https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/stable/api/dataframe/#daft.DataFrame.write_parquet).",

You could export and compress with parquet although I'm not sure it'll be any smaller than PG's internal storage compression.\n\n[https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/guides/performance/how\\_to\\_tune\\_workloads.html](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/guides/performance/how_to_tune_workloads.html)\n\nDuckDB supports spilling to disk but I think the internal data structures and access methods an In Memory Database like Duck or SQLite uses is very different from a disk based database that also has a memory buffer pool in RAM. Postgres for sure is one of those, but for your use case you'd want an Analytic (OLAP) Database so you could use Clickhouse.\n\nDoing rankings is a typical analytic task with a window function. Establishing relationships, the full table scan part is just part and parcel of what a traditional database does but you going in and actually mapping the relationships you could use a CTE. Better yet would be something like dbt (data build tool).\n\nNow I'm not saying you'll be accessing all 225G's at once in which case *maybe*  you won't hit your 32G of system memory limit. I'm not sure queries you do plan on running. But to be on the safe side just use a traditional analytic server like Clickhouse and if it turns out that the queries you end up running don't have huge joins or aren't working with tables that are 60gigs at a time in size then you can just use DuckDB.\n\nEdit: How you end up modeling this data and what queries you run against it might be a separate issue. I think the baseline technical aspect is to get you up and running. \n\nActually one thing I hadn't considered is you can just keep running everything in Postgres since it's already in it, and then use DuckDB with the postgres extension known as pg\\_duck\n\n[https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/postgres.html](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/postgres.html)",

Or it is because the Hash table will still remain so big after only selecting the needed keys that it will through a OOM?",

However, it can be a bit clunky with dynamic DAG generation, and the setup might feel overkill for lighter tasks.  Dagster shines with its focus on data assets and dependency management, which can be super handy with dynamic generation per user. Its built-in observability tools are really neat too, but some might find its approach a shift from traditional practices. Prefect offers dynamic task generation with a simple and Pythonic API, which can make it appealing for ease of use and quick iterations. It’s really intuitive for developers and scales well too.\n\nFor integration with your sources, DreamFactory could simplify API generation for RESTful endpoints, while tools like Stitch or Fivetran might handle the replication aspects you need. Ultimately, pick the framework that aligns best with your team’s skill set and project growth trajectory.",

I've put out a ton of resumes and received a lot of rejections. However I have a few things brewing and suspect one will land within the next few weeks 🤞 \n\nI do want to work for as long as I can. I think there will be opportunities where I can find something where I can teach or take a lower paying, less stressful position.",

The docs had to be reviewed, edited, and approved by peers and it was a lot of exploring theoretical alternatives and waiting for feedback.",

I was a bit uncertain when I first started applying for DE roles and most of them were no joke, job requirements I couldn't have handled 6 or 7 years ago.

The biggest problem I had like this was cleaning addresses around the world. There were about 400 million of them. They were almost always manually input, inconsistent and had tons of dupicates and semi-duplicates. In addition to that fun, the rules that constituted a \"good\" address changed from country to country. The acid test for the US was the addresses in Atlanta, GA. There are dozens of valid variations of Peachtree. Some countries, such as Switzerland, had the individual/company as part of a valid address. This didn't even begin to address misspellings and incorrect abbreviations.\n\nIt is solvable and straightforward but not easy. You have to use different techniques for different problems in the data set. Sometimes a lookup against existing data is needed. Sometimes it is a correction table. \n\nIn this case, it required brut force data cleansing using SQL (so I could treat things as sets and get some performance). I was able to run through the entire set in about 25 minutes. Once the bulk of the data was cleansed, I started using the Google mapping API on the front end to validate addresses. This started making the problem a bit better.",

If I pass through bad data (even with the best intentions), I'm still accountable for that error.\n\nNow, for the person entering data, \"they\" are accountable for entering data correctly.

And I'm not talking about data that needs to be cleaned up, I'm talking about actually just incorrect data.\n\nBy reframing the problem around accountability, I've had decent success in getting people in large, medium, small, and even in academic (which tend to be the worst lol) settings to understand that if they want good data products, there is no magic sauce I can sprinkle on incorrect data to make it work.",

A movie will always have been produced in the same season, have the same category, director or whatever.  If you wanted to represent movie revenue in your fact by region, then you would have a separate dimension for region as the same title would have several records in the fact with different regions and different revenue amounts.  \n\nHigh level looking at this I think you have a fact table, date dimension, title dimension and actor dimension with a bridge.  Might be a bit more complex if I thought through it, but looks pretty simple.",

There's a email address at the bottom of the post, or I can ask around :).\n\n[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sql/introducing-change-event-streaming-join-the-azure-sql-database-private-preview-for-change-data-streaming/](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sql/introducing-change-event-streaming-join-the-azure-sql-database-private-preview-for-change-data-streaming/) \n\n\n\n2) Fabric Mirroring\n\nThis is a turn-key \"it just works\" native solution for SQL Server to Parquet in near-real-time - but it has one constraint that may be a non-starter for you - it can replicate to OneLake (which implements ADLS / Azure Blob Storage API), not S3. \n\nFrom there, you could use whatever ADLS-compatible tooling (including Databricks, Snowflake, Microsoft Fabric, et cetera) you like for further OLAP and reporting needs.\n\nAnnounced here [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/blog/2025/01/15/the-year-ahead-for-sql-server-ground-to-cloud-to-fabric/](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/blog/2025/01/15/the-year-ahead-for-sql-server-ground-to-cloud-to-fabric/)\n\nShould be quite similar to [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/database/mirrored-database/azure-sql-database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/database/mirrored-database/azure-sql-database) but for SQL Server 2025.\n\nOneLake also supports \"Shortcuts\" to translate between Storage APIs and avoid you having to move all your existing data; but I'm a bit fuzzy off the top of my head whether writes **to** S3 are supported ( [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/create-s3-shortcut](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/create-s3-shortcut) ) - OneLake is not my area of expertise, especially around the Shortcuts side of things.\n\n  \nDunno if you'll find either of those helpful - depends on if you are willing to upgrade to SQL Server 2025 and your exact requirements - but I thought I'd share in case you weren't aware. \n\nDisclosure: I work at Microsoft on Fabric Warehouse.

Airbyte is not a scalable solution especially for high volume database; whereas Fivetran gets expensive real fast.  \n  \nCustom Python / AWS Glue – definitely an option, but as you mentioned, can become a huge maintenance burden.

One example is my company [Artie](http://www.artie.com/), which focuses on log-based replication from transactional DBs like SQL Server into cloud storage with minimal setup.  \n  \nHope this helps!",

Ideally you can do it within your current role by putting your hand up to do those boring businessey meetings engineers hate, and get to talking at a strategic level to decision makers about what data engineering can do for them: so salesey, relationship management work.\n\nAnother option to step out of tech but not starting over are things like scrum master, product owner, etc., where the work is mostly people but your grounding in the processes of delivering data and software will give you a head start.\n\nAnd also, consider whether it's the field you're in or just your job or company. In larger orgs you get pure data engineers who turn specs into code and bugs into fixes, but in smaller orgs data people tend to have to wear more hats so have more direct contact with the business instead of relying on BAs or similar to deliver specs to you.",

Something you're likely to discover when you go and do something else is how hard it can be outside of IT.\n\nIf you can live without the money, then it's a no brainer - go and do something you love.  Doesn't matter what it is.\n\nAs other people have mentioned, moving into sideways moves where you're something like a Project Manager, working in sales or Business Development are all viable alternatives as there might be a pay cut but not massively.\n\nI worked in a field I hated for 10 years.  I just didn't know I hated it.  I always recommend for anybody who has worked in IT and gotten used to basically hating their job for money, go and do something you love.  Just once to see what it's like.  You never know and might find that not being miserable most days is more important than having a massive house or a yacht.",

I've already got a comparison matrix started, I'll make a point to add more of the long-term costs in there as those do get overlooked/hidden in the \"just write some python\" version of things.  Mainly because that means I do it and nobody else feels the pain lol.\n\nIf you were going from azure sql to azure sql and just wanted to handle the data copy/replication side of things so you could work in dbt from thereafter, is there a favored tool or approach you'd use if you had \\~50 databases each with \\~200 tables?  All of which are *mostly* identical in schema, but not totally?   Our group is pretty good in dbt and managing CI/CD with it.    \n  \nBut handling the replication is what's slowing me down on this project, and all these expensive tools do a lot more than replication, so in a way we don't really need all that functionality if we are cool with dbt (or maybe eventually sqlmesh but IMO it's not quite mature enough yet to where I want to use it at large scale, but maybe that's being overly conservative).  \n\nWhere I've landed for teh \"built it\" version is a data factory pipeline where we try to parameterize as much as we can so it can be deployed.  But I'm also kind of attracted to standing up open source airbyte, building out the replication for one database, exporting to json, then parameterizing that and using a github action to deploy wider.

In cell-based architecture, we develop various products and services in these cells that contain a grouping of cloud-based resources. It's not uncommon to have one of those cloud-based resources be a database or storage like an S3 bucket or blob storage depending on your cloud provider. With proper isolation in the cloud, you may have a database per environment, which leaves production having production data and dev with no data.\n\nHowever, depending how you use the data in said database, which you didn't provide, will give you the key to handling that missing data in dev. For example, if you developed an AWS Lambda Function that needs to connect to that database, read in data, do something with it, then write it somewhere else, then you don't really need production data to test that. You can mock database connection and data to test the AWS Lambda Function code without production data or the live database connection.\n\nThat being said, if you're testing things like canned reports, dashboards or even ML process, then you just need to look into generating dummy data or completely anonymizing the data much like they do in healthcare. What you **SHOULD NOT DO** is bring over production data into the lower environments because you should treat everything below production as **UNSECURED ENVIRONMENTS**. The reason for that is because until it hits production, everything should be in test mode. The exception may be hot fixes if you branch those off production and staging environments depending on your branching strategies.\n\nI say this because while YOUR PRODUCTION DATA may not be sensitive, it's just good practice not to open that can of worms incase sensitive data does accidently spill over because you already opened the door.",

They often have real-world examples and discussions that can highlight common gotchas and pain points. Also, check out some case studies or blog posts from folks who have already made the switch to these systems. That should give you a good sense of what to expect.\n\nGood luck with your POC! 🚀",

This is also why I feel somewhat responsible for not being able to live up to my manager’s expectations within 3 months of my hire. You’re also absolutely right about how it is a reckless move to quit when I do not have a job lined up. At the moment the product itself is heavily related to the rest of the data related work at the company, and my manager’s perspective is for me to fully understand the product before having me work on the data side of things more. Hence, it seems inevitable that I lean more towards the PO side of things before I can take on more DE related work. (Also the product itself would not operate without me helping as the PO who has been working on the product for 3+ years isn’t capable of running it well which is also why external vendors were involved in supporting the product. However, they are leaving fairly soon so I’ll be tasked with more of the management of the product). The job I am currently doing does not truly align with the description I was hired for, but I am also coming to understand that this might be the case for teams operating with few members.",

After your advice and the one provided before, I now realize that maybe the best way to approach this is to absorb all PO related tasks as much as I can in the next month or so so I can start to shift my focus on DE related tasks. \n\nI have previously pointed out to my manager that the onboarding process does not seem sufficient. Although they’ve implemented a few more training sessions for newer employees, it still does not seem sufficient. My manager and my colleagues have also pointed out that people are overworked and despite some being in a higher position than myself, it isn’t in their interest/responsibility to manage how other people work nor teach, so they seem reluctant to offer me much support (which I can kind of understand given that they are already struggling themselves). \n\nI think the biggest hurdle for me now is to organize the disorder in the team right now and to really know where to start, given how little I know compared to everyone else (which makes me think how much I can actually transform and organize the team and project). \n\nMoreover, despite the disorder I feel working in my team, other department heads/teams see my team as prestigious and hardworking with lots of intelligent and highly qualified employees, so I feel like the black sheep, feeling a constant pressure to succeed, output and at risk for being fired.\n\nHowever, your advice has given me solace. Thank you so much. I will just do the best I can while hired and see where things go.",

Heck, single enterprise SSDs can be a lot bigger than that these days.  \nBut it depends on how much compute you need to do. Also depends on the size of your host / VM / whatever. But a modern mid to high end server can have hundreds of cores and hundreds of GB of RAM and dozens of TB of storage. I generated a certain well-known benchmark dataset at 100TB scale on a single VM once, only took like a day or two with brute force and ignorance. Granted, that VM was either one of the insane Msv2 Azure VMs, or maybe a Standard\\_D96ds\\_v5, been a while. And those don't come cheap if you don't work for the cloud :D .\n\nYou still do have to think about multi-threading or multi-processing here - but can maybe avoid networking.\n\nB) You could try to adapt Spark APIs to SLURM.\n\nIt's by no means an *easy* thing to do. And I'm not sure if it'd make sense at your scale or not. But very similar has been done before:\n\n[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NSDI19\\_paper159\\_CR.pdf](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NSDI19_paper159_CR.pdf)\n\n[https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p3148-jindal.pdf](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p3148-jindal.pdf)\n\nC) I also came across this from Princeton - might be worth asking them how they do it (unless that's your current institution :D )? I don't see any *horrific* bash scripts in sight, but I do see an independent cluster being set up as you put it, I think.\n\n[https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/knowledge-base/spark#Before-You-Turn-to-Spark](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/knowledge-base/spark#Before-You-Turn-to-Spark)\n\nThey also call out a few other tools (that I'm not personally very familiar with) like Modin.\n\nD) You could wrap your rust tools in a Python API using PyO3 if ease of use of those tools is a major problem?\n\n[https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3)\n\nE) Polars, perhaps? Have heard good things, but haven't used it myself. It's a query engine written in Rust. Would potentially mean you have to write less to build your tools.",

It would 'relatively' easy to make a python library à la [dask\\_jobqueue](https://jobqueue.dask.org/en/latest/) for spark on slurm if we stick to the very basics of what we need (no adaptive clusters, no support for any other schedulers, no fancy anything, just support for initializing workers and master)\n\n\n\nC is also very relevant.

Pick popular one that may sense: Java, Python, javascript, C#.\n\nAnd each ecosystem is strong for some stuff and bad at others. C++ first strength isn't to code web applications for example. Java or python will not work that well for real time code. You don't write big industrial app in python...\n\nI don't think you need a portfolio and most of the time professional experience is valued much more than personal projects. Honestly even as beginner 1-2 internship are much more valuable than any portfolio. Once you have a bit of XP, the XP matters much more.\n\nYou could almost always find solutions to most problem with the right Google search. Now it is just asking your preferred AI. Learn how to use these tools, really. Sure internal stuff you may have no choice, but in many case the info is just here.\n\nMany company will ask you to code something for interview and will ask technical/architectural questions.

Github is just one of many tools that harness the power of Git. You can practice using Git directly on your own machine without using any other tool (and without even using code) if you want. You can just use a text file and practice committing and merging changes to the text via git.\n\nThe basics are, essentially: You have a code base. You want to make one or many changes to that code base, but you want to keep the current state intact so you dont lose your functionality. You create a branch, which is an exact copy of that same code base. You make your changes to the branch. You test the branch. If it's a failure, it doesn't matter because the \"main\" branch hasn't been modified yet. When you get it to work properly, you merge your branch into the main branch. Now your main branch reflects the changes you've made. Repeat. \n\nIt gets a little more complicated when you've got many people working on many branches at a time, which is when the pull requests and reviews come into play. That stuff exists so that someone who is familiar with the code base can be a second set of eyes, check your work, make sure there aren't conflicts with other people's work, etc. The whole construct exists so there is an easy way to do parallel development work on the same code base without actually changing the working code before the changes have been tested and reviewed.",

        "body": "I think when trying to learn it often ends up sounding more confusing than it actually is as a concept. Obviously there are layers and layers of complexity but at first I would try to understand at its core what it is. \n\nImagine there’s a massive library of handwritten books and your team need to make various amendments to different ones. Someone has written a list of requirements for you. \n\nYour team divides up the tasks. Your first task is to remove any mentions of parrots from “My Life as a Hamster (1974)” - don’t ask why. Better not to ask too many questions in this team. \n\nTo do that, you check out the single book (My life  as a hamster) from the library and tell everyone else you’re doing it for transparency. \n\nYou do your stuff. \n\nNow you could just go and pop the book back on the shelf as you’ve finished but what if you’ve made a mistake? Instead you put it in a little box for “review” and your other team mates can have a look and check they’re happy with your work. Once they are, it goes back in to the library. Yours is now the correct version for that book. \n\nOf course you don’t want to shut down the entire library while you do your job which is why this strategy of checking one book out, making changes, getting it reviewed and putting it back in works well. \n\nEveryone can be doing different tasks at the same time. The library itself remains central and “pure” - hopefully with your robust review box, no mistakes are getting in. The library is a single point of truth - everything in there has been approved and checked and is correct. Any mistakes are picked up in review. \n\nNow instead of a library, as a developer, what you’re working on is digital. \n\nIt means that people are working on all different books (files). Sometimes people might even be working on the same book but doing a different task. While you’re doing your hamster task, someone else is updating page numbers in all rodent books including your hamster one. \n\nSometimes this can cause a bit of confusion if you make changes to the same page but luckily Git gives you a nice simple (ish) way to fix these and decide which changes to keep when there’s  such a conflict.\n\nMost importantly, to reiterate, despite all these complicated changes all happening at once, the library itself is pure and “correct” - because people cannot make changes and put the book back. They need check out books, make changes, then put it into the review box (make a pull request) and others in the team must approve it before it goes back in (gets merged in) to the library. \n\nIt may help, moving away from the library analogy, to imagine the alternative. Imagine word documents named version1, version2 etc. imagine everyone trying to change it at once. Everyone saves their own local copy. But someone else has changed the same bit you were going to. Whose bit goes in? Soon nobody has any idea which version is the right one. People are no longer copying the original. - they  are copying version 17. But oh wait, while you were doing something, version 18 became available and now all those changes aren’t in yours.",

You’re trying to train your brain to think in abstractions, understand decomposition, generalization, managing complexity, logic, and structure. That’s what CS is for. That’s what good teaching is for. And no, you don’t need to build the next Minecraft, in fact trying to do that too early is gonna confuse you more.\n\nOn the other hand, if you really want to build something, being a app, a game or wathever, then code becomes the tool but not the subject. You’ll learn plenty by doing, that's for sure, but your brain is focused on making it work, not on understanding the system. The trap is thinking the second automatically teaches the first. Sometimes it does, with enough reflection. But often, it builds habits that are hard to unlearn later.\nIf you want to learn programming, keep it small, controlled, and concept-driven. Then build up.

Using a ternary lets you keep a block of all your property assignments that’s likely to fit on your screen and be easier to read and check off against a mapping spec. \n\nIn normal coding, I prefer if statements. The style should make the pattern obvious while skimming a thousand lines of unfamiliar code base.

It keeps the entire thing on one line just so that things don't look as messy and cluttered, and the presence of the operator itself tells you that we have a 1-liner going on here.\n\nIn other languages that don't have them, I still tend to prefer the 1-liner for the same reasons, but I also just feel weird about it because it's not as immediately apparently what's going on. I'll use some Free Pascal as an example, because that is unfortunately my favorite language to work with.\n\n  \nIn C/C++\n\n    // no ternary\n    if (X > Y) {\n      return X;\n    } else {\n      return Y;\n    }\n    \n    // ternary\n    return (X > Y) ?

In FPC and other language that don't have one, it's only very slightly more effort to figure out what's going on, but it still kinda rubs me the wrong way and I might want to just use the whole if..else block to make the intention more clear.\n\nAll that being said, it's basically all inconsequential and up to personal preference.

I know a software project is never technically finished, there's always something new to add, but you should at least be getting projects to a usable state. Like if you were going to release the project as a product, it should do what you set out to do. If you want this to be a career, you need to start seeing things through, even if you don't feel motivated to do it in that moment. Just commit and finish some of these projects.",

Reading code written by better, more experienced engineers is a good way to understand some of the things you might be doing wrong or ways you could be doing things better. There's plenty on Github. Look for well-known libraries and tools in your chosen stack and just browse the code. You're not trying to understand all of it. Just dive in some place that looks interesting and read through, see how they approach things, style, format, design. \n\nNovelists don't become novelists without reading other people's novels.

Looked it up and realized the rules are simple enough to program.\n\n I did it first following a object oriented approach with each cell being it's own class. Then I did it again using only functional programming. Then I asked chatgpt to make the most efficient version that IT could and got a version using vectorization and running at least 100x faster than my implementation. \n\nThat led to reading about what vectorization is and how to utilize it effectively, it wasn't even a tool in my toolbox until then but now that will stick with me. Learned about SIMD (same instruction multiple data) and how python as an interpreted language works with compilation to byte-code and finally being ran by the cpython virtual machine, as well as how using numpy and vectorization drastically reduced the compilation step as numpy uses precompiled C/Fortran subroutines. All because I just heard something not useful, but interesting and wanted to give it a shot because why not.",

Tutorials are holding your hand so that you don't get lost in kindergarden.  \n\n> Any advice to stay on track without getting overwhelmed?   \n\nFollow a curriculum. Find the curriculum of what you want to learn on a university website. Find ressources to learn the topics (if they give the books used for the courses, buy them and study them). Ace the ressources (my goal was to absorb 100% of the content of those ressources. I deemed acceptable if I ended above 90%, with the last 10% me having understood the concept but maybe lacking excellent execution).  \n\n> without getting overwhelmed?  \n\nYou will get overwhelmed. It's normal. Learn to deal with that. You'll need discipline to stay on schedule (yes, build a schedule for your learning path), and a schedule slow enough so that you can consistently be 1 week ahead in case you stumble onto something difficult that requires 1 full week of research and work to grasp. It will happen.  \n\nSource: I did self-teach maths, statistics, and a bit of programming up to bachelor level (I think it's that equivalent in the US, 3 years into college), and managed to get accepted in a master's degree. This way I only did 2 years of university to get a master's degree worth on the job market + network from the university.  \nYes, I'm not fully self-taught, people may dismiss my experience as \"basically not self-taught\" if they want, but at least I'm transparent.  \n\nJust to add, going the self-taught route is much harder than going the university route. I did that because I couldn't afford to stop working for 5 years to get back into the job market with a decent job and I was super motivated.",

You need to learn by doing projects because projects by definition have an end. Tutorial Hell is like open world games, you can just keep going. \n\n1. What I did was to set myself projects which interested me that we adjacent to the kind of tasks I'd be doing in a job. In my case it was an analysing books to understand the relationships between characters. I also had other ideas around web-scraping for data journalism type use cases. \n\n Rabbit-holes are great and you should dive into them, but having a project tethers you to what you're trying to achieve and you can drag yourself back because you start to feel guilty that you've not made progress. If your goal is undefined \"I'm going to learn\" that mindset will encourage you to keep going deeper. For example, in my case I spent time working out how to get data into pandas, but I also went down some rabbit-holes of anonymous functions and different file formats which were good to know, but not directly applicable. I didn't get into what's possible to do in numpy because my motivation was to get my project done, not to learn learn learn. \n\n1. Same answer as the other two. \"Do projects.\" 99.9% of programming is going to fall outside of your project's scope, so it naturally limits you to a domain that should be manageable. If it doesn't, then the programming mindset of continually breaking down the problem until you have something you can solve or you can research how to solve it will get you the rest of the way.",

Even as a professional its question of months). Other than that, I think everything else is fairly okay at documentation.

If you are interested in higher lever low level (like userspace Assembly or OSDev) then just go with your regular x64. Both Linux and Windows works. If you have no clue what you are doing, Windows might be harder for beginners.\n\nEdit: the H7 actually doesnt have a dual cortex dev board that's below 300 dollars iirc. Its a shame. Lower end H7s do. I would really appreciate if someone would make one for the higher end H7s that does not have all the fancy things EVAL has.",

        "body": "First JavaScript and web development is because JavaScript is the only language that runs in the web browser.  If all the web browsers supported LUA or some new language, then maybe JavaScript wouldn't be he language of choice. Additionally you could argue that TypeScript is the web development language, but it's compilation phase turns it into JavaScript...so is it TypeScript or JavaScript?\n\nI suspect Java and Android is because Java existed, was free, and android needed some language for programmers to develop in.  Also JAVA is nice in that it really hides the hardware/OS from the development process.  You can develop a JAVA app on Windows, Linux, MacOS and be reasonable certain it will run in the Android OS.\n\nI would ague against C++ as the king of the OS, C is more the king of the OS development.  Mostly because all the popular OSes were developed when C++ had more overhead and ran slower, so writing the code in C avoided those issues.  You really don't want your OS to be slowing you down.  \n\nThe Linux Kernel for example is all C and now Rust maybe, I'm not sure.  I suspect Windows is all C.  These days C/C++/Rust are good because they compile down to native CPU instructions so your program has the least amount of overhead.  There is a cost however, in that you have to handle idiosyncrasies between hardware and OSes yourself.  This may be as simple as just compiling for that hardware, but can have other issues.\n\nC# and games I have no comments on.  My guess would be time to market, some programming languages let you produce code faster with fewer bugs, the code may not run as fast as code written in another language, but as long as it runs \"fast enough\" then people will buy it, the company will make money, and the developers will get paid, so everyone is happy.",

You have the enshrined problem (this language is used for this field, so all the tools use that language, and at some point its hard to 'break in' with another language to do the same thing, even if it would be great for it).  You have the 'no can do' problems, like java has a ton of things it simply will not do without arm twisting and work arounds, like operator overloading.  Not a big deal you say?  Consider some linear algebra: AX=B.  In C++, that could look like B = A\\*X;  In java that has to look like B.assign(A.multiply(X));  Now imagine an equation with 5 or 6 pieces in it written the java way... it looks nothing like the math and is hard to write, hard to read, and hard to maintain.   There are several other key things java does not directly support that make it frustrating to use for some tasks, including a bizarre workaround just to have an unsigned int.   Java has nice stuff too, though: it works pretty cleanly on various OS without the frustration that some C++ projects can present when porting.   \n\nC# is tied heavily to windows, and windows has 'won' the gaming audience by and large.  Less so today, but like the enshrined problem with languages, gaming is enshrined in windows very heavily (compared to other desktop OS).  Between that and game engine support and native OS tie in, it has a leg up right away.  Then you add in the pointers and other support that push it towards C++ and away from java's rigid approach, and its performance, you start to see why it pulled into the gaming industry.  Java got (and deserved) a bad rep early on for being slow, and while that has been fixed in a broad sense, it still suffers from the rep and the reality (it still isn't as fast as c++ when push comes to shove). \n\nSo to sort of try to answer.. its a mix of the language's performance, tools, design, and so on alongside an almost 'social' problem of getting a foothold in an area that is already dominated by something else.  New languages come and go, but the ones that stick and are used heavily in any field get there by being better than what was used before.  Python is kind of an oddball there, as its niche is being easy to use for hobby programmers, which is an area that has grown huge (everyone wants a little knowledge now) in the last 20 years or so.  In the 80s and 90s, most people were happy if they could use a word processor without too much work.",

        "body": "You not only need to \"learn programming\". Learning a programming language is like 1% of what you need to learn. The most important aspect you have to acquire is thinking like a dev. Problem solving skills above all else. Languages are the easy part, especially these days where like 70% of the main languages follow the same syntax and if you're able to use one, you'll get used to another one in a few days (OOP related). Besides that, most jobs not only ask for a language, but a specific set of technologies such as Docker + Kubernetes + GCP + Java + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL. Learning development isn't learning a language, it's learning to solve problems. How you solve those and which tools you use is another topic and most of the time you can choose between multiple tools to solve the same task. Another - in my opinion - important aspect is that you need to be able to explain complex tech heavy topics as simple as possible without using the word \"code\" once. Many companies work in agile environment with different products, roles and departments and you'll have a lot of meetings where you have to explain what you did in simple terms so that every PO understands it. In your case, you should first find out what you're lacking the most, which will probably be problem solving skills as it is for most devs. If you have not even build a single private project yourself once,  it's very unlikely that you're ready to work in a professional development environment in a year. Developing a private project and developing a b2b project as an example are totally different worlds. \nBut thats just my take. Ask 10 devs and all 10 will have different opinions and approaches. The most important question right now which you should ask yourself is \"what exactly do I want to achieve?\".",

What does this mean? \n\nImagine you try to write an app that opens a window, shows a pink screen, then a special effect and changes to blue. \n\nIf I'm in a new language first I look at how to write a function in general. Assume we do this in python. So, at this point I only know the function syntax work, what do I do next?\n\n    def makeItPink():\n      pass\n\n    def showEffects():\n      pass\n\n    def makeItBlue():\n      pass\n\n\n    def main():\n      makeItPink()\n      showEffects()\n      makeItBlue()\n\n    main()\n\n\n\nThen I thought about it and got to the conclusion \"to make a window pink, how do I get a window first?\"\n\nLookup for frameworks for GUI, choose some one and realize that I should create the window before and pass around the handler in my main, so I modify:\n\n\n    def createWindow():\n      return GuiFramework.Window.new()\n\n\n    def main():\n      handler = createWindow()\n      makeItPink(handler)\n      showEffects(handler)\n      makeItBlue(handler)\n\n\nThe idea is that you split what you are trying in the different steps you currently understand that happen in your app, then you try to refine every step one by one. In the process you introduce as many axillary undefined functions as you need. At every step, if you got stuck in something, you leave it as an undefined function and continue with the rest. \n\nEventually you reach a point where no more undefined functions are left except the problematic ones and you focus on them. \n\n\nThis doesn't apply for big projects, but people planning big projects learned how to design them by doing things! \n\nThe most important part of the process is that you move to do things! Otherwise (at this beginner stage you are) you get stuck forever and don't improve!\n\n\nNote: If you are refining your steps and you have to see a tutorial about it, do it. You already understand why you need this step, and would focus on how to do it rather than in why. This means you already overcome one of the principal reasons not to watch a tutorial.",

The LineItem table doesn’t describe the product itself. It represents an economic transaction, and the price it refers to is not the current catalog price, but rather the price snapshot at the time of the sale, specifically referred to that order.\nIn fact, this is exactly where discounts, custom prices, or promotions could apply. Directly in the LineItem. Tying it only to the current Product data breaks the integrity of historical records and assumes that product attributes are timeless, which they clearly aren't.\n\n\nEdit i see many answers with triggers, other tables and so on. If you move redundancy out of a table that should be ,because of semantic, \"denormalized by design\"  you are not removing redundancy from DB and you have an inconsistent LineItem table as result.\nNormalization should not be \"never replicate data, even when it has different meaning\".\n\nNormalization is a technical tool that originated because, before ORMs, data persistence was handled directly by application code, which led to all sorts of issues. The idea was to solve these problems by abstracting the physical layer of persistence and using relational algebra rules to optimize the logical design.\nBut normalization must be subordinate to proper modeling of entities and meanings.\nFor example, suppose you have a product_quantity field in a product catalog table, meaning \"units per package\", and another product_quantity field in a warehouse table, meaning \"units in stock\".\nShould you normalize the schema to avoid redundancy, or disambiguate the semantics first?\n\nThe answer is obvious: semantics first.

Don't focus on \"I need to learn backend\" or \"I need to learn frontend\", focus on rather, I have idea **A**, which needs features X, Y and Z, and I need to figure out how to build them.  Pick the right tutorial's, blogs and lessons that will help you implement the features you want. \n\nSoon or later it will all come together and you will naturally fill in the knowledge gaps when building something you actually want. Plus it's fun. \n\nFundamental's are important don't overlook them. But have fun, break problems down to their core, figure out how to solve them and what knowledge you need to get them done. I believe learning something for the sake of learning is often, a huge waste of time. You need to (if you can) have clear intentions and set clear goals, that way a solution to \"you feeling lost\" is just a simple to-do list of the things you need to get done. \n\nGood luck!",

Stack accumulation is not directly related to CS learning process. So learning Django doesn't teach you software engineering, and \"learning backend\" doesn't automatically make you good at building systems or understanding how AI works. It just makes you... someone who knows Django.\n\nStack accumulation is something needed AFTER you formed yourself, understood what you need and you're asking yourself \"what are the best, most common, tools we can use toward this?\"\nOr if you want to become job ready on a specific path, pretty fast.\n\nBut If you're serious about AI, you'd get way more value starting from the actual foundations: data, computation, algorithms, programming principles. Learn how software works, not just how to wire things together. Then, when you build something related to AI, you’ll know how and why it works. And how to improve it.\n\nTLDR, before picking stacks, pick a direction that teaches you how to think like a builder, not just how to glue tools together. Because 6 months of python... well.... you're not quite there yet. I'm not trying to deny the effort or saying it doesn't count, it does. I'm trying to say you just started your path, do not rush if rushing isn't needed.",

I join intense course for PCEP (Python cert), but couldn't land DA role. I just took a graduate assistantship at university helping lecturers to do Data processing for ML research. \n\nDuring the assistantship,, I attended part time webdev bootcamp, not actually interested in webdev, I just wnat to network with IT people so I can land proper IT job. \n\nAfter my assistantship contract ended, I joined UX reskill bootcamp under government program that helps retrennched workers. I managed to get myfirst dev role due to their on the Job training program. \n\nThe company I'm training at didnt proceed to hire me, but I managed to land a laravel role at other company. \n\nThis is my current role I have just started in 5 months. \n\n\nYou definitely can go into tech, but it's going to be really fucking hard, and understand that  your arsenal aren't as good as other candidates because we come from different academic discipline. \n\nGetting through HR is the toughest, I advise you to get some certs just so it can convince them. I'd prefer to go for known certs like COMPTIA, cisco, Python Institute because HR might recognise these names, compared to udemy and LinkedIn learning. \n\nDefinitely make a good project you can be proud of. It's easier to show the technical managers what you have built than just yapping about it. In my experience, everyone in the webdev bootcamp I have attended, knows that personal projects are crucial to land a job, but most end up not building anything either way.\n\nAlso, I think Python is agood starting point, but if I were you, I'd pick a niche on top of python. For example build an API server using python, or build an automation script using python. \n\nThat way, if you got offer for role that's not related to python, you can still explain the technology and mechanisms, even though they are using different programming language. \n\n\nI know I'm still very junior, but I'm sharing this to paint the picture of the path you may experience as a career shifter. It may be easier for you, or it may be harder. Good luck!",

I would imagine there's a need in robotics, automotive, aviation etc. for some one to clean up telemetry data, run an AI model, generate reports, etc.  \n\nI would look for job titles like analyst, research assistant, data engineer, etc.  It's not as obvious as a \"junior software engineer\" job title, but I would imagine there are jobs that require writing at least some code as part of their overall job function.

At university you got probably got two different subjects like analysis and design just to understand this all.\n\nSo, you want to create a blackjack game? Then imagine how it is played in real life, you have a deck made of cards, you have a dealer, you have one or more players, players ask for cards (or the dealer draws cards), they bet, and the one closer to 21 points wins. Write down in text the interactions, like \"the dealer shuffles two, three, four decks of cards\", \"the dealer deals one card to every player\", \"the players bet\", etc, etc, and then find the nouns and the verbs. Nouns are potential classes (player, dealer, card, deck, bet, etc) whereas verbs are potential methods (deal, bet, withdraw, etc). Then build the relations between the different nouns, in terms of pure OOP how the player interacts with the dealers, what is the \"protocol\" between them, which \"messages\" does the player expect the dealer to handle, which \"messages\" the dealer expects the player to handle, etc.\n\nMaybe you should begin with simpler designs? Like create a File class that lets you work with files? Create a Calculator class that lets you execute math operations? That might help.",

Be dumb.\n\n\nIf that means rarely or never using 95% of what OOP has offer, then **that's the right way to do it**!\n\n\nDon't use inheritance at all, unless you know it's going to save you a LOT of typing. And even then, be very careful with it, keep it absolutely minimal, and don't layer it. Especially multiple inheritance.\n\n\nDon't use static props and methods in your design. They are typically just a bandaid on what could otherwise be done by regular props and methods. They're mainly helpful when you code yourself into a corner and don't want to redo large bits, so don't use them in the beginning.\n\n\nDon't try to organize your code according to the typical OOP tutorials. It never works. Real world code is not made out of Dogs and Rectangles.\n\n\nIf you're fighting the multimethod problem, aka if you cannot decide between doing `dog.eat(food)` or `food.eatenBy(dog)`, consider making an `Eating` class, and then call `eating.eat(dog, food)`.\n\n\nUse OOP mainly to encapsulate state, as in, have each object only directly talk to its own data. Don't modify values inside objects other than self. Use getters/setters. That way you can intercept the modifications and ensure that the data within the object is always consistent.\n\n\nTry to have classes that are either mostly/fully just data, or mostly/fully just functions. Those are your \"nouns\" and \"verbs\", analogical to the structs and functions in non-OOP languages.\n\n\nBe perfectly happy with making a class which is only instantiated once. In fact, most of your classes should probably be instantiated only once.\n\n\n\"The problem with OOP is that you want a banana, but you get a monkey holding a banana, inside the rest of the jungle\" - someone else's quote.\n\n\nOOP is too much. It's a huge pile of features. The worst thing you can do is trying to use them all just because they exist.\n\n\nConsider this: goto and global variables exist too.\n\n\nWrite a basic class that doesn't inherit anything, add regular methods, regular properties, one constructor if needed to pre-fill the properties, and then instantiate it and use it.

And I jump in to force the task to end (so I take controls and show them  how we finish this). But at this point, I can't take the time to let them in control and me helping them \"getting it\". What I should be doing if they accepted my help before. My role, at least a big part of it.\n\nAt some point they were frustrated because our pairing session was just me showing off...\n\nSo I stated as an objective that they have to talk to me often about what is blocking them. They also have to accept help when I offer it. They choose when, but they have to accept or else, I'll be taking the task if they can't handle it and everyone is frustrated. And they shoot themselves in the foot. \n\nSo my main idea is:\n\nIt's cool to want to get things on your own. But you are given help to be able to do more than that. So please use that. Use your mates whatever the level, raise warning about your blockers, communicate.\n\nYou can get things on your own, on your own time... That's a bit harsh, but the project needs to move forward. Else, you'll be ejected from the project.\n\nIt's more important to raise warning, that's team play. You're not alone in this, you shouldn't at least (I may have missed something in your post).\n\nEdit: to answer the part where the team doesn't answer fast enough. Tell your manager and insist.

But it's also not right to do that at the expense of your coworkers' sanity and time and the money of your employers.

You spend months debugging, that means you are doing something, undeniably get better at that thing and that's great.\n\nKnow that unblocking ourselves is part of the job, more so in software development than programming because of all the moving parts. There are several alleys towards unblocking and you must timebox your attempts, not fall for sunk cost fallacy, reassess the problem, rubber duck yours, others and even 3rd party code, ask for help, ask for clarifications, break down the problem into known facts, stash/shelve your changes and start over, or my favorite: do something else and come back to the problem later.\n\nRemember: the only thing that can solve a problem is a solution to it, and debugging for months isn't a solution, it may help identify the problem but that depends how you go about it. You are also not responsible for all the overlying causes to blockers, so if it tends to happen over and over in the same code base maybe it's the code base and not you (as a senior dev I've found that the faster I assess that the code base stinks, the faster I deal with blockers).\n\nThere are resources online that tackle this very part of software development and with science and practice you'll unblock yourself much faster and you won't feel blocked that many times.",

Python dominates the market at the moment despite slow af, just because it's simple enough and there are many libraries. \n\n\nMy suggestion is to look at Clojure/Clojurescript, as they would give the most benefits for someone without any experience right now. The reason being Clojure is a Lisp that runs on the JVM. \n\n\nThis way, you have the best of many worlds in one, you would have all the libraries of the Java ecosystem helping you. You then can use Clojure, which is a Lisp and is excellent for functional and meta programming, and Clojurescript compiled down to Javascript so you'll be able to leverage the webs too. (Without the need to master Javascript or Typescript, besides Clojure is much more flexible and powerful than both Javascript and Typescript)\n\n\nAnother perk is that Clojure compiled down to Java also, so if you want to target the mobile phone too, it'll be a nice perk. \n\n\nClojure's flexibility, capability and expressiveness will amaze you and ruin your taste for clunky languages.",

If you’re looking for quick tutorials, Traversy Media on YouTube has great content for both SQL and backend development.

The major difference it will have from most of your project and feature creation is that the bugs are normally well defined!

After having been through for-loop exercises, invent your own, decide that you want a loop that goes backwards, or skips every third number, or doubles every time. Small things.

Otherwise I could read for hours, but with less retention (meaning I would need to re-read).\n\nWhen searching something, the sinchrony of videos is way less efficient.

Letting me become absorbed by the content as if it was a movie, helps me retain more information, but it's different.\n\nWhen I'm reading documentation, the wiki allows me to keep searching between hyperlinks. I can resolve doubts in the flow, as I enter \"the zone\".\n\nHowever videos doesn't let me do that. Yes, I can pause it and look for it, but interrupts the flow.\nFor videos or audios to mimic a fraction of the Wiki's power, it has to be a well constructed and have a great pacing, wich nowadays is rare.\nShort videos are also good, but for short super specific things.",

Forcing yourself to learn things you don’t want(disinterests you, not necessarily because it’s hard) just burns you out. Learn things your pace. \n\nIf you feel like you’re not learning much, I recommend reading up different sort of technologies and forming up your own projects. These projects can then later on help you out on resumes and portfolios if you plan on landing a job in Computer Science.

Like, as a student you should be learning a little bit about all of these things ANYWAYS and you should be constructing small projects from the ground up to get your feet under you, but I think that level of specialization (or, in the case of a full-stack developer, that profound committment to not specializing) is something you don't really settle in to until you're a bit more experienced?",

They are more likely to cover specific technologies (say, Spring, or some web framework).\n\nIn any case, \"good choice\" is subjective. It's certainly popular. You're not going to get one answer, so you'll have to decide among many answers. For example, someone could say there's a lack of young Cobol programmers and despite fewer jobs being in Cobol, they exist, and are mostly by older programmers that may retire soon.\n\nIs that a good choice? Most would say no, but maybe? There's less competition, but that could mean fewer opportunities as well.\n\nGiven its popularity, it's probably not a bad choice, provided you're willing to do other things.\n\nOther choices, which may or may not be available to you are data science, machine learning, but they do require more math (e.g., statistics).",

What you can do is treat each event like collision, moving etc... as a state. \n\nAnd when you detect that a specific action has occurred, you can change the state of that ant and use a thread to perform a certain action (changing cell, interacting, whatever) that only performs when an ant is in a certain state.",

So, in general, in real-world software, multithreading should be your last choice, not your first. There are other choices. To give you an overview of some other choices, read this (from the Kotlin programming language): \n\nhttps://kotlinlang.org/docs/async-programming.html \n\nAnyway, while we're talking about other choices, the Go programming language offers Goroutines. I think the Kotlin programming language also offers some sort of Coroutine type functionality. The Scala programming language offers The Actor Model in the form of Akka (you can search for \"Scala Akka\" or \"actor programming model\" for more information). Akka can also be used with recent versions of the Java programming language even though it was written in Scala (both Java and Scala run on the JVM). Microsoft and C# ported Akka over to their platform with Akka.NET . The Erlang programming language has its own implementation of the actor model which I assume is sort of similar to Akka. \n\nAlso, a lot of programming languages (like Kotlin, Scala, and Haskell) offer some sort of parallel immutable data structures with built-in automatic multithreading. \n\nOh, and in a lot of cases programming languages use async callbacks/promises, like JavaScript. C# has its own async keyword and await keyword for that purpose. The Scala programming language has its own implementation of Futures, which facilitates multithreading and asynchronous programming and is sort of like JavaScript callbacks/promises. Kotlin has a suspend keyword and libraries for working with that sort of asynchronous stuff.\n\nBut yeah, in real world software, low-level multithreading should be your last resort, not your first.",

This is different in Rust, where suddenly changing to a multithreaded implementation will simply result in the compiler refusing to build the code until you fix everything, and this is also one of the reasons why I wonder why people are still choosing to start new projects in C++ these days.\n\nRegarding your specific problem, if you decide to listen to my advice and reimplement everything from scratch, I recommend looking up the Entity Component System architecture, which would greatly benefit your project, minimize potential threading problems (or completely eliminate them in the case of Rust), and maximize both CPU cache efficiency and thread parallelization. In Rust there's a project called Bevy which is a highly modular game engine implementing the aforementioned architecture, however I do not recommend relying on frameworks and libraries while learning.",

One for email lookups, one for phone number lookups. Don't force yourself into going through hoops to solve something that has a simple solution in a different way just for the sake of doing it\n\n With your current system, how would you go about adding another field? Say you'd like to have something storing someone's username. Would you them add a 3rd nested dictionary? This sort of thing can get messy quickly and doesn't make much sense",

Set a time limit for how long you'll work on your own, versus looking up common solutions.  Something like 2 hours seems like a good ballpark, but feel free to adjust that based on your own experience.\n\nIt's good to get in the *habit* of thinking about the problem more deeply before mindlessly reaching or Google, but as you've *also* probably realized, there's often a super simple intended solution to most basic software engineering problems like this one.  I would say that learning to reason about software is a *more important* aspect than just rote memorization of common strategies / patterns... But they all really build off of and re-enforce each other.  If you learn the common patterns, you can move on to solving *bigger, more complicated problems,* rather than trying to re-invent the wheel from scratch every time.\n\nTl;Dr - Give yourself some time to *practice* thinking about how to solve a problem, but also set a time limit after which you'll \"just Google it\".  There's real value is practicing reasoning about code, but you also don't want to get stuck too deeply on \"solving\" trivial problems that have already been solved.",

Tell them politely to send you or your manager an email, and you'll look at it later.

As you noted the classic example is just adding up all the numbers in an array, where the \"somehow\" is the function: \\`return total\\_so\\_far + the\\_current\\_number\\` and the \"accumulation\" is a running total.\n\nA different example could be finding the max number in an array. It's not the fastest way to do it, but if you have an unordered array then you might provide the \"somehow\" as \\`return max(the\\_current\\_number, the\\_max\\_so\\_far)\\` then by the end the the\\_max\\_so\\_far variable has whatever the max value of the array is.\n\nOr you could have an ordered array of chapter objects that you want to output into a combined book, so the \"somehow\" is like \\`return book + this\\_chapter.to\\_s()\\`\n\nSo instead of a big ugly loop with temp variables you could just do \\`book\\_text = chapters.reduce(string.empty, (book, chapter) => book + chapter.to\\_s())\\`\n\n  \nTo be clear, as with basically everything in programming, you can of course do all this without \\`reduce()\\`, and you just have to choose based on clarity of intent whether to use it or not.",

Perfect! You're close to understanding reduce because all 3 share one foundational behavior: Run a function on each item of the array.\n\nNow, here's how they differ:\n\nforEach: You want to just call the function for each item in the array. You don't necessarily want to do anything to the items or the array itself and you don't want to return anything.\n\nmap: You want to transform each item in the array into a new value. Example: You have an array with the values 1,2,3? Use map to transform the array into a new array with the values 2,4,6. The key here is your goal is to transform the original array into a new array with new items. The new array is an array of the same length as the original. Start with 3 items in your array? You'll end with 3 items in your new array.\n\nreduce: Similarly to map, your goal is to transform the array into something else. However, that something else can be anything! With map, you return a new array. With reduce, you return a new ANYTHING. You can turn the original array into an object (most common use case) or you can return a number, string, boolean, literally whatever you want. Example: Have an array of 1,2,3? Use reduce to return the sum of all numbers.",

Here's the solution, just so you know what I mean:\n\n    function calculateTotalPrice(products) {\n      let totalPrice = 0;\n      for(const product of products) {\n        totalPrice += product.price;\n      }\n      return totalPrice;\n    }\n\n  \nThen, when that works, write a more generic function, that doesn't know about product.price, but takes another function as a parameter, one that returns the value to add to the totalPrice. Meaning that this function should be able to calculate any total.\n\nAnd continue on to you have basically re-implemented .reduce with your own code.\n\nIt is important that you write it yourself, using your own thinking, and not get the solution from somewhere else, because it isn't about the solution, it is about the thinking that goes into it.\n\nThat is how I learned most of the array-functions (filter, map, etc.), coming from the old procedural way of thinking, I wrote my own implementation (with loads of bugs and imperfections) to understand what was going on.\n\n  \nAnd the benefit of using the builtin functions, is that other people know what they mean and can read it quickly, but having to understand someone elses implementation always requires having to read a lot of code, until you realize: ah, he's just reducing!",

Perhaps there is a better way. \n\nSometimes, there are few examples because  the use case is very old, and the greybeards who solved these problems though the solutions were intuitive enough that they did not put them on the internet, or they predate that custom. \n\nSometimes, there are few examples because your use case is actually esoteric, and you must figure it out. \n\nMost of the time, you can work through not understanding how some code works or how to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller steps that you do understand.

So as much as like the command-line and keybinds, I prefer the more visual approach, where I can swap over to the mouse at certain times (for for certain workflows). I prefer VSCode (even though I program on Linux).\n\nThat said, you can use Vim keybinds (and custom keybinds) in VSCode, and you can use VSCode keybinds in Vim.\n\nOverall, I'd argue that Vim will slow you down (at least at first), and you're better off trying it out later when you have some more experience under your belt. With Vim, once you get a grasp on everything you're doing, all of your macros, and map all of your keybinds perfectly... you'll be blazing fast. Editing code, refactoring code, and navigating between functions, files, and folders will be instant. But getting there is HARD and, debatably, acute speed isn't a huge priority when it comes to writing code, or writing quality code.\n\nI'd say, in regards to people I've worked with who use Vim, they're typically \"not faster than me at all\" or they're something like \"10% faster than me at best\". There's always the rare exception, the sweaty nerd who's so good at Vim that they're flying through code and edits at light speed, but they're rare, and I'd suggest that \"it has more to do with them\" than it does \"Vim\".

(But you can get far with other, less conventional techniques too: flashcards work for some people, a Zettelkasten for others, or try building a memory palace or using mnemonics or singing a song about Python or whatever. Do what works best for you, and feel free to use multiple methods.)\n\n>I kinda draw a blank on what to write when watching videos or reading code, because everything seems important\n\nIt sounds like you're early on in your learning journey right now, so it's no wonder that there's a lot to learn. You can't whittle it down yet; it will whittle itself down as you get more experienced. Start anyway. Be prepared to forget a lot the first few times you do it: memory builds up gradually and incrementally, not all at once.\n\nSooner or later, you'll have used for loops (or whatever) so much that you can throw away your old notes on them entirely, or refine those notes into just the tricky little corners you keep getting stuck on or some cool new feature you heard about recently. That's okay. Your notes can evolve with you.\n\nTry working through a tutorial on whatever language you're learning, and every week or three, pause to design yourself a \"cheat sheet\" of what you've learnt so far. (Look up other cheat sheets on Google Images for inspiration of how to lay them out. Try to make it maximally useful for **you**, not just to cram it full of as much information as you can get on the page. Don't be afraid to go through lots of rough drafts and lots of scrap paper. This step **is** the learning process.)",

If it's unclear what to take notes on then maybe the video is too advanced or maybe not even relevant enough to be watching, potentially.\n\nI'm guessing you're already also doing this, but I can say that I learn programming languages best by writing programs with them. So I do recommend trying to dedicate time to that. You can go through a basic tutorial and write and execute the code, and keep doing this with increasingly advanced concepts in the programming language you're interested in.\n\nBest of luck!!",

But this still doesn't really break the previous statement, how paradox games work is in the event handling side of things it is basically 2 steps repeated over and over: get players input then compute new state, when one of the players is lagging what happens is its basically blocking on the get players input stage, the simulation doesn't look at real time it looks at simulations slices (ticks), and so to the simulation everything comes in at the same time, but at the get players input we know that isn't true. Typically the lag will come from one player not verifying the previous simulation slice fast enough.",

Instead the game just runs slower and it takes longer to pass time in the game. Rimworld has a similar system where it aims for a set tick amount per second and throttles to a slower tick speed to try and prevent lag by slowing the game down.\n\nLets say your cpu can handle 100 calculations per tick. In essence what happens is if over the course of the game you go from 100 calculations per tick up to 1000 calculations per tick over the course of a game, then the tick speed will get 10x slower by the end and you shouldn't in theory see your computer drop below 60 fps",

I'm pretty sure there's some bottom floor to the rock speed so instead of lowering the speed any more, the game lags\n\n2.) there's some fundamental problem in the Clausewitz engine paradox games made that causes the game to lag when hitting that lower bound where it processes stack up causing lag. I assume this is bc the CPU usage is wildly inconsistent second to second due to a possible lack of  multi threading engine architecture, so the games frequently max out cpu usage at 100%. This is why the lag can sometimes disappear when lowering game speed by one level even though tick speed didn't change.\n\nRimWorld does not have this problem in my experience and only really experiences lag from running out of memory (or poorly optimized mods).",

Might be easier for debugging later, how are you going to tell it’s the right answer (probably an answer class with a Boolean variable). \n\nMake smaller examples of what you want as you go. Focus on the individual activity first like asking the user a question and getting an answer. After you can go back and add a progress tracker in the corner\n\nUltimately go for it!!! Best way to learn is by doing. If you have something you really like and want to make it’ll be more fun to learn and keep going. \n\nBest of luck!!",

Once they do that, the accounts `confirmed` flag is changed to `true`. To make this better, the confirmation code (which may be part of the confirmation link), can be stored in a table linked to the account with a set timeout.\n\nThis is the account verification process.\n\nThe password rest works in a similar way. When a user clicks the \"forgot password\" link, an Email with a reset-link / code is sent out. The code is stored in a reset database, with the record linking code and account id and having a timeout. If the user enters the code they got sent, they are redirected to a config page where they can change their password.\n\nThis is the password reset process.\n\nBoth of these processes rely on the assumption, that the user has sole control over the Email account.",

Motivation can make a big difference. But in general, it isn't necessarily an easy career to get into, and while it is well-paid once you get in it isn't easy money either. Very much like being an engineer or an architect. If you've got the aptitude, it is a solid career, but it isn't worth pursing \"just to get a job\" type of a thing.\n\nIf you're just looking for a job to improve your financial stituation, you might want to consider jobs that are a little less competitive, require a bit less learning, but still pay well. Everyone says \"HVAC technician\" but I don't know how true that actually is. I've got a bunch of family members who are electricians though, and they've always done pretty well.

But in all honesty this is not the path for you.\n\n1) It is a VERY competitive field. If you're struggling to learn the absolute basics you are going to drown here.\n\n2) It requires good social skills as much as anything else. Developer jobs are not Hollywood cases of a dude in a basement. You need to be engaged with the business. Able to drive conversations about needs and requirements. To provide feedback etc. So do not go down this route thinking that it is some easy path in that regard.\n\nThere are many paths in life. Dev is not for everyone, and if we take your comments here at face value then it is not for you. Have a look at what options there are that better suit your interests. Regardless you will have to develop your social skills. There is pretty much zero exception there, so if I were you I would work on addressing those first.\n\nThen start exploring options. Careers are hard because often we don't know what we don't know. Which leads people to aim for the high profile stuff like software div / engineer / lawyer.

        "body": "Recently I freelanced for a UI-focused company, and I picked up some interesting practices from how they structure their frontend work. They use Tailwind for styling and Next.js for everything else. Here’s a breakdown of their approach:\n\n\n**Start with a clear theme**\n\nThey rely on design tokens to keep things simple and consistent across the UI. It helps centralize color, spacing, and typography decisions early on.\n\n\n**Component architecture: two clear categories**\n\n- Templates:\nThese are dumb components. They just display what’s passed in via props. No state, no logic. In Next.js, these are implemented as server components.\n\n- Traditional components:\nThese do the heavy lifting: handle state, run computations, etc. They render templates and manage the layout. \n\n- \n\n\n**Avoid prop drilling by leaning into composition**\n\nMost components accept a children prop. That, combined with smart layout components, makes it easy to nest and compose without passing props down five layers.\n\n\n**Type safety everywhere**\n\nThey use TypeScript, and schemas are defined using Zod.\nTypes are derived from the Zod schemas, so you get strong typing and runtime validation in one go.\n\n\n**Always validate backend data**\n\nFirst thing they do with any data from the backend: run it through Zod. If it doesn’t match the schema, it gets rejected. This protects the app from unexpected API changes or malformed data.\n\n\n**Some of my own preferences that I mix in:**\n\n- For complex state, I like using a reducer. It can grow big, but having all actions in one place keeps things maintainable. Plus, reducers are easy to unit test.\n\n- For simple state, I lean on signals (when available). They’re lightweight and reactive, perfect for local UI state.\n\n- I’ve also grown to like the “crash fast” philosophy: use assertions to catch incorrect assumptions early. If something is wrong, I’d rather have it fail immediately than cause weird bugs later.",

As others have mentioned too, the SLT executives also don't pay for quality execution and productization either (UI/UX, actual internal tooling, Quality assurance testing, organizational software to actually help PMs and engineers, etc.).\n\n\nIt's not just being cheap on Total Compensation.  Internally there's very little travel and expenses budgets, morale events are gone and often paid by managers, no free food or snacks, the equipment is cheap, internal IT is garbage tier, we had to fight to get replacement computers. Also, those bonuses were structured in a way to be weaponized. You NEVER hit max bonus and more often hit midpoint or less if the manager just disliked you.\n\n\nPeople like to joke about Amazon's \"frugality\" leadership principle. But there's a difference between the definition of frugal (pay for just enough) and Microsoft's cheapness.\n\nEdit: Let me add one more cheap thing. Microsoft just had their 50th Anniversary. I would say that's quite a milestone for a big company, right? Let's just say when Windows 11 came out, we all got to pick out pretty fantastic goodies (sweaters, premium jackets, memorabilia's, etc.). For the 50th...I got to pick out a Teams background. And watch 3 CEOs pat each other on the back. Oh, and more copilot features (internal copilot is garbage tier and extremely watered down).",

An extra 30k/yr snowballing into 1k/mo or whatever in capital growth after 10 years is not nothing. There's a world of difference between having a chill/boring job vs not having to have a job in the first place, and with the high pay ceilings in this profession, the latter is reasonably achievable.",

Stagnating is a great way to jeopardize your financial future. You stay at the $170K company with a chill job, you don't keep advancing in your career, and then in 10 years when the company decides to lay you off... now what? Recruiters want to see growth, and you will just be able to say \"I've been in the same spot for like 10 years\". Especially in an ageist industry that evolves quickly, you really don't want to find yourself obsolete at 40.\n\n2. Inflation. When I graduated college 20 years ago, $100K was a lot of money. Now you need $160K to have the purchasing power that $100K did back then. So if inflation is going up higher than your salary (which is likely if you don't seek advancement opportunities), you might gradually lose purchasing power - and pretty substantially.\n\n3. Even with lifestyle creep, you will often find yourself accumulating wealth in other ways as your salary goes up. Bigger 401K, the bigger house you bought gets a bunch of equity + appreciation in it, etc.\n\n4. Accumulating extra experience early can actually land you in better work life balance later. Which, let me tell you - I'm happy to have the good work life balance at 40 (when I'm tired and have kids) than at 26 (when I had way more energy and no kids to worry about)",

Even today with 5 YoE, recruiters get shook at that one contribution I did in 2023 to the most popular logging solution for Salesforce. The other thing you can do is build your own projects to demonstrate you can build new things from scratch. Start simple, build a blog, add comments, add the ability to subscribe via email, tie it in to a content-management system - Lotta places need blogs. Once that's done, chronical your open source contributions & post tech-related content on there. There's a certain \"man's is published, he knows what he's doing\" energy from having a nice blog.\n\nEssentially the goal is to build a sufficiently impressive portfolio that you have *something* to put on a resume & something to talk about in an interview. A nice plus is if your projects make money - could be a small amount, even just $1-5 / month is noteworthy. \n\nA lot of people are giving you shit - but we all started from nothing at some point, it might take 6-12 months for you to build a sufficiently impressive portfolio that it lands you a job - but a year from now is a year from now regardless of what you do now.

Once you get to senior then moving into the tech lead track requires a spot to open up AND you be the best available candidate.\n\nThat happened to me until I found myself as a tech lead of an org of 150+ engineers. I never really intended to get there, I just focused on crushing my current role and helping out the tech lead above me with their problems. Then when they left they saw me as a natural backfill and put my name in for it.\n\nIf you have any specific questions LMK.",

        "body": "Investors want profit, which is revenue minus costs. Software needs developers, which are expensive. The big promise of AI is to drastically slash software development costs. There are a couple of ways for doing that:\n\n* By allowing less skilled folks to create good-enough software without having to pay experienced developers. Here, AI tools compete with the low-code/no-code industry. Nothing new.\n* By making good developers more productive. This is where AI-based code completion comes in.\n* By having the AI system independently solve high-level tasks. This is the dream of “agentic AI”.\n\nIt doesn't matter for AI companies if there will be fewer mid-skilled developers buying their subscriptions. A client company wants to get some amount of software development done. In theory, it can achieve this by some mix of humans and AI tools. Choosing some amount of AI is an economic win-win situation if AI-productivity is more cost-effective than human-productivity. But this means the price cap of an AI tool subscription isn't hundreds of dollars per month, but whatever it would cost to hire another human developer. And good developers are quite expensive.\n\nNow the neat thing for AI companies is that they don't have to realize these productivity gains themselves. They just have to convince other businesses that there *could* be productivity gains using these tools, that everyone else is doing it, and that your investors will start asking questions if you don't also jump on the hype train.\n\nIn a gold rush, sell shovels.\n\nThe problem here is that AI tools aren't cost-effective (yet). They are generally not cost-effective for users due to quite uneven quality, and they're not sold at-cost by the tool providers, because GPUs are so dang expensive. Currently, the field is propelled by the belief that the economics will work out soon™.\n\nPersonally, I'm fairly relaxed about this. AI-written code is generally well below my skill-level (especially when taking architecture and design concerns into account), and I don't see a plausible path for AI to catch up. Ever-bigger models with ever-larger context windows cost exponentially more, which could mean that the productivity:cost break-even point for high-skill activities like software development is never reached before the tool providers go bankrupt. There are also systematic problems, like software projects having a lot of implicit and oral context that is not available to an LLM.\n\nAI is probably here to stay, but software developers are some of the last folks who have to worry about this.",

Some may be lucky enough to find another role internally, but losing your job hurts and is a very stressful time.\n\nA silver lining perhaps is that these losses seem to be Seattle-focused. If laid-off, being in Seattle and a current employee will almost certainly put you at the top of the list for hiring, in the area where the most jobs are.\n\nWhat I'll also add is that it's worth noting where these layoffs have occurred. Devices is a huge org, but many of the divisions are ones where new products were recently launched or are due to be launched. That's not a great look for Amazon, especially if the new versions of Alexa, Zoox, or Kuiper start to suffer issues. It's equally a really shitty look internally if these are successful - why the fuck would you work hard to make something a success when your payoff is losing your job?",

H1b really breaks those.\n\nAlso the US never had talent shortages in industry or academia until these visa programs screwed up labor conditions and wages...\n\nEven Elon has talked about how talented Americans avoid actual stem careers and go into finance and other industries bc STEM is unappealing (which I'd argue is because of the wage and working perversion by these visa programs.)\n\n[How and Why Government, Universities and Industry Create 'Labor Shortages' of Skilled Americans](https://www.ineteconomics.org/uploads/papers/Weinstein-GUI_NSF_SG_Complete_INET.pdf)\n\nYou can look at what chinese software engineers make in an actual free market which is not oursourced or perverted by visa immigration.

To qualify for PERM a job is benchmarked against median salary for that profession in the nearest metro area. Moving requires an updated petition so you cannot apply based on LCOL area salary and move to a HCOL area. \n\nYou can keep living in this persecution fantasy that H1B workers have some kind of competitive advantage against you when in reality it costs an extra 10-30k to onboard them and possibly months in paperwork plus the uncertainty of a lottery. No sane hiring manager picks the visa candidate against a US person when all else is equal.\n\nThe H1B annual quota has not increased for years. It's a completely minuscule impact compared to offshoring and neglible compared to the overall SWE job market contraction since peak COVID times. But of course the current crop of low quality grads who got bailed out by lenient grading during COVID and had AI as a crutch for schoolwork are struggling to get hired. Prior to 2020 they would be dropouts instead of unemployed new grads.",

The market is tough right now and you're going to have to suck it up and basically throw everything you have at this if you truly want it. \n\nEach thing your do here increases your chances of success: \n\nBefore interviewing\n- leetcode hard, follow neetcode roadmap to fill in theoretical gaps in knowledge, once you have an interview focus on problems given from that company leading up to interview\n- time every leetcode problem to 40 minutes. Don't look up the answer until you finish the timer. Every single time you fail to solve a problem, work aggressively to ameliorate your weaknesses. \n- come up with a methodical problem solving process. Don't just change things and run them praying it works, get good at thinking about what you're going to do to your program and similating the output before even typing. Get good at running your own test cases against your code in your head rather than relying on printf debugging\n- get as many swe interviewers you can to give you mock interviews and giving you mock interviews\n- fill any gaps in your text stack that you may have (frontend should be angular, react, nextjs and typescript, backend should be Java , spring boot, postgres, mongo, redis)\n- brush up on AWS knowledge of core services including networking, security and databases, \n-  build example projects that actually work and document them very well on your GitHub and publish live links to your portfolio site and GitHub. This is a good chance to combine both stack knowledge gaps and AWS knowledge gaps all in one shot\n- create a portfolio site\n\nSomewhere in the middle of the above after some leetcode and projects are under your belt:\n- dont be as stringent about pay\n- expand the set of rules you're searching for (i.e. SWE, SDE, SDET, full stack, backend, frontend, SRE, ops, devops, etc...)\n-  be willing to relocate\n- get as many swe interviewers reading your resume as you can\n- ensure your indeed, LinkedIn and resume are fully beefed up and peer-reviewed\n- don't just cold apply. That's completely useless. Cold message recruiters, hiring managers, team members, random recruiters / hiring managers on LinkedIn, connect with family members, old colleagues, old peers, anyone and everyone. Don't seem too desperate, don't ask strangers for referrals. \n- always smile, be punctual, dress appropriately, take your time, make the interviewers feel comfortable like it's a conversation and not an interview, show no ego whatsoever, appear extremely eager to learn, admit when you don't know something rather than guess and embarrass yourself, have a list of thought provoking and insightful questions to dazzle interviewers, and AGGRESSIVELY ask for feedback and FERVENTLY correct all of your mistakes every single interview, after enough interviews there will be no more mistakes left. \n\nMost importantly...\n- keep your head up, realize that if you keep trusting in the process you will come out ahead. Don't doom yourself, if you get rejected sometimes it has nothing to do with what you did and is out of your control, and lastly, JUST KEEP BUILDING LEARNING AND GROWING!!! EVERY DAY!!",

Sounds like you did your best, so you should be proud, even if it's hard.\n\nAnother thing – you are not your work. Maybe it's worth taking some time to consider how much of your personal identity is entangled with producing shareholder value. If you care a lot about that, you'll probably always be a little dissatisfied because shareholder value doesn't give a fuck about you. \n\nIt's okay to feel bad for a few days, but after that, pick your head up and get back to it.

If a company needs to cut corners or decides to move positions offshore, there isn't much you can do about it.  You could have been picked due to performance, salary, age, likability.  You will never know the real reason so don't beat yourself up over it but, be honest with yourself and look at what you could have done differently and learn from that.\n\nGet on the job hunt now and work hard at it.  Don't take time off to lick your wounds.  That will only put you behind.  Job hunting is your full-time job now.  Do all of the things you hear about such as formatting your resume and cover letters for each application.  ChatGPT and Grok make it easy.  It's a stupid game that we all have to play now.  I've had recruiters admit that they only look at the top 3-5 resumes that some AI spits out to them after receiving hundreds.\n\nKeep a log of who you apply to so you have the info handy when a company contacts you 6 weeks later saying your resume impressed them and you have no idea who they are or the position you applied to.  OneNote is great for this.  It also makes it easy and organized to fill out unemployment claims.\n\nStart being frugal with your money now.  Life is expensive and your savings will go fast.\n\nBiggest thing is stay positive.  Looking for a job when you are unemployed is a grueling process and it's easy to get depressed.  That will kill your drive and make things worse.  Get out and be active.  You don't have to spend money to keep yourself fit and engaged in things.

I am dealing with a very tricky health issue, get an appointment at our renowned medical school, only to find out I'll be seen by a NP (nurse practitioner). Not very confidence inspiring never mind my primary care provider is an NP or as my kid calls them, a noctor /s but it's the reality of where healthcare is going (i work software for a large healthcare administration company). \n\nThird, i get the meaningful part. Having worked in the automotive industry for three decades i had the same desire. It does feel meaningful to see your stuff in action.\n\nHaving said all that, I'd say try big pharma, some health tech, and medical devices companies. Or any embedded really, automotive or aerospace. My partner worked 15 years in big pharma manufacturing. Her software helped make many very popular meds.

Goobie (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25LUF8GmbFU). to summarize, although medicine is can save the lives of many patients, medicine can only do so much saving and the other form of relief also comes from the patient's own habits and behavior. if you believe that your role as a doctor is to guide and fix (realizing that not all problems can be fixed), and this matters to you, then medicine isn't a bad idea in this aspect.\n\nalso, if you don't mind me asking, how did you become both a premed and CS major in college? that sounds like something i'll be interested in",

One thing he continuously emphasized is that it's a *copilot*. We are still the pilots. He himself said that the most dangerous thing about Copilot, and the biggest disasters he's seen, are people that trust it. Copilot is a tool that can help us quickly get through mundane tasks. It is not a resource that can be used to blindly generate code we ship to production. *The creators* are telling us that it should not be used for blind code generation. That's telling.\n\nA funny thing about those trainings that I noticed is that the instructor himself struggled a lot during all his demos because the AI wouldn't co-operate, and he had to live debug why things weren't working the way he wanted. It's very telling when a *live demo to a major customer* goes haywire.\n\nI use AI the exact same way I use StackOverflow. It's a tool to get me information, or get quick answers to mundane tasks. It's *not* something I just copy/paste. It *augments* my abilities, it doesn't generate my code.

It's pretty capable but still needs guidance and corrections on your part, but given the right context it really can speed things up quite a bit. I've likened it to \"auto complete on steroids\", in that it can gain context from what I name things and am working with to pretty intelligently suggest what it thinks I wanna do next.\n\nIt's absolutely not flawless and can definitely be outright wrong, but that's also why you're there. It's absolutely not to the point of architecting a full business solution (yet), but in general I've found it really does speed things up for me as far as the more boilerplate stuff is concerned.",

        "body": "I had a fun observation recently.\nWorking with Claude Code, I started out slow getting it to review and understand that structure of the codebase I'm working on, it run and analysis and report back things like \"The project is well, structured and cleanly coded adheres to best principles,\" kind of comments.\n\n\nThen I'd coach it through, tell to analyze a specific pattern being used in the project (for example the exception handling pattern in use) and point it a feature that had the pattern fully and correctly implemented and tell it \"Feature A shows the exemplar for this pattern, analyze the implementation carefully. Now apply the exemplar pattern to feature B,\"\n\n\nAnd it would do a good job of correctly implementing the pattern and saved a substantial amount of time. It'd get things wrong here and there and always needed a clean up, but overall it did about as well as a decent intern.\n\n\nAnd then I started giving a little more latitude. I wrote out a requirements document for a new feature, got it to analyze the code base again, feed it the requirements document and worked through it with it.\n\n\nIt did a reasonable job of putting together code that met the requirements. I did catch it trying to cheat on the unit tests, very badly. Something it definitely learnt from the unit tests in its training data. It did hallucinate a few things and left some half implemented code it had started and then deserted lying around. The worst thing I caught it doing was going of and off and making changes to completely unrelated code that would've broken things.\nBut overall, it's output was mediocre AF. It was messy, convoluted, had nonsensical functions it had added and forgotten about, barely conformed to the patterns required.\n\n\nSo next session, I loaded it up and ask it to review the code base, it does so and comes back with \"Areas of the code are well designed and implemented, with clean code and adheres to best practices, but feature XYZ contains numerous errors, technical debt and fails to meet the same stand as the rest of the code\". Feature XYZ was the feature I'd asked it to implement. So at least it was able to identify that it's output was garbage. I did let it have a go at clean up it's mess, but it just made it worse to the point I had to roll back all the changes fir the session and then went and cleaned it up myself. So no time was saved that day.\n\n\nSo lesson here is, just like with juniors, if you give it a well crafted exemplar to learn from, it'll do an acceptable job of implementing code  based on that. But, just like with juniors, if you give it a requirements document and turn it loose on a new feature, it'll get the job mostly done, but it'll be ugly as all hell and need a fair bit of work to get it over the line.\n\n\nBut where the junior wins out is in when you send the work back, show them the exemplar and get them to rework things, the junior won't usually make things worse.",

Sometimes I use AI to automate simple and but long tasks that would otherwise be easy but monotonous to do. \n\n\nOverall I would say not to become dependent on AI.

It is your responsibility as the senior reviewing PRs to provide feedback to the person making the pull request that enables them to address your concerns with their code.\n\nOP, your issue here is that Mr.Newbie isn't pulling from your developer branch to merge the latest set of already merged code into their code, assuming your org is using *proper* version control guidelines of developers having personal branches per story, the team having a dev branch for every sprint and PRing work from the stories to the dev branch, then the dev branch to the main demo branch, then the demo branch to the production branch for use by the users. If your org is managing branches properly, the issue here is that Mr.Newbie wasn't pulling from the developer branch before PR'ing their branch to the dev branch. These conflicts tend to happen when multiple people are working on the same file. If anything, your frustration at this common inconvenience is itself indicative of a relative lack of experience working with version control in a group setting. **Try to be understanding of what it is like to be inexperienced with unfamiliar tools and a good mentor for the newhire.** Everyone is new to these tools at some point in their career, even you.\n\nOnce you are both pulling from dev before PRing to dev, you'll have to *intelligently handle any merging conflicts on your local build***, so be sure to push your changes before pulling to ensure you don't lose any work if you make a mistake.** Try to become a mentor for the newhire and retain a positive attitude about the team expanding. You should make an effort to find ways to gain visibility for your mentorship and beat the drum of how much progress you've made with training the newhire to resolve these issues during your scrums so that you get credit for the effort.\n\n  \nTbh, just showing up to work being able to explain that fairly basic solution to your org's problem and pitch the answer to it to your team ought to resolve the issue and make yourself seem rather knowledgeable in your next meeting.

Things that immediately come to mind:\n\n* If you \"embelished\" or straight up lied about your current compensation during salary negotiations. Like, if you said you were making $200K and they used that info to offer you $240K and then they find out you're actually making $150K, that could have negative repercussions\n* If you had any jobs that you didn't put on your resume that you might not want them to see - like, if you said you had an employment gap but were actually doing work for a somewhat controversial company. Or if you lied about having a job or how long you were there.\n* As OP said - union membership, reason for termination, etc. I feel like those are all touchy subjects that could have repercussions.\n\nAll that to say - I think for a lot of people, this doesn't really matter that much.

        "body": "2024 grad from a T20 here. General salaries I saw ranged from 80k-150k in the Bay Area (most job postings only listed cash comp, not TC). I ended up getting a pretty good TC (220k TC: 155k cash, 30k bonus, 35k stock). I think I posted my resume before, so you can take a look at my previous experience. \n\nIn general for a new grad, the bands are pretty tight (I could only get 10k higher even with another job offer as leverage). The big disparity in pay comes from the differences in companies. You shouldn’t be asking if your experience gets you $X, but rather if your resume (and interview skills) can get you into a FAANG-level company. Given the job market, this means you need something that makes you stand out on paper and in person. \n\nAlso, I would recommend not doing a PhD unless you’re really, really passionate. It’s not really a “pass the time” or “get more money” thing. Especially due to the DoE budget cuts, full funding may be unstable in many places over the next few years. This means you need to be competitive in your lab/department to retain funding if anything gets impacted.\n\nAlso, maybe it’s an anecdotal experience, but all the professors I’ve talked to said it’s a slight red flag to do a PhD at the same undergraduate school since you want to diversify your research and education.",

Your company has an information/support problem. Because there's no documentation, or proper support, or any sort of information distribution to the rest of the company, you're getting pinged constantly. You're being pulled into meetings that don't actually need you, just because ***you're*** the documentation. They want you there just in case. Going into a meeting without you would be like trying to code without Google. When people run into issues they ping you because ***you're Google***.\n\nYou can fix that. Just setting up a random Teams channel and telling them to send their questions there is a start, but it's not enough. Also, it's useless if you keep answering direct-pings. If you get direct pings, politely redirect them to the dev channel. You don't need to come off as if you're avoiding helping them, you can hide it under the guise of \"visibility\" to others.\n\nBut the \"Go-To Person\" at a company that *doesn't* suffer from that is the person management comes to when they need to *get shit done*. They aren't going to waste your talents asnwering stupid questions in a support channel. When there's some really hard task that *needs* to be done fast, and right the first time, they point immediately at the \"Go-To Person\", they don't want to risk giving that ticket to anyone else in the team. You're the tool they use when they don't have any margin for error, because they know you don't need any.\n\n*That's* my experience as the \"Go-To Person\". I always naturally fall into that role, and its great. I've done some awesome things, I've pulled some miracles, I get interesting work, I have the trust of my management.

The interview process was generally:\n\n* HR Intro Call\n* 1 hour Hiring Manager / Tech Screen\n* On-site panel interview for 2 hours / 2 interviews 1-on-1 with a SWE lasting about 1 hour each\n\nFrankly it's harder to get an offer now, because companies are more picky.  They are scared to death of a false positive hire and will sacrifice the false negative hire all day every day.  I personally think there are tons of talent out there that with some ramp up time on the job would be an excellent SWE.\n\nEvery company I have worked for over my 15 YOE never really had issues hiring once candidates applied. Granted these were non-tech companies in non-tech cities so they were not hiring out of the same pool of candidates as bit tech companies.  If you could do reverse a string level problems with C or C++ you would get an offer. \n\nThese companies were fine with ramp up time and showing candidates, at all levels, what they needed to know to do the job.  Just finding people that had an aptitude for being a SWE was the problem. Aptitude does not mean some rock star coder, but could wrap their head around concepts when shown to them.\n\nGranted I've never applied to a startup, so maybe that world is different.",

        "body": "It is much more a consequence of the company values.\n\nBad work culture and bad work/life balance aren't the same thing than having high operational target metrics.\n\nAmazon has an intentional culture of employees being always working, always tethered to operations, and committing to die at the job. They make you feel bad for taking more than a week of vacation in a year of 12 hours work days. That's more a correlation than a causation but Bezos doesn't see it that way and since he's writing the checks, that's how it works. This is not specific to AWS and affects other areas at Amazon which are less tied to operations. Regardless they built the narrative that such shitty conditions are simply the result of the nature of the job, that if you're not always on the edge of burnout, the business will crumble and the competition will overtake them. Most people have known nothing else so they believe it.\n\nOther sectors and countries have laws so that demanding jobs don't ruin the life of people. For obvious reasons, truckers cannot drive more than X hours per day. Airline pilots must observe rest times, etc. Because obviously pushing these limits isn't good. It doesn't mean we can't have trucks and airplanes, it means we had to find ways to make it work and compensate for the demanding conditions of such jobs, often in the form of regulations against abuses. Companies still find ways to be competitive.\n\nIn some other countries if you are on-duty you need to be compensated for that even if the pager doesn't ring. Being available for the job is considered a work related duty so it needs to be compensated. If you join the call for an incident the law requires the employer to clock hours in addition to your regular pay -- even if you're not an hourly employee. On holidays you get up to double pay. And their online services aren't more or less reliable.\n\nThe US tech has close to no worker protection laws so the only things that retains companies to crush employees is how long they want to keep them and how easily they can find a job elsewhere. That somewhat works if the job market is balanced and companies are compelled to watch wlb to be attractive. This is often made easier by the general American narrative that government is a bad thing, that politics are here to trick us not to protect us, so employees hope for their company to do the right thing by themselves and rarely think about forms of civil action.",

If it’s not mitigated every 15 minutes passed it will page the next in line, so an issue that has been going for an hour would have the VP and like 20 other on call engineers getting yelled at trying to mitigate the issue. By the way that happened every other day, and when that’s not happening you’re resolving tickets of minor issues.

It's only a matter of time.\n\nWith that knowledge, I hold onto a good WLB for as long as it stays good. I have no interest in job hopping just to make some more money, I already make plenty. When the WLB is good, I couldn't care less if I'm underpaid. I know full well those small 1-5% annual raises don't keep me up with the market, and I'm perfectly OK with that. Once the WLB changes for the worse, and I'm *forced* to job hop is when I'll get the nice salary bump to be re-adjusted to market rate.\n\n$40k-$55k extra wouldn't make me consider leaving an otherwise good gig for even a moment. Irrespective of market, but it's doubly true in bad markets. If we're talking about $40k to $80k it'd be a different conversation, but $110k to $150k wouldn't cause me to jump ship.\n\nThat's just me though. These are *my* priorities, and *my* goals in life. My answer only makes sense in that context. Someone that's foused on grinding money would think I'm crazy, and in their world, I am. Different strokes.\n\nThink about what's important to *you*.",

No job is perfectly secure. Lots of people who were working for the government, gov. contractors, and research institutions who thought they would have a job forever are now looking. The best job security is the kind you make yourself, by having a diverse skillset and a wide reaching network. Working at different places is the easiest way to do that. \n\n3. there’s absolutely no harm in submitting some resumes and taking a few interviews. You’re actually in the best possible position. You don’t need a job right now, you have one that you like and could stay at. You’re not in any hurry. Only apply for jobs here and there that seem very interesting to you, that meet your preferences (remote, etc.). If you do a couple interviews and git a whiff of bad WLB, bail. If you do go through all the way and get an offer, start your negotiations at a stupid high salary, what do you have to lose?",

The two of us working just barely managed to put together enough money for a down payment on a house.\n\nI started doing some open source which got some traction and that eventually led to another job for like a 60% increase. A couple years later, that open source project got me scouted into a big tech company for another 150% increase. My pay at this company more than doubled in the 8 years I've been there. I make and have enough money now that I don't really need to work anymore (I still do because I like the work, but my wife quit the rat race)\n\nBy contrast, there's this guy that occasionally posts in salary progression threads here who worked 15 years in a single non-tech company with the steady 3% raises throughout. He was at low one hundies mark when he left his job and hasn't found a job in a few years, last time he gave an update.\n\nI think these two points should give you a decent idea of the range of possibilities going forward from where you are.

Im sure many people your age are job-hopping to more money but more stressful jobs. Your company may appreciate how you stayed, give you huge promotions and when it comes down to layoffs they wont consider laying off a person who has been there 10+ years and knows the system and someone who everybody loves. \n\nTo see the other side of the coin, it is completely fine being the person who wants to work extra create innovative code, etc. All i say is dont do it because you are under this impression SWEs need to be on the go all the time.",

Make it known internally you want some growth on that side. If you’re currently unemployed, it’ll be an uphill battle for sure.

AI, no AI, it doesn't matter, the buck has to stop with someone, and that's a variety of managers.\n\nI do think there is truth to your statement, though. At least at my company, we have no team level managers. I run a team, and I'm a senior engineer. The next layer of management is on the \"team of teams\" level. I do like this, and although a lot of project/product management falls on me when it comes to planning and execution, it's a lot easier when the managers just trust me on the technical details, empower me with a team to get the job done and the right set of people to answer my questions, and just step back and let me do my thing.\n\nIn my role, the managers just worry about goals, and how we allocate resources to go achieve them. For me, that's easy to deal with: everything we do must be towards some goal, I can get that done with the team, and management makes sure that impact/effort ratio remains high.\n\nAfter all, what I want for everyone on my team is to have a good, impactful review period which translates into good reviews. Instead of fighting management, I get a lot further by thinking of them as partners in the process, where trust is a two way street, and we are on the same team. Maybe that's niave, but the only way to be trusted to build anything significant, or lead, is to have a manager agree to the spend.",

        "body": "So, I'm 5 years deep into my career, which I hope gives me a good amount of perspective without being grizzled and jaded. Most of it was as a developer at a boutique consulting firm, and I stuck with the same client for about 3 years, a large at home healthcare company. Then bounced around other clients for a little over a year before we had a bad quarter and a headcount reduction. I got another job within the month building business software at a major auto manufacturer. \n\nAll that said, here's something I wish I knew 5 years ago. \n\nThe technical stuff, coding, architecture, deployments, are NOT the toughest part of the job. There's a good chance that coding is the easiest part of your work. It's working with and meeting the often inconsistent expectations of clients, product managers, stakeholders, and business analysts that will make your job hard. But, the good thing about that, is the better you learn to understand these people's perspectives and speak their language instead of nerd gibberish, you will be so much more valuable to your team. It's one thing to be a good coder, but when you're a good coder who can get the non-technical decision makers on your side, you become the person who GETS THINGS DONE. \n\nI inherited my current position from someone who was a good developer, but a really poor communicator. He didn't set expectations and just said whatever he needed to so people would stop asking him to explain. He developed a notorious reputation in the other departments as someone who didn't make sense and couldn't deliver. The tough part was he actually was a good developer, but people who didn't trust him tried to get in his way. \n\nLong story short, even though you're a developer, educate yourself in the business as a whole. Ask people from other departments about what they do and what their pain points are. Take their perspectives into account when it's appropriate and let them know that you're doing that (in a humble way, of course). You'll be an asset to the company as a whole and unique opportunities may open up.",

The tradeoff here is that for above pay band talent, you need to invest in training them, or at least hire someone who can self-onboard.\n* Offer the use of technology, like Rust, or Haskell, or anything else, that people will pay a passion tax for. I'm not sure if Electron is this, and this is more a decision that needed to have been made when picking out the tech stack.\n* Offer responsibilities and ownership far above what the level of talent you are looking for would otherwise get.

I know these kinds of opportunities only come so often, but I would still rather focus on my IC work at this time than step into this team lead role.\n\nIf you stick to just \"no\" and \"I want to focus on my job as an IC\" as your two talking points, you really don't give them much room to try and convince you otherwise. it won't come off like you are looking for other work, it will just look like you prefer to be an IC and don't want to be a manager, which is common.",
