The recursive CTEs should be tough to optimize for the engines, as your query filters diverging series early (not vector friendly). I'd love to understand how it works inside.\n\n\nAnother question is how those benchmarks scale wrt pixel resolution and divergence threshold. I suspect databases will suffer more than the others (exponential volume because of self joins?) but it's just a hunch.",

One of the issues with the framework became apparent pretty quickly. I found that Airflow logging was not working - in case of failure, stderr was printed in the logs, but nothing from stdout. There was another logging interface configured, but stdout was missing from there as well. The only option to see the error message was to rerun the step again directly on Airflow through SSH. \n\nA step usually took 5-30 minutes. So if there was a failure, an extra 5-30 minutes had to be spent instead of just seeing it in the airflow logs. The fix was just 2 lines of code. \n\n**The lead engineer had to wait for a production pipeline to fail so they could bundle (sneak) my change into the emergency fix to get it deployed.**\n\nYesterday was my last day.",

Yea I'm sure it's not needed at an operational level but that's not the level that your execs and ultimately your board is looking for.\n\nIf you acquire your competitor and say you both share the same supplier but have different supply terms which are more favorable to the company you acquired then you would be smart to use that contract going forward. You will get to that answer sooner with MDM.\n\nMDM helps us get in front of these types of data challenges. Yes the tooling is bloated, expensive, and hard to implement and maintain. Regardless, the need will always be there. \n\nAnother easy example, what if your customers are subsidiaries of other companies. How does Finance calculate the consolidate line of credit if it doesn't know or manage those relationships in the systems. \n\nWhen your company decides to change and modernize their ERP there is a huge effort to migrate accurate master data.

If there is no change in action second by second then you don't need to be working at that pace. \n\nAnother useful one to review is whether anyone is logging in to check the dashboard during the weekend and holidays. The harsh reality is that people tend to only look at these things from 8am to 10am and that's it done. There are always realtime use cases for sure but folk deciding to move from batch as a \"nice idea” likely don't have the need for true realtime else batch wouldn't have been in place for so long.\n\nMeet in the middle, run intra day (which already at least doubles their update speed just by running it mid day) but as you've mentioned this brings a whole load of other things with it. All those times the pipelines failed middle of the night and could be kick started again before people get in to the office the next day is now going to be an \"IT data incident\" with everyone watching and waiting for the screwed up dashboards to make sense again 🫠\n\nThere's so many assumptions it's hard to say whether it makes sense for you. You may find for instance your systems don't even update in realtime themselves. What even is their definition of realtime.. seconds, minutes, hours? You may also find you can get away with their numbers being realtime whilst everyone else doesn't use it enough or care",

Also it’s more expensive, requires more infrastructure, more optimization, more maintenance, more engineers, oncall rotations. So make sure leadership actually understands what they are actually asking for. \n\nIn most cases you can make it work with a microbatch architecture, but if you don’t even have Kafka/debezium/an event-driven architecture that is also your data source, then it’s probably not worth it unless there’s a solid business case around it",

If you move your data from the relational database to a datalake, you are doing it with the batch fashion. It is understandable, probably should stick with your batch job. but if you ETL your data from datalake to another analytics datastore, it can be changed to be real time by implementing datalake's built-in feature such as AWS S3's SQS to detect S3 bucket changes. \n\nYou run a service 24 x 7 to listen to SQS, then implement your ETL in this service, it can achieve the real-time result.",

If you wanted to automatically process S3 files you could just configure a S3 Event Notification to automatically invoke your Lambda. This approach is all event driven and re-processing can be triggered by either copying a file in place or invoking the Lambda with a JSON object that mimics the S3 Event Notification.",

And if Bob and Sue both think their one is best, then there can be a process for working out which one becomes the single source of truth instead of them going off into their silo and doing their own thing.\n\nOrganisationally it sits at a good place too, in that it can be a product of a central data team to enable business unit-adjacent analysts and BI teams to get straight into their value-add (engineers do the engineering, business users do the questioning, presenting and interpretation) .

It Has to be able to rewrite all of the data in scope so that the ordering can work properly, so it would necessarily rewrite all the data. That would conflict with concurrent merge/update/delete operations, as at the time of finishing the ZOrder you would revert the rewritten data. However, if you run ZOrder on a single partition, then you can still merge/update/delete data in other partitions.\n\nThe same goes for performing merge operations -- if you can isolate them to a single partition then the system can know for certain that you could not have possibly rewritten data outside that partition, so you can have concurrent merges working on different partitions.\n\nBut that's all you really need it for now. You might add it for `is_active` on an SCD2 table because you will generally fundamentally only be updating current data and frequently only querying it, but you wouldn't be trying to optimise tables with partitioning. The new metadata-driven clustering is much more flexible and effective at that.",

One account from the first query looks like a hijacked account, post history isn’t hidden.  That account has 42 comments across 10 different subs 8 days ago then nothing.\n\nThe astroturfing bots like to stick to the comments as it’s easier to influence users that way while being less visible towards mods.  Another tactic is cross posting a news source posted in a sub owned by the astroturfers.\n\nAlso note that they’re not all bots.  Troll farms also play a role since you can hire a “PR consultant” that contracts with the troll farms.  They’re really cheap too, think Amazon Turk but for astroturfing (Amazon Turf?).  The trolls are given templates for GPT or other GenAI tools to help formulate replies and keep them on point.\n\nOh and Google indexes Reddit comments.

I modelled everything myself, in a working solution, where the data indeed was really messy. It helped me tremendously, compared the on on-job-training my DE colleagues got. And later on I was dragged on to DE projects in various roles, and while not certain to get your anything, it sure can help a ton.\n* As for point 3: In general true, especially from a technical point of view. But in my part of the world, northern Europe it is becoming more the standard, that customers ask for x% of consultants to have Y certificates. So with a more commercial point of view, you can say, that while everyone can study and get Databricks' data engineer associate+engineer data professional without useful experience, they matter for contracts. And if you have the choice between hiring 2 candidates that are rated quite equal, I would take the person with the certifications, because you don't have to ask the new guy take certs on company time.\n\n\nAs for your last point, with no number; that is where I really disagree. The majority don't work in companies where they work with the most modern tech. Then you let your company decide the ceiling of your skills/knowledge. The few paid certifications and courses your get on company time every year is usually focused on already established topics. \n\nWhen your boss (or his boss(es)) asks about stuff from outside the regular box it is worth a lot to be able to know about it. You get to lead test projects, you get to be placed on actual projects. Or you learn some technique or alternatives solutions that can benefit you on the job.

        "body": "Interesting to see the demand growing for analytics over JSON data. We've been working on improving JSON in ClickHouse as well.\n\nWe released our native type last year, and just recently did a big update (https://clickhouse.com/blog/json-data-type-gets-even-better). We originally designed it so that you could pick (or let CH pick) about 1000 paths to store as native columns, and then pack the rest into a shared part file. It worked really well, but as more people used it, we found that a lot of people have A LOT of JSON paths. Either huge objects, or just huge variance between objects, which results in tens of thousands of paths. At which point you have many thousands of paths being bundled into the shared parts, and losing much of the efficiency (i.e. trying to aggregate a field that is packed into shared parts was slower and used a lot of memory compared to a real col).\n\nWe redesigned it so that we can essentially do hierarchical indexing of buckets of shared parts - the post above explains  how it works in detail. We managed to get some pretty impressive gains - about 58x faster when querying paths in shared parts, and using 3300x less memory, when you have over 10k unique paths.\n\nIt's a pretty interesting area to work on as not many OLAP DBS handle JSON very elegantly, typically you just flatten it which is pretty annoying and brittle.",

They should all already be identified and catalogued someplace, as part of a data security framework.  If they're not, that's a problem in and of itself.  You need to know where the PII actually exists, and ideally section it off into separate, higher-security datastores.  Less sensitive datastores should only store identifiers to the records in the secure datastores that contain the actual PII.  This step alone can dramatically simplify the process of keeping things secure, and can make it safer to allow production access for developers to debug issues.  It's rare that a bug involves needing to know actual PII, even in production.\n\nOnce you know which datastores/fields contain PII, you can set up automated ETL pipelines to mask or tokenize them during the process of being copied into non-prod environments.\n\nA good practice is to have (at least) two non-prod environments:  development and QA/staging.  The QA environment should be automatically overwritten with a fresh, sanitized copy of production data, on a regular basis.  The development environment should have finer-grained controls for overwrites, so as not to erase work-in-progress changes that developers have made to those datasets.  Ideally, each team should have some control over whether their data domain is merely appended to by the automated ETL jobs, or overwritten/reset entirely.",

        "body": "I've tried and seen a couple of approaches, usually starting with using open-source [Cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos) to orchestrate dbt Core projects so you can see each dbt model/seed/test as an Airflow task in the DAG for additional visibility and to see the dbt docs in the Airflow UI (side note: this feature will be back for Airflow 3.1 with Cosmos 1.11 that should come out next month).\n\nThe next \"level\" is to use Asset (in Airflow 3.x) / Dataset (in Airflow 2.x) scheduling for cross-DAG dependencies. That way the Asset graph (exists in 2.x and 3.x but imho is much easier to navigate in 3.x) serves as a proxy-lineage graph. Side note tip if you need both, runs based on time and upstream DAG dependencies, there is a combined [AssetOrTimeSchedule](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/airflow-datasets#combined-asset-and-time-based-scheduling).\n\nFrom there, yes, some people implement custom solutions, often based on dependency information gathered from the Airflow API or use the OSS OpenLineage integration to get \"true\" lineage and then visualize it with Marquez. How well this works highly depends on the operators and hooks you use, if they already support lineage extraction (there is a [list of supported classes](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-openlineage/stable/supported_classes.html)) or if you need to add extractors to your own custom operators. Inlets and outlets (so Assets again) are also evaluated by this integration.\n\nIf you want an out-of-the-box solution there are paid products like [Astro Observe](https://www.astronomer.io/product/observe) which is based on OpenLineage and reads in that information to create a lineage graph with additional fancy features like SLA definition, alerts, cross-deployment lineage etc. There is also a list of potential up and downstream impacts in case of failures. The upside is minimal setup needed and managed service support.\n\nDisclaimer: I work at Astronomer :) and a lot of the above was inspired by [this blog post](https://www.astronomer.io/blog/the-road-to-reliability-implementing-pipeline-observability) (and the webinar linked at the bottom of it) from our internal data team. They don't use dbt but their pipelines center around Snowflake and they had the same goal of getting to end-to-end visibility and documented their journey to that there.",

I work for a mid-size CPG company in the US that has more or less the same framework:\n\n\n- ingestion: raw data lands in redshift, separate schema for each source (raw schema for transactional source, separate raw schema for crm, another for customer support platform, etc). Method for ingestion varies by source, but the end result is the same. On our side we use a combination of stitch for some prebuilt connectors for SaaS applications, lamda for unstructured data that lands first in S3, and some custom python scripts hosted on ec2 for the various odds and ends\n- transformation: dbt transforms raw schema in redshift to cleaned data marts. I recommend putting thought into how you want to structure your transformation layers in dbt, and then just try to stay consistent. Dbt has their own recs on how to structure, and that's more or less what we do (staging, intermediate, and marts): https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview\n- analytics: some sort of viz or BI tool that references the cleaned data marts exclusively. You don't want business users building reports off the raw staging data\n\n\nYou can probably find lots of sample dbt projects online, that mostly look the same in terms of structure. Just figure out what works for you, write out some rules for your org, and try to stick to it. ",

        "body": "Lots of good advice in this thread. I'm going to give you some advice that may seem conflicting with itself. That's because there's no single right answer to your question, and a lot of nuance to unpack. No two people or their careers will go exactly the same. Don't take anyone's, including my own, advice blindly. \n\n* Do you have an academic advisor or a professor you trust that you could ask for advice or talk to about this?\n  * We don't know what institution you attend, what your academic situation is, what majors, minors,  specializations, certificates, what classes you've already taken, what classes your school offers, and so on. \n  * Career advice is tricky, and academic advisors and professors have a lot of practice giving it. \n* College is a great time to explore different parts of the field/different fields via electives.\n  * It's a much smaller commitment to take a few say, 3 month electives (especially given that you presumably are taking multiple courses at the same time) than it is to accept a job in a different industry or a different role. Taking advantage of that is smart. \n  * Taking a few related courses as electives, or doing a minor, in data science or computational science or the like is definitely a reasonable thing to do. If you want to double major, that's your call too, but it can be a lot of work and potentially limit your ability to take other interesting electives depending on your program. Then again, if you're really interested in both, and if enough of the required courses overlap, I don't think it's a dreadful idea. \n   * If you've never taken a class on statistics, I think all engineers should. Knowing how to calculate if something is likely to be statistically significant, understanding how distributions sum (if independent, that independence isn't always the case), and so on, is very valuable. \n* At the same time, I wouldn't want to spread myself too thin. \n   * You probably want to build relatively deep knowledge in one area, with broader but shallower knowledge outside of that. This is sometimes called having t-shaped skills (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills). \n* Knowledge of fundamentals helps you better learn and utilize tools. \n  * The relational model and SQL, data structures and algorithms, programming language concepts, and so on are timeless. And applicable to software engineering of all kinds, including data engineering. \n  * Yes, new algorithms and approaches are invented or become commonplace, but the vast majority of them build on top of past research and theory. \n  * It's not uncommon that old ideas come back either, just reinvented, recontextualized, and rebranded. \n* Go to every career fair your school has, yes even now as a sophomore. \n  * Talk to as many companies you can that are hiring software engineers and data engineers, even those that don't sound interesting to you (though yes make sure to prioritize interesting / better fit sounding ones) - they may surprise you, and at worst, it's great practice getting comfortable introducing yourself and interviewing. \n  * Try to get an internship for next summer if you have the chance, even if it's not the most exciting one in the world. It will help with junior year internships and job opportunities. And help you figure out what you want to do. \n\nIt's ok to not have all the answers now. You won't necessarily have all the answers when you graduate either, or ever - it might be you find yourself gravitating towards or working on something different than you expected, by choice or by necessity (e.g. what jobs you're offered, or what the company actually needs at a given point of time). And that's ok. That's completely normal.\n\nIf there's one bit of advice I can give, it'd be to embrace change, learning, and uncertainty. The more you learn, the more you realize there is to learn. Software as a field is still relatively young, and it's always changing. \nThe fundamentals largely stay the same, but the tools (hardware and software) keep changing.",

The agent inherits your existing governance rules so fine-grained access control is automatically respected.\n\nData never leaves your warehouse. The AI generates SQL + code that runs in your Databricks environment. You keep full audit logs since the execution happens within your warehouse. Instead of pushing data to a 3rd party LLM, you have an AI assistant inside Databricks.\n\nHope this helps. It took a while to find a solution, but this one was approved for use.",

Put a gateway that enforces DLP and field-level access; Presidio works well for PII redaction. Run RAG so only vetted chunks leave the DB, and keep vectors in pgvector/OpenSearch with KMS. Turn off chat history, force prompt templates, and log everything to CloudTrail/SIEM. Egress is deny-by-default through a proxy.

Most of those can give you the capabilities you asked, but implementations vary and none operate quite like Talend did.\n\nThe open source options include DLTHub, Airbyte, Bruin, CDAP, Nifi, Trino, and a few others I probably missed. That comprises at least the ingestion pieces, but you'll likely need other tools to supplement that such as dbt/sqlmesh and a workload orchestrator. You will pay in labor what you saved in cost, but it's rewarding when you get it right.\n\nHope that helps.",

It is the same reason you can sort of get a way with a federated RDMS in OLTP but not OLAP of any size.  \n\nAlso, most organizations don't do \"best in breed\" they use \"good enough of breed\" that barely meet the requirements due to cost. The top end RDMS systems are almost all proprietary. The only thing that open source has going for it is price.

ClickHouse is great to run analytics on very large immutable data (super fast because of the vectorized engine, sparse index etc), I'd only use it for that and only if your data is actually very large (or you anticipate it to be in a reasonable time frame) and move the SCD and model layers into a proper OLAP db. So: raw, very large and will never change in ClickHouse, anything aggregated or that needs to be updated ever in Postgres/BQ/Snowflake etc.  But honestly for a first PoC if your data isnt that big, which I assume based on the current CSV/SharePoint/PowerBI combination, you can also skip ClickHouse for now.\n2. Sorry no first hand experience with PowerBI+ClickHouse. From what I've heard it works fine for basic dashboards but complex joins are not fun with that combo.\n3. I'm biased here since I work for Astronomer so I have a lot of Airflow and only very little Prefect experience. I'd recommend spinning up a small dev environment of both and creating some mock pipelines to see which fits your needs better. For small projects it's often the case that several orchestrators can do the job and the decision is made more based on personal preference. Some tips for Airflow:\n   * Use the Astro CLI to spin up a local dev env in containers to try it out (its free and does not need a sign up).\n   * If you are combining Airflow with dbt you have to use [Cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos) (ok, technically you don't *have* to but it is really the best way!). It is an OSS package that lets you render dbt projects and dbt docs in the Airflow UI.\n   * You said your ingest is pulling from REST APIs using Python: you can use the `task`decorator in Airflow to turn any Python function into an Airflow task, thats probably the fastest way. I think Prefect has a similar decorator too. So with either tool hopefully you can reuse a lot of your existing code there.\n   * If you end up passing data between tasks that is more than just small jsons in Airflow, for example larger pandas dataframes, you'll want to store that data in a blob storage. This used to take a bit of setup but about 1.5 years ago a class was added in the Common IO provider package that is very quick to set up via env vars ([a tutorial](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/custom-xcom-backends-tutorial)).\n   * PSA: top level code in Airflow is executed every time the file is parsed, so don't connect to your db in top level code (i.e. outside of tasks).\n4. If there is a good way to do SCD with ClickHouse I have not found it yet. There is [ReplacingMergeTree](https://clickhouse.com/docs/guides/replacing-merge-tree), which I haven't tried myself but generally, yes, that is definitely a good reason to have the modeling layers somewhere else.",

Only times I seen companies with bills like this is when they leave the EMR cluster and all the associated services running 100% but the utilization is only 25%  So being able to spin he cluster  up and down when your jobs are gonna run will help reduce it quite a bit.  But if you are using it for ad-hoc queries and need the cluster available 100%  you might try playing around with the spark executors and memory sizes to optimize your instance size.  \n\nMain thing would be to run your Master + Core nodes on an on demand instance and have all your task nodes be cheaper spot instances.",

[https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos)\n* The Astro CLI is a tool for running Airflow locally, developed by Astronomer. It is also free, and you can use it indefinitely without being a customer. However, it is only for running Airflow locally which we would highly discourage from doing in production. [https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/cli](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/cli)\n* Astro is Astronomer's managed Airflow service, which is paid, and allows you to run Airflow in the cloud in production without managing it yourself. If you want to use Airflow in production but not pay for a managed service, you can of course do that too. Airflow is open sourced also under the Apache License 2.0 and is free to use, and many companies run it themselves on kubernetes, or using other deployment options\n\nHope this is helpful! We have seen lots of Airflow + dbt users be quite happy with that stack, and find using Cosmos to be the most functional way of tying the two together. But of course recognize that the needs of each team in regards to orchestration are different, and there's no one-size-fits-all solution",

Start by building the MVP (minimally viable product) THEN add features and improvements. Build with the intent that things will get bolted on. \n\nThey are doing a classic waterfall approach. Deliver the final product all at once. So in this method, building in certain features first might be more efficient to get to the final deadline. \n\nAgile is faster, more flexible, and some variation of it is the new modern standard. Waterfall is good for building something with core features that are extremely well defined. Of course, there's the other option that they are just building what they want to build whether it is needed or not. With data scientists, you can't rule that out. \n\n\nHere's the catch, every data scientist I have ever met HATES Agile. I suspect it is because in academia, you design your entire experiment, make your hypothesis, do your research, THEN do the experiments THEN publish your results. To them, Agile is following a poor practice of finding something 80% correct with the end goal of getting something better in the next round. Plus, if they are building a gradient boosting regression with specific variables now, the 90% correct version may require completely different variables with a Random Forest Regression. In other words, a complete rebuild. Data engineers can add features much more organically. \n\n\nI'm not saying that the Data Scientists are right. There is a very good reason while Agile has dominated tech, and there is a reason Data Science projects never get anywhere. Understand where they are coming from, but ultimately, you're more likely than them to be following best practice.",

Typically data scientists work in a sandbox environment when they model. If you’re talking delivery, then I assume you are building data pipelines? They need to figure out what model works before they can tell you what data they need and how they need it. It’s a lot of exploratory work. \n\nWhen I worked on an agile data science team, we just wanted access to copies of raw prod data from different sources while we figured out approximately what worked. (Honestly, even if it would work.) Training can involve significant amounts of data. If it was something large and complex, like a simulation, this might take weeks. At review we usually had draft models to talk through with business and often changed or added data as a result. We didn’t get involved with engineering until we had a good idea of what data we needed and how we needed it first (and where we were putting it). If business needed something faster for a particular reason, we’d just refreshed our working draft. (They usually had access.) “Productionizing” something like that as we worked would have been wildly expensive and time consuming. \n\nWe had conflict with one of the engineering teams at one point because they thought it was inappropriate to give us access to data until we could tell them exactly what we need. Then they would decide how to model it, spend time modeling for us, and it wouldn’t be modeled in a way that worked, the back and forth arguments took forever. (No, six months of data isn’t enough. No, the most recent value replacing the old value doesn’t suffice. Actually, we needed those variables you deleted, etc.) It was a nightmare. They considered us “non-technical” as just told us we didn’t understand best practices. \n\nNo idea if this applies to you. Hopefully not. But you might ask them their reasoning. Data science is not a software dev discipline and follows a different life cycle than the standard SDLC. I have seen multiple issues with tech people over my career who could not wrap their heads around this. They can be overly perfectionist, yes, and I can’t tell you if yours are or not, but I’ve lived it long enough to know they might not be.",

I'd look at xUnit equivalents for other languages.\nI use Behave, which is a Cucumber/Gherkin equivalent, for orchestration tests. The beauty of Cucumber/Gherkin us that the human readable phraseology plays well with auditors and business users. It helps build trust in what we produce.\nRuff and SQLFluff enforce code style. If I didn't need the DBT plugin I would look at SQRuff in preference to SQLFluff.\nFor DBT we publish the output of DBT Docs to cloud blob storage so clients can download it into whatever internal websites suit them. Again, interactive data lineage comforts auditors and people who query business data.\nIn the past I've used products such as Redgate SQLDoc and Innovasys DocumentX to document databases. As the company I was with went with a plethora of other databases I ended up writing my own version.  For any tabular DB my app needed a DB connection and a folder to hold that DB's equivalent of queries whose output was a defined contract. Again, this comforts the auditors.\nCode quality tools such as SonarQube, Sonarlint are useful. In JetBrains PyCharm there us a \"Problems\" tab that provides code improvement suggestions. I've found these to be useful. I think VS Code has some useful extensions that do something similar.\nJavaDoc is over 30 years old, most languages have an equivalent. Its only as good as the human content put in, but as a mechanically solved autodocumentation facility, its up to you to avoid shooting yourself in both feet....then reloading and shooting both kneecaps etc.\nI do a lot of work with AWS. I've found that their APIs, for the products I use, need a lot of calls as an API call answers a question but doesn't always provide the info to feed directly into a related question. Using Mermaid markup allows the relationships between various cloud artefacts to be autogenerated. I'm crap at graphics so Mermaid is about my limit. Again, a diagram comforts auditors. A comforted auditor is a comforted management team.\n\nData testing can be DBT Test, Soda and more specific queries. Its easy enough to generate AWS cloudwatch metrics from the results of a query. From AWS Cloudwatch metrics, its easy ti generate AWS Cloudwatch alarms. An example would be average expected sales +- 1.64 standard deviations as the acceptable range, anything outside of that range needs investigation.\n\nIn all honesty, the tooling is not the important thing. Its thinking about the goal you want to achieve, the benefit of achieving it, and the process by which you can achieve it. Only then do I look at tooling.",

You should do the math yourself but being an actual employee is not trivial. That being said if your spouse has health insurance and can get you on his plan this might not matter.\n\n\n2) SF will likely lead you to more opportunities long term. There’s a lot more in-person jobs coming back and it is highly advantageous to be here for future jobs moves. During my most recent job search, most if not all of the roles I found were in-person, and all of the highest-paid ones were in or around San Francisco. The same is true of my other friends in tech. Many of them who have roots elsewhere are struggling to find jobs that won't force them to relocate to SF. And a lot of places will pre-screen for candidates who already live here when searching LinkedIn. I likely would not have found my current role if I wasn't already based here.\n\n\n3) $150k is still a lot in SF. People talk a lot about the high COL and it's true that the bang-for-your-buck on rent is terrible. But how that usually shakes out is you just rent a place that's smaller/shittier than you would otherwise rent elsewhere, and then are left with more money than you know what to do with. I have plenty of friends who get by just fine on less than $100k/year here. With $150k and your spouse having an entire second income you'll be more than fine.\n\n\n4) the weather here in SF is way better",

He has a vested interest in this. Don't let the DE consolidate the data flows until after the training and don't let him do the consolidation alone. ~~If~~ When he doesn't like it, this will give you ammo to demonstrate to the manager why this is a good plan.",

If your organisation is big enough then all sorts of things typically can and do happen. Now, I am not saying that the approval must come from the consumer domain necessarily (you're right, that's probably a bad idea...), but some sort of sign-off should come from someone. Thinking of it, probably the official data product owner or steward should give that, BUT the downstream data product consumers should receive a notification of change.\n\nIn any case, this does not fundamentally change my question or argument. The main point being that data products would have some form of enforced and versioned schema, and you could not simply consume a data product by circumventing that contract, nor could you simply change the schema without any formalized and versioned change request.",

You should be using sth like dbt/bruin for that so that you have a maintainable framework to build these SQL pipelines.\n   * If you need to \"activate\" this data by pushing the data into some other systems/reports, you then build that part of the ETL in Python or any other language you are familiar with.\n   * If you need to orchestrate these, you use something like airflow/dagster/prefect/bruin to make sure the steps run at the right time in the right order.\n\nA significant chunk of the work here is exploration, as you can tell. Once the problem, the data sources, and the usecases are clarified, building the technical solution becomes clearer. My suggestion would be to map out these clearly and then look into the technical capabilities of the team, the tools you all are familiar with, and pick the simplest option to start with.",

The data coherence has to be assumed entirely but your ingestion process.\n\nAnother great advantage for you is that Clickhouse is natively multi-tenant, and built to scale (which is never fun, though)\n\nLeast but not last ( having worked with Clickhouse for 4+ years) Clickhouse community is great and you can easily reach them out on their slack or support.",

What helped us in ClickHouse: use ReplacingMergeTree with a version (updatedat) for idempotent upserts and late-arriving fixes; resolve surrogate keys via ClickHouse dictionaries so facts can map to dimension IDs without heavy joins at write time. Put tenantid first in ORDER BY and partition by month (toYYYYMM(ts)) for fast pruning and easy drop/backfill per tenant-month. For custom fields, store a Map for long tail, but promote high-usage keys into real columns; add bloom filter indexes on common filters and a soft\\_delete flag with TTL DELETE to keep storage sane. Row policies work well for tenant isolation if you expose direct SQL. Tinybird is great for serving pre-aggregates, but keep ClickHouse as the source of truth and rebuild from staging when mappings change. I’ve used Airbyte for ingestion and dbt for tests/backfills; DreamFactory helped us expose secure REST endpoints over the star for internal tools and partner integrations without hand-rolling auth. The main thing: tenant-first sort key, ReplacingMergeTree + version, and a small canonical layer will save you when schemas shift and backfills hit.",

        "body": "Thank you! Looking briefly at this post, it does seem to touch on what I’m asking. The post calls it a “monster query”, which is accurate. A composite metric fact table is just that - rather than a period snapshot, or transactional fact (or other) it’s literally taking data (facts) from many adjacent places and smashing them together - in my case to create “supply vs. demand” - adjacent facts include production actuals, production schedules, inventory (on hand, consignment, with vendor, in transient, etc), stock received from 3rd parties, projected sales, actual sales, goods issued, etc.  There is like >17 datasets that comprise the formula for “supply vs. demand”, and each data set is multiple ETL jobs / facts broken out by different companies / regions of the world (in a large multinational). \n\nHence, you can see my concern about potential challenges about different points of time due to unexpected failed or delayed ETL jobs, and ensuring to write an artifact to the fact for data quality purposes. I don’t need to expose this to my end uses (who are restricted to views on top of my table) but I would put in in the physical table for quality/explainability. \n\nAlso, I’m only concerned with the explainability part now (best practice design). Obviously, the more important part is the proactive portion of who you programmatically ensure all combined data is from the same point of time. For example, you can break the metric up into regions of the world (NA, EMEA, APAC) to ensure it’s computed relevant to their time zones, you can adjust your “subqueries” to enforce timeboxes, or time travel / time restrictions to ensure they are all consistent, or you might do some sort of staging tables that can be “frozen” (for example frequent loading upstream but frozen into daily buckets, etc.). I’m sure there are a few good options.\n\nAgain, I’m starting with “hey they this is very complicated since ETL doesn’t always work as intended and error free” so how do I assure quality given the many challenges. \n\nThanks again - it’s is a great link, very helpful and exactly what i was asking for.\n\nEdit:  the blog post called out something I forgot to mention that’s pretty critical. The subsets of data are all aggregated, so what’s included/missing from the aggregation is very important.  For example, if we are calculating MetricValue = Inventory on hand [region | material | day] - goods issue [region | material | day ] + projected sales [ region | material | calendar day] —> and each of these are very volatile. The different businesses in different regions of the world will change their sales forecasts through out the day (especially as we near quarter/year end, or other business target dates), inventory changes drastically, and goods issue (reduction of inventory) is very dynamic. So, if I’m after a daily level, as in what’s my EMEA inventory for material 111 on 10/23/25, this value could be very different if my subquery executes at 1am vs. 4am vs. 7am. Where as in a transactional fact table, i would simply be adding rows (ie: additional sales invoices to a sales fact table) and the differences are easily understood - I’m summarizing inventory per day, so the differences in values due to timing are a mystery. I like that the blog post is pointing this out as a challenge in the “monster query” which aggregates results into a “common grain” (which is exactly what I’m doing here).",

Look up Onion Architecture, Hexagonal -- how uncle bob has unified all of these with Clean Architecture.

This version of the game was VERY different from the java version. \n\nEventually the goal was parity, which meant Mojang getting more hands on with the mobile version, developing it to also support other (non pc) platforms. Its arounds this point where console edition turned into what is now bedrock edition.\n\nSo yes, it would be easier (and probably a lot better) if there was only one version of the game, but thats not what we ended up with.\n\nBased on how the development went, yes, they essentially redid the entire game and tried to make it feel like minecraft. No, they didn't really have to do that. Most code is, at least to a general level, language agnostic. If you have a functioning object or function, it shouldn't be hard to transfer that.

Having two seperate versions of the game predates the Microsoft purchase by a LONG time.\n\n\nThe first non-Java version of minecraft was minecraft pocket edition for android, all the way back in 2011. It was released as part of a deal between Sony and Mojang to make a minecraft version for the Sony Xperia Play, which was a gaming phone. Think about how shit the hardware on a phone would have been back in 2011, and you can see why they would need to rewrite the game in the more optimised and lightweight C++. Also worth noting, all the way back then, the game was very simple and didn’t have that much content, it wouldn’t have been that hard to rewrite. It was still in beta, with the really old terrain generation and even basic features like sprinting and the hunger bar hadn’t been added yet. The old, shitty pocket edition version you remember from your childhood was basically identical to Java edition at the time.\n\n\nAccording to autobiographies about Notch, at this time mojang was still a really small company with probably 10 or less employees and the rewrite was mostly entrusted to a single guy who was known as “the smart one”.\n\n\nLater that year they copied over the C++ engine for iOS, then next year to the Xbox 360, then the year after that to the PS3. \n\n\nMicrosoft didn’t buy minecraft until 3 years later. They didn’t rewrite the game engine at all, they just got all the different existing C++ versions for consoles and phones onto the same page in terms of updates, then unified them into what we now know as bedrock edition and made them cross play.",

Java is a product created by Sun Microsystems - a competitor of Microsoft, and Microsoft is not going to condone and legitimize a competitor's product.\n\nThere's some argument that Java won't run on phones? Are you fucking kidding me? And who says this? Microsoft, of course... Android OS is a JVM on top of a Linux kernel - and constitutes the single most widely deployed OS and platform, and Open GL is the most portable 3D graphics platform there is. So that's a whole bunch of bullshit.\n\nOf course Microsoft rewrote it in C++, because they explicitly won't allow a JVM on the XBox platform. They would have written it in C#, but at the time .NET Core was 2 years away, and its initial release was a barely functioning prototype and wasn't all that portable. As much as Microsoft hates C++, at least no one formally owns it and they can swallow that pill. Their legacy is also largely built upon it. It's a neutral territory that they are willing to port.\n\nSo in a word: politics.",

This started to gain some traction among the device makers, namely Nokia and Siemens, and lead to the first games you can buy and run through WAP and sold through app stores included on the phone. \n\nFWIW, iPhone (1) didn't come out until 2007. And probably the earliest recognizable Android phone, the Motorola Droid, didn't release until 2009. \n\nNotch launched Minecraft Java Edition in 2009 but it didn't gain traction until 2010. By then, J2ME was almost a decade old, designed for FAR MORE PRIMITIVE CPUs, and no understanding of GPUs. \n\nNot going to go over history of Minecraft much. \n\nEDIT: Except to add that Minecraft Pocket Edition (aka Minecraft PE) was actually written in C++, and when ported to iOS and Android, standard transpiler was probably used to create Java/Dalvik code and Objective-C code. (see Minecraft Wiki). \n\nIn 2017, Microsoft acquired Mojang and all stuff related to Minecraft. Yes, Notch WANTED a big corp to buy his stuff. \n\nBut one of the reasons is due to all the different ports to different platforms, the codebase became fragmented. There's a Pocket Edition, there's a Windows 10 Edition, and there are the various console editions. Maintainence and bug tracking was eating up a ton of time. And Java... is a big long in the tooth. And having to pay Oracle (which bought out Sun Micro, and thus, own Java) for a license is probably not in Microsoft's long-term plans. \n\nSo Mojang and Microsoft pushed out \"Bedrock Edition\" in 2017, which supposedly united a lot of the codebase in the program core, by ~~rewriting~~ basing the core in C++ with the Pocket Edition codebase, and because C++ was the most \"universal\" language. The program core will call the OS language libraries to do native processing (Dalvik / Java on Android, Objective-C on iOS, and whatever else platforms).",

All you know is that you're getting an object that implements the `MyServiceClient` interface.  It could have been made by half a dozen different implementations of that interface, or it could even be a mock object created in a unit test.  You treat all of them the same way and don't care where they were constructed.\n\nIf you think there's something wrong with the way the object is being constructed, looking in the code that is having it injected is the wrong way to inspect it.  Look for any implementations of that interface that have `@Bean` or `@Component` annotations.",

If it was that good, every other language would be copying the patterns. Instead, what we see is Java trying to copy other languages while maintaining backwards compatibility, which naturally makes the language harder than needed. See the \"wonders\" of how string interpolation is stuck with a kind of nasty format, because all the more reasonable ones were used in other libraries first, and they didn't want to break backwards compatibility. See the streaming api, less comfortable than the equivalent in every language with monadic collection operations. The Option class that has no nullability guarantees, so it's not reliable, And since 95% of all Java for services is written in Spring, the annotation salad is what we've got.\n\nSo yeah, your best bet is to cope via heavy IDEs that do all the work and will track usages, including knowing the autowiring logic.",

The hardest part is learning that when you write `int weeks = days / 7;` on line 14, and then change the number of `days` on line 20, the value of `weeks` doesn't change along with it. But you get used to it, and learn to read code.\n\nThen comes **procedural** code, with loops and functions/methods (we ignore the objects at first), and it gets a bit harder to understand that the loop does the same thing over and over, but with the values changing - so now changing a value on line 20 **DOES** impact the calculation on line 14, if they are inside the same loop. Or a function behaves differently from time to time, because it depends on a global variable, whose value might have changed since the last call ...\n\nThen you move into **object oriented** code, where objects ask each other to do stuff - but it still mostly reads like procedural code, where a single thread of execution goes through methods living in different objects - you get used to having to jump around in different files, but most of the time you can still follow along. The hardest part is knowing when the objects are instantiated, and who \"owns\" the reference to them - but other than that you begin to abstract away the actual program flow, unless you really need it.\n\nBut you begin using frameworks, and suddenly you don't see all the code - you have objects that extend existing objects, who then call methods in your object. You don't know exactly when or why your own methods are called, you just get CVS-receipt-length style stack-dumps when something fails, and you sit \"outside\" the code, looking in, trying to understand what might be happening around your own code - mostly you are guessing or using information from other people also guessing.\n\nIt becomes very hard to follow, even for experienced programmers\n\nAnd then you move to Spring, which is **aspect oriented** programming, where you don't even write, nor see all the code, but only add annotations and interfaces, and then some magic entity behind the curtain reads your code, and changes it! Sometimes before compiling, sometimes after! And you have no idea how your code is being used, who uses it, what for, or when. You just hand code to the monster, and it does something - now it is literally impossible to follow what is going on, and you need to know what the platform does, what the framework does, how it uses your classes and methods, and why it uses them in the way it does ... And you either have to read through 35 years of accumulated specifications, or watch days of indian youtubers explain it, still somewhat on the surface-level ...\n\nSo to answer your question, **yes**! Modern Java is actually very hard to read - and Spring is outright impossible to understand if you don't know a whole lot about it beforehand!",

        "body": "I'm in a similar boat, but I happened to figure that problem out as an undergrad. You're probably ahead of me in skill and prospects. \n\n\n**Work on skills related to finding a job:**\n\n\nSet a block of time, every day after work, for applying and upskilling. No exceptions, even if it's as little as 30min for one and 30min for the other. \n\n\nEvery time you feel like you're not skilled enough (which may be true), remember that people less skilled than us ARE getting jobs.\n\n\nFigure out why. Are they applying in novel ways? Do they have really good interviewing skills? Are they personable? Did they do x, y, and z? \n\n\nImprove yourself based on your findings. There are A LOT of unique ways to get hired while being less skilled. At the very least, you can improve your interviewing skills by failing at them and learning what to learn. \n\n\nDon't be afraid to look for more technical, but still retail-adjacent/low-level roles as a start. Don't allow yourself to settle for this either - keep searching and improving your process. \n\n\nI'd also try doing Neetcode 150 as well. Spend 15-30minutes failing on one question, watch the solution to the video, and then learn why the solution works (you can use AI as a mentor, not a solution solver). Rinse-repeat. Don't worry about \"not knowing the answers.\" Even experienced developers struggle on optimizing Easy's.\n\n\nSo, 30 minutes of self-study, 30min of applying (even \"knowing\" you'll fail), and a bit of LC-style learning when you're bored. \n\n\n.\n\n\n**Work on your technical skills:**\n\n\nThere are just as many paths forward in this as there is on the above. \n\n\nMy advice as a beginner? \n\n\nFigure out what domains you liked during your studies, research what it takes to get into them, and then follow an online roadmap learning those resources. \n\n\nDon't have a preferred domain?\n\n\nThen either read some books related to learning how to program, ones that are heavy on coding along and building things, follow a bootcamp, or go straight into \"github project-based learning\" repo and start building with your preferred languages. Focus on your preferred languages and up your skills.\n\n\nI recommend that path the most.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, school primed us to be very good at intaking new information and thinking like a computer, so now you have to learn how to be a craftsmen, building new projects and applying your theory. \n\n\nToo overwhelming? \n\n\nThe Odin Project is a free online boot camp that will essentially take you from 0 to the very minimum skills of a junior full-stack developer. You'll learn how to research, use version control, and build projects. \n\n\nThis will solidify your programming foundation, especially if you go a layer or two deep when using the additional resources/reading books.\n\n\nDon't forget to keep applying. When you're done with Foundations, you're not going to be \"cracked out junior\" level, but you'll be \"meh, *maybe* I can teach him the rest\" level. \n\n\nIf you haven't been applying due to being an imposter, you want a job or what? At least start at this point. \n\n\nThe more you improve at learning to program, the workflow for it, the rigor it takes, etc, the better you can pivot to other domains of programming. This is just one method of trying to open that door.\n\n\nYou are free to learn whatever else (project-based building in your preferred domain, reading books about programming, following tutorials on building a game, etc) as long as you complete that block of time for applications (or learning novel ways of getting a job) and dedicated self-study (this example being The Odin Project).\n\n\nIt's important to have fun during it all and not try to speed run yourself into burnout. You may find you learn the most in that period of fun/exploration.\n\n\n.\n\n\nSorry about the wall of text! I don't know the correct/most efficient path since I'm stumbling along as well! \n\n\nIf you want someone to chat with, feel free to DM on here. I'll give my Discord. ",

We only had to choose in year three and then could also choose multiple paths at once to test them out.\n\nSome jaded opinions from having done all of that a bit (my formal background is databases, chip design, robotics and cognition psychology):\n\n- Cybersecurity is steady but boring. It sounds flashy on paper with hacking and 0-days, but in practice it's about managing risks, audits, and doing lots of trainings for Rachel from accounting and writing stern memos for Herbert down in the archives to not write passwords on a postit. I've come into that via formal certifications we had to do to get projects in certain industries and I'm in contact with the legal department of a client for risk management there.\n- AI is buzz. There's money there, but you have to be able to suppress any remnant of morality to get that money by promising the sky and unicorns. The actual tech is cool and fascinating but can do a lot less than what sales people promise and unless you can get into one of the big players, you'll be eternally chasing their work. We do get project requests related to that and at least half of them ask for applied magic.\n- Databases is steady and boring and a bit frustrating. 99% of what people need from databases can be taught in a simple SQL course, the rest comes up if you either need to scale a high performance setup for 100000 users or when the new manager Timmey suggests we move all our data into a MongoDB on his notebook because he can scale with kubernetes or something like that. As I said, my formal background, and the MongoDB example is only half exaggerated.\n- Avoid Web. It's been the lowest common denominator in coding for decades. It will be expected that you can do web in addition to your \"real\" specialisation.\n- Game Dev... as you said, not a good option if you want to eat.\n\nEdit: added a bit of context, also some more specialisations to consider:\n\n- control unit and embedded is surprisingly complicated and rewarding. Pretty much all machinery out there runs software somewhere, but it's not talked about a lot.\n- graphics programming is also surprisingly large. Medical imaging, HUDs and sensors for vehicles, big data visualisation etc are all non-trivial, and the algorithmic side overlaps with the nitty gritty details of running AI.\n- robotics is cool, but not a lot of jobs in my city.\n- signal processing is an absolute rabbit hole. Take it at least as an elective because it helps immensely with compression theory, cryptography and video encoding.\n- if all else fails, there will always be jobs for stupid, boring enterprise software. The electronic version of a clipboard and a document binder. It's soulless corporate work, but it pays the bills.",

        "body": "Check out what's taught in the core curriculum for these specializations: subjects, courses, technologies, topics, languages. They can teach anything under the name AI. It could be generative AI, ML, or complex but important topics, but also things that are completely irrelevant to today's world or the job market. Similarly, other cybersecurity categories will likely include theory, encryption, encryption algorithms, and more, but there's a good chance they won't include what everyone expects—hacking or active intrusion prevention. Web can also encompass anything, perhaps focusing more on network administration or web application development (more or less latest technologies, languages). Depending on how the university keeps up with the times, databases might have a well-developed foundation, but they might also include cloud computing, Azure, data warehousing, Big Data, and more.\n\nBased on what these specializations contain, you can make a more informed decision, and we can recommend one over the other. Of course, it's also important what you're interested in, what you've done, and what you felt good about. This is especially true for things you didn't particularly enjoy; this can strongly steer you toward a particular specialization. However, the names of specializations alone aren't enough, as they can encompass many other things.\n\nAdditionally, look at the job market in your country or the location where you'd like to work. For example, you probably won't find a job as a junior game developer or Android developer. Job offers based primarily on databases should be available, although you'd likely need to learn something, such as data science. If this specialization truly teaches the topics I mentioned and others, you could easily find a job, for example, one related primarily to Azure and databases. There are jobs for web developers, but they involve a vast array of technologies. Unfortunately, you'll likely have to learn many of them completely on your own due to the limited number of subjects and hours to even call yourself a junior. It's also possible that the technologies they'll teach you for creating web applications aren't entirely aligned with market demand. Therefore, it's crucial to check what they'll actually teach under the term \"web\"—will you have the skills to administer networks, for example, or will it be a mishmash of everything, not necessarily up-to-date, and will pose a problem later.",

They aren't an \"attractive nuisance\" in the sense you're thinking. They're not \"polluting the public view\" any more than *any* random website on the internet is (and I'd argue infinitely less so). Instead, by posting how you *started* in the form of your newbie, beginner-level code (that, yes, might \"suck\"), and then posting a steady progression of how you learn, you would show evidence of by far one of the most important skills a programmer can have: the ability to learn. \n\nI feel this is especially true for a modern software developer. If all you post is your \"perfect\", fully complete projects, how am I to know that you didn't just have AI write it for you (and yes, fellow devs, I am *fully* aware that AI does not write perfect code)? How am I to know that you can adapt to unknown coding situations? How am I to see that you can learn, adapt, and above all *think* like a dev?",

You already know how to program, too. That doesn't change much. Neither does computer architecture or networking principles. Same for OS design and for parsers/compilers (the purple dragon book is still likely going to be the book you read for compilers and that was written 40 years ago).\n\nWhat you want to do at your stage is to continue passing your math and engineering classes because those are extremely important if you want to do anything with CS that doesn't involve basic software engineering. And the reason for that is going to be that the math classes you take will likely gate what upper division electives you can take. Go through your course catalog and look at the electives for your major. THOSE are going to lead to high-level, interesting stuff that *does* require a college education. For example, machine learning as a college junior or senior is severely more intensive than what you're going to experience through online tutorials aimed at people who don't have a CS background.\n\nThe important thing is that a lot of interesting stuff that you can learn as a CS major *isn't necessarily CS.* If you want to learn about simulation, you might end up looking at stuff for civil engineers (and realize that you need to take more physics). If you want to learn more about data science, you might end up looking at economics and might need to take way more philosophy. The more interesting networking classes are usually tied into management of information systems. The split info embedded is likely going to land you in electrical engineering if not directly into computer engineering. If your school has an informatics program, you might even want to change majors. \n\nIf you want to manage software projects and your college doesn't have any sort of specialty in that, then you're going to need to learn the Project Management Body of Knowledge on your own *anyway* if you want to become a project manager... and then software project management is a subset of business management anyway. A ton of tech project managers can't write a lick of code. \n\nSo at the end of the day, look at your upper division electives and think \"Does this sound interesting?\" If it does, go for it and make sure the path on your curriculum leads to it. As for personal development, I always tell people to just work on something, ANYTHING AT ALL, just for fun outside of their school hours. The only people I know that managed to finish a CS degree but then never did anything with it were people who never wrote any code for fun on their offtime. If you simply want to flex what you already know and want to broaden that, then look up coding challenges or attend a jam of any sort.",

Then I didn't use it because I 'needed' a spray booth. Got one about 18 months ago. Still didn't do any because 'I need a dedicated space'. Recently I got one. Still didn't use the airbrush because I 'needed' running water, power and internet (because of reasons) in order to spend time down in that area.\n\nAll of these things that delayed me starting were, if I'm honest, because it scared me. The whole journey off learning to use the airbrush properly and learning to clean and maintain it, scared me. So I didn't use it.\n\nIn the last few weeks I finally used it. First time was okay. Cleaned it and left it all there. Came back and had problem after problem with the airbrush.\n\nTurns out that that was the best thing that could have happened. I had to repeatedly strip the brush and work or what was wrong and how to fix it. All of these problems completely destroyed my fear of it. The problems (and solving them) were the perfect thing to educate me on how to use it and have me experience and confidence.\n\nThe lesson here is that problems are good. Problems teach and instead of fearing it, it's just best to dive in and confront the problems.",

Find a problem you feel you're able to tackle, but haven't tried solving before, and then solve it. Be it programming related or not (although, in most cases that would be ideal). Then, having done that, find the next problem, tackle that.\n\nThere's no silver bullet here. Making progress is hard, it takes lots of time, dedication and being quite stubborn, and it is slow. If you don't get a kick out of having something finally click, or finally figuring out that everything that was wrong was a missing semicolon (or something similiar), then it might not be for you. It may feel like you're hitting a wall all the time and making the same mistakes over and over again - but recognising that you're making mistakes is what will enable you to learn. There's really no other way forward than just insisting to continue, be curious and seek out all the knowledge you can.\n\nGood luck.",

When you merge, either you'll get a clean merge, or you'll get merge conflicts that need to be resolved.\n\nThe key thing is that any new changes from the base branch may or may not matter for your feature development in that 4 day period. It depends. A major factor there is how orthogonal the team members are to one another. If people are working on completely different things that don't affect the other, then you could potentially defer merging the base branch into your feature branch until your feature branch is done, especially if it's pretty short-lived.\n\nSometimes, you'll encounter merge conflicts when you attempt to merge the base branch into yours. Depending on what they are, I usually prefer to reconcile those sooner than later, just to not have that looming over my head, but even so, you could potentially hold off if they're not critical and don't affect how you develop the feature.\n\nIn some cases though, even non-conflicting changes can be problematic, either in the sense that the code is no longer working (a semantic conflict, rather than a textual conflict), or they could just muck up your build in some way and force you to have to rebuild. In either case, if it doesn't affect how I'd build the feature, then I tend to defer merging until my feature is done, unless there's some good reason I should merge sooner.\n\nAll that said, it's a judgment call, and ultimately you'll want to ensure that in the end you're merging quality work to the main branch that is well tested against the main branch's latest changes.",

But if you always plush to master, and you've done work since you realized that feature you added broke something, removing it without removing the in between work is a pain.  It's also harder to go back and figure it out.\n\nWe branch from master when we start on a new major update.  These usually are usually a very big deal - features being added.  We don't merge a major into master until we end support - master holds the oldest version we support.\n\nWhen we patch, we branch off the major branch into a patch branch.  So most of the time there will be master, major, and patch.  There can be two major branches, though it's not common.  When we release a patch we merge it into the major, so that doesn't get cluttered.\n\nWhen a developer starts working in something, they branch from, usually, the patch branch.  When they're happy they submit a pull request so someone else can review it, then merge once approved.\n\nThis makes it very easy to keep things organized.  If you need to pause work on one incomplete task, you can just swich branches, do what you need to, switch back and, if needed, rebase to bring in the thing you stopped to work on.\n\nAnd commit often.  Lots of commits make it easy to change your mind and go back to something you did earlier.  It also makes it easier to put notes into a pull request, and to see what you have been doing.",

If you want real numbers, go on job portals in your area, and look through a few hundred backend jobs. (Yes, it will take 2-3 hours, but you will have an accurate answer, which did not come from the subjective, 2 years out of date experience of someone from germany)\n\n2. I mean... Not sure what you mean? A Backend REST (or GraphQL) API will work for any frontend, as long as that frontend can do network requests. You can use the same backend for a python Frontend, a JS Webapp and an embedded C controller, and I have done so in the past. \n\n3. You will have to learn the concepts of backend. This is not optional, and will be about the same amount of work for all of the options listed above. But once you know how it works and how to set it up, it works pretty much the same in every framework (+/-, different things will be included, there wil be different names and slightly different details). If you know what middleware is, or how a request/a form is handled, you can migrate frameworks pretty easily. If you don't know those things, you can't really work productively in teh backend. \n\n4. I don't think that there is a huge difference between languages/frameworks here. If you want to shorten it, use a language you already know. (So I guess Java or Kotlin, if you come from Android).

I kind of suck in putting the button in the middle of a div or whatever. Styling stuff is not my thing. I can get it done but I would prefer a backend task.\n\nJust being a frontend developer will limit your options. Yes, there ARE jobs for frontend developers but in general it is more likely to find a job as a person who can do both backend and frontend.\n\nBut if you did not mean frontend but web applications/services then focusing on that is a fine and valid choice. Sure, the job market is saturated with web application developers and you have to stand out of the dozens or hundreds of other fresh graduates, to get hired. How will you do that is up to you. Will you work on your portfolio, will you try to get an internship, will you start as a freelancer, or something else? You choose. But you do have to push harder to be able to stand out. Web application development market is saturated.",

You need to learn to create the discrete steps that make the computer do what you want it to do. \n\nI fully do understand that your ultimate goal is to create your game, but that's a *future goal*. (A new carpenter doesn't directly start building intricate Victorian furniture. They start with learning to work with hand tools and with the grain of the wood and gradually work their way up.)\n\nTake two steps back and start with general programming. The suggestions I give you now are tailored to your desire of making games in the end:\n\n+ Start with the MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki. It is a free, textual, extremely practice oriented course that is the current first semester of \"Introduction to Computer Science\". This course will give you a solid general programming foundation and understanding along with teaching you the *Python programming language*.\n+ Then, move on to [Making Games with Python and Pygame](https://inventwithpython.com/pygame/) - also free to read online. This book will lay the foundation for game programming. Maybe, if your game is simple enough, you can even realize it with Pygame already.\n+ Then, move on to Godot. And here, I'd suggest that you shell out a few bucks (it's really cheap) and buy the [Humble \"Learn Godot in 2025\" bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/software/learn-godot-in-2025-complete-course-bundle-software) (available for 2 more days at the time of writing this comment) - I've bought a previous similar bundle and can attest that the courses are excellent and well worth the money.\n\nMy recommendation for Python first comes from GDScript's similarities to it. GDScript is basically a Python dialect with some additions for Godot and some peculiarities. If you know Python, learning GDScript will be much, much easier.",

I could list a bunch of stuff I believe are important to know, but more than likely, miss quite a few in the process.\n\nA more broad answer is that the fact that you are aware of gaps in your knowledge is a great place to start! If you find yourself unaware of why an implementation is done the way it is - investigate it! Many of the frameworks you're using are likely Open Source, and likely developed in the open, with open issues, RFCs, etc. that describe exactly the sort of information you're missing.\n\nNow I don't know your skill level, so I don't know if you are well adept in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTTP, etc. But I would add that you should know what the frameworks you're using are doing for you. If it is a frontend UI framework - your first question should be \"Why am I using this?\", \"What problem is this framework solving for me?\" If your answer is \"because this guide tells me to\", then that's an issue.\n\nUnderstanding basic design patterns is also something I consider to be quite important. Sadly I think many traditional methods of showcasing these patterns are quite poor in terms of teaching the way one can internalize the patterns and use them - even if programming in a different language than the one being used to show examples in, and even if the implementation details differ to the way the patterns are shown.\n\nSo, to summarize, my take is that the fact you're asking questions is half the way to progressing, now you just need to look for the answers. Mastering all of this is a craft, and it is ever evolving. But if you want to look past the frameworks as \"the stuff you learn\" and get to \"I use them to solve specific problems\", you need to be painfully aware of exactly what those problems are. This is also the only way you will ever gain a proper understanding of when to switch to a different framework. Remember this industry moves fast, most of the frameworks in use now either didn't exist or were quite new 10 years ago, and going back 10 more year will yield the same result. But knowing all of the fundamentals, as well as how and why the frameworks evolved as they did - that will always be relevant.",

Spend as much time on a whiteboard as in any particular software, talking to a client, breaking down what functionality needs to be delivered, etc. For an app, you're going to spend a lot more time in something like Figma - or, hell, PowerPoint - than you will in an IDE to start off.\n\nPeople aren't as likely to have a full design of everything these days as they were back twenty years ago - deliver prototypes to the client fast, correct as you go is more common - but still you're going to spend at least a little bit of time figuring out what the app needs to *do* before you start writing code.\n\nSo, like, a process I might recommend to someone new might be:\n\n\\* Figure out your major requirements, produce some GUI mockups.\n\n\\* Figure out what data you need to store and maybe make an ERD (entity relationship diagram)\n\n\\* Sketch out the parts of the system - what's in the app, what's in the backend? What information do they need to communicate? What tech stacks will they use?\n\n\\* Once you've got that all figured, write the smallest sliver of one part of it that can possibly be tested.\n\n\\* Then write another small sliver that connects to the first one you created, see if they work together.\n\n\\* They probably won't work together, so rewrite as needed.\n\n\\* Repeat until you have a big enough chunk of functionality you can show/demo to see if it actually meets your requirements.\n\n\\* Revise your requirements as needed, write more tiny pieces of functionality, test them with everything else, rewrite, repeat.\n\nAnyways, don't be afraid of scrapping code and starting over. It isn't a big deal. You'll do it lots and that's *fine*. Even professionals end up tossing code very often, beginners should do it routinely.",

        "body": "Not building Apps, but PC programs and Web-apps. Mostly small scale and/or personal projects right now, but I have experience with medium sized project (50 devs, over 1k active users, < tens of millions of datapoints)\n\nThere is not one perfect order. This is the first decision you will have to make: Where do you start, and what project style do you go with.\n\nSince I am currently building a one man project, I can give you the order of operations as I did it:\n\n1. Rough outline: What is my project? Why would people care? What problem does it solve? What solutions are already available? Who are the potential users?\n2. Feature list: Itemized list of all features it should have. For each Feature I wrote down for whom it is useful, and what I need to to technically to get it to work. (Networking, database, things like that)\n3. Feature details: I then added something similar to user stories to my features: Basically, short descriptions of how a user would interact with it, and what they would expect to happen/see. On my whiteboard, I then drew a lot of boxes, denoting my features, and connected them with arrows: \"Feature A needs Feature B\", or \"Feature C leads to Feature D\"\n4. I took everything I've built up to this point, and made UI mockups. First \"wireframes\" with a pen and paper, to roughly block out what could go where. then I made a single page in detail, to decide on a style for my UI. With those two in hand I went to some potential users, and used them to \"test\" my idea. I put the papers in front of them and asked them to perform a task (and I ended each test session by letting them choose a few tasks themselves) This resulted in me changing quite a few of my designs and intended workflows. It is good to catch errors as early and cheaply as possible. Changing the blockout version of a site costs a few hours in drawing, changing a coded version would take days or weeks.\n5. Then I sat down with my new UI and double checked, that all planned features are present, and that all parts of the UI are part of a planned feature. If not, I adjusted either side until I was happy. Then I used my feature List to plan my tech stack (yes, I did it this late in the game) Now I knew everything I wanted my (web)app to do and what it needed to do. So I chose rust(leptos) frontend, rust(axum) backend and postgresQL as my database. (shocker)\n6. With my new tech stack in hand, I made some rough diagrams of the architecture of the front and backend, something like a UML diagram, but much less formal. (because I am alone, as long as I can guarantee that I understand it, it's fine, and I have been using the same \"almost-UML\" since year 2 of university) I also mapped out the DB, but in excruciating detail, every nullable field, every relationship. Then I double checked again, that every feature, both in the UI and my docs, is present in my database.\n7. Then I started implementing a vertical slice: Meaning a single feature, from the DB to the UI, \"fully\" functional. I took this to even more testers, got feedback and did a final round of adjustments to my UI style plan.\n8. This is where I am now: I am currently implementing version 1 of my app, in it's entirety. This will be interrupted by testing with real users from time to time, but I am hoping that no major issues will come up, and I am confident that my architecture is strong enough to support refactoring most features.\n\nThis is not \"the best\" way. But I was bitten by agile too often in the past, so for my free time, I wanted something a little more waterfally. I am certainly not moving as fast as I could, and if I was dependent on external funding, this might not be a path I could afford; but since it's only my spare time, I chose to take the time and try to get it right the first time. If I get it 75% right, I will be more than happy.\n\nEDIT: \n\nI forgot Step 0: \n\nI actually built a prototype. The UI was shit, and I only had 10% of my final featureset, but I wanted to see if the \"demand\" was there. It is. The UI was built sloppily over a few weeks with no plan, and was very unmaintainable. I learned a lot about the domain though, so it's not wasted time, it made my second attempt so much easier and better.",

Maybe not.  You should expect to have to rewrite parts of your code as you discover errors in previous assumptions, find better ways to do things, find that your requirements change, or whatever else comes along.  That's why you try to have strong separation of concerns and loose coupling between well defined functions (and architectural layers) that can be swapped out at a later date\n\nI would generally advise writing an end-to-end solution as early as possible, including installing your app on an iPhone/iPad to prove that it works in the wild.\n\nA good starting point for an architecture is to separate your app into 3 separate layers: data, business logic, and presentation logic.  The data and business logic would be in the 'M' (model) of an MVC architecture, while the presentation logic would be in the 'V' (view).\n\nTry to think about how easy it would be to swap the components within one of those layers for other components with minimal impact on the rest of the app.  The fewer changes you have to make to interfaces between layers, the more decoupled they are.\n\n> Can someone please breakdown their typical workflow, do you start with back-end? ground level framework stuff, and then work your way up to re-usable shared features that can nest into full components later?\n\nIf you imagine your architectural layers as being stacked one on top of the other, with the data layer at the bottom and the presentation at the top, then my approach is to design the architecture from the top down, then again from the bottom up, then finally once more from the top down.\n\nI start from the top because that's where the user lives, and it's the user experience that will drive the app.  There's always a bit of tension between the the best implementation for the UI and the best implementation for the data, and that tension has to be resolved somewhere in the middle (e.g. at the API); so once you've established your data models from the perspective of the user, it helps to look at the system again from the perspective of the models, make sure you've established the best way store and query those models, then see how your UI will interact with those models.  With your new understanding of how the data will be modelled, you might find a better design for the UI, or at least refine how your UI interacts with the models.",

Crois-moi, une fois que tu es dedans, ça avance vite !\n\nSi je devais choisir parmi tes options, je dirais plutôt **Ingénierie Cloud + DevOps** (Azure/AWS) car c’est un domaine avec beaucoup d’opportunités aujourd’hui. Sinon j'ai touché à l'**IA/ML**, mais ce n'est pas vraiment mon truc. Ça demande souvent du **matériel puissant** pour tester les modèles. La **Data Science** est aussi intéressante, mais je ne m'y suis pas trop plongé, donc je laisse quelqu'un d'autre donner son avis.\n\nQuoi qu’il en soit, l’important est de **passer à l’action**, de **te fixer des objectifs** et d’avancer petit à petit.\n\nne reste pas bloqué. Bonne chance et surtout, **never give up** !",

There's really more harm done by misunderstanding or forcing others to look things up, than what you are saving.\n\nPreferred language by whom? Why do you care? If you're already at a school, shouldn't you just do what your teachers recommend? Specific tech stacks don't matter at all, you're getting a degree to learn how to think, not how to use languages.\n\nData structures and algorithms are often taught in pseudocode because the principle mattes, not the implementation. Sometimes metaphors are used like lightbulbs or searching a phonebook, etc. Nevertheless, the C language is often used for more practical examples because it is barebones. There's not much high-level fluff and it feels closer to the actual memory implementation, which sometimes makes it feel more relevant to learn about sorting algorithms when working directly with raw arrays. A language like Python works just the same, but the ecosystem around it will throw high-level standard libs in your face, which already take care of all data structure and algorithms for you, so it feels more pointless than a lower level language.\n\nI've never heard that C++ or Java would be preferred for learning DSA, why would they? C++ is like C, just with classes and more high-level features, which aren't applicable when learning about the fundamentals. Java is a memory-managed high-level language similar to C#, therefore still in the root vein of C, but with many more features, all which are irrelevant for DSA.\n\nUse whatever your teachers/mentors know best to reduce the friction of setting up any environments or getting stuck on syntax features. Then ignore the language and learn computer science, it goes a far longer way than any single language.",

At my current position, I've been writing in JS, Java, Python, Swift, PDL, and some proprietary stuff unique to this company. Have you ever even heard of PDL? No you haven't.\n\nYou're trying to do three things here - master engineering fundamentals, learn to learn, and demonstrate your capabilities.\n\nSo decide on a project - a calendar app, a video conferencing app, something business people will recognize as valuable. Then decide on a stack that will be appropriate to build that particular app, learn that stack, and then be able to articulate why you chose that stack in an interview. That will be more impressive than already knowing a language, at least to any engineers you want to work with.\n\nHope that helps.",

So there isn't a quick and easy explanation I can give you that will make it easy to understand. It's going to take time and effort on your part.\n\nTo learn about how something like Spring works, you have to read *both* high-level overviews *and* the detailed lower-level documentation. Since you've asked such a broad question, I don't think I can do much better than just pointing you to [the Spring documentation website](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/index.html). For quick answers to specific subtopics, I've found [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/) to also be pretty good.\n\nIf you can post the code and ask *specific* questions, like \"where's the program's entry point\" or \"how does this function get called\" or \"what does this annotation mean\", then people can try to give you more specific answers. But the answers might not make much sense without background knowledge of how Spring works.\n\nAs for Kafka: Kafka itself is not super complicated to use -- it just acts like a fancy persistent queue. But you need some distributed systems and systems programming knowledge to understand when it makes sense to use it, and how to use it performantly.",

Depending on what is available, I would take a look at the following ressources roughly in that order: (If at any point you don't understand something, because of you unfamiliarity with Kafka/Spring, take a look at their documentation. It is good practice to have all relevant documentation open in a tab at all times)\n\n1. README - Any good repo should have a readme in it's root path, ideally more READMEs when necessary in subfolders. This should give you a rough idea of how to get everything setup, what the project does and how you run tests (if it's well written)\n\n2. Comments and Code - The Code should be commented. I normally start at the entry point (main function if applicable) and go deeper into the project from there, by following used classes, function calls and so on. If the project is big, I always have a whiteboard and / or stack of papers to take notes and draw diagrams of how it all connects. This step will take time, maybe hours or even days, depending on the size of the codebase. I also like to make small changes, like commenting out function calls, to see what breaks. This allows me to know a little more about what does what. (don't forget to revert all changes, using git preferrably\n\n3.

As a quick explanation, Spring is used in the creation of microservices, and has a robust structure for making RESTful web services. Apache Kafka, based on its description, is known for use with real-time data feeds. Based on these 2, I'm guessing that I have a web client that sends or POSTs a certain data and a receiving end (maybe a database) receives or stores something, and that latency or throughout is pretty important that we are using Apache Kafka to manage multiple POSTs or other HTTP methods.",

Then build something small: a calculator, tic tac toe, a web scraper that notified you when a certain youtube channel uploads.

I'd normally write it as:\n\n    double convertInchesToCentimeters(double inches) =>\n        inches * 2.54;\n\nHOWEVER, that's the final form.  If I needed to trace something, then I'd need to go back to needlessly storing something, because now I needed it:\n\n    double convertInchesToCentimeters(double inches) {\n        var result = inches * 2.54;\n        Debug.WriteLine($\"convertInchesToCentimeters({inches}) = {result}\");\n        return result\n    }\n\nThe issue with having lots of named variables it that... you have lots of variables.  In controlling the chaos of coding, the less moving parts the better.  However, you don't necessarily know what you need when mid process.\n\nFirst pass code can break all the rules it likes, as long as it works.  Then you go back and consider the mess you've made and what you could clean up.  The more you code, the more you'll get the hang of what your personal level of acceptable mess is.",

If you don't know any framework yet, just take the one with the biggest userbase / selection of tutorials. That will make your start easier, and switching a framework later really is not that hard. \n\nIt's just like learning your first programming language feels hard, because you are actually learning programming. Once you pick up your second language, it will go pretty fast, and your third language won't even take an entire weekend to start getting productive. Same goes for frameworks: Once you know how a backend is structured, they are all pretty much the same. (They are solving the same problem, and there are only so many ways to do that) \n\nSo I would suggest, staying in JavaScript (although it pains me to see it used in the backend), and choosing the framework with the best community support. \n\nThere are a lot of alternatives, and you probably should use many of them at least for one project, until you feel you've found something you like. Python has Flask, Django and FastAPI (among many more), PHP has Laravel and CakeSomething? I think. .NET, Kotlin, Java all have some, Go is great for backend, and although personally I really enjoy axum in rust right now, that is really hard to get into for beginners.",

        "body": "There are 3 answers IMO, depending on your goal:\n\n\\- If your goal is to become a \"BE eng\" only, like you stated, leave the JS ecosystem and go do something else, preferably something with a lot of offers in your area (Java, PHP, .NET, Go, .etc). I say in your area because it does drastically change depending on when you live! JavaScript is often miserable for employment, especially if you are BE only.\n\n\\- If your goal is to learn some stuff, I would stay with JS/Express. You are already familiar with JS, so you can learn the server-side concepts more easily without having to relearn the language. But learning comes in any shape, so it would also be perfectly fine to switch to a different language if you want to.\n\n\\- If your goal is to become a full-stack dev with a decent developer experience, definitely stay in the JS ecosystem. This way you will be able to leverage both the fe and the be to a very high degree while writing the same code, reusing types, etc. With time, you will probably move to Next or some other full stack framework instead of express.\n\nNotice that I answered your question regarding JavaScript in general. Thats because the specific technology doesn't matter in your case. Yes, express is minimal and somewhat outdated, but its perfectly fine, and even great, at teaching you concepts and getting you started. You will shift your stack and ways of writing code a million times, but fundamentals stay.",

Others have to make do with docstrings.\n\nDocstrings are usually special comments that are displayed on hover in editors, and can be extracted to automatically generate documentation for libraries and programs.\n\nOrdinary comments a lot of us prefer to have explain the _why_ of the code, usually only when it's doing something unusual. E.g. I'll leave comments like `// this is a workaround for $remote_bug: <link>`\n\nI also generally like [the advice in the Rust stdlib on error messages](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/error/index.html#common-message-styles), which kinda boils down to writing down what you expected and possibly what can be done about the error. Even just thinking about that should aid you in how you architect your code.\n\n>  I hand comments but they're for me to remember what each section was and did.\n\nOften what happens to manage stuff like that is to break code out into a function or module with a descriptive name.",

        "body": "It’s always a good idea to include some documentation with your personal projects. \nI usually have 2 or 3 .txt to track everything. \n\nFor me it starts with my planning and it follows through what I’m doing as I work, so if I get pulled away to something else or pick up a project again after a while I have detailed note on what I was doing and (maybe more importantly) what I want to do. \n\nnotes.txt: this file is just for my revision and work, I don’t share it with anyone. \n1) Concept. I start by explaining the idea of what I want to do and what I might need to make it. Brief 4-5 lines as an intro to the project\n\n2) Aims and Objectives. Here I detail exactly what I want and what it needs to be a success. This help keep things on track and prevent scope creep as I can always focus on what I really need and the real objectives in the background. \n\n3) Plan. First through rundown of how I think I’ll build it. You don’t need to be exact on every detail but figure out what you’re going to need. Login section, landing page, diff options, processing input for ‘x’ or ‘y’ and how it’s done/what the out put should be. \n\n4) Components. List out the big bits you need to do. Parts that need to be put together with key functions and features. It’s to track that plan you did earlier and figure out what needs to be done at a glance. \n\n5) Variables Functions libraries and Header files. \nList out all the variable you’re using and why you use them, do the same for function. Very basic ones can just be named with type, you don’t need an explanation but if you won’t know at first glance what it does write it out. What are we importing from this library. Why did we make that header file and what’s in it/how does it work. Keep updating as you move along\n\n6) Working journal. This one might branch into a different file depending on the size of the project. Start the project, write out what you need to do first and what you’re planning to work on. I usually put the date in but that’s just for me to be able to look back over it. \nEvery day I start by bringing unfinished tasks forward and writing out the next set of tasks I need to finish. \nCopy across what you’re doing and what’s not working  and the final version when it is. Anything important or interesting I need to note for later goes in here. “Had to scrap an entire section and restart it”, throw that in here and explain why. \nAt the end of the session I list out what I  did today and what I need to do on the next session (cuts back 10-15 min of figuring out where to start when you sit down next time). \n\n\n7) Closing Brief. I usually move this up after the objective section once I’m finished. How did the project go? Did you achieve your goals? What was difficult how did you get around it? What would you like to improve further? And finally are you happy with the finished product? \n\n8) Lessons learned, at the end of the file, where did you go wrong and what do you know now about doing “x”, “y” or “z” for next time. \n\n\n\n.\n\nRead Me file:\nAfter the project I’ll make the read me file. \n1) Update the Concept, Aims, Components and Brief so I have a concise document that anyone I share the project with will be able to understand what’s going on and why it’s built this way. \n\n2) Features:\nDetail what the project takes in and what the intended out puts should be. If it’s an API detail the call and expected output if it’s a web app follow a trace of how the user progresses through the app. Think of it as a guide on how someone else should use the application. \n\n3) Components:\nList out the key functions and methods, how they work and how you’ve used them. No need for major details just let people know why it’s important and what you were thinking with it. \n\n4) Closing Statement:\nDetail what you achieved in making this application. What needs more work and whether you intend to come back and work on anything else. \n\n.\n\nIt’s a good habit to start tracking your projects as you go along even just for your own notes. \n\nWhen you look back at this in 6 months or 2 years are you going to know what you were thinking on April 3rd when you need to fix/plan around a similar issue in the future. \n\nThe notes.txt file is just for me and I usually put it in the gitignore. It’s helped out in interviews when I was asked to walk through some of my work I’ll pull up my notes file and can quickly find key details on what I was doing and how I did it. I’ve shared my screen to show some of the details or pulled up \nA specific part of my journal where I figured out a problem. \n\nReally helps to have actual example of what you did and how you processed the problem before finding the solution. You can also then say “Well I know about this library now that fixes this for me but I could build it myself again if I needed to”. \n\nVery small concept projects or feature test I don’t do this out. It’s only for projects I might show people or a 10 min glance wouldn’t explain what’s going on. \n\nSorry a lot in that comment but that’s how I do it.",

Make the repo(s) public (watch for secrets  and personal data etc.).\n\nIf you have a website too I might visit it, but 95% chance I won't. 1% chance I look at any of the code in the repos. We just don't have time for that, generally. I'll just look at the repo README to see what it is, then move on. With this in mind, it's a good idea to spend a bit of time on the README, telling me the details I need to know \"above the fold\" (without having to scroll down) like what the project is/does, where it runs, key technologies used etc. In a few formatted sentences or bullet points. I will never ever ever pull+build+run your projects. Again, I've got tens more candidates to screen, so anything you can do to dial back the bullshit, not add to it, is great. (E.g. I once passed on a candidate that had an obnoxious loading message on his website whilst his unnecessarily large front end bundle loaded and hydrated taking seconds to do all these fancy JS things. The exact opposite of impressive.)\n\nYou don't need to deploy things, but if there's a convenient link in the README I will probably click it just to see what you built. I won't run through the features or anything unless it's a button push.\n\nSaved on your computer is only useful if you're screen sharing for a demo or something, like in an interview. Maybe have a local copy checked out and built in case you get the opportunity to demo or something. I would look positively on a candidate offering to show me a project we are discussing actually running, even if I didn't take them up on it.\n\nDoesn't matter for recruiters. Most of them are even less likely than us to look at projects in detail, they just pass these things along to client firms. Occasionally you get a recruiter that will click around but their feedback probably isn't very valuable in all honesty. They'll focus more on your CV itself and experience etc.\n\nIn general don't worry too much. If we want to see you code we'll set a test (live, take-home etc.) as repo code could have come from anywhere and doesn't tell us much. Honestly, I mostly use projects to gauge the level of interest a candidate has in writing software, not their actual ability, as we expect that to be low at entry level. You have no idea how many people we get that can't point to anything they've done outside of education, and can't demonstrate any ability or approach to solving a problem they weren't prepared for.",

Ok so you’re looking at a front end that talks to a backend and likely stores or obtains data from somewhere. \n\nYou’re keen on typescript and react, great that’s your frontend sorted. So do both. \n\nYou want to make a web app which will have to do something or talk to something. Ideally just throw together an api to process the front ends requests. Front end should be light and the backend should be the brains of the operation. Probably just put something together with node so you can see the full end to end experience. \n\nStart with data early if you’re gonna do it. Don’t just throw things in a json file if you’re planning on using a database later. If you want a db soon just use SQLite and swap it out when it becomes inconvenient. \n\nThat’s a full web app right there using both technologies you mentioned. Do that right and you’ve kick started your cv. \n\nOf course throw in version control (git) and unit testing and you’ve got everything you need.

I would suggest doing everything without typescript so you get a good understanding of what JavaScript really is, and then learn typescript separately.

        "body": "I think what you're being confused by is a special feature of unions in C++. When you declare a union starting with a simply typed field like an integer (or an enum, which is just integer values you that have certain names), or multiple such fields at the start of a union, C++ treats then as the \"Common Initial Sequence\" of the union. What that means is that the compiler assumes that all the struct union member types that follow, such as, say, SDL\\_WindowEvent, SDL\\_KeyboardEvent, and others -- that all of those structs themselves start with those fields/types. If your SDL\\_Event event union is in a variable e, it lets you write e.type as a shorthand. What that actually means is \"no matter which member type (SDL\\_WindowEvent, SDL\\_KeyboardEvent, etc.) I'm currently interpreting my union variable as, I know it starts with an enum SDL\\_EventType value (because I've arranged it so all the union struct types start with that field), so just interpret the first four bytes of this variable as the type.\"\n\nI think (?) when you say 'shouldn't it be e.SDL\\_EventType == SDL\\_QUIT', what you mean is, 'when I access things from a union, I always have to specify which sub-type I'm thinking about the union as at that moment, so I expect to see e.SDL\\_EventType or something like that, just like I would write e.SDL\\_WindowEvent.whatever, and I shouldn't be able to access any field directly as e.type\". But you can because of this Common Initial Sequence convenience C++ gives you.\n\nOn the other hand, if your question really is just about how enums work: An enum is just a way of telling the compiler that certain symbols stand for certain integer values. So when SDL defines the SDL\\_EventType, one of the values in there is SDL\\_QUIT, which is assigned some particular value (like 5 or whatever) by the enum. Your intuition is right that it's kind of more \"proper\" to refer to that value as something like SDL\\_EventType.SDL\\_QUIT (i.e., the SDL\\_QUIT value as defined by the SDL\\_EventType enum. But C/C++ let you just say SDL\\_QUIT and it knows that by that you mean 5. It doesn't make sense to say e.SDL\\_EventType because that's trying to refer to a field of e using a enum \\*type\\*. The actual field e is an integer, so it has values like SDL\\_QUIT or other enum values defined by SDL\\_EventType.",

They guide you through the implementation to some degree IIRC, but you write all the code for the ray tracer yourself. The final scene contains nearly ~1million triangles. It's very rewarding once you get each of the projects working since there's a nice visual payoff. I remember it being short (6 weeks?) but a little intense due to the pace, particularly the ray tracer, so make sure you have nights and weekends available to bang your head on the assignments.\n\nI think you can audit it for free on edx? not sure\n\nIf you find the topic interesting, I would seriously recommend just giving it a go and to not let the idea of the math hold you back. Maybe you'd surprise yourself with how much you can understand and learn as you need it. The lectures all cover the important material, and there are tons of other resources online (plus LLMs) that can give you a major nudge. I think they also have forums for the course where people can answer questions if you get stuck.\n\nFor the final homework project (write your own simple ray tracer from scratch), IIRC there were about 7 scenes, where the final scene was by far the most complex and could take quite a few hours to render if not using any optimizations. All the other scenes help you know you're on the right track and that your final scene will likely succeed. The final scene is basically just a stress test. Some things that can majorly help:\n\n* use OpenMP to trivially add parallelization to the render loop. Ray tracing is considered \"embarrassingly parallel\" as all the work done to render each pixel's final color value is independent. This is a free win that will make the render go faster with hardly any work on your part. If your machine has 8 cores, this could give you ~8x speedup. IIRC this only required adding a single #pragma above the outer render loop, like this (and installing openmp if needed, and adding an `#include <omp.h>` somewhere):\n\n        #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2)\n        for (int i = 0; i < height; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < width; j++) {\n\n* restrict the rendered region down to a small square (e.g. add a conditional inside your render loop, to only process pixels within a certain region). You could also disable reflections.\n\n* bonus: use a space partitioning data structure to eliminate a ridiculous amount of unnecessary intersection tests that each pixel's ray otherwise has to perform. I forget if the course went into any detail on this or just left it 100% as an optional exercise. Anyway, instead of each ray performing an intersection test against all ~1M triangles only to find that for the vast majority there's no intersection at all (wasting a huge amount of time), the space partitioning structure will chop the number of intersection tests per ray down from ~1M to ~50 (~20,000x speedup). If you got all the other scenes working, there's a high chance the final scene will render just fine and you don't really need this optimization to finish the course. But it's a nice optional addon you could try doing once the course is over.\n\nAt first I did none of those things, and I saw the scene was taking forever to render. I think I added some logging on every Nth iteration to get a sense of progress, and it would have taken at least 15+ hours, possibly much more (can't remember). So adding OpenMP made it only take ~3-5 hours or something, and at that point I figured that was good enough and I walked away and let it finish running. Space partitioning would have been nice to add but I didn't have time, and wasn't required. Also, I was using a 2012 intel macbook with 2 cores, so YMMV significantly with a more recent machine with more (and faster) CPU cores.",

I’m used to the shortcuts, better interface, less crashes, I prefer the debugger when i place breakpoints, in my opinion better interface for resolving merge conflicts. For html and js it’s better to use webstorm, c++ is CLion and I think php is phpstorm specifically but you can also use php in webstorm. You can use plugins or use multiple languages sometimes in the same ide but they designed ide’s specifically for specific languages so you’ll have to research what to use best. Since you need an account and a license, your settings will sync over all jetbrains ide’s. As a student the ide’s are free to use, if you’re not than the licensing is still affordable with a package that you basically get all ide’s. You can buy seperate as well but I think it will be more expensive.",

No matter ... We'll just pretend that you are a skilled painter.\n\nNow imagine that someone comes up to you, saying: \"How to I get better at drawing? I'm not very artistic, but I like to think very logical, and my goal in drawing is to simply be able to make these drawings I see street-artists do, where a few simple lines suddenly resemble a duck or an elephant! I want to try those challenges and overtime get better at it!\"\n\nHow would you react, what would you tell them? I'd imagine that you'd get somewhat angry, tellin them that isn't what drawing is about, that is just learning some basic shapes and strokes, and repeating them over and over again, following a pattern like a robot! No, if they want to learn drawing, they should start by watching the world around them, note how light and shadows move, make sketches, thousands of sketches, practice, imagine, dream and practice over and over, not trying to copy those \"hack artists!\"\n\nBecause that is what leetcode and the rest is - it isn't about programming, it is about knowing and memorizing patterns for solutions to specific problems. There isn't even any problem solving involved - surely, you might be able to \"invent\" an algorithm that solves that particular problem, but that isn't what most people do, they just know of the correct algorithm to apply. And the only way of knowing, it to have been exposed to a large number of algorithms, and remembering (or being good at looking them up). Something an AI like ChatGPT is extremely good at - but still, it isn't really programming, just like drawing a \"remembered shape\" isn't really drawing.\n\n  \nIf that is still your goal, then you simply need to learn all the algorithms and remember them - it is boring stuff, and absolutely useless, but it can be done, and is done by a lot of over-eager students around the world. Just go through every article in this list: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Data\\_structures\\_and\\_algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Data_structures_and_algorithms) \\- read and implement every one - then you'll quickly see that most leetcode problems is similar to one of those.\n\nIf however you would like to learn to program, and actually solve real problems, then look at your program like you would look at creating a piece of art. Imagine the finished piece in your mind, begin with the rough sketches, implement some ideas, research parts you need to know more about, and gradually work your way towards the goal. That is what programming is supposed to be - not guessing at which algorithm some writer were thinking of when they designed the problem!",

I didn’t know where to look for answers.  \n\nNow I know that I have to study data structures to be able to understand how to solve logic coding problems.

Other times it seems it's because it's in their muscle memory: they get a question and, instead of listening to understand, they're listening to engineer a prompt. Instead of pulling from their pool of knowledge, they reach for the laptop. It can take 10-30 minutes to get the person into a frame of mind where they can remember and talk about their experiences instead of trying to give the \"right\" answer. At this point I'm thinking I need to make a meetup to help early career folks think like an engineer instead of a student. \n\nFwiw I've helped engineers from self taught to \"elite school\" grads, early career to sr staff (but haven't interviewed in a while). I'm involved in my local community and talk with other engineers about their new hires.

        "body": "This is not a forever problem; this is the inevitable outcome of a field that was in a hiring bubble during the past decade & during covid and which is in the continued process of a correction. People are really starting to grasp the reality that CS is different now, and this realization will only get more apparent as time goes on. Since most high school students who enrolled in CS during the last several years did so for the money, it's pretty obvious that most incoming high school students who possibly would have done so before are now going to pick something else by and large. Hence, we will likely begin to see enrollment decrease year by year, not least because of the upcoming enrollment cliff. Of course, there will still be high achievers, along with low achievers who are too naive to understand that CS has fundamentally changed. But I think that the middle achievers will be largely hollowed out such that in the end, it will become crystal clear who is worth hiring and who isn't worth hiring; and thus, the problem of resumes looking identical will go away, because now the quality distribution for new grads will be more bimodal and less uniform.\n\nAlso, even though I agree with you that offshoring is a real thing, the way you have characterized offshoring is kind of strange and seems to contradict your views on new grads. Talent didn't just suddenly 'grow' abroad;  apart from recently incoming juniors with potential, any people who were talented would have been talented before and it's not like they magically became talented during Covid. On top of that, it's not like talent grows on trees, as you can't just train anyone at all to become talented since there are certain untrainable innate characteristics which make people talented such as high IQ, innovative creativity, visuo-spatial capabilities and so forth. If that weren't the case, then surely all of the new grads could be \"grown\" by domestic companies hiring in-house, just like offshore employees are being \"grown\" by satellite offices. But like you said yourself, the median talent of new grads has deteriorated significantly and by now, they can't even do easy-medium leetcode problems and are essentially unfit for this field, as you also said. So this goes against your other idea that people can be made fit for this field. And as an aside, let's not pretend that talent doesn't vary by location. You're telling me that different countries which have all have extremely varied PISA scores in math, reading and science have the same amount of talent density? Please.",

The Laravel/PHP + DevOps combo is solid for consulting work too, and honestly the transition from agency owner to senior IC or technical consultant is way more natural than starting over with frontend frameworks you dont enjoy.",

If you're getting a lot of inbound interest that means the signal you're receiving is the market wants people like you.\n\nIf you're not getting that interest my advice is to try something different. Do some stuff on LinkedIn to raise your profile, maybe take a look at some JDs of the kinds of roles you're looking for and ask whether your resume accurately shows how good you would be at those jobs, or if it's missing information that could help you.\n\nI asked ChatGPT about this and, obviously take this with a grain of salt since it's a robot, but it suggested to me that the niche that good senior engineers are in is like \"person who can run projects\", people with lots of years of experience just pushin' code and gettin' paid don't get as much inbound since they're really only staff level on paper.\n\nNot sure what nugrads can do tho, it seems like the market is just awful for them.",

        "body": "Unionizing is a great idea but unfortunately there are problems with this idea that in my opinion this will exacerbate the problem. \n\nFirst and foremost, if software devs unionize then it will give the companies a golden opportunity to push for more AI and outsourcing. Simply because the people here are complaining about work hours, pay but hey over there in this other country we can abuse the living shit out of people and our operating costs are lower.\n\nSecondly, software developer position is highly dependent on the thing/service the company is trying to make. For example, a person sitting in pakistan or india can make the same website/app that any person any american software developer can make. Moreover, these people will bend over backwards to adjust to the american demand. \n\nThirdly, unions will demoralize and depress the high salaries one can find in tech companies. Again, for example pilots in air canada are paid bonkers and the union has to constantly fight against the corporation to hold a bargain. \n\nFourthly, the supply of software engineers is slightly higher than the demand at the current moment. This will overall negatively impact the strength of the movement. A new grad software developer doesn't have the leverage to bargain for higher salary because of inexperience.\n\nThis is however, not the end. If you want, push the law makers and politicians, collective force to lobby the government into taxing the companies which outsource or use more AI. The way I see the current problem in software industry is that, the big players want to cash in on the AI demand, the mid level companies are trying to make a product which will earn them the attention from big companies. The government is only interested in sucking rich peoples' cocks. There is nothing to stand in the way.\n\nOther commenter u/dontping mentioned some other pathways, which are viable but they demand more time and effort than the current market is willing to deploy. Don't get me wrong, this is a great idea but to do this there has to be a way to back industry into a corner without getting the economy fucked.",

From what you’ve said, it sounds like you may have been working on an older project and may not have much experience setting something up from scratch.\n\nIt seems to me like basically every backend job nowadays wants experience in: AWS or Google hosting tools, Docker, Node/Python/Java. Github actions or Jenkins. Know how to spin up an API, REST or GraphQL. Learn how to set up a DB, Mongo or Postgres or Dynamo. Learn how to do logging, reporting, and alerting.\n\nI don’t think every job will require UX but the more backend skills you have, the more likely you are to be a fit for what they need.",

My investigation found that it's been failing for almost a month and nobody noticed it. \n\n\nIt was just serendipity that Friday was when we were supposed to cut our big official release build. And that failed, ya know, because of this catastrophic problem nobody had noticed. \n\n\nFriday afternoon the build team gets leadership involved and somehow I'm invited to everything and it's just a bunch of teams who aren't even sure who owns this thing. Eventually we agree that it is either the build team or the infrastructure team, and they will both investigate. \n\n\nInfrastructure team got laid off and sent to India. Team is responsive, but clearly has no idea how to do the needful.\n\n\nThe icing on the cake is that our incremental builds take about an hour and a full build is closer to three.\n\n\nAnd it's so unreliable that our standard operating procedure is to just 'try it again'. A few times. \n\n\nIt used to be faster, but they virtualized our dev environments (to be clarify, I'm complaining both about how ridiculously long it is to build locally and also, how long it is with our automated pipelines. The specific failure was specific to our pipelines, and I guess nobody cared since it would pass locally. Truthfully, lots of teams are overburdened so nobody wants to spend time investigating stuff like this)\n\n\nI've literally had a single line change that took 15 minutes to write, take four days to get reviewed, tested and merged successfully.

The last 3 bad years of software are trimming the hiring pool from both ends. Older workers are fully getting out of tech after their last layoff. And the junior hiring pool has been crushed.\n\nI don't think they could keep up this hiring pattern for 5 more years. And even if every software engineers productivity goes up 2x or 3x. There are a lot of lesser tech companies that could expand and benefit from more capable software devs with better tools.\n\nAt least until they get AIs that can outthink humans reliably. I don't think that will be an LLM based system. So we are probably a few big innovations away from that.",

Also, there are times personal life or other factors may be impacting your work.\n\nI joined a high-performing team, but my personality is pretty laid back. There was always someone more familiar with the code (they wrote it). It wasn’t until they all moved to other projects, and I was given an opportunity that I got a lot better. I was more responsible for success or failure. When I had originally joined the team, I spent more time reading about World of Warcraft than improving myself. So, you can definitely become a stronger developer, but you have to make the effort. \n\nI do believe there are those with more innate talent, but there are plenty of cases of people wasting opportunities. \n\nAlso, take what some of these people say with a grain of salt. Some of them are preoccupied with building their branding and misrepresent a lot of stuff. Be wary whenever money, fame, and recognition are involved.

Those gaps spanned anywhere from DSA to not having a command of what i was coding. So I slowly filled those gaps, eventually I gave a solid interview and was made an offer.\n\nMy thing is, if I wasn't made an offer - maybe the other candidate did just a lil better. Maybe I shouldn't have hesitated on this answer, maybe I shoulda known that thing I shoulda known. I'm able to navigate through these interviews - but its just another candidate with theoretically a similar skillset, that gets to the offer. It's ME that needs to be better. \n\nI absolutely cannot imagine starting from scratch in a new area of work. I have twins, 3.5 y/o now. My finances are wrecked. But this is the kind of job and level role that can pay me what I believe I'm worth, so I can eventually dig myself out of that hole.

I remember that at one seminar we were given a list of 30 ideas for projects, with no requirements at all, things like:\n\n* \"4-way chess game\"\n* \"Musical composer\"\n* \"File browser and manager\"\n* etc.\n\nand it was up to us to come up with our own requirements and build something. Some of these projects were group work too, so that made it easier as you had other peers to brainstorm with.\n\nThat said, I wouldn't worry too much. Job interviews for juniors don't usually have you build a whole project from scratch, and when you join a company you will be supervised and given a lot of structure. I would suggest joining a more established company rather than an early startup, because they would offer the structure, the product and technical requirements, and you will be given ample support and guidance (ideally).\n\nAt the interview for my first job they had me write a small function to determine whether a given string was a palindrome (i.e. a word that reads the same forwards and backwards, such as \"madam\" or \"racecar\").

And while reducing cost is always a concern for a contracted workforce, generally in product companies, the thought process is a bit long-term.\n\nUsually, any decent boss would focus their energy on three things: a. Hiring good people  (with good skills and high ownership), b. Getting them excited about the domain and deepening their engagement in the company business by growing them, nurturing them to be a team player, finally, c. Weeding out the bad apples - hopefully fast.\n\nIn a long-term play, a few days, weeks, sometimes months of lean periods do pop up, and that’s the opportunity to clean house (reduce tech debt, refactor, cross-learn from other modules, do hackathons, and have fun, etc). And good bosses keep their own backlog of these things ready for these low periods.\n\nTech work is not as transactional as some other careers. The value generated by good engineers compounds with time as they improve their skills and understand the domain better. 'Keep them busy - no matter what'  attitude usually leads to a sub-optimal outcome.\n\nSo no, bosses don’t look for ways to cut their teams as soon as they run into a low patch.\n\nThis doesn’t apply to situations like contracting, a dying/loss-making company, bad performers, over-hiring (which happened right after COVID), and teams run by bad management/bosses.",

Don't bother finding out what they don't know, and let them know this say its okay to not know something. Don't let them flounder and meander if they obviously don't know, just move the conversation on. You only have a set amount of time to figure this person out.\n\n2. Let them show you what they do know and let them go into depth about it. If they have a project or past work experience this is a good place to start, ask them what they did, what decisions they made and if they might change those decisions in hindsight. \n\n3. Have prepared questions. This doesn't mean a script but you need to be able to move the conversation on if it gets stuck. Hopefully your company has good enough practices the topics for your interview are defined, but if they aren't you should know what skills/tech/aptitudes are important for your job since ideally you have them.\n\n4. You aren't trying to trick them, too many interviewers do this where they will ask a misleading question to see if the candidate just takes the bait. The problem is candidates are nervous and will always be hesitant to disagree with the interviewer. Keep questions straightforward and open ended. \n\n5. My most important advice especially if you are an early round interview, you aren't trying to find the number 1 candidate. You are trying to avoid the bottom 90 candidates. At the end of your interview (assuming your company has good hiring practices) you should be able to fill in these blanks about every candidate:\n\nI would/n't hire this person.\n\nIf we did hire them these are my concerns __________ .\n\nIf we did hire them here is where I think they would excel ________.",

Having rarely interviewed the perfect experience fit, I like to ask as much about their work as their familiarity with our tools to gauge how thoughtful they are as a developer.

Ask about a project they worked on if it's listed on their resume. \n\nMy favorite is to show them something that needs fixing and let them talk you through how they'd fix it.

The pay is also good state dependent, I made about 70k year 1, year 2 I was close to 6 figures, and the next several years I was ~120-200k depending on overtime and how much I wanted to work.\n\nThe negatives: you often get shit work days (weekends, nights), poor pto, work holidays, work in hazardous environments, it’s hard on your body, and you work with people who HR would have a meltdown if they heard for 5 minutes (gay jokes, teasing you, political talk, stuff some aren’t comfortable with I didn’t mind but I’ve seen several people quit a week or 2 in over it). \n\nI’d recommend industrial if you go the path. It’s more dangerous as you work with big stuff but you keep plants running like you can work for a refinery, brewery, stuff like that. You aren’t in peoples houses and you aren’t messing with code stuff all the time and you have constant work, they usually get paid the best depending on the place.\n\nIf you have any questions or anyone else does feel free to ask.

Also having associates use their own equipment for training.\n\nOne of the craziest things I experienced was that we spent some time learning AWS.

There are also people who literally do not care. Having worked with some hiring teams, there are devs who care more about their work deliverables than interviews. It's possible the feedback you received is valid, it's also possible it's wrong. \n\nThat being said, I'm not sure you should be so sure you submitted what they were looking for. I worked at a place that intentionally left take-home assignments vague, because they wanted people to impress them. One person made a solution that technically did what was asked, and my assumption is they knew what they were doing, but the submission was so non-standard, we ended up rejecting them and wasting everyone's time. \n\nI think you just need to realize hiring is an imperfect process, and some company passing on you isn't necessarily an accurate assessment of your ability to do the work. You have to just forget those who passed on you and keep looking for a job that will fit. \n\nAlso, don't assume people are spending a lot of time doing a really personalized candidate tracking process. They probably just clicked a \"reject\" button in some candidate tracking software, and you got an automated message.

But I joined in high school and 3 weeks after graduation I was in boot camp because I had no plan for my life. It’s hard to explain but my advice, whatever it’s worth, is to keep your job and work your way up the economic ladder. Even if you went in as an officer, you’re losing 85-90% of your paycheck. If I were you, I would stay and keep working because the money you can and will make will provide the travel and fun experiences you desire. Sure they won’t be exactly the same as creating some relationships, however, not all relationships in the military are good. You will have corrupt seniors harm your promotions if you don’t play by their rules, you’ll go places and do jobs you absolutely hate doing. That’s why I say it’s better to be financially independent and choose what experiences you want rather than maybe experience them by chance. I never got the chance to go to Russia or Australia and those countries were the stuff of legends. But you can go there now where you’re already at. I feel like I keep saying the same thing differently, but I guess that’s my point. You don’t need to join the military to have experiences someone else got to have when you can make those experiences with the money and freedom you possess right now. If you want to feel like you’ve contributed to the welfare of the country then I would recommend you get hired at a tech company that fulfills that wish.

Pick a specialty you like, and start building large projects with it using popular libraries so you can get a feel for how it all works together. Focus on using the framework and libraries that the industry commonly uses first, you want those names on your resume and cover letter. \n\n>but I feel like machine learning is too competitive now I am not really a top programmer material \n\nThe entire industry is competitive as hell, ML, like all CS, has roles for top talent hat make the **REALLY** big money, and roles for regular developers who are still learning or just want a stable job. When you look on social media, or listen to others, you're only hearing about the top developers, you don't hear about Jim who spends his days doing the grunt work that allows the top developers to have the time to do what they do. You don't need to be  genius to be a great developer, you just need to build and listen/learn from your colleagues every step of the way. And maybe in 10-15 years you'll be a top developer, or maybe you'll prefer work life balance and just be a regular developer like the vast majority of us are. \n\n>What are some directions I should chase? \n\nhttps://roadmap.sh/machine-learning\n\nLearn from those who came before and follow their path, or make your own path, but you'll have to learn the same basic things so following other people's paths is generally more efficient.\n\nAlso, as someone else mentioned, you will almost certainly need to learn leetcode questions. Don't panic they're easier than most people think. The easy level questions shoudln't be too hard, go through 20-30 of them to see what sorts of questions you'll be asked. But before moving to medium or hard, first learn DS/A. Data Structures and Algorithms is what Leetcode is there to test (not entirely, but basically). Most jobs will almost never need it, but really complex problems solved at scale (think Google Map's directions handling hundreds of millions of requests a minute) do, so Google started using these questions to test their recruits and the rest of the industry couldn't be bothered to make their own interviews, so now we all have to answer them. \n\nThis youtube channel has some great lessons on how DSA/Leetcode all works:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@mycodeschool\n\nThey don't cover every element of DSA but do cover the most common. Either watch a video, then go to neetcode.io and practice the questions related to that video, or get a question on neetcode.io, look at the answers, then go find the videos that cover the answers and watch the video and then learn how and why the answers work. Sorry if that's unclear, my point is don't sit and try to \"learn\" how to answer leetcode questiosn on your own, lots of them are not \"intuitive\" and you will only get annoyed. It's much simpler to understand the question, then find the answer soemone else already fine tuned and learn that. If you want to fix a car, you don't just go smashing on things and see what happens, you get the manual. For leetcode, DSA and neetcode.io togehter, are your manual. \n\nAnd no, you don't need to pay for neetcode.io for it to be incredibly useful, you get better organization if you pay, but it's all still very usable for free. Though I will say, its' a pretty useful site, so I did end up paying, but I actually got the lifetime membership after I got my job and had some money coming it. More of a \"thank you\" than anything else, plus I'll have it for my next job hunt, though hopefully leetcode questions will be fully gone by then, they're definitely starting to disappear which is nice.",

What one company calls a Senior SWE, may be another company's SWE 1. What one company considers a Junior SWE, another company might consider them a Senior SWE.\n\nMy new grad company for example tossed the \"Senior\" word at people after 2 YOE. Does that mean those people are suddenly Senior industry-wide? Obviously not. That was just that single company's title hierarchy.\n\nCompare that to the next company I joined, which wouldn't consider calling anybody \"Senior\" until at least 7-8 YOE.\n\nThe roles themselves can differ too. At some companies a Staff SWE is just a regular IC with a lot of experience, and churns out code on a single team like everyone else. At other companies, a Staff SWE is much closer to management than it is SWE. At other companies still, a Staff SWE serves as an architect role and is working across several dev teams providing technical leadership. So just because Company A called you a \"Staff SWE\", doesn't mean you meet the expectations of what Company B has for a Staff SWE.\n\nEvery company has their own hierarchy, with their own expecations. Downlevels, and *uplevels*, are just the company mapping you onto their hierarchy.",

After my screen I received a downlevel to \"mid\" after the screen, and only earned back Senior when I went through the whole cycle. My teammate came in senior from another big tech company, and was hired as mid.   \n  \nLooking at our interview system with an internal view, it's designed to take \"below\" \"at\" or \"above\" level feedback. So you might get tracked at \"mid\" for the cycle, but an upward departure in some candidates is planned for. That's just what it takes to make senior.\n\nit's not really about YOE (at least not for my job), but about the roles you've played on teams , your responsibility, and track record of technical execution. For instance, I was at a scale up database startup, filled with ex-Meta engineers, but I was still rejected at one big tech company over: \"lack of technical leadership for long term projects\".  I was a tech lead, but I just hadn't lead a team on a project that lasted long enough. Fair call.\n\nI ended up going to a better company and getting that experience, so I believe that was a false negative. I don't blame them, in this job market you hire for the skills people have, not rely on personal growth to meet your business needs, and the rest is just extra. This is a lot different than the market in 2015 when I built a career off \"good experience, smart learner, grow into it\", but that's just the way it goes in a down market.",

These companies are huge with around 100k employees so it’s impossible to have widespread cultural changes quickly). \n\nBaked into the agile process is the decoupling from requirements driving code and moving towards user stories. By the book agile means that every user story has an acceptance criteria which resembles a unit test. This means teams (again, not everywhere but it is slowly propagating as a culture) perform test driven development where they inherently do red-green-refactor. \n\nBuilt in the development process, devs usually are presented a failing TDD/BDD style acceptance criteria to get started (red), they write just enough code to pass the test (green), and they (refactor) the code with the safety of the tests performing safe operations from Fowler’s refactoring book that may use GoF patterns. Some teams have a senior engineer or software architect that write user stories or tests that explicitly force software into a particular architecture or forces a design pattern in order to be implementable. \n\nSo yes, we do refactor but it’s baked into the process. Code doesn’t break because it is common to have projects have a strict requirement for 80-100% test coverage. Unit testing is just one level. We have integration, system, and end-to-end tests with real hardware in a lab. There are projects that try to redo an entire existing system, but they tend to be wasteful and expensive.",

        "body": ">just so you can have easier life with maintaining\n\nYou're dismissing the value of refactoring... it's not so I can have an \"easier life\", although that can be a side effect. The goal of refactoring is to make the system easier to extend, update, and understand.\n\nWhen you have a brittle system, actual feature changes are significantly more likely to break production.\n\nWhen you have a difficult to extend system, seemingly simple feature changes can take months (or years!) to complete, costing the company tons of money and time.\n\nWhen you have a difficult to understand system, your employees because a single point of failure. When one person leaves the company, now you have to find their replacement or else the project timeline gets delayed by several more months. But when the system itself is cryptic and difficult to understand/modify, it takes significantly more time to onboard a new employee, easily resulting in a year+ of lost productivity. That high onboard cost can often get teams into a situation where *all* their developers leave, and now you have a fresh team of people that don't understand the codebase. This is how \"black boxes\" get created, by not refactoring combined with turnover.\n\nAll this kinda plays into retention, which exacerbates everything. A complex, brittle, difficult to work with, system is *not* pleasant to work on. If management has no interest in letting the SWE's improve that system, then those SWE's won't be staying at that company for very long. High turnover introduces new developers, who are significantly more likely to break prod, while also having a very long and expensive onboarding process.\n\nSo yeah, in critical areas, you *need* to refactor. The costs of not doing it aren't always immediate, but it's significantly more dangerous than not refactoring at all. Any halfway competent engineering manager will be going to bat for their SWE's to refactor against product and upper management. This is the balance of a healthy SWE team. Product is pushing for features, upper management is pushing for results/money, engineering management is pushing for a stable/maintainable/extendable codebase. If either of those 3 prongs get an inordinate say, you're on a toxic team.\n\nThat said, there are very well defined approaches to refactoring a legacy codebase. Writing a massive PR with +10000/-12000 isn't the way to do it. That's a high risk PR whether it's a refactor or a new feature. Refactors can be done in small chunks, and done using common design patterns that reduce risk.",

Feeling trapped between financial obligations, career dissatisfaction, and the loyalty you feel towards your team, especially with such significant projects on the horizon, must be incredibly isolating. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed when facing such critical decisions, particularly when they involve your health, your peace of mind, and your ability to start a family. When you're dealing with such frequent panic attacks and the daily drain of a job you dislike, it's natural for your brain to feel like it's in overdrive, making it hard to see a clear path forward. Prioritizing your mental health is never a sacrifice; it's an investment in every other aspect of your life, especially when you're considering bringing a child into the world. It might be helpful to explore different ways to manage the acute symptoms of anxiety, especially since your current medication situation is changing. Sometimes just having a toolkit of techniques can make a big difference in those overwhelming moments. There's a free [podcast](https://youtu.be/72ZhaR-aWNI) that covers common anxiety symptoms, coping strategies, breathing exercises, and techniques for controlling panic attacks, which you might find useful to listen to in your own time as you navigate these challenges. Thinking about your long-term health and happiness is really important here, not just for you but for your future family. God bless.",

Nobody would touch me without a degree. I went and got a degree circa 2017 and I can say unequivocally that college is not an educational institution, it's a licensing gauntlet. You're bouncing from ego to ego of the full time teaching staff that have never been in the private sector, but are charged in preparing you for it. I wrote essays on the \"Browser Wars,\" traced some algorithms, tried out some new programming languages, but NOTHING from college prepared me better for my fulltime career. \n\nI actually did a bootcamp for the time that I had my degree, yoe and still couldn't get interviews because my history was in legacy systems (COBOL + Mainframe). So everyone reading those COBOL developers are drowning in offers, just know that's a very hurtful clickbait lol. But the bootcamp gave me a full stack experience that tripled anything of value from college, since we used a template of Flask. That bootcamp gave me 90% of my modern view of development work. I started working personal projects until I got hired to do API work.   \n  \nThere's nothing of any value from my undergrad degree. I answer these because I'm a contrast for some of your worldview. I experienced it in the weird oddball way that OP highlighted. I broke into the career, then got my degree, then continued my career. Calc 2 and 3 didn't make me a better developer, it made me better at test taking and studying. Data Structures and Algorithms were already known, but I didn't know what was available in modern and other languages from COBOL. I was working in procedural languages, so I got an OOP lesson, which was neat, and I probably had the best OOP professor who added in how he uses it practically which is what many of my classes taught by academics were missing. My electives were taught by academics and did not help me apply much of my core studies. A bioninformatics class had given me hope, but the teacher just read from the book and power points and we had a 3-4 week intro to what bioinformatics is and the tools used before getting our hands on anything. My DevOps class opened where the professor asked us \"What is DevOps,\" and started taking notes and building that syllabus on the first day. We didn't touch git until our software engineering final group project and most of the class couldn't figure it out.  \n  \nI solemnly promise that I did not need to get a bachelor's degree and am now Senior level in my shop. The classes were full of old material taught identically for over a decade. The math just simply didn't coincide with computer science lessons, like I've heard some have. It was hard, It was messy. But luckily I experienced that prior to learning how to code for the military and already had a prideful ego. I think everyone needs to get discipline and experience hard/dark times to really push themselves. But academically at a mid-tier state school, I did not become better for it.",

My team recently laid off a new mom after her maternity leave for \"performance\" (the company was not performing well and pushed everyone to work longer hours which she did not do) and it felt very scummy.\n\nI feel like you have 3 routes you can go. The first is to find a job at a company that has a relaxed WLB. That's hard to do on command, at any company, in any role. Historically the best option has been government work, which right now is more volatile than it has been in the past. When I've seen this work out for people in the private sector, the situation is usually that they got hired into a \"boring\" company that doesn't pay particularly well, and they stayed long enough that they're performing well and worth more in the market vs. their current job so therefore they have the leverage to push for a great WLB. This isn't your situation. So if you can find a company like this, great! But I wouldn't bet the house on it.\n\nOption two is to accept that you're going to end up working longer hours than you want to for a while. I don't think it actually matters whether you stay in software or pivot to sales, PM, solutions engineering, or recruiting (which are the most common pivot options). Those may be more people oriented and may be a better fit if that's what you want in a job, but you aren't necessarily more likely to stay employed, or have an easier time finding work. This is kind of the time where leaning on family for help with the kid is going to make a big difference.\n\nOption three is to take a few years off until the kid is in school.",

Just like any other sort of writing. \n\nThere are of course some general principles that tend to make things better, and it is certainly possible to make *horribly unclear* code, but past a certain point a lot of it really is a matter of taste.\n\nSo essentially a person who has strong opinions about specific details of how code should be written is similar to a person who thinks their preferred genre of music is superior to others, or otherwise thinks their taste is superior -- they are wrong, but it's going to be very difficult to convince them of that, and the more persuasive you are the more they will probably dig in and get pissed at you.\n\nSo you'll need to decide which things *you* care about and which things you don't. \n\nIf you don't actually care about something, just go along with what they want and smile and nod anytime they try to justify it, content that they're trying to justify it to themselves as much as to you.\n\nIf you do care, really think again about whether you actually do care. Lots of people don't actually care about things they fight for but rather let ego get tied up in it and are instead fighting over ego. Try to avoid that if possible. So really think about whether you genuinely do care.\n\nAnd if you genuinely do, try to act in good faith. Explain what you think, then invite them to explain what they think and walk you through their thought process and be genuinely open to it. They might actually have good reasons, and so *you* should be open to changing *your* mind. But inviting them to explain will both make them feel like they are valued (which is important to them if they have strong opinions about how the code should be written) and also let them talk themselves out of ideas that are bad (like, if you explain a good idea and ask them to explain theirs, they will have a hard time denying yours is better if they actually have to explain it, and because it is them talking it through and deciding they will be more likely to compromise than if you order them to).\n\nInviting them to explain also gets both of you on the same side -- rather than arguing you are instead both looking at the same problem and talking about it as a thing separate from yourselves. And that change in perspective is helpful -- it makes them feel less like *they* are being devalued if their ideas aren't used.\n\nIn my experience, most workers do ultimately want to get along and do good stuff, and if you can diffuse their defense mechanisms and avoid getting defensive yourself you can usually find a common ground.\n\nBut if a person truly is an asshole and can't be reasoned with and truly is my way or the high way, and you really do care about the thing they're digging in on, your best bet is probably to try to go around them. Build support for others / get others to validate your view. After all, if the person is an asshole to you then they have probably been an asshole to others as well, and so you probably will find support. Try to avoid getting ego involved, as that will only make it harder and also pull you into petty drama.",

But ofc you could say I use patterns.\n\nDI is a pattern and I pray people are at least using that for testability purposes.\n\nI mostly tend to refactor into patterns that emerge from the first pass of implementation. I think if you're starting with a design pattern, and working backwards, that's really backwards. Sometimes with enough experience you short-circuit the logic though. For example, I'm a big fan of step builder pattern in the main language I use ( Rust ). Why? It's pretty ergonomic and it makes it so invalidly using the API is a compiler error rather than a runtime error. So whenever I have a highly customized struct or state machine, I tend to lean towards step builder off of prior experience. But I also don't just roam the codebase with patterns in my hand ready to force them anywhere.",

So, its probably quite uncommon that most people aren't using design patterns in some capacity.\n\nThat being said, I think design patterns are a thing you should be able to understand and reason about but I actually think they are overused and can be harmful, hot take incoming and I'm sure I'm gunna get downvoted into oblivion.\n\nThe problem is design patterns draw your focus away from the problem you are solving and make you focus on the organization of the code itself. Nothing about design patterns makes you're code A) correct or B) performant, and most the time you end up taking what was a really simple problem and making it wayyyyy over engineered and over abstracted.\n\n  \nThe worst is when people go to build out something and they start with a design pattern in mind that they want to use and the first implementation is driven by that pattern, rather than the actual problem that needs to get solved. Outside of stuff prescribed by a frameworks, starting with a pattern is a terrible idea, you have no idea what functioning code will look like and even worse, you have no idea if a pattern is even necessary for what you are trying to accomplish. \n\nDepending on what patterns you are even using, you may actually be affecting the compilers ability to optimize the instruction set because it can't reason about the amount of misdirection you have introduced into the code.\n\nI'm not saying there is never a use case for design patterns, but more often than not, if you just keep it simple and straight forward, your life will be easier. At a minimum, get the thing working and see if a pattern can be applied, never start with design patterns.",

You buy your servers from Dell, HP or similar and then rack them. That's then paid rather than paying $$$ to AWS, Azure, GCP or similar. Cons are that you're limited on what hardware you have deployed - you can't just spin up more hardware quickly. Also you'll be responsible for maintaining this hardware, and the corresponding operating systems etc on it. It can be cheaper, but the overheads mean that it's not necessarily a simple choice, in particular if you need to hire co location space etc - all of this adds up quickly.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'd go for cloud first and only go on prem if there was a very good reason for it, and that all of the points I made above had been considered.",

Also you might have meetings at anywhere in work hours.\n\nSo you cannot simply work 2-10 because you want to. That means nobody can reach you before 2, and you won’t make it to meetings before 2.\n\nIn my experience permanent deviations from work hours usually require you have a special situation and need accommodation for that. Then your manager can arrange this and everybody knows they cannot reach you at some hours. And meetings that need to involve you are not scheduled to those hours. But even in this case 2-10 is a big stretch. Practically no company will support this permanently.\n\nI sometimes do and see people do something else: You start your day at the beginning of the work hours, check in and be available but do not actively work. When somebody needs to reach you, you respond. If you have a meeting you join. Then when it’s 2, you start actively working. After official work hours end you continue working until 10, but tone the communication down and stop answering to people who want to reach out, until next day. But this is usually more difficult than working regular hours. And I only do this temporary basis. Edit: Apparently this only makes sense for remote work. If you need to go to office at 9, there is no sense in not actively working.",

You got a CS degree and that is a testament to your knowledge and ability to learn and grow in this field.\n\nI don’t know what companies are looking for with respect to new grads these days. It used to be the case that companies hired knowing you had zero experience but the capacity to learn and grow into the role. These days, since there’s so many new grad applicants, the bar for hiring has been raised and so you’ll need to improve your resume to get interviews and improve your interview skills to increase the odds of performing well.\n\nThink of it as levels in a game, you'll want to focus your energy on one level at a time (more or less). Since you're not landing interviews, this the first level to pass. Get constant feedback on your resume. You should be iterating on it — share it with friends or redditors to get feedback, make improvements, and send it out to companies (job boards, networking, etc). If you get callbacks, this means your resume is good enough. If not, keep doing that iterative feedback loop until you do. \n\nOnce you feel you're landing interviews a bit more consistently, then you'll need to focus on the interview rounds. I don't really know what that entails for new grads, but you seem to be on the right track. Practicing leetcode as a way to prove your understanding of DSA is good. Working on personal projects is also good. Keep track of what problems you encounter and what you did to solve them, and be able to communicate that. They don't expect you to be an expert, just want to know how you think and tackle problems. It's great that you're focusing on infra and LLM projects btw. There's no right or wrong path here, the field is too broad so it's best to do what you're interested in because enjoyment is a crucial recipe for making progress and preventing burnout. It's better to have some depth here rather than shallow breadth. \n\nIt really sucks that this is the market you’re graduating into, but you’re definitely not a fraud, and you're definitely not alone in this experience.

A lot of our stuff is internal, so its gonna be new anyway. I think just have a good foundation, and learn on the job is the best. \n\nFor the job part: If you don't have the job or interview, focus on getting the interview. if you got the interview, focus on passing the interview.\n\nWorry about the not knowing things part after you get the job. Not all companies have a good onboarding/ramp-up time for you, but that's not something you can control anyway. \n\n  \nOnce you get there, find out what you need to know for your team's projects and tech stack. Go from there.\n\nI didn't have AI to help me when I started, but I think AI makes it way easier to learn quickly nowadays. Use it to understand the code base. Like if you need to modify a part of something in the codebase, use AI to find where the code is and understand what patterns this codebase use and get suggestions.\n\nNeed to build something from scratch? Use AI to quickly understand parts of the tech stack you don't understand. Feed it documentation and ask questions. Clarify your understanding, but be skeptical about what it tells you. ask it to confirm, ask it for direct reference sin the documentation if you're unsure.\n\nI don't really know what's best for a junior in this era of AI-assisted tools. But my personal opinion is that you use it to augment your learning potential and gain experience. Once you have more experience, perhaps you can use it to vibe code or output tons of code. Because at least, you tell tell if the output is good or bad.",

        "body": "The problem with academic programming in school is that business has an entirely different set of needs, tools and development processes. As a junior-level person, you're not expected to know all that stuff. There are a couple of exceptions to this rule -- startups frequently expect new grads to know as much and be able to perform at the level a senior with full implementation level knowledge of their tech stack in the first week. FAANGs might also have higher expectations and be more unforgiving as well, depending on the FAANG.\n\n\nLarger corporations that aren't FAANG will generally have well established IT groups who can offer a decent level of mentorship. Maybe focus on trying to find a spot at one of those.\n\n\nThe more you know in general the better. Being able to set up docker instances and CI/CD pipelines is a pretty good skill to have, even if you don't find devops particularly interesting. You might even want to go look at hashicorp's terraform and tools like that, that allow you to stand up a huge amount of infrastructure with the wave of a hand. I don't particularly care for terraform's configuration, would much rather do it in python, but it's still a pretty neat tool and a good one to have in your toolbox. You are very much building out a toolbox now, and it's good to know the things you have at your disposal.\n\n\nI wouldn't suggest coding directly with AI. There are a couple reasons for that and your instincts are good that if you just blindly copy and paste AI code, you're not really going to learn anything. Poke at the problem a bit and use the AI for inspiration. If it writes code for you, try to read and understand it and possibly even rearrange it a bit. Rather than \"Write some code to do X\", focus on \"How do I do X\" and try to understand the underlying concepts.\n\n\nAlso, relax! Back in the 80's when I was getting started, there was already way more to know about this field than any single person could know. Math has been like that since Isaac Newton's day -- before him, one single person could know everything there was to know about math. He gave us the map to an infinite landscape. Programming is similar, an infinite landscape of the mind. Don't try to understand it all at once and accept that there will be things you couldn't have even imagined were out there. Maybe you'll even invent one of them one day!\n\n\nGot a couple of funny stories for you if you care to keep reading.\n\n\nFunny story about relaxing: I decided to learn how to skydive when I was in my early 40's. My instructors kept telling me to relax. And I was all like \"I'M ABOUT TO JUMP OUT OF AN AIRPLANE! I AM NOT GOING TO RELAX!\" A few months later I went to the indoor skydiving wind tunnel and told my instructor I just wanted to mess around today and not focus on learning anything. As soon as I hit the wind I felt my whole body relax and I realized that *I'd never done that before!* And I flew so well that day. And knowing how to relax, my driving (which I'd been doing for ~30 years at that point) immediately improved as well. It took a somewhat extreme experience to get me to that point, and it's something I wish I'd learned much earlier in my life.\n\n\nFunny story about people skills: Empathy is a human superpower. We have the ability to think about what another person might be thinking and feeling and act on how we think they're feeling. Hone that power to a fine edge and it's as close to telepathy as we're gonna get. At some point along the way, I found that while reading code, I could get a sense of how well the programmer who wrote it understood the requirements and even their mood and how they were feeling when they wrote the code. It's weird when it happens.\n\n\nSo back in the poker craze of the early 2000s there were a bunch of guys around who'd go to bars and set up tables to run free poker tournaments. They'd arrange to get a small kickback from the bar for each customer they brought in. I got laid off from a company I was working for at the time so I started frequenting these tournaments, as they were free to enter and usually offered a free $30 bar tab to the winner of the tournament. I could pick up one or two of those a week and get one or two halfway decent meals out of them. Playing poker taught me to look at people. I can't read people as well as I can read code, but the first time I knew what a guy's hand was just from watching him while he was thinking about betting, I felt like a sorcerer.\n\n\nSo learn what you can about computers, but also learn what you can about yourself and the species you belong to. You'll find some surprising things there too, I think.",

I found a lot of people are more likely to bomb those than the coding stuff. Fortunately the amount of studying you have to do there is small for the amount of value you get out of it\n\nPersonally I would never skip an interview. Every interview is at worst practice. You need to learn to accept failure and move on\n\nEDIT: Folks get a ton of resumes now, the fact that they decided to spend time on you means they want you.

As you scale you gain more leverage to incentivize companies/clients to implement their own pre-processing (or provide as a paid service) to gain access to your tool. Probably worthwhile to keep the client-supplied data in a different database for posterity.\n\nThis is pretty basic first-principles stuff but I’ve been shocked how many people don’t do this kind of thing",

Nobody loans someone money thinking \"This person sucks, pretty sure they're gonna fuck me\".\n\nThere's 2 very different questions baked into your post. One is how to bill yourself. The other, and one you're neglecting, is doing business with family/friends.\n\nGo ahead. Google what doing business with family/friends is like. No matter how good my sister's tech idea might be, in no world would I ever consider working for her. Same for my friends. My friends are very smart, they have lots of good ideas. But we're friends. Not co-workers. That's why I'll never in a million years do *any* sort of work for them.\n\nIt's very well established that you should never do business with friends/family. And if you do, you should do so expecting to never be paid. You're working for free. If you expect to be paid, you should not do the work.\n\nFor the other side of the question, you mention you have an aversion to an hourly wage..... why? There's a reason that's what a lot of freelancers do. There's lots of hidden costs you don't think of that can pop up during a project. It's really tough to just say \"Yeah, just pay me $X\". If any of a million things come up, $X suddenly turns into $X+$10k. Now you're out a bunch of money because you tried to do an upfront cost versus an hourly rate.\n\nAs for the actual rate, a lot of SWE's tend to charge $50-100 per hour.",

It's tough. And some people can be very condescending and difficult to work with. \nI found a new job in the country I currently live in for this very reason and I will give my resignation very soon. \n\nJust remember, we are always being held to higher standards when it comes to technical skills. Because their assumption is that we are just not as technical as them. They don't do it consciously and if you mention it to them as a feedback to your manager they will 100% get defensive and you will come across as \"oversensitive and blaming them for sexism instead of responding positively to their feedback\". \nBut it's been my experience, my friends' experience and I ve seen it countless times.\nThere have been times that I saw men in my team doing things in a certain way and their PRs got merged. I tried to use their approach and my PR got scrutinized. \nI try to just stay on the facts, avoid making any accusations, just sharing code snippets and say \" we used this approach here, how is it different now?\". Most of the time, they don't have an answer.\n\nJust try to look at your output objectively. Are they really right to what they are saying? If not, try to remind yourself that your output is just being scrutinized much more than theirs. If yes, try to improve on the things they are right and also document what you worked on/what you did to improve. \n\nI also found that these issues significantly reduce when I work in teams with a more balanced gender ratios. My current experience at this job, has been really extreme and it makes sense since I am literally the only woman in a team of 15+ people.\n\nI wish you good luck! ❤️",

I don't think it's for everyone, there can be strict deadlines, and usually your opinion for what to do is valued to a certain extent.\n\nIn this hypothetical scenario:\n\nYou need to solve this problem and you hypothesize that a new service that does XYZ should address this. You can build it as a microservice and plug it into your org's infrastructure pretty well. It might take some time to get off the ground, but it's technically sound and tech leads sign off on it. You need maybe 3-4 months with 3-4 engineers.\n\nInternal tools might be like \"yeah let's do it\". Things you work on are probably here to stay for a long time.\n\nA product team might be like \"can't we just implement some new models and cram it into service ABC?\" The answer is yes, it'll take maybe 1-2 months, but it'll be messy and you need to \"force\" it.

Take time to reflect on the answers to questions AND how you came across as. I've been in interview debriefs where we had a technically great candidate, but the person's soft skills were awful. In my interview, I was constantly interrupted, told me I was wrong, told me that they didn't care about getting the job because their current job was better, etc. The conclusion was \"this person is technically smart, but I wouldn't want to work with this person\" and so we passed on the candidate.\n\nIf you're working for 7+ years then you have more than enough opportunities to show why you're a senior dev. Talk about projects you led, mentorship opportunities, etc. Be kind. Literally be someone you would want to work with.",

My last company did a reverse-version of this for every manager role. “Promote the internal person, with 5+ yoe, already doing the managerial work, to the role?

The only reason to stay at your current job would be financial stability, but if this new one pays close to what you’re making now and lines up with your long term goals, it’s worth considering. For your interview, brush up on basic IT support and management topics like Active Directory, ticketing systems, networking fundamentals, and ITIL concepts. Since it’s a manager position, you might need to talk about how you handle team performance, communication, and customer issues.",

Just spend your year making connections, taking to profs, try to basically get some experience on resume, it could even be a tutor position. Then also add see if you can make a project and try to get some users and maybe even document it publicly.\n\nAll to say it’s ok and normal to worry but there are plenty of things you can do in order to better increase your chances.
