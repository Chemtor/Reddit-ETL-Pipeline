Network heavily with people adjacent to that team on LinkedIn or through real introductions from a senior person in the company (this works more often than you think) and try to get on the radar of the recruiters in a non desperate way(The variance here is massive)\n\nIn the end, once you’re “in” . .

It's both instructive and entertaining, with the perfect geeky touch.\n\n\nI'm surprised by the performance of some sql implementations. The recursive CTEs should be tough to optimize for the engines, as your query filters diverging series early (not vector friendly). I'd love to understand how it works inside.\n\n\nAnother question is how those benchmarks scale wrt pixel resolution and divergence threshold. I suspect databases will suffer more than the others (exponential volume because of self joins?) but it's just a hunch.",

It Has to be able to rewrite all of the data in scope so that the ordering can work properly, so it would necessarily rewrite all the data. That would conflict with concurrent merge/update/delete operations, as at the time of finishing the ZOrder you would revert the rewritten data. However, if you run ZOrder on a single partition, then you can still merge/update/delete data in other partitions.\n\nThe same goes for performing merge operations -- if you can isolate them to a single partition then the system can know for certain that you could not have possibly rewritten data outside that partition, so you can have concurrent merges working on different partitions.\n\nBut that's all you really need it for now. You might add it for `is_active` on an SCD2 table because you will generally fundamentally only be updating current data and frequently only querying it, but you wouldn't be trying to optimise tables with partitioning. The new metadata-driven clustering is much more flexible and effective at that.",

It's not just metadata (although there are). If your clustering keys change, then the files do need to be rewritten. (Edit: to benefit from the new clustering. But Databricks actually allows keeping old files with a previous clustering, see reply.)\n\nPlease let me know if you have a source stating otherwise or if I misunderstood your comment.\n\nThe difference between liquid clustering and simple clustering, is that liquid clustering is dynamic based on the access pattern statistics. If your access pattern is shifting, the optimizer will decide at some point that it is worth it to rewrite some files to reduce cost.  \nThis dynamic aspect is great, but it may also create new unexpected costs. \n\nA quick way to remember the main difference between partitioning and clustering: \n\n- partitioning → directories: determines which subdirectory a record goes into.\n- clustering → files: determines which specific file a record goes into and how records are arranged within files.",

I modelled everything myself, in a working solution, where the data indeed was really messy. It helped me tremendously, compared the on on-job-training my DE colleagues got. And later on I was dragged on to DE projects in various roles, and while not certain to get your anything, it sure can help a ton.\n* As for point 3: In general true, especially from a technical point of view. But in my part of the world, northern Europe it is becoming more the standard, that customers ask for x% of consultants to have Y certificates. So with a more commercial point of view, you can say, that while everyone can study and get Databricks' data engineer associate+engineer data professional without useful experience, they matter for contracts. And if you have the choice between hiring 2 candidates that are rated quite equal, I would take the person with the certifications, because you don't have to ask the new guy take certs on company time.\n\n\nAs for your last point, with no number; that is where I really disagree. The majority don't work in companies where they work with the most modern tech. Then you let your company decide the ceiling of your skills/knowledge. The few paid certifications and courses your get on company time every year is usually focused on already established topics. \n\nWhen your boss (or his boss(es)) asks about stuff from outside the regular box it is worth a lot to be able to know about it. You get to lead test projects, you get to be placed on actual projects. Or you learn some technique or alternatives solutions that can benefit you on the job.

Essentially, almost all offshored employees were laid off, and all contracts canceled.\n\nThe business argument that was made was basically: \"It costs almost as much to employ Chinese DEs as in the US, with comparable competency levels, but a timezone gap issue. Meanwhile, we can employ 2-3 Indian employees/contractors for the cost of one competent US employee, but not only is there a timezone gap, there are seemingly a ton of communication issues, like sudden unannounced PTO/Holidays taken during product launches for example, and even when you can reach them, you're lucky if even 1 of these employees can write basic SQL code.\"\n\nThe result was a much more robust vetting of US based employees, including several rounds of technical interviews, and thorough background checks...\n\nEdit to add context: The hiring practices when offshoring to India were pathetically lackadaisical.\n\nBasically, the process was:  \nRecruiter: \"Do you know SQL?\"  \nCandidate: \"Yes\"  \nRecruiter: \"Are you willing to work for peanuts? (~30-40% of US-based DE)\"  \nCandidate: \"Yes\"  \nRecruiter: \"You're hired!\"  \nCandidate: \"Yes\"  \nRecruiter: \"Great!

(we've lost quality candidates because of this...)\n\nSo yeah, you reap what you sow, and all that.",

In particular, data contracts require preventive enforcement, and if you are profiling data, it means incorrect data has already been written to database systems and is propagating across the business. If anything, I argue that data profiling is more closely tied to data observability, which complements data contracts but serves a different purpose.\n\nI argue that data contracts need enforcement where data is either first generated, captured, or ingested. In the Glassdoor case study above, they use static code analysis to extract metadata from the code to determine what function calls in the application relate to a data asset. Then apply LLMs to this highlighted code to determine the codified business logic irrespective of the data. Enforcement of expectations on the code ensures prevention via CI/CD before the code is deployed and thus before data is written.\n\nMy recent article [*Your Data Contracts Are in the Wrong Spot*](https://dataproducts.substack.com/p/your-data-contracts-are-in-the-wrong) goes into more detail on this.",

Our latest Sail 0.4 release introduces native Apache Iceberg support and provides major architectural improvements to Delta Lake execution. The release also lays the foundation for distributed DML operations across open data formats and marks a key step toward Sail’s goal of a fully unified lakehouse engine.\n\n# What is Sail?\n\nSail is an open-source, Rust-native, multimodal computation framework which includes drop-in replacement compatibility for Apache Spark (SQL and DataFrame API) in both single-host and distributed settings. Built from the ground up in Rust, Sail runs \\~4x faster than Spark while reducing hardware costs by up to 94%. Our mission is to unify batch processing, stream processing, and compute-intensive AI workloads all in one compute engine.\n\n# What’s New in Sail 0.4\n\n* **Native Apache Iceberg integration:** Iceberg tables now run directly inside Sail’s Rust-based query engine for a unified experience across open data formats.\n* **Added support for the Iceberg Catalog REST API**, including **Polaris** and **R2 Catalog**, enabling connectivity to standard Iceberg catalog backends.\n* **Reengineered Delta Lake integration:** Delta operations have been refactored into modular nodes for scanning, writing, and committing, enabling more advanced DML operations.\n* **Shared abstractions across Iceberg and Delta Lake:** A common foundation that paves the way for a unified, format-agnostic lakehouse architecture.\n\n# Join the Slack Community\n\nWe invite anyone whose interested to [join our community on Slack](https://www.launchpass.com/lakesail-community/free) and get involved on [GitHub](https://github.com/lakehq/sail)! Whether you’re exploring Sail for the first time, migrating workloads, or contributing code, here you can collaborate, ask questions, and help shape the future of data infra.\n\nCheck out the full release post here → [https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-4/](https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-4/)\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts!",

No specialists/specialist knowledge needed. \n\nFor moving data in to the platform, you can use no code tools like Fivetran. Definitely consider using these tools as free trials to see how you feel about the ease of use and administration required. After that, it’s SQL and a BI tool of your choice to build the end-to-end analytics environment for your company.",

With it in market 3 years now.\n\nI will say Fabric would be a WAY easier transition for folks because of the integrations with Power BI, Excel and power query and you can grow into more SQL based things. (I had the same background but also have had strong SQL before I was mainly doing Power Query and PowerBI)\n\nthe Low Code Layer is great with the Other side to grow into Deeper coding. \n\nWhat you probally can do is get the trial version of Fabric with some of your main use cases and see if it works for your team. But again Snowflake may work well depending on certain data needs. \n\nSkills wise based on the skills of your team already fabric is an easy on ramp vs snowflake imo.",

        "body": "I'll comment from a Snowflake perspective on the numbered points you raised ...\n\n1. Snowflake have recently released OpenFlow but it has a limited number of connectors, so may not meet your needs. People generally use tools such as Fivetran to pull data from source systems and push it into Snowflake, or they have some process that writes source data to cloud storage where Snowflake can load it (using COPY INTO... commands)\n\n2. Straightforward to transform data using SQL (normally wrapped in a Stored Proc if you're building pipelines). A lot of people use dbt for transformations and Snowflake have recently released the ability to run dbt within Snowflake. If you really want to go down the low/no code route, have a look at [coalesce.io](http://coalesce.io)\n\n3. If your analysts can write SQL then they should be fine. You can also write/run SQL in VS Code if you want to (and probably in other tools too)\n\n4. Not sure how this differs from your point 1?\n\n5. Snowflake can probably do all this; depends on your precise requirements\n\n6. Depends on your definition of \"seamless\" but making Snowflake a datasource for PowerBI is pretty trivial\n\n7. Snowflake allows you to keep data within Snowflake or externally (Iceberg and external tables). It also separates storage and compute so you can scale the compute power you want to use for running a query independently of the data being queried, and this happens almost instantaneously. I can't imagine a scenario where Snowflake wouldn't be able to scale to your needs\n\nSnowflake documentation is pretty good, and readable, so is always a useful place to start if you want to get a better understanding of the platform in general or specific capabilities : [https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide-getting-started](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide-getting-started)",

I work for a mid-size CPG company in the US that has more or less the same framework:\n\n\n- ingestion: raw data lands in redshift, separate schema for each source (raw schema for transactional source, separate raw schema for crm, another for customer support platform, etc). Method for ingestion varies by source, but the end result is the same. On our side we use a combination of stitch for some prebuilt connectors for SaaS applications, lamda for unstructured data that lands first in S3, and some custom python scripts hosted on ec2 for the various odds and ends\n- transformation: dbt transforms raw schema in redshift to cleaned data marts. I recommend putting thought into how you want to structure your transformation layers in dbt, and then just try to stay consistent. Dbt has their own recs on how to structure, and that's more or less what we do (staging, intermediate, and marts): https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview\n- analytics: some sort of viz or BI tool that references the cleaned data marts exclusively. You don't want business users building reports off the raw staging data\n\n\nYou can probably find lots of sample dbt projects online, that mostly look the same in terms of structure. Just figure out what works for you, write out some rules for your org, and try to stick to it. ",

Everyone is moving to the cloud or hybrid cloud models now so it they will be something good to put on your resume / CV anyway.",

If you go with Airflow I'd recommend looking into [DAG Factory](https://github.com/astronomer/dag-factory/) (or creating your own), it is an open source package that abstracts the Python for the Airflow pipelines behind YAML, it is especially useful for simple and repetitive pipelines. I've also seen setups were almost all of the Airflow code was abstracted away by one or two engineers and the analysts only wrote SQL (an OSS example here is [gusty](https://github.com/pipeline-tools/gusty)).  \nMight be a way to help the drag and drop team members to slowly start to see the beauty of code-based abstractions and pipelines, once they see that can just fill in a few values in a template instead of clicking around when adding a new source etc.\n\nAlso if you ever end up hating one of the GCP tools you can still switch them out against another tool and move towards a hybrid setup later.\n\nI haven't used data transfer service/dataform before so can't speak to those vs Fivetran/dbt. Just FYI you can use dbt Core with Airflow, a great way there is Cosmos. \n\nDisclaimer: I work at Astronomer, we made Cosmos (which is OSS, so you can run it no matter how you run Airflow), adopted and maintain the DAG Factory and do managed Airflow, so I am biased towards Airflow. Though in this case I guess I just gave an assist to cloud composer which is our competitor. If you want to look into Airflow we have a lot of beginner resources like the [learn guides](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/intro-to-airflow) or [Marc Lamberti's academy course ](https://academy.astronomer.io/path/airflow-101)that are relevant no matter where you run Airflow. :)",

You get the bonus of having quality control by having your SQL (dbt models) version controlled and peer reviewed via pull requests. Also control over deployments. Your dbt code should be in a repository with a CI process that tests it and then publishes an image to Google Artifacts Registry. Cloud Run will pick up the image when Composer runs it, just use the Cloud Run Operator.\n\nSure newer orchestration tools like Dagster and Prefect a bit sexier.

ClickHouse is great to run analytics on very large immutable data (super fast because of the vectorized engine, sparse index etc), I'd only use it for that and only if your data is actually very large (or you anticipate it to be in a reasonable time frame) and move the SCD and model layers into a proper OLAP db. So: raw, very large and will never change in ClickHouse, anything aggregated or that needs to be updated ever in Postgres/BQ/Snowflake etc.  But honestly for a first PoC if your data isnt that big, which I assume based on the current CSV/SharePoint/PowerBI combination, you can also skip ClickHouse for now.\n2. Sorry no first hand experience with PowerBI+ClickHouse. From what I've heard it works fine for basic dashboards but complex joins are not fun with that combo.\n3. I'm biased here since I work for Astronomer so I have a lot of Airflow and only very little Prefect experience. I'd recommend spinning up a small dev environment of both and creating some mock pipelines to see which fits your needs better. For small projects it's often the case that several orchestrators can do the job and the decision is made more based on personal preference. Some tips for Airflow:\n   * Use the Astro CLI to spin up a local dev env in containers to try it out (its free and does not need a sign up).\n   * If you are combining Airflow with dbt you have to use [Cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos) (ok, technically you don't *have* to but it is really the best way!). It is an OSS package that lets you render dbt projects and dbt docs in the Airflow UI.\n   * You said your ingest is pulling from REST APIs using Python: you can use the `task`decorator in Airflow to turn any Python function into an Airflow task, thats probably the fastest way. I think Prefect has a similar decorator too. So with either tool hopefully you can reuse a lot of your existing code there.\n   * If you end up passing data between tasks that is more than just small jsons in Airflow, for example larger pandas dataframes, you'll want to store that data in a blob storage. This used to take a bit of setup but about 1.5 years ago a class was added in the Common IO provider package that is very quick to set up via env vars ([a tutorial](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/custom-xcom-backends-tutorial)).\n   * PSA: top level code in Airflow is executed every time the file is parsed, so don't connect to your db in top level code (i.e. outside of tasks).\n4. If there is a good way to do SCD with ClickHouse I have not found it yet. There is [ReplacingMergeTree](https://clickhouse.com/docs/guides/replacing-merge-tree), which I haven't tried myself but generally, yes, that is definitely a good reason to have the modeling layers somewhere else.",

Then we use Databricks to do the T. Apply business transformations and write out Unity tables. No relationships, everything is isolated. We're a cloud centric company so we don't need OLTP so we can get away with isolated tables. ADF pulls the data in then triggers the associated Databricks job. Data is served to Power BI and end users via SQL warehouses.\n\nWe do not create tables for reports and the warehouse holds no data models. Analysts are expected to use the fact and dimension tables to create their own models in Power BI or whatever they're using, and they do so quite successfully. It helps that our datasets are in the 10s-100s of thousands of rows so Databricks chews this up without any trouble. In fact, I'm driving the entire company off one extra-extra-small single node cluster.\n\nI have some advanced analysts that know SQL so I've given them their own database to create views in. Ideally, I'll integrate those into the warehouse proper one day. You know, when I get time...\n\nOur data needs are fairly modest (A dozen or so data sources, with 3-4 new ones each year, 150-odd data sets (API calls) and maybe 50GB/day ingestion (not counting our CRM which is inside Azure) so I recognise this setup may not work for more complex set ups. Our data needs are very dynamic so I needed something modular and easy for one person to administer. It's been running for about two years so far and is working really well.",

Then you can use a couple different techniques. You can use something like minhash lsh if you have lots names you need to dedupe. \n\nWhether or not you use that, you’ll need to match names in a way that discounts common words and prioritizes uncommon words. Most distance metrics don’t work well for this because you’ll get really high values for names that aren’t actually that close. For example, using Levenshtein distance “apple corporation” and “Snapple corporation” (different companies) are very close, but “Bernstein Partnership, LTD” and “Bernstein” (same company) are not. You can look at various text vectorization models on huggingface that should be able to account for the fact that “corporation” is basically meaningless while “Snapple” is significant. If you have enough data you may even be able to just use tf-idf.\n\nIf you want you can then lay on hierarchical clustering or just use a score cutoff.\n\nLast, you’ll probably want this wrapped up with some kind of feedback mechanism so you can make a lookup table to unify known alternatives over time. Once you know that A and B are actually C, you can store it in a table so you don’t have to run this expensive analysis on those names again",

        "body": "I've done something similar at a previous job at scale in the health tech space. I had a dataset in the hundreds of millions of rows with fields of of text for medical notes where I had to identify specific key terms related to specific medical codes (eg \"Used X medical device to do Y procedure.\"). The problem is that this wasn't just for one hospital, this dataset captured 80% of hospitals in the US, and all have their unique implementation of medical records.\n\nWhere to start:\n\n1. You have to understand the business logic and what a \"meaningful\" match entails. This was especially true in medicine where I had to coordinate with doctors employed by the startup.\n\n2. Create regex for each form of business logic and validate that it accurately matches data for samples. You will quickly start seeing edge cases (note them, but don't optimize for them yet).\n\n3. Create a script to apply the business logic and regex matching, then run it on a sample of data if the data is large (in my case it was the difference between running in 30s vs 3hrs). \n\n4. Apply the script to your dataset (or sample) where you only count how many times a separate piece of regex matched with a row. You can then quickly see your coverage (ie match count greater than 0) and where your logic could be wrong (ie match count greater than 1).\n\n5. Determine what level of coverage and accuracy is needed for your stakeholders (they will always say \"as much as possible\" to which you respond with time/effort tradeoffs). Since I was in medical, it had to be high, but a lower threshold could suffice.\n\n6. Take a new sample of the data (about 1k records) and manually label them with what they should match with. Then apply your script to the sample and determine your accuracy. I often represent this as a confusion matrix (my background was data sci before eng). Id often pull in some of my colleagues to help with the labeling if we all benefit from the data asset.\n\nYou now have levers for coverage and accuracy, iterate on your regex logic script until you meet the requirements of your stakeholders. Bonus, if it's a huge success, you now also have direct metrics for employee reviews/resume.\n\nPlease note that this was back in 2020. So there may be better methods than this, but here's an example of something that was deemed successful at the company.",

Go with mid-tier regional players that specialize in the platform you're interested in (I prefer Snowflake). These tend to provide better service and can be more flexible. Also consider an initial engagement with 1 vendor where they are not able to bid on the down stream work (or at least that is what you tell them). The look others for the actual work. This will help reduce the chance that a vendor lowballs the effort required to get the work.\n\nGood luck",

You should do the math yourself but being an actual employee is not trivial. That being said if your spouse has health insurance and can get you on his plan this might not matter.\n\n\n2) SF will likely lead you to more opportunities long term. There’s a lot more in-person jobs coming back and it is highly advantageous to be here for future jobs moves. During my most recent job search, most if not all of the roles I found were in-person, and all of the highest-paid ones were in or around San Francisco. The same is true of my other friends in tech. Many of them who have roots elsewhere are struggling to find jobs that won't force them to relocate to SF. And a lot of places will pre-screen for candidates who already live here when searching LinkedIn. I likely would not have found my current role if I wasn't already based here.\n\n\n3) $150k is still a lot in SF. People talk a lot about the high COL and it's true that the bang-for-your-buck on rent is terrible. But how that usually shakes out is you just rent a place that's smaller/shittier than you would otherwise rent elsewhere, and then are left with more money than you know what to do with. I have plenty of friends who get by just fine on less than $100k/year here. With $150k and your spouse having an entire second income you'll be more than fine.\n\n\n4) the weather here in SF is way better",

In dbt, use snapshots (Type 2) with unique\\_key = that surrogate and check\\_cols='all'; you’ll get valid\\_from/valid\\_to/is\\_current without depending on Oracle MVs. \n\nFor incrementals from Oracle when you can’t do CDC, keep a high-watermark table in Postgres (last seen version or updated\\_at), and also compute a row hash; diff by hash to catch silent changes. Dimensions shouldn’t truncate soft-delete with an is\\_active flag and keep facts referentially stable.\n\nDev workflow: dbt Core CLI + VS Code (SQLTools + dbt Power User), local DuckDB for rapid iteration, then target Postgres; add SQLFluff to keep SQL sane.

But they should never need the formal approval process from the end user.\n\nI mean, sure, if they are \"conscientious\" they'd do that. But who says they are? If your organisation is big enough then all sorts of things typically can and do happen. Now, I am not saying that the approval must come from the consumer domain necessarily (you're right, that's probably a bad idea...), but some sort of sign-off should come from someone. Thinking of it, probably the official data product owner or steward should give that, BUT the downstream data product consumers should receive a notification of change.\n\nIn any case, this does not fundamentally change my question or argument. The main point being that data products would have some form of enforced and versioned schema, and you could not simply consume a data product by circumventing that contract, nor could you simply change the schema without any formalized and versioned change request.",

        "body": "Thank you! Looking briefly at this post, it does seem to touch on what I’m asking. The post calls it a “monster query”, which is accurate. A composite metric fact table is just that - rather than a period snapshot, or transactional fact (or other) it’s literally taking data (facts) from many adjacent places and smashing them together - in my case to create “supply vs. demand” - adjacent facts include production actuals, production schedules, inventory (on hand, consignment, with vendor, in transient, etc), stock received from 3rd parties, projected sales, actual sales, goods issued, etc.  There is like >17 datasets that comprise the formula for “supply vs. demand”, and each data set is multiple ETL jobs / facts broken out by different companies / regions of the world (in a large multinational). \n\nHence, you can see my concern about potential challenges about different points of time due to unexpected failed or delayed ETL jobs, and ensuring to write an artifact to the fact for data quality purposes. I don’t need to expose this to my end uses (who are restricted to views on top of my table) but I would put in in the physical table for quality/explainability. \n\nAlso, I’m only concerned with the explainability part now (best practice design). Obviously, the more important part is the proactive portion of who you programmatically ensure all combined data is from the same point of time. For example, you can break the metric up into regions of the world (NA, EMEA, APAC) to ensure it’s computed relevant to their time zones, you can adjust your “subqueries” to enforce timeboxes, or time travel / time restrictions to ensure they are all consistent, or you might do some sort of staging tables that can be “frozen” (for example frequent loading upstream but frozen into daily buckets, etc.). I’m sure there are a few good options.\n\nAgain, I’m starting with “hey they this is very complicated since ETL doesn’t always work as intended and error free” so how do I assure quality given the many challenges. \n\nThanks again - it’s is a great link, very helpful and exactly what i was asking for.\n\nEdit:  the blog post called out something I forgot to mention that’s pretty critical. The subsets of data are all aggregated, so what’s included/missing from the aggregation is very important.  For example, if we are calculating MetricValue = Inventory on hand [region | material | day] - goods issue [region | material | day ] + projected sales [ region | material | calendar day] —> and each of these are very volatile. The different businesses in different regions of the world will change their sales forecasts through out the day (especially as we near quarter/year end, or other business target dates), inventory changes drastically, and goods issue (reduction of inventory) is very dynamic. So, if I’m after a daily level, as in what’s my EMEA inventory for material 111 on 10/23/25, this value could be very different if my subquery executes at 1am vs. 4am vs. 7am. Where as in a transactional fact table, i would simply be adding rows (ie: additional sales invoices to a sales fact table) and the differences are easily understood - I’m summarizing inventory per day, so the differences in values due to timing are a mystery. I like that the blog post is pointing this out as a challenge in the “monster query” which aggregates results into a “common grain” (which is exactly what I’m doing here).",

The query workload will be distributed over the replicas and all nodes have all  the data to handle any query, so you can achieve maximum distribution/parallelism. But note that a single node performs better with double the resources compared to adding another node to the cluster with these resources.\n\nIf you partition data over multiple shards distributed over nodes you'll have less parallelism but might perform better on specific queries or when running many queries at the same time. But a query that requires data from a single shard cannot be executed on a  node that doesn't have that shard or a replica of it.\n\n\nBottom line: adding nodes and replicas will improve query performance linearly due to query distribution. For sharding you'll need a more complicated strategy. But if you're ingesting terabytes of data and already know your workload it's almost certainly a good idea to develop a sharding strategy, even if you'd have all shards on the same node or when every node has replicas of any data not in its own shard.\n\nAnd finally for a few terabytes of data on a cluster of 2 nodes with 32 cores and 64GB seems sufficient. If it's all one data stream I'd rather upgrade my server RAM and cores if possible than adding nodes. Unless the workload as a whole requires more simultaneous executions instead of individual query performance.",

The response is then sent back to the web page. Then there is a memory module to remember the historical context but that's way more into the details. This was the first chat based system we built. The system was a bit slow and the semantic layer file kept getting bigger lol \n\nEdit -Later we moved everything into Snowflake intelligence. Still getting refined everyday but works pretty good, low maintenance. None of these systems went to production, these are available to general users who has an itch to check out the data on their own. They are learning how to ask questions, I foresee that this system may work out in production in near future.",

I would really, really strongly recommend reading through a Spring tutorial before even attempting to debug any Java code that uses it.  That would answer all of the questions you have here.\n\n> I can't find a CallAction constructor call anywhere, so I don't know where MyServiceClient is coming from.\n\nBy the way, one of the really important concepts here is: you shouldn't care.  The `@Autowired` annotation on something means that dependency is being injected by the framework, and it could come from anywhere.  All you know is that you're getting an object that implements the `MyServiceClient` interface.  It could have been made by half a dozen different implementations of that interface, or it could even be a mock object created in a unit test.  You treat all of them the same way and don't care where they were constructed.\n\nIf you think there's something wrong with the way the object is being constructed, looking in the code that is having it injected is the wrong way to inspect it.  Look for any implementations of that interface that have `@Bean` or `@Component` annotations.",

If it was that good, every other language would be copying the patterns. Instead, what we see is Java trying to copy other languages while maintaining backwards compatibility, which naturally makes the language harder than needed. See the \"wonders\" of how string interpolation is stuck with a kind of nasty format, because all the more reasonable ones were used in other libraries first, and they didn't want to break backwards compatibility. See the streaming api, less comfortable than the equivalent in every language with monadic collection operations. The Option class that has no nullability guarantees, so it's not reliable, And since 95% of all Java for services is written in Spring, the annotation salad is what we've got.\n\nSo yeah, your best bet is to cope via heavy IDEs that do all the work and will track usages, including knowing the autowiring logic.",

        "body": "I think that code readability has a lot to do with one's experience with the particular paradigm being used, as well as one's understanding of the abstractions and the underlying platform.\n\nSorry for the essay - hope it makes sense for someone out there :)\n\nI teach intro-level Java-Programming as well as Spring programming, and it is interesting to see how different students grow into the different paradigms at wildly different paces.\n\nUnderstanding **imperative code is easy for everyone**, first line does something, then second line does something else, then the third line does another thing. The hardest part is learning that when you write `int weeks = days / 7;` on line 14, and then change the number of `days` on line 20, the value of `weeks` doesn't change along with it. But you get used to it, and learn to read code.\n\nThen comes **procedural** code, with loops and functions/methods (we ignore the objects at first), and it gets a bit harder to understand that the loop does the same thing over and over, but with the values changing - so now changing a value on line 20 **DOES** impact the calculation on line 14, if they are inside the same loop. Or a function behaves differently from time to time, because it depends on a global variable, whose value might have changed since the last call ...\n\nThen you move into **object oriented** code, where objects ask each other to do stuff - but it still mostly reads like procedural code, where a single thread of execution goes through methods living in different objects - you get used to having to jump around in different files, but most of the time you can still follow along. The hardest part is knowing when the objects are instantiated, and who \"owns\" the reference to them - but other than that you begin to abstract away the actual program flow, unless you really need it.\n\nBut you begin using frameworks, and suddenly you don't see all the code - you have objects that extend existing objects, who then call methods in your object. You don't know exactly when or why your own methods are called, you just get CVS-receipt-length style stack-dumps when something fails, and you sit \"outside\" the code, looking in, trying to understand what might be happening around your own code - mostly you are guessing or using information from other people also guessing.\n\nIt becomes very hard to follow, even for experienced programmers\n\nAnd then you move to Spring, which is **aspect oriented** programming, where you don't even write, nor see all the code, but only add annotations and interfaces, and then some magic entity behind the curtain reads your code, and changes it! Sometimes before compiling, sometimes after! And you have no idea how your code is being used, who uses it, what for, or when. You just hand code to the monster, and it does something - now it is literally impossible to follow what is going on, and you need to know what the platform does, what the framework does, how it uses your classes and methods, and why it uses them in the way it does ... And you either have to read through 35 years of accumulated specifications, or watch days of indian youtubers explain it, still somewhat on the surface-level ...\n\nSo to answer your question, **yes**! Modern Java is actually very hard to read - and Spring is outright impossible to understand if you don't know a whole lot about it beforehand!",

You're probably ahead of me in skill and prospects. \n\n\n**Work on skills related to finding a job:**\n\n\nSet a block of time, every day after work, for applying and upskilling. No exceptions, even if it's as little as 30min for one and 30min for the other. \n\n\nEvery time you feel like you're not skilled enough (which may be true), remember that people less skilled than us ARE getting jobs.\n\n\nFigure out why. Are they applying in novel ways? Do they have really good interviewing skills? Are they personable? Did they do x, y, and z? \n\n\nImprove yourself based on your findings. There are A LOT of unique ways to get hired while being less skilled. At the very least, you can improve your interviewing skills by failing at them and learning what to learn. \n\n\nDon't be afraid to look for more technical, but still retail-adjacent/low-level roles as a start. Don't allow yourself to settle for this either - keep searching and improving your process. \n\n\nI'd also try doing Neetcode 150 as well. Spend 15-30minutes failing on one question, watch the solution to the video, and then learn why the solution works (you can use AI as a mentor, not a solution solver). Rinse-repeat. Don't worry about \"not knowing the answers.\" Even experienced developers struggle on optimizing Easy's.\n\n\nSo, 30 minutes of self-study, 30min of applying (even \"knowing\" you'll fail), and a bit of LC-style learning when you're bored. \n\n\n.\n\n\n**Work on your technical skills:**\n\n\nThere are just as many paths forward in this as there is on the above. \n\n\nMy advice as a beginner? \n\n\nFigure out what domains you liked during your studies, research what it takes to get into them, and then follow an online roadmap learning those resources. \n\n\nDon't have a preferred domain?\n\n\nThen either read some books related to learning how to program, ones that are heavy on coding along and building things, follow a bootcamp, or go straight into \"github project-based learning\" repo and start building with your preferred languages. Focus on your preferred languages and up your skills.\n\n\nI recommend that path the most.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, school primed us to be very good at intaking new information and thinking like a computer, so now you have to learn how to be a craftsmen, building new projects and applying your theory. \n\n\nToo overwhelming? \n\n\nThe Odin Project is a free online boot camp that will essentially take you from 0 to the very minimum skills of a junior full-stack developer. You'll learn how to research, use version control, and build projects. \n\n\nThis will solidify your programming foundation, especially if you go a layer or two deep when using the additional resources/reading books.\n\n\nDon't forget to keep applying. When you're done with Foundations, you're not going to be \"cracked out junior\" level, but you'll be \"meh, *maybe* I can teach him the rest\" level. \n\n\nIf you haven't been applying due to being an imposter, you want a job or what? At least start at this point. \n\n\nThe more you improve at learning to program, the workflow for it, the rigor it takes, etc, the better you can pivot to other domains of programming. This is just one method of trying to open that door.\n\n\nYou are free to learn whatever else (project-based building in your preferred domain, reading books about programming, following tutorials on building a game, etc) as long as you complete that block of time for applications (or learning novel ways of getting a job) and dedicated self-study (this example being The Odin Project).\n\n\nIt's important to have fun during it all and not try to speed run yourself into burnout. You may find you learn the most in that period of fun/exploration.\n\n\n.\n\n\nSorry about the wall of text! I don't know the correct/most efficient path since I'm stumbling along as well! \n\n\nIf you want someone to chat with, feel free to DM on here. I'll give my Discord. ",

The forwarding can happen through HTTP calls, but in modern data centers you may also encounter request forwarding through other protocols that are more suited like gRPC. Reverse proxy servers can also handle load balancing, i.e. if the same application is deployed multiple times behind the reverse proxy the reverse proxy can choose the application with the lowest load as the forward target so that no server becomes overly burdened.\n\nReverse proxy servers can perform so called \"TLS termination\", where the reverse proxy handles the TLS handshake (and is aware of the TLS private keys that are used to prove service authenticity). This effectively strips the TLS functionality from the requests so that an application can focus purely on providing functionality, while the secure connection responsibility remains with the reverse proxy. However it is also possible (and encouraged) to encrypt a HTTP / gRPC connection that gets established within a data-center from the reverse proxy to the application server with TLS. You'd do this if you don't trust the network infrastructure in the data center, e.g. because it runs a co-location server model where the server hardware owned by different entities is deployed within the same physical location.",

It's a marriage like it was meant to be.\n\nThis means you implement the HTTP protocol:\n\n    namespace methods {\n    class GET;\n    class POST;\n    class PUT;\n    class PATCH;\n    class DELETE;\n    class HEAD;\n    class OPTIONS;\n    class CONNECT;\n    class TRACE;\n\n    using method = std::variant<GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, CONNECT, TRACE>;\n    }\n\nI'll let you fill those out in detail, but I'm going to still jump around to get to my point.\n\nNext you need a request and a response type:\n\n    namespace messages {\n      class request: method { /* an incoming request is implemented in terms of one of the HTTP methods */};\n\n      class response;\n    }\n\nNow here's where we're REALLY going to build on some of the magic:\n\n    class request {\n      friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, request &);\n    };\n\n    class response {\n      friend std::ostream &operator <<(std::ostream &, const response &);\n    };\n\nBarring the rest of the class details, you need these functions. Now when it comes to the request, you'll start parsing the incoming text stream until you get the HTTP method, and then you know which method type above to instantiate. Then your method types implement their own stream extractors, and THEY extract their own bits. So understand that transport protocols tend to have enumerations - whether they're numbers or text tags, doesn't matter. We don't need a data field to store the method, we can translate that into a C++ User Defined Type. The enumeration of all the methods? That's implied by our type instance stored in the variant. That's you enumeration! We've enumerated the method types with actual types!\n\nI'm droning on about that because you wouldn't believe how much code I end up seeing where people read data out of a source and plug it right into a runtime data field. Wholly unnecessary and missing the point.\n\nBut this means that all your IO is over text, and it's over streams, and your types work with ANY stream, including... `std::cin` and `std::cout`.\n\nSee, you don't have to know shit about networking because you don't have to write any of it. C++ is a systems software language, you're expected to make systems of software, not these gigantic monoliths. The desktop and the GUI is not the operating system, an operating system is a system of software FOR YOU - THE ENGINEER. You make this one part that can extract and then insert HTTP, and then you can combine it with other software to do the networking and the encryption.\n\n    > nc -l 8080 -c your_server\n\nSo now when a request comes in on port 8080, an instance of your program will launch, and all TCP IO will be redirected through `std::cin` and `std::cout`. Your program doesn't know, doesn't care.\n\nYou want that shit encrypted?\n\n    > nc -l 8080 -c 'stunnel | your_server'\n\nIt's a bit more than that, but it's the basic premise. It's why unencrypted HTTP is default port 80 and encrypted HTTPS is default port 443.\n\nAs for servicing the request, you've got a variant, which means your handler is a visitor, and of course you can make a visitor that can dispatch to different handlers for each type. You can initially make a catchall visitor that always returns a 501 - not implemented. If you can hit your server with your browser and get a 501, that's not nothing, that's something - proof that your server actually worked and talked HTTP with your browser. Remember, a response is going to be in text!\n\nSo now all you have to do is read the HTTP standard and figure out the nature of the protocol. Are fields fixed or floating? That is to say, are they order and formatting specific, or can fields be anywhere in the message payload? Which ones are optional and which are mandatory? You know - I'll give you another hint, that URL and RESTful resources LOOK like a file path for a very good reason... You can also deliver binary payloads, but I'll let you figure that one out, and it's also common to base64 encode content because it turns binary into text to get past some of the text fuckery that is assumed by the protocol and implementation, like how line feeds and carriage returns get mangled.\n\nContinued...",

Then wouldn't you want to test that it works? You could easily have a bug in your code. What if it works most of the time but fails for small numbers? What if it crashes if you give it a negative number?\n\nUnit tests can be useful for this sort of thing - trying a wide range of inputs to a function to ensure it works correctly.\n\nAs far as where to put them, the standard practice is to make them part of the same repository and to make an easy way to run all of your tests. The idea is that every time you change your code, you run all of your tests and make sure you didn't break anything.\n\nSo that brings up the second value of unit tests - they catch future problems. Suppose you want to speed up your code by using SIMD instructions to speed up math. You could rewrite your square root function and then re-run the unit tests to make sure it still gives the correct answer.\n\nThere's no rule for how many tests you need, but one goal that a lot of people strive for is to cover every line of code with at least one test. So if your function has an \"if\" statement in it at the top level, you'd need at a minimum two tests to cover it - one test that covers the true branch, and one test that covers the false branch.\n\nThere are tools that will run your tests and tell you exactly which lines were and weren't covered by tests.\n\nFinally, as to what to test, unit tests are generally for testing individual functions. A good rule of thumb is to test all of the public interface of any class. So if there are some helper functions inside of a file that can't be called from anywhere else, you don't have to test those, but you should test whatever public functions or methods other parts of your code might be able to call.\n\nTesting systems is also a good idea, but then they're not called unit tests, they're called something else, like integration tests. They tend to have different tradeoffs, like they're usually slower so you can't have as many of them, and you might care more about the tests being robust than them being comprehensive.",

For example, only create tests when you start developing something and you know it's going to be annoying to test manually (like someone mentioned, a reimplementation of calculating a square root). Another good point to write some tests is before a big refactor.\n\nOnce there are more people working on the project it makes sense to add tests to provide some stability to the project. Most contributors are not able to test a project comprehensively, often code lacks the proper data to test the program, and tests can provide that. In general, a small team of experienced developers can work with less tests, only adding tests were it truly makes development easier. Once you go into bigger organizations or open source you will need more tests, because there is going to be people whose main task is to review and merge code and their life is made so much easier with tests.\n\nSecond, what is the project? I've seen application UI code has usually less tests because a lot of the output is visual. Sure there are some methods like monitoring visuals changes, or component libraries where you can click though individual components. Something as simple as just checking all components render can be a good enough test. But in general the passing test for UI is that it looks good and is usable, and that needs more often than not some manual testing anyway.\n\nData processing oriented code, infrastructure code, and code that has difficult inputs or outputs on the other hand rely more on tests. Like how are you \"manually\" going to test that some data objects coming through your kafka stream are processed correctly so they can be sent to the database? The whole premise just asks for some kind of programmatical test.\n\nWhile 100% code coverage can be good, it is not the ultimate milestone. You can have 100% code coverage but still you are not handling some cases correctly and have bugs in your code.",

        "body": ">For example if you have a function that calculates the square root of a number, it's quite easy to unit test. But is that really necessary?\n\nWell you know its supposed to calculate the square root of a number, someone else might see the function and think it just devides by 3 because they put in 9 and 3 came out but now they put in 16 and it doesnt work so they \"fix\" the function so it devides by 3. Ofcourse this a rediculous example but in the real world even a lot of short and easy to write functions dont have a super obvious expected output and sometimes multiple outputs are equally possible but you this case needs one and another case needs another output. So you write a unittest to make sure if someone changes the function to fit their usecase they see that something else now is broken.\n\n>What about functions and classes that are simple to understand/debug/modify? Should unit tests only be done for more complex code/frequently modified code?\n\nWell again simple to understand/debug/modify code doesnt equal just one possible expected output.\n\n>And if something needs unit tests how many should I do? Should I try to cover all the edge cases? Or just the common ones that are easy to break.\n\nThats something each dev or each team needs to decide on their own and depends on the projekt. Think about what happens if that piece of code fails and how likely it is to fail. If the code fails and people die you wanna absolutly test as much as you can. If you are using that code to turn on an LED on a personal project well no cares if it fails. \n\nFor me personaly on the current project the goal is to have atleast a unittest so that every piece of code is atleast called once. So if you have an if somewhere in there (that depends on the input) you need two write two unittests so that both sides are called. \n\n>Finally, what scope should unit tests be? It's probably not a good idea to make unit tests for each function, but what about per class? Should it be done per system instead?\n\nPer function is absolutly a viable option. if you know each function gives the expected output and your code is deterministic (which it should be) your code should pretty much never fail. But you also dont have to choose just once scope. You can do some unit test for functions, for groups of functions and the class at the same time.",

It simply boxes in the solution, leaving as little place for bugs as possible (but we’re only human).\n\nIn some sense the tests are more important than the solution.

When you merge, either you'll get a clean merge, or you'll get merge conflicts that need to be resolved.\n\nThe key thing is that any new changes from the base branch may or may not matter for your feature development in that 4 day period. It depends. A major factor there is how orthogonal the team members are to one another. If people are working on completely different things that don't affect the other, then you could potentially defer merging the base branch into your feature branch until your feature branch is done, especially if it's pretty short-lived.\n\nSometimes, you'll encounter merge conflicts when you attempt to merge the base branch into yours. Depending on what they are, I usually prefer to reconcile those sooner than later, just to not have that looming over my head, but even so, you could potentially hold off if they're not critical and don't affect how you develop the feature.\n\nIn some cases though, even non-conflicting changes can be problematic, either in the sense that the code is no longer working (a semantic conflict, rather than a textual conflict), or they could just muck up your build in some way and force you to have to rebuild. In either case, if it doesn't affect how I'd build the feature, then I tend to defer merging until my feature is done, unless there's some good reason I should merge sooner.\n\nAll that said, it's a judgment call, and ultimately you'll want to ensure that in the end you're merging quality work to the main branch that is well tested against the main branch's latest changes.",

But you should be committing and pushing often, and you don't want to push something incomplete into master.\n\nA minor change having a dozen pushes is perfectly fine.  But if you always plush to master, and you've done work since you realized that feature you added broke something, removing it without removing the in between work is a pain.  It's also harder to go back and figure it out.\n\nWe branch from master when we start on a new major update.  These usually are usually a very big deal - features being added.  We don't merge a major into master until we end support - master holds the oldest version we support.\n\nWhen we patch, we branch off the major branch into a patch branch.  So most of the time there will be master, major, and patch.  There can be two major branches, though it's not common.  When we release a patch we merge it into the major, so that doesn't get cluttered.\n\nWhen a developer starts working in something, they branch from, usually, the patch branch.  When they're happy they submit a pull request so someone else can review it, then merge once approved.\n\nThis makes it very easy to keep things organized.  If you need to pause work on one incomplete task, you can just swich branches, do what you need to, switch back and, if needed, rebase to bring in the thing you stopped to work on.\n\nAnd commit often.  Lots of commits make it easy to change your mind and go back to something you did earlier.  It also makes it easier to put notes into a pull request, and to see what you have been doing.",

I tried learning when I was younger but never really understood the concepts, or maybe I didn't have the drive to put in effort. If gured if I gave up then, I'd never come back. I'll say, learning now is 100x easier than I remember, probably because the Internet wasn't as much of a thing back then.\n\nI did some Ruby to start, because I thought I wanted to make websites and it seemed like a good entry language. About a month in, I decided I didn't really need a website for anything, so I had no motivation. Shortly after, I switched to c# and then learned Unity, so I could more easily see the results of my work. \n\nIt's been very rewarding, and I'm having lots of fun. But don't get me wrong, there are some times where I search for a simple answer to a question, and I have to go read a lot of docs or ask other questions to even understand what the other answers meant. \n\nI haven't considered turning my codding hobby into a career, maybe one day, but for now it's been keeping my mind engaged.

One daughter who really loved \"programming\" in scratch took a Python class and decided coding wasn't for her. She'd made some really fun stuff in Scratch, with graphics she drew herself, but there's quite a bit more to programming than dragging little boxes around. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the understanding kids can get from a tool like Scratch is helpful for things like understanding program flow and conditionals, but \"real\" programming--even game programming--isn't like that. I don't know how your particular nine-year-old is wired, but seeing what's involved in actual code couldn't hurt, IMO.  So it's a chance to see if he's really interested. And plenty of kids play Minecraft, which isn't peak graphics, so I wouldn't focus too much on that.\n\nI think picking something relatively straightforward is a good plan. You might also make sure that you understand how all the libraries you'll be using work and have maybe tested them out a little (in case you've forgotten something since the last times you used them). It can be boring for a kid to sit and watch while you try to figure out how pygame's init module works.",

In Europe/US as far as I know, Python, C# and Java are still pretty common, Go, JS and Ruby (and rust) exist, but at different and lower frequencies, I have seen only very few Kotlin backends, even though I love how it is done in the language. If you want real numbers, go on job portals in your area, and look through a few hundred backend jobs. (Yes, it will take 2-3 hours, but you will have an accurate answer, which did not come from the subjective, 2 years out of date experience of someone from germany)\n\n2. I mean... Not sure what you mean? A Backend REST (or GraphQL) API will work for any frontend, as long as that frontend can do network requests. You can use the same backend for a python Frontend, a JS Webapp and an embedded C controller, and I have done so in the past. \n\n3. You will have to learn the concepts of backend. This is not optional, and will be about the same amount of work for all of the options listed above. But once you know how it works and how to set it up, it works pretty much the same in every framework (+/-, different things will be included, there wil be different names and slightly different details). If you know what middleware is, or how a request/a form is handled, you can migrate frameworks pretty easily. If you don't know those things, you can't really work productively in teh backend. \n\n4. I don't think that there is a huge difference between languages/frameworks here. If you want to shorten it, use a language you already know. (So I guess Java or Kotlin, if you come from Android). I have built a toy project in Kotlin, but never anything in Java. I can't really give you advice there.",

The typical way to do it would be to drag and drop UI controls into a template in Visual Studio, then write little bits of C# code to hook them up. You could also do it in pure code and a Hello World GUI app would only be 20 - 30 lines of code or so.\n\nIf you use Electron, you're basically building a web page using HTML+CSS+JavaScript and Electron runs an embedded web browser inside your app window. It will look like a web page inside of an app window. If you're already good at web development or you want to learn web development this will be very convenient. If not, it will feel more complex to get things up and running because you'll need HTML, CSS, frontend JavaScript, and backend JavaScript.\n\nElectron makes a ton of sense if you want a website and a desktop app. You can share most of the code. There are similar frameworks that let you build mobile apps and share a lot of the code too.\n\nComing from Python and Tkinter, C# with WinUI will feel more familiar and just more polished and powerful. But if you wanted to build a Mac app, mobile app, or web app later you'd have to start from scratch.",

To do this you'd need to take some more advanced math (college-level linear algebra and statistics, at a minimum) plus many more of the college CS courses would be quite relevant and important. For this type of job, many applicants will have Master's degrees.\n\nA level up from that would be doing AI research - coming up with new models and algorithms. That basically requires a PhD.\n\nThe languages you'll use will vary - probably some Python, some C++, maybe R. The languages will only be 10% of what you need to learn.",

Being a bit cynical, I felt this was the industry's attempt to get software people to work harder to be more productive.\n\nIt's like saying a barista (the person that makes coffee) has to be passionate, tasting and making coffee at home like it's a mission.\n\nAnd, even passion only gets you so far. Andre Agassi, the tennis star, said he hated tennis in his early years, and yet was a top 10 player through much of his career. There are guys desperate to be in the NBA. They practice as much as the stars, but all that passion doesn't translate to talent or height or raw athletic skill. \n\nIt gets to the point where those who struggle to program still proclaim how much they \"love programming\" and are so passionate. What happens to the passionate non-achiever? We might say it's \"fake passion\".\n\nIt *can* just be a job. You don't have to code on weekends. If someone studies and figures something new out, well, you have ChatGPT. Ask it to teach you in an hour or so.",

Then at the beginning of my work day, I decided to google keywords for my problem, and there it was, the solution to my problem, which was a program that did what I wanted to do for the past week, and it finished in less than an hour.             \n          \nI might not remember the exact specifics of my problems, but I remember what got me to the solution, which was to search for keywords rather than my entire problem, (e.g instead of ‘migrating from cloud database to local database to backup’, I searched ‘backup cloud database’ ) usually helps you find the solution you want much faster.         \n          \nSo, while you might feel that it was dumb not looking in the obvious place for your issue, you now know, if this problem arises in the future you know where to look first, and to take it a step further, whenever you find something that’s not showing up, instead of redeploying, you first check the configurations needed for it to show.            \n           \nThis is what makes a difference between an okey software engineer, and an excellent one; learning from their mistakes.",

Also, just getting libraries to work can be a pain although package managers like vcpkg are a godsend in Windows, and with Linux, well, everything is just \\`apt install\\`.\n\nJava... well, I know it's a decent language but my experiences with it have been annoyance over the IDE Eclipse and settings things up like Gradle and Maven.  So much documentation to wade through. Although, LLMs can probably help with these things nowadays.\n\nI'm a C# person myself, and I love the language and the environment, I am most productive with it.  I occasionally work with Python for scripting and Javascript / Typescript is a must when working with frontend stuff.

        "body": "I remember that. I like Qt Creator and Godot for letting me drag stuff around. But I do not like to work on other people's projects in those things.\n\nThere are a few fundamental tradeoffs here:\n\nThe code is the truth. Whatever the wysiwyg editor makes must translate to code. Whatever the code says must be presentable by the wysiwyg editor. This usually breaks down as soon as you do something with the code that the wysiwyg editor can not handle, like some custom widget for example. To make that work you have to write extra code just to make the wysiwyg editor compatible with your code again.\n\nOn the flip side a lot of the frontend code has structure that the wysiwyg editor can not show. DOM has a box model that doesn't allow you to simply drag/drop a button anywhere. The only way to do that is to position it with absolute. You wouldn't do that because it breaks responsiveness with different view-ports. Instead you would work with padding, margins, grid layouts etc to get the desired effect - but the wysiwyg cannot show that. It can only hint at that.\n\nThis in turn usually leads to people who're used only to the wysiwyg editor to forget about the underlying structure. There's plenty of precedent for that. LaTeX for example is about code representing structured text and styles to render headlines differently than normal text, Microsoft Word simply allows you to make text large and bold to emulate a heading. But the loss of structure also means you can't do the other stuff LaTeX can do like creating content listings and reducing page breaks immediately after headings. Designers who create mockups in Figma _can_ do really great work, or they can simply slap some shapes there and call it a day. But since the code will be the truth eventually, someone has to translate those shapes into the structure anyway.\n\nLastly, the people who work with code all day have a different problem than the people who rely mainly on wysiwyg editors. Graphical user interfaces are about discoverability of features and a quick preview of the final product. Material pipelines in Blender for example work very well as boxes connected with wires. \n\nCode has about information density, and is easier to work with. No graphical tool can fit as much information on a screen as well written text. Copy and pasting text works between tons of editors, but copy and pasting graphical elements only works in the same tool. You can check text into version control and get diffs or even move detection, that doesn't work for graphical elements unless it compiles to text first.",

        "body": "As a college graduate - I don't care what language you learned in college.\n\nIntroductory materials only teach you the grammar and syntax. You're not learning how to USE the language, and they're not teaching you problem solving skills. Your programming classes give you some context for your other classes - computation theory, DSA, applied mathematics... It also gives you some exposure - this is the job, staring at a screen, walls of text, arbitrary decisions, bastard bugs. Is this something you want to do all day, every day, for the next 45 years?\n\nWhen you graduate, your education didn't finish, it only just begun. You don't pop out an expert. The end of college is only the beginning of the rest of your life. WE KNOW you don't know shit. THAT is why we hire junior developers - not because you're cheap, not because we couldn't afford a senior, but because juniors tend to multiply the force of a senior, because we can mold you into what you need to be successful here.\n\nI'll bet when you're done with this semester you couldn't actually tell me what OOP even is or adequately demonstrate it. It's not a judgement on you - all programming and college courses are saturated with dogmas and traditions. They call it an OOP course but don't actually teach it, typically because your professors don't actually know, either.\n\nSo when you graduate, your programming experience isn't terribly relevant. C++, Python... What I need to know is how you think, if you can learn and adapt. Can I mold you into the person I need here to solve our problems? Ostensibly, the answer is \"yes\", so the major difference between you and another candidate is not what you \"know\", but the aptitude you both demonstrate. Obviously I'm going to hire the one with the greater potential, insofar as my hiring process can deduce. We don't have great tools for this - your GPA is SOMETHING but only tells a particular kind of story. It can mean you can learn a lot and make connections, or it can mean you can memorize the material long enough to ace a test. So GPA alone isn't enough. Your personality also counts for something - can I see myself working with you for the next 5 years? Are you going to mesh well with the personality of the team? You don't have to be smarter than the other guy to be the better fit.\n\nOnce you get hired here, we'll teach you what you need to know to be successful. So don't sweat it. If you're hired, it means you're good enough, you've got the right stuff, and that we want to build you up and see you succeed. We know that's going to take time.\n\nWatch out for puppy mills - places that want junior graduates to also paradoxically have 3-5 years experience. That's not junior, that's not entry level. Also, if a company doesn't hire you - they're doing you a favor. Often it's because it's not a good fit - and that there is a TWO-WAY street. You DO NOT want to work for a place you don't fit in, that kind of misery WILL take years off your life.\n\nSo focus on your fundamentals, your problem solving skills, and your joy of the craft. A good GPA won't hurt, either. Very quickly, the programming language fades away, and becomes a tool, a means to an end - you won't even see the code anymore. What you'll see is the problem before you, and your solution will be sculpted and painted - the epitome of elegance.",

This is safer and less stressful than trying to update everything at once.  \n  \nFor example, many times when updating a library or framework, there will be some deprecated functions - like version 9 of some library contained theOldWay and theNewWay, and either one worked. Maybe version 10 either completely removes theOldWay. You could go through your code and replace all calls to theOldWay with theNewWay, while still in version 9, before introducing any other changes\n\nOr, maybe you have some other dependencies that you know won't be compatible with React 18, so first you update those dependencies to the latest version one at a time, before updating React itself",

The bigger the steps, the more likely it is to fail, so ideally you have a CI/CD approach where you can just make small commits and daily pushes and slowly things switch over.\n\nThen you execute.\n\nSometimes this approach doesn't work because you're building a whole new stack with different tech. In that case, you build the new stack bit by bit and slowly transition calls over. For example, you might start by implementing one use case on the new stack, then divert calls for some test users to it. If everything looks good, then you can start bringing over more traffic and slowly increase the load on the new stack until that use case is fully moved. Then you add another use case, rinse, repeat until done.\n\nYou also want to have a good experiment / feature framework for this. This is where you can create flags in the code that can be updated live on the running system (which are usually just booleans like `ENABLE_X_THING` but can be anything). Then in your code you introduce the feature flag to divert calls to the new stack:\n\n    if (ENABLE_X_THING) {\n      return // result from new stack\n    }\n    \n    return // result from existing code\n\nTypically in these feature frameworks, the state of the flags is attached to the individual requests, it's not a system-wide thing. This lets you turn it on and off for individual end users, or only for a sampling of requests across users, or whatever you want to do. It also allows you to selectively enable the feature in test envs so you can keep the old tests running on the old code path and add new tests for the new code path.\n\nSo now you deploy it, add the new code with tests, and if everything looks good now you can start playing with it in prod to do manual testing, enable e2e tests with test user accounts, etc. Then you start rolling it out to actual users and if anything starts going wrong, you can always just flip the flag and shut it off.\n\nAfter you've moved everyone over and it's fully deployed for a few weeks and everything looks good, you can go in and remove the old code path. Once that's fully deployed, the feature flag now no longer controls anything so you can remove it from the feature flag framework as well and you've moved this use case over.",

Solve some problems that require you to think algorithmically (Advent of Code is one of my favorites) and practice DSA with those questions and you'll be good. The key to learning DSA, in my opinion, is not just how to write an algorithm it in a programing language, but understanding the underlying concept. So, if you know how a hash table works, if you know how to explain binary search in detail, if you can visualize the call stack when doing recursive binary search or merge sort, then I think you're good to go and you shouldn't worry if you forget syntax. If you forget the underlying concept, then I think you should just try to practice more by yourself and force yourself to think. So, if you get an exercise that says \"sort this array using bubble sort\", then instead of just using the memorized bubble sort implementation that you have in your head and then going to your code editor, instead open up a notion document or a google docs and write pseudocode or go to excalidraw and draw some diagrams to visualize bubble sort with 0 code so that you can make sure that before you implement it in your programming language of choice that you actually understand the concept and you're not just using the memorized implementation of bubble sort that you saw in a course.

The features available in ARM7 aren't so overwhelming that you need to worry about advanced instructions you'll find in x86.\n\nAs for fundamentals you want to make sure you understand - try to find some good resources that explain registers, addresses accumulators - it might be easier to start with a simpler microprocessor like an 8051/Z80, just to keep things simple and not overwhelm yourself.  A lot of universities would start with M68k, which I think is too complex to throw people at as a very baseline beginner architecture.",

Then build something small: a calculator, tic tac toe, a web scraper that notified you when a certain youtube channel uploads.

You could compare/contrast the two. You could even make a blog post about if there's interesting differences. Regardless, you'll learn the data structure/algorithm/pattern, even if you don't become an expert in the two languages.\n\nI don't really have specific advice on how to focus on one language for a given period of time.

This is related to dynamic programming, and map reduce. Once you've solved a few of these problems, you've solved them all (for the most part).\n\nYou can turn recursive problems into none recursive problems by pushing arguments into a list, and using a for loop instead, which is pretty much what is happening when you make recursive calls. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/159590/convert-recursion-to-iteration\n\nIn general the more you know, the more you make links to things you already know, and the quicker you can learn more - the hump at the start just takes persistence and putting in the hours, to get a basis of knowledge to build out from. In this case, try solving problems that tend towards recursion, like solving a maze or solitaire (board game) recursively. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire\nDon't get trapped in analysis paralysis - get stuck in, solving real problems, and use decent tools like a good IDE debugger to understand what's going on.",

Creative thinking: How should I even tackle this problem? When I think of \"create a program that does X, Y, Z\" - which subproblems does X, Y and Z actually consist of. This is a skill that you cannot really read your way towards, you have to DO it. If you find yourself stuck it is of course alright to look for solutions to subproblems, but again I would avoid copy/pasting code, look for general ideas you can apply to the problem solving at hand.  \n2. Just experience writing and debugging code. This is another area where reading the answers just don't help. You need to learn the error messages of whatever tool you're using and how they relate to problems in your code. This is probably the most frustrating part of all of this, as sometimes it can take hours only to realise it was some small silly thing that was wrong. But just to give an example of what I think about here (I don't know if this is still the case or not), but back in the day whenever reading error messages, regarding syntax, from PHP, usually the error was on the line above the one mentioned in the error message. Figuring out stuff like this, finding shortcuts for yourself in how to debug your code and general issues will enable you to write code for yourself.  \n3. You need some experience designing systems, as you become more and more skilled your systems will become bigger and probably more complex - and likely also more messy. I cannot remember how many years I wrote code before I was able to look back at code from just a year prior without thinking it was total crap. Nobody expects a junior to create beautiful architectured code, but you need to have experienced this epiphany of \"I wrote this, and it's trash, I should have done so and so\".\n\nOf course reading about code, be it design patterns, or something else entirely is also good. But you need to ensure that actually writing, debugging, testing code is the main part of what you spend your time on. I would suggest only reading for an explicit aim in solving something you are currently working on for the foreseeable future. It is very easy to fall into the trap of reading instead of doing and then thinking that you're becoming better book by book. You need to put what you're researching into practice, without it, it won't do you much good.\n\nGood luck in your adventures",

If you don't know any framework yet, just take the one with the biggest userbase / selection of tutorials. That will make your start easier, and switching a framework later really is not that hard. \n\nIt's just like learning your first programming language feels hard, because you are actually learning programming. Once you pick up your second language, it will go pretty fast, and your third language won't even take an entire weekend to start getting productive. Same goes for frameworks: Once you know how a backend is structured, they are all pretty much the same. (They are solving the same problem, and there are only so many ways to do that) \n\nSo I would suggest, staying in JavaScript (although it pains me to see it used in the backend), and choosing the framework with the best community support. \n\nThere are a lot of alternatives, and you probably should use many of them at least for one project, until you feel you've found something you like. Python has Flask, Django and FastAPI (among many more), PHP has Laravel and CakeSomething? I think. .NET, Kotlin, Java all have some, Go is great for backend, and although personally I really enjoy axum in rust right now, that is really hard to get into for beginners.",

I say in your area because it does drastically change depending on when you live! JavaScript is often miserable for employment, especially if you are BE only.\n\n\\- If your goal is to learn some stuff, I would stay with JS/Express. You are already familiar with JS, so you can learn the server-side concepts more easily without having to relearn the language. But learning comes in any shape, so it would also be perfectly fine to switch to a different language if you want to.\n\n\\- If your goal is to become a full-stack dev with a decent developer experience, definitely stay in the JS ecosystem. This way you will be able to leverage both the fe and the be to a very high degree while writing the same code, reusing types, etc. With time, you will probably move to Next or some other full stack framework instead of express.\n\nNotice that I answered your question regarding JavaScript in general. Thats because the specific technology doesn't matter in your case. Yes, express is minimal and somewhat outdated, but its perfectly fine, and even great, at teaching you concepts and getting you started. You will shift your stack and ways of writing code a million times, but fundamentals stay.",

You should always start with the question: What are my requirements? \n\nOtherwise, if you just spam \"corporate tech stack\" things, you will end up like this: [https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition) (yes, the joke is 10 years old, and still relevant today)\n\nJust as comments to your list: \n\n1. all of this seems okay and important, for most java/spring backends\n2. Why? I mean, microservices CAN be great, but they always increase complexity, both to develop and to deploy. If you can't give enough good reasons as to why you need microservices, a monolith might be better. \n3. I don't know what you mean by \"completely\"? It is probably not necessary to learn postgresql \"completely\" (that would take a loooong time), because in all seriousness: your app will most likely not need 100% of all possible performance out of your database. Even if everything you write is 10x slower than possible, it will still be more than fast enough in reality. \n4. Monolith is simpler, Microservices scale differently and can do a clean separation of concerns. Monolith should be your default!\n5. afaik you can just deploy docker images to kubernetes, no? My understanding is, that kubernetes is just a more fancy way of managing deployed images, and stuff, but I am not very experienced in deployment. \n6. Again, why do you need this? Ci/Cd sounds good on paper, but especially the CD part adds a lot of complexity to your deployment phase. If you can't articulate, why, default to a normal, manual deployment whenever you think a release is ready. \n7. Cloud is just an invisible server. You can get a VPS for very cheap, which doesn't run the risk of increasing your cloud bill into the stratosphere, if you use too many CPU cycles. Start there. As with CI/CD and Kubernetes, this is really not a developer issue. It's a deployment and DevOps issue. At small scales, you can do it yourself, but you really don't need a lot of complexity, and when you are working at a company, there will be a separate position for this. \n8. This is legitimately the most important point on your list for a developer, and there is no single correct answer. As with all design decisions, there are a lot of possible tradeoffs. While I don't have a good book for that handy, I would suggest reading up on your favourite API Design (REST for example), because much ink has probably been spilled about that topic. Also: experience. Just build some APIs and see what works, and what gives you more issues in the long run, when you try to refactor a new feature for example. \n9. So, this is complicated: Most backend system have a proper event system / observer pattern thing going, like flask or axum both have pretty good signals internally. As long as you build a monolith, this is really good and should definitaly be used. Kafka is just a way to send signals over multiple microservices, which CAN be useful, or it can just add more unnecessary complexity! As with everything else that adds complexity, start with the assumption, that you should not use kafka, unless you can articulate why you need it!",

You can practice by coding, and by doing stuff, that helps you switch abstraction levels (which you can also learn best by coding imo). The important thing is: no one can have an accurate mental model of 10k lines of code, and that is pretty tame as far as big codebases go. In the last corporate project I worked on, we had 3 main (and several smaller) microservices with about 30k-60k loc each. So instead of memorizing files, I learned the structure of the project. When I was asked, where to find a feature, I could then think through it logically. This only works, if your project is internally consistent, so if you have every piece of code placed correctly. For example, we had all models in a folder, all endpoints in a folder, with subfolders for very large collections of endpoints, all validation code was together, all signals where in a single folder, and so on. At that point, it's just like following a map: \"Okay, you want to know about the bookmarking function for an article. Let's open all models regarding bookmarks and articles, the endpoints files, the signals and start looking if we can find what we are looking for anywhere in there.\"",

        "body": "So, backend and frontend are pretty different skills: You have started dipping your toes into frontend, which is mostly declarative: You tell the computer HOW things should BE, and you will need to learn a little JavaScript for better interactivity, which is imperative: It tells the computer WHAT to DO, if something happens (a button is pressed for exmaple). \n\nThis is connected to the fact, that the frontend is very visual. \n\nThe backend works on data: You get a request, you react to that request ba returning data of some kind, often after running multiple layers of checks (authentication, authorization) and fetching data from a database. \n\nYou might like both, but I would still suggest that you stay with frontend for a while, at least until you are pretty well rounded there. Afterwards you can try backend and decide, if you want to pursue both (fullstack) or even switch over to backend. \n\nYou seem to have the best learning strategy already figured out: \n\n1. learn a little bit of theory\n\n2. apply that theory and incorporate everything else you already know\n\n3. repeat\n\nIf you want something with a set curriculum, go take a look at the odin project [https://www.theodinproject.com/](https://www.theodinproject.com/) . I have not taken it myself, but I have heard good things. The Foundations -> JavaScript Path looks good to me. \n\nBest of luck to you, and feel free to come back with any questions you might have later, while learning",

If the website is static (all content is sent upfront with the HTML), then I agree with the other commentor. I'd use Python, with `requests` to fetch the page and `BeautifulSoup` to parse it to get the data out.\n\nIf it's dynamic (Javascript is executed in the browser to fetch the actual content that you care about), that won't work. You'll need a tool like Selenium (basically, it allows you to control a browser via Python) which is capable of executing Javascript.\n\nYou can tell how the site is populated by opening the dev-tools and comparing the Elements and Sources tabs. If the content you want is in Elements but not Sources, it's dynamically generated. If the content is in Sources, it's static. If you're comfortable with it, you can DM the URL and I can take a look at the site.",

Then it's not as straightforward, but very possible and quite easy to figure out where the data is coming that you actually want to search using your browser's dev tools. Say you're visiting funerals.com or whatever, but the site actually fetches its data from funerals.com/funerals?start=2025-10-24&end=2525-10-25 and populates the website dynamically.\n\nNow you have the API (application programming interface) endpoint and you can just fetch that data instead of the whole website.\n\nOnce you have that working, you can look into cronjobs or scheduled tasks, if you're on windows, to make your script run automatically at specified times and then look into notifications. Via mail, some messenger, SMS, whatever, so you don't have to remember and bother with running the script manually.",

If so, that formula won’t help you and you likely do need a loop. Since they’re not allowing you to cast to a string you need a mathematical solution. One that loops through each “place” (1s place, 10s place etc) and gets each value to sum together.\n\nIMO the question as you’ve described it above is a little ambiguous but I’m not sure if that’s how it was presented to you verbatim or not.",

In this case n is 2 and 2+1 is the 3 from above.  \nThe last number to add is just \"n\". However, there's a trick. More on that later.\n\nYou could use recursion here, but that's not necessary.

        "body": "The API is how programs make requests to each other. You usually don’t want to expose your program’s internal logic to outside sources, that’s just asking for trouble, so instead you define an API that lets outside sources make requests to your program with predefined parameters about what they can ask for, what data you need from them, and what they should expect to get back in response, and then you build a function in your program to parse and handle the request.\n\nLikely the most common implementation of this pattern is Rest API that allows your front-end web service to communicate with your back-end code. An analogy I like to use is ordering food at a restaurant: imagine if you went to a restaurant where there was no waiter, no menus, just a chef in the back kitchen. To order your food, you just yell whatever recipe you want to eat at the chef. If he knows how to make it, he will, although it might not be exactly what you asked for because you couldn’t see a menu to know that their version of grilled salmon comes with Broccoli while you were expecting asparagus, because nothing was there to tell you so, and you aren’t allowed to go poking around in the kitchen. And, if you ask for something not on the menu, the chef sends you back an empty plate. If you ask for something REALLY not on the menu, the entire kitchen might catch on fire. That is your code with no API, where the front end is allowed to just make requests to public methods in the back end.\n\nWith an API, you have a more standard restaurant. The waiter (API client) comes out and hands the customer (user / front end) a menu (API schema). The customer now knows what is available to order, and what they should expect to get back once they place that order. If the customer asks for something not on the menu, the waiter can tell them “no” before that request ever makes it to the chef. And the chef, instead of waiting around trying to listen to 500 customers all screaming nonsense from the dining room and trying to pick up orders, can instead just rely on the waiter to carry valid requests back to him as a single point of contact. The chef also just needs to hand the prepared food back to the waiter and let the waiter take care of interacting with customers, instead of having to sprint out of the kitchen to drop food off and then rush back to handle the next request. And finally, say something changes in the kitchen — they run out of paprika and need to substitute chili powder, for example. Now, instead of the customer having to *know* that the chef is actually using chili powder and, if they order a dish with paprika, the whole order gets thrown out… they can just order off the menu like normal, and the chef is responsible for knowing “menu item #17 uses chili powder now instead of paprika”, make the dish, and send it back out. The customer doesn’t have to *care* exactly what spices are being used, just that they wanted a dish, had a standardized and codified way to ask for that dish, and then whatever happens between the waiter and the kitchen is a black box, but results in the dish being served to them.",

So they can ask c++ code -> assembly level( not to write but to point out to show knowledge) -> CPU instruction level -> talk cache, talk core parallelism etc. etc depending on job and level however this is mostly intership for me.\n\nEdit: TLDR In my experience you have to solve an algorithmic problem, usualy leetcode style, and then explain the details of the solution through the lens of hardware",

From memory, these are drawn on the UML diagram using solid or dashed lines.\n\nThe 'has a' relationship can also be of differing types, for example 'one to one', 'one to many', 'many to many' etc. Again, from memory, these can be captured on the UML diagram using circles, triangles and other symbols.\n\nThe UML is just simple diagram that allows the OOD to be captured on a piece of paper. That is all there is to it.\n\nThe harder part is learning the OOD itself, but that too is not overly complicated as it is about things like attributes, visibility, methods, abstractions, encapsulation, relationships, polymorphism etc.\n\n**EDIT**: I used properties in my description.

Deal with optimizations when you need to, or when you feel like it. Get it running and working first. \n\n> or if I cannot find a tutorial that is directly relevant I struggle to try and take apart the code line by line in the documentation. \n\nThat's okay! It's a skill you develop with time. The way I approach this is, \"how does what I want to do differ from the tutorial?\" and most of the time I can kinda figure out a way to progress from tutorial to what I desire. \n\n>  I still don't understand how a vector can have an index, or whether it's the 2d line itself that is an array containing points. \n\nIt is always interesting to learn how a library works, but it's not _always_ necessary. Going back to your art example, I might know how to use a paint brush, I might know how to mix two paint colors together to get something new, but I might not know how a brush is made from scratch or what the individual pigments that go into a paint color are. Sometimes it helps, maybe one pigment reacts differently in certain conditions, and not knowing that might catch you off guard. But, it's not _required_ knowledge, most of the time. \n\n\nGood luck, hang in there. I remember feeling this way too, but I can't pinpoint a singular thing that got me over it. I think it was just stubbornness? I tend to go \"fuck it, IDC if it exists or if it's slow, I just wanna make the thing and see it work\". Slowly but surely, you start picking up new skills. At times they feel distinct and disjointed, but sooner than later they'll click. Another thing try is to view your initial idea document as just a guideline. You _think_ you'll use a linkedlist here, recursion there, etc etc. But when it comes to actually implementing it, you might find that your initial assumptions about the project were not accurate, and you'll have to adapt.",

Nice guy who would gladly explain anything and wasn't stuck up about being an expert.\n\nWhy the \"layoff\"? - to improve the Q3 numbers.  The work load didn't drop, not only was there more work, but less of us to do it. And it was no longer fun. Everyone expected to be terminated.   Why? We have bloated middle management who only care about the bottom line.\n\nIt got so bad  that another senior engineer just quit. He HAD to be backfilled asap as the work is quite skilled. You can't put just anyone in these jobs and expect them to cope. So they brought back the Senior Guru canned in Q2 - at a reduced pay.\n\nThe whole place just sucks. Everyone is now only about making their numbers. No help. No camaraderie. No extra anything.  It doesn't help there is no OT, just comp time IF you make enough each week and its approved after your do it.  You have to work at least 2 extra hours per day to qualify for comp time. 90 minutes? Nope, you lose.\n\nSenior nice guy has horror stories about the job market. He no longer does anything extra. He'll let you watch him work but won't comment and just puts his head down and outdoes most everyone else. Making it worse on the junior staff as they take longer and their numbers are dropping.  Guru guy quietly says that management can't be trusted and will probably lay off again the when the Q1 slack hits. He thinks it will probably be him as he still makes more than most. But nobody knows.\n\nNo one raises any issues at meeting. The life has drained out of the place. It was a fun an exciting job. The call will come just before your shift starts.\n\nManagement lies at every call.  They talk about the heavy forecast and how much work is coming. - Exactly like they were before the layoffs. They are probably just saying it to convince the people above them. Its such an obvious act now that you know to look for it.\n\nKeep your head down. Shut up, do you work. Spend your free time studying and looking for a better job. Don't make any large purchases and save every penny. \n\nCanned?

People don't really want to talk about it, but there have always been a tremendous amount of people in the industry who did very little. At least that's how it has been since I started in 2007.\n\nThe reason why it used to be like that is because you used to be able to predict revenue growth by adding warm bodies and new projects, but now that tech (particularly the web) in a lot of ways matured its a lot harder to increase profits in this way. There are far fewer obvious ideas not being done out there that you can make bank on by doing. Thus the incentive has become cutting through the layers of fat and excess in engineering orgs.\n\nGoing forward I see tech as being far leaner than it has been and more focused being placed on building high-performance teams that are spearheaded by high-impact individual contributors. Whenever those teams yield significant results you'll probably see them hiring reliable warm bodies again to maintain and extend what they've built. Even with lower interest rates I don't really see this dynamic changing much. Because back in the day you could just mill out CRUD apps and rake in cash but that game is tapped out.\n\nWith that being said the experienced engineers who aren't finding jobs are the ones that never really applied themselves to achieve significant things for the organizations they worked for. Any body that's spent their career trying to be high-impact/goal-oriented and developed a reputation and resume to match isn't struggling nearly as much right now.",

Same story for most of his friends, classmates. I guess it’s beyond bad when these folks can’t even get jobs and it’s not gonna recover that easily with AI and outsourcing.",

Eventually all these companies that are trying to squeeze the most out of each worker will lose critical employees, those employees will move to companies who are not squeezing them to death, those companies will start growing someone will eventually eat those former company's lunch.\n\nThe problem is that this whole process could take years - maybe even decades - to materialize. In the meantime, workers get fucked, shareholders benefit, and the executives that are fucking everyone over will be long, long gone by the time the repercussion of their actions materialize.",

To me anytime someone from a non FAANG company asks a leetcode question I just know they put 0 thought into their hiring process and probably have a revolving door of engineers. FAANG does it because they have 10s of thousands of applicants and teams etc. You are just copying them when you only have one product, you are not the same.\n\nIts like you said companies that don't ask leetcode or are smaller tend to pay less but they still pay well.

Pay is shitty but would you personally take a job with shitty pay for swe?\n\nI was at a private non-tech company in a non-tech city working on safety critical medical devices, think dialysis machines, for 15 years  It was my first job at out school in 2006 and I made 42.5K.  At the end I was leading teams of 20 SWEs on multi-year cross functional projects making 110K.\n\nPeople will ask, why didn't you leave?  The answer was I was never good enough to find another job when I decided to start looking.  The problem was my experiences didn't match the YOE or title at other companies.\n\nAt the end of the day I was working at a non-tech company, their goal was pumping out features and meeting the bare minimum of FDA guidelines, not creating quality code.  Lots of things I know tech companies do this company had no interest in doing.\n\nI even worked in my free time to develop a prototype of how something like Jenkins could help by running automated tests nightly.  When management found out they literally told me \"if you want to work extra on the weekends work on project priorities or don't work on anything at all.\"  The issue was management didn't care about things I was trying to solve.\n\nThey were content with the speed of development, which was slow.  They were content with how automated testing were run at the whim of people who owned the tests and sometimes issues would be found late in to the process.  They were content with all the tech debt, because it wasn't preventing them from meeting their goals of getting FDA approval.\n\nAt the end of the day they know creating an FDA approved medical device takes a long time and they were confident they could talk away any issues that did not affect patient safety. There were 100's of bugs that did not affect patient safety in the bug tracker, but fixing them was only priority when doctors or patients complained. \n\nI'm not saying ever place is like this, but that has been my experience which really soured me on working at companies like this.  Sadly I'm not smart enough to get in to real tech companies, so I just have to deal with what I can get.",

Because then I can explore something else and it's not at the expense of me being worried I quit my job, I got let go. \n\n\nBut that's also because I have no debt and a healthy safety fund. I've also interviewed for jobs that weren't even swe jobs but the domain knowledge from my swe gigs was very valuable to them. So become interdisciplinary early on or seriously make sure you understand whatever field you're in bc a liaison between tech and something else is invaluable. ",

It probably didn't help him get the initial interview, since I think that was more about the fact that we were recruiting at his school, but it definitely helped him stand out during the interview process. When we were in discussions about the new grad class, that project was mentioned often and certainly kept him above the fold. It should be noted that he had to pass the interview solely on technical merits.\n\nOne side point with this is that he was extremely difficult to work with because of this. He kept mentioning how he had built an app with thousands of users so he knew what he was talking about. We were building a company at petabyte scale with millions of users, so his experience was not particularly applicable. Not saying that you're like this, but it's something to be aware of. It shows that you're a go-getter and good at figuring things out, which are important qualities of a great SWE, but a SWE role at a big company is an entirely different skill set than a successful app builder.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, I was able to land my first internship through a successful project. The thing that made my experience different from yours is that our app had very few users but a ton of publicity (it was kind of a wacky idea). This helped recruiters find us. All of the members of our team landed internships by responding to social media posts about our project. I also think that the companies liked the marketing aspect of \"look at these fun young founders working for OUR company.\"\n\nIn short, I think having a successful project is great during an interview, but having a highly publicized project is better for getting your foot in the door.",

I am going to poke to see how arrogent you are, This followed up by how well do you take being wrong or pushed back on.  Also see how well you will take being assigned grunt work.

Until people start developing a sense of common cause among all their brothers and sisters who work (this \\*includes\\* commonly demonized people like H1Bs, Indian workers, people on temporary contracts, etc), instead of approaching it from the direction of \"but how can I get mine?\", talk of unionizing is dead air.\n\nI'm hardly a labor scholar but I think an important precondition is a shift toward cultural solidarity of workers over employers. The first movers here, as in any labor struggle, will likely be casualties. Workplaces will -- as has been happening -- retaliate. People will be fired and blacklisted, whole departments shuttered, etc.\n\nIn the \\*absence\\* of a broader cultural context around labor consciousness, the lesson these retaliations teach is \"that was a bad move, you can't win\". Whereas in a context of solidarity, it is more acceptable to take personal risks to advance the greater good. You have to be willing to do things that might get \\*you personally\\* fucked, in order to advance the interests of labor, the common good, which I think most people today are very, very far from.",

Simply because the people here are complaining about work hours, pay but hey over there in this other country we can abuse the living shit out of people and our operating costs are lower.\n\nSecondly, software developer position is highly dependent on the thing/service the company is trying to make. For example, a person sitting in pakistan or india can make the same website/app that any person any american software developer can make. Moreover, these people will bend over backwards to adjust to the american demand. \n\nThirdly, unions will demoralize and depress the high salaries one can find in tech companies. Again, for example pilots in air canada are paid bonkers and the union has to constantly fight against the corporation to hold a bargain. \n\nFourthly, the supply of software engineers is slightly higher than the demand at the current moment. This will overall negatively impact the strength of the movement. A new grad software developer doesn't have the leverage to bargain for higher salary because of inexperience.\n\nThis is however, not the end. If you want, push the law makers and politicians, collective force to lobby the government into taxing the companies which outsource or use more AI. The way I see the current problem in software industry is that, the big players want to cash in on the AI demand, the mid level companies are trying to make a product which will earn them the attention from big companies. The government is only interested in sucking rich peoples' cocks. There is nothing to stand in the way.\n\nOther commenter u/dontping mentioned some other pathways, which are viable but they demand more time and effort than the current market is willing to deploy. Don't get me wrong, this is a great idea but to do this there has to be a way to back industry into a corner without getting the economy fucked.",

An executive's job is to run a section of the business, make it work well, and be accountable to its results.\n\nAn executive's job security is based on how important their piece of the business is, how hard/risky it is to remove them from that piece of the business (either to replace them or reorg the function away), and how politically influential the person is (like who else will leave or become a problem if I fire this person). \n\nIf your org can just be eliminated or you can easily be replaced, and everything else will stay standing without you, then you have no job security. If you are directly driving the company's financials, no one else can run your machine, and everyone else that is important to the business likes you and will be pissed and follow you if you are fired, then you have near-infinite job security. \n\nThe title means nothing. It's just about what power you have. Generally, the title of an executive is supposed to be descriptive, not prescriptive. You are VP of eng because you are the person controlling eng. You aren't controlling eng because you are VP of eng. Where these are misaligned, the person with the title needs to be pushed out and replaced with who's actually in charge, and will be in any functional org. But who is actually controlling critical pieces of of the business is very safe.",

Extremely senior roles actually have less equitable job prospects in the open market at any given point in time, and as a result most businesses will \"sideline you\" while you figure out your next move. Senior SWE? You can get interviews tomorrow for that. VP of software engineering? Takes time to connect to your network, make a role for you, or work into an existing hiring process. \n\nWhat it also may look like in a mass-layoff type scenario is that you need to layoff a significant amount of your team, then you \"get fired\". You would be critical in rebalancing the existing work on the new owners but consolidation may drive your role to be redundant anyway. You can't justify the scope of work or w/e.",

Those who aren't are asked to go back to IC. That also meant that directors with limited spans were asked to take on more areas, but I didn't see any directors laid off.\n\nI think layoff risk decreases higher up you go, but firing risk increases. As a manager or director, you're responsible for certain OKRs and project deliveries. It's inevitable that there will be some bad projects out there, either in tech talent of the team, bad product vision, or operational politics, only some of which the manager can control. The last director I knew who left not on his own accord was fired (or you know, replaced, 'left to pursue other opportunities' or whatever) was fired because his project went against architectural guidelines which led to risks that the business was unable to accept.\n\nIt's also expensive to lay off directors, and VPs especially. At a certain level, you can negotiate your own exit package that is nonstandard. So, I think there's some second thought that always goes into laying off at higher levels because of that.",

Someone who can advise you on career trajectory and all that.",

H1-Bs are a good step, now they just need to tax flat +20% to any business that decides to contract overseas.  Any dev shop needs to have a physical location in the states and virtual offices don't qualify.\n\nUntil that happens then things won't change much but FAANG will certainly pick by up heavily, then following the rest of the industry; however, the only reason they'll be hiring is because they have to replace H1-Bs, which is a low amount of workers.\n\nSubsequently, if the Guardian catches wind they're just replace H1-Bs then they'll fire out propaganda against Meta so they want to avoid PR stuff.  Therefore, a lot of people will be hired (not like COVID) but enough for you to get some.  Unfortunately, unless AI burns and crashes (3-5 year reset, until LLMs are run onsite), then we won't have a true recovery, just slowly getting better.\n\nIt'll be funny when AI startups realize how expensive it is to run an LLM with the latency of the big models.  Nvidia will release their increasingly more powerful local LLM devices; however, the LLM computer will be more like a laptop you get at a company.  Probably have some fancy case to put everything in and there are some distributed, blockchain-y kind of things you can do with them.\n\nThat's why I believe these corporations are calling for back-to-office, not because of real estate money so much, but these smaller, compact LLMs need to be physically near each other to keep the costs the cheapest they can.  Look at Morgan Stanley's updated trading floor, no elbow room.\n\nEventually the LLM will be stuck in your head with neural link and you can really be a slave node at that point.

The pay is also good state dependent, I made about 70k year 1, year 2 I was close to 6 figures, and the next several years I was ~120-200k depending on overtime and how much I wanted to work.\n\nThe negatives: you often get shit work days (weekends, nights), poor pto, work holidays, work in hazardous environments, it’s hard on your body, and you work with people who HR would have a meltdown if they heard for 5 minutes (gay jokes, teasing you, political talk, stuff some aren’t comfortable with I didn’t mind but I’ve seen several people quit a week or 2 in over it). \n\nI’d recommend industrial if you go the path. It’s more dangerous as you work with big stuff but you keep plants running like you can work for a refinery, brewery, stuff like that. You aren’t in peoples houses and you aren’t messing with code stuff all the time and you have constant work, they usually get paid the best depending on the place.\n\nIf you have any questions or anyone else does feel free to ask.

It's something that I will enthusiastically undertake to help someone else.\n\nI'd recommend trying more development roles before exiting for skilled trades. Try a big company. Try a medium company.

Having a degree is just a signal for \"able to stick with learning CS coursework for 4 years\" but that in and of itself isn't an actual job requirement, it's more of a \"in the absence of anything else, I'll take any signal you have\". It's just that, since majority of new workers only have that, it de-facto becomes the floor for expectations, cus statistically nobody can realistically do Salesforce or Kubernetes or whatever at entry level (...unless you can)",

My mother used to go into work at 6 AM so she could leave the office in time to pick us up from school. My dad worked from home so that he could be there in the morning to get us ready and drop us off. Both compromised significantly - both by declining promotions, and by staying with companies that afforded them more flexibility over those that paid better. They turned down Google offers because it was known for being a very hard place to work at the time, so it's kind of funny that FAANG is seen as kind of a golden ticket these days.\n\nSo long and short is that you will have to compromise - either in terms of career progression or not being with your kids - if you feel you're hitting your limit.

Also you might have meetings at anywhere in work hours.\n\nSo you cannot simply work 2-10 because you want to. That means nobody can reach you before 2, and you won’t make it to meetings before 2.\n\nIn my experience permanent deviations from work hours usually require you have a special situation and need accommodation for that. Then your manager can arrange this and everybody knows they cannot reach you at some hours. And meetings that need to involve you are not scheduled to those hours. But even in this case 2-10 is a big stretch. Practically no company will support this permanently.\n\nI sometimes do and see people do something else: You start your day at the beginning of the work hours, check in and be available but do not actively work. When somebody needs to reach you, you respond. If you have a meeting you join. Then when it’s 2, you start actively working. After official work hours end you continue working until 10, but tone the communication down and stop answering to people who want to reach out, until next day. But this is usually more difficult than working regular hours. And I only do this temporary basis. Edit: Apparently this only makes sense for remote work. If you need to go to office at 9, there is no sense in not actively working.",

The experience you are describing really falls into the “builder cto” role… have you considered an early stage startup?

Might want to spend an hour or two a night getting ramped up on running LLMs locally and MCP/RAG for the agentic stuff as that’s where all the funding is right now, and you already have solid domain/industry experience.  \n\nI know downskilling sounds like an attractive option but sometimes you just gotta put ten toes down and stand on business.  There are plenty of hands on CTO roles out there looking for real experience right now.  I’m not saying don’t try for the SDE roles but just pointing out there is a path where you can both get more hands on and keep a path in the csuite.  Check out stuff like execthread and wellfound, and just know that recruiting for this stuff doesn’t happen on the normal channels so try to figure out what’s the best path in your ideal industry and what’s available around your local market as well.

Now you have to take part in a self study / unpaid training, do well in that and they may allow you into the actual paid training program. Not sure which clients are Revature ships out the trainees to anymore.\n\nRecently I was given part of a class action settlement with Revature. Shams vs Revature, It was claimed that Revature included illegal language in their contract such as enforcing repayment of training fees. Also having associates use their own equipment for training.\n\nOne of the craziest things I experienced was that we spent some time learning AWS.

Juniors don't get jobs becuase they are useful and make the company money, they get jobs because we all know we need juniors to skill up to become the next generation of seniors. \n\nB) Build Build Build. Pick a specialty you like, and start building large projects with it using popular libraries so you can get a feel for how it all works together. Focus on using the framework and libraries that the industry commonly uses first, you want those names on your resume and cover letter. \n\n>but I feel like machine learning is too competitive now I am not really a top programmer material \n\nThe entire industry is competitive as hell, ML, like all CS, has roles for top talent hat make the **REALLY** big money, and roles for regular developers who are still learning or just want a stable job. When you look on social media, or listen to others, you're only hearing about the top developers, you don't hear about Jim who spends his days doing the grunt work that allows the top developers to have the time to do what they do. You don't need to be  genius to be a great developer, you just need to build and listen/learn from your colleagues every step of the way. And maybe in 10-15 years you'll be a top developer, or maybe you'll prefer work life balance and just be a regular developer like the vast majority of us are. \n\n>What are some directions I should chase? \n\nhttps://roadmap.sh/machine-learning\n\nLearn from those who came before and follow their path, or make your own path, but you'll have to learn the same basic things so following other people's paths is generally more efficient.\n\nAlso, as someone else mentioned, you will almost certainly need to learn leetcode questions. Don't panic they're easier than most people think. The easy level questions shoudln't be too hard, go through 20-30 of them to see what sorts of questions you'll be asked. But before moving to medium or hard, first learn DS/A. Data Structures and Algorithms is what Leetcode is there to test (not entirely, but basically). Most jobs will almost never need it, but really complex problems solved at scale (think Google Map's directions handling hundreds of millions of requests a minute) do, so Google started using these questions to test their recruits and the rest of the industry couldn't be bothered to make their own interviews, so now we all have to answer them. \n\nThis youtube channel has some great lessons on how DSA/Leetcode all works:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@mycodeschool\n\nThey don't cover every element of DSA but do cover the most common. Either watch a video, then go to neetcode.io and practice the questions related to that video, or get a question on neetcode.io, look at the answers, then go find the videos that cover the answers and watch the video and then learn how and why the answers work. Sorry if that's unclear, my point is don't sit and try to \"learn\" how to answer leetcode questiosn on your own, lots of them are not \"intuitive\" and you will only get annoyed. It's much simpler to understand the question, then find the answer soemone else already fine tuned and learn that. If you want to fix a car, you don't just go smashing on things and see what happens, you get the manual. For leetcode, DSA and neetcode.io togehter, are your manual. \n\nAnd no, you don't need to pay for neetcode.io for it to be incredibly useful, you get better organization if you pay, but it's all still very usable for free. Though I will say, its' a pretty useful site, so I did end up paying, but I actually got the lifetime membership after I got my job and had some money coming it. More of a \"thank you\" than anything else, plus I'll have it for my next job hunt, though hopefully leetcode questions will be fully gone by then, they're definitely starting to disappear which is nice.",

So doing projects that involve cloud infra or general dev op CI/CD pipeline I think would be really helpful. For example if a job posting goes up and outside of the basic \"must know javascript/react bla bla\" theres probably also going to be a line or two somewhere about knowing something in cloud like AWS Lambda and knowing some infrastructure stuff. Even for the \"SWE I\" roles. If a recruiter sees your resume and cant instantly draw that link for AWS Lambda for example they are likely to scrap it. Its annoying but that how it is with cold applying right now.\n\nYou also have your degree in computer engineering, im curious to what job positions you are actually applying to. You should still qualify for early career new grad stuff along with internships which sounds like you are also applying to but have you tried stuff out side of the web dev space? Like embedded stuff/robotics etc? Heck honestly you could probably read a C/C++ book and open up a whole new world for yourself.",

You will have to be willing to move, take maybe not swe position but it/cs role, and starting out experience not pay.\n\n4. Record your interviews and play it like game footage to figure out the type of questions asked, weak points resume, and how you articulate yourself.\n\n5. Mock interview yourself with someone 1x week.bare minimum. Try to have them dig in your resume and go in depth extract down to mutiple layers of why you did x, value brought, trade offs, etc. Interviewer wants to understand your thought process and most people including me beyond surface level struggle to articulate mutiple layers deep unless they really know their shit.\n\n6. Aim for lower barrier entry gov, defense healthcare, retail, etc.\n\n7. If your resume is not getting hits, let say least a 4% ration. 100 apps least 4 interview. I would use online resource, friends, or pay services update resume.\n\n8. Star when answering questions interview.\n\n9. You should be sending out say least 15-20 apps every other day during work week imho.\n\n10. If you have any social skills or your kinda funny, try find some way to relate it could be as basic as small talk b4/after interview to even little banter if your confident enough. \n\n11. Always send thank you email after every interview and give or take 3-4 weeks no response fine send follow up.",

This system does has its perks that you can escape a bad fit the second rotation, and you get to try new things. \n\nBut internally? There’s a lot of teams who hate TDP/Coda hires because they are basically assigned one and they can be a net negative. That attitude is awful in a pip culture because everyone already wants to save themselves and claim as much visibility as possible (first person to turn in performance reviews can claim milestones and others then have to go to extra efforts disprove them). Imagine being a senior engineer and you want to help the junior get up to speed but if you do, you likely going to get pipped for not delivering more of your own tasks. Years ago, they apparently counted mentoring, interviewing, and similar activities as a bonus point towards performance and now it’s almost a negative. \n\nYes, yes. If you don’t end up in Card/similar, and get placed in Cloud in C1 you can barely do any work and not get pipped compared more competitive orgs (I know someone in cloud who admitted that they should get pipped but their manager is too lazy and finds it easier to just lie about their performance and cloud is less aggressive on pip). \n\nBut you really don’t want to roll that dice",

If you cant or are not willing do that pick a few companies and roles that you'd like to target. Read the job description and find out exactly what they are asking for. build a project or contribute to an open source project that is based around that jobs needs.  \nFor example if you are applying to netflix streaming, it might be useful to either contribute to ffmpeg or build a quick wrapper application around ffmpeg.  \nIf a company is looking for someone to help with their AI/ML stuff it would probably be useful to make an AI agent.\n\nMost of the jobs/recruiters are just matching keywords and things that align with their goal.

The only sustainable move for specialists to make is to get into leadership. Preferably as quickly as possible because the bottom can and will fall out. See the current status of Salesforce development for example.\n\nContrast that to a generalist who gets paid less to start, but eventually they know so much there isn't really anything they can't do. Once you're 15 to 20 years deep studying become unnecessary because you have a total grasp on how everything works within the current architectural limits of computing. You can literally do just about anything at a high-level and weigh every pro and con from a technical perspective without needing to research anything. They're far more likely to retain their roles when the bean counters in finance are looking to make cuts.",

Specialization can be added on top to fit into desirable roles after.\n\nThe problem I see with a lot of specialist engineers, even mid-to-late career, is that they can end up being sidelined when things go wrong.\n\nLike a superstar front-end engineer who can crush React components, handle bundling and build systems and even has solid chops putting together a build system and deployment pipeline. But they might end up flummoxed when the site is broken due to bad DNS config, load balancer problems, certificate issues, etc.\n\nSpecialists can be super productive when they are in their lane and things are working on the happy path. But they can end up struggling  when troubleshooting failures and problems that occur in systems they \"own\" but fall outside their speciality.\n\nI'm happy that I've spent time working on provisioning systems for bare metal servers, fumbled my way through setting up networks and getting BGP working across VPN links between sites, built my own AD domains and a thousand other \"IT\" tasks which most Software Developers are never exposed to. Its been amazingly useful when it comes to troubleshooting failures and being able to identify all the places where problems can be injected into the environment where services run.\n\nSo ultimately, I think it is most valuable to be a specialist in one or more domains, but with a broad exposure and experience outside of those specialist silos. I think that means you pretty much need to be a generalist early in the career, then evolving specialist knowledge in one or more domains as your experience grows.",

It isn't guaranteed of course but for L3+ with a good performance record, you have a shot. In the short term it may be worth the trouble to get a short term rental with a less insane commute while you decide if the role is a good fit.\n\nYou should absolutely include RSUs in your consideration for this role. Stripe has had 1-2 tender offers annually for the last couple years so there are plenty of chances to get liquidity. Yes, RSU grants are taxed at your marginal income tax rate (about 50% for me), and you will pay capital gains if your shares increase on value after vesting (this is a good problem to have). If you are a high performer, you can stack additional RSU grants that vest over 1-2 years and sweeten the deal considerably.\n\nWLB varies by team of course but I don't think it's as bad as some people say. You can try to get opinions for your team/org by asking on Blind. It's definitely not a place where you can coast but I rarely work over 40 hours a week. Being a good communicator is critical here (as in many big techs).\n\nPIPs do happen but you should give yourself some credit - passing the interviews and getting an offer is not trivial and it means that you have a good shot at succeeding.\n\nIt opens doors for you career-wise in tangible ways (learning new skills) and intangible ways (brand recogniziton, relocation opportunities to the US, that kind of thing). Depending on your goals and lifestyle values you might find that it's a smart move. Good luck!",

If you burn out or slide into isolation, the pay won't feel good.\n\n**Try this:** pick a small target for change. Could be *\"Meet one teammate for coffee/virtual chat this week and ask what their blockers are.\"* Or *\"Offer to pair on one small task.\"* If you get zero response, that’s an indicator.\n\nKeep the radar up for your next move. You’re already coming from a team with good support... so you **know** what better feels like. That’s strength.\n\nIf it keeps feeling lonely and unsupported for 6-12 months, seriously weigh whether high pay + poor teamwork = “worth it” for you.\n\nBottom line: you’re not stuck forever. You’re learning, you’re doing good work. If this place starts to eat your joy or energy in a non-recoverable way, it’s valid to move on again.\n\nHope it gets better for you.",

Feeling trapped between financial obligations, career dissatisfaction, and the loyalty you feel towards your team, especially with such significant projects on the horizon, must be incredibly isolating. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed when facing such critical decisions, particularly when they involve your health, your peace of mind, and your ability to start a family. When you're dealing with such frequent panic attacks and the daily drain of a job you dislike, it's natural for your brain to feel like it's in overdrive, making it hard to see a clear path forward. Prioritizing your mental health is never a sacrifice; it's an investment in every other aspect of your life, especially when you're considering bringing a child into the world. It might be helpful to explore different ways to manage the acute symptoms of anxiety, especially since your current medication situation is changing. Sometimes just having a toolkit of techniques can make a big difference in those overwhelming moments. There's a free [podcast](https://youtu.be/72ZhaR-aWNI) that covers common anxiety symptoms, coping strategies, breathing exercises, and techniques for controlling panic attacks, which you might find useful to listen to in your own time as you navigate these challenges. Thinking about your long-term health and happiness is really important here, not just for you but for your future family. God bless.",

You cannot know what abstractions you'll possibly need before the software is being used in the real world and you run into edge cases/new feature requests.\n* Keep the conversation grounded - ask for practical examples. What would happen if we didn't do this? Would we experience pain when working with this code? Would it be easier or harder to make a mistake/bug?\n* KISS - keep it simple, stupid. Onboarding new devs is going to be more difficult the more abstractions you add. Then maintenance becomes an issue. Then mistakes are made because the new guy doesn't understand the code. Think of writing (as in, a novel): Plain words are good words because everyone understands them.\n\ngood talk, somewhat related: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4anAwXYqLG8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4anAwXYqLG8)",

        "body": "It's a matter of picking your battles. \n\nIn my experience \"clean code\" is very much in the eye of the beholder and is more a matter of whether the author and the reader are on the same page rather than any objective superiority of any particular method of coding. Just like any other sort of writing. \n\nThere are of course some general principles that tend to make things better, and it is certainly possible to make *horribly unclear* code, but past a certain point a lot of it really is a matter of taste.\n\nSo essentially a person who has strong opinions about specific details of how code should be written is similar to a person who thinks their preferred genre of music is superior to others, or otherwise thinks their taste is superior -- they are wrong, but it's going to be very difficult to convince them of that, and the more persuasive you are the more they will probably dig in and get pissed at you.\n\nSo you'll need to decide which things *you* care about and which things you don't. \n\nIf you don't actually care about something, just go along with what they want and smile and nod anytime they try to justify it, content that they're trying to justify it to themselves as much as to you.\n\nIf you do care, really think again about whether you actually do care. Lots of people don't actually care about things they fight for but rather let ego get tied up in it and are instead fighting over ego. Try to avoid that if possible. So really think about whether you genuinely do care.\n\nAnd if you genuinely do, try to act in good faith. Explain what you think, then invite them to explain what they think and walk you through their thought process and be genuinely open to it. They might actually have good reasons, and so *you* should be open to changing *your* mind. But inviting them to explain will both make them feel like they are valued (which is important to them if they have strong opinions about how the code should be written) and also let them talk themselves out of ideas that are bad (like, if you explain a good idea and ask them to explain theirs, they will have a hard time denying yours is better if they actually have to explain it, and because it is them talking it through and deciding they will be more likely to compromise than if you order them to).\n\nInviting them to explain also gets both of you on the same side -- rather than arguing you are instead both looking at the same problem and talking about it as a thing separate from yourselves. And that change in perspective is helpful -- it makes them feel less like *they* are being devalued if their ideas aren't used.\n\nIn my experience, most workers do ultimately want to get along and do good stuff, and if you can diffuse their defense mechanisms and avoid getting defensive yourself you can usually find a common ground.\n\nBut if a person truly is an asshole and can't be reasoned with and truly is my way or the high way, and you really do care about the thing they're digging in on, your best bet is probably to try to go around them. Build support for others / get others to validate your view. After all, if the person is an asshole to you then they have probably been an asshole to others as well, and so you probably will find support. Try to avoid getting ego involved, as that will only make it harder and also pull you into petty drama.",

The reason why people are unwilling to compromise in many cases is that the benefits of clean code are large. i.e. The more readable, testable and maintable, and reusable your code is,  the faster you will go.

But you didn't say how you defined that.  \n  \nClearly define what over-abstraction actually is.\n\nOne simple one is speculative design.\n\nAdding inheritance when there is no code-reuse, (or no good reason at the moment) is speculative design.\n\nAnyone who does test driven development typically is very good at avoiding speculative design.

An acquaintance of mine ended up doing front desk at a hospital after trying to pivot around.\n\nIf I'm a hiring manager hiring for Vue I don't necessarily care if you know React or Java or anything else. Casting a wide net for a job search makes sense if you have a broad transferable skillset, but if you're already somewhat niche with something like Vue, it might make sense to just go deeper in the niche since the pool of qualified applicants also tends to shrink the more niche you go, since depth isn't as easy to acquire due to paretto principle.",

You buy your servers from Dell, HP or similar and then rack them. That's then paid rather than paying $$$ to AWS, Azure, GCP or similar. Cons are that you're limited on what hardware you have deployed - you can't just spin up more hardware quickly.

It can be cheaper, but the overheads mean that it's not necessarily a simple choice, in particular if you need to hire co location space etc - all of this adds up quickly.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'd go for cloud first and only go on prem if there was a very good reason for it, and that all of the points I made above had been considered.",

As you scale you gain more leverage to incentivize companies/clients to implement their own pre-processing (or provide as a paid service) to gain access to your tool. Probably worthwhile to keep the client-supplied data in a different database for posterity.\n\nThis is pretty basic first-principles stuff but I’ve been shocked how many people don’t do this kind of thing",

Nobody loans someone money thinking \"This person sucks, pretty sure they're gonna fuck me\".\n\nThere's 2 very different questions baked into your post. One is how to bill yourself. The other, and one you're neglecting, is doing business with family/friends.\n\nGo ahead. Google what doing business with family/friends is like. No matter how good my sister's tech idea might be, in no world would I ever consider working for her. Same for my friends. My friends are very smart, they have lots of good ideas. But we're friends. Not co-workers. That's why I'll never in a million years do *any* sort of work for them.\n\nIt's very well established that you should never do business with friends/family. And if you do, you should do so expecting to never be paid. You're working for free. If you expect to be paid, you should not do the work.\n\nFor the other side of the question, you mention you have an aversion to an hourly wage..... why? There's a reason that's what a lot of freelancers do. There's lots of hidden costs you don't think of that can pop up during a project. It's really tough to just say \"Yeah, just pay me $X\". If any of a million things come up, $X suddenly turns into $X+$10k. Now you're out a bunch of money because you tried to do an upfront cost versus an hourly rate.\n\nAs for the actual rate, a lot of SWE's tend to charge $50-100 per hour.",

He probably solved that problem countless of times before so it's straightforward to him. If he has been working for the company a long time, he is also much more comfortable with the codebase than you, naturally.  You will get there eventually, don't stress out about it.\n\nI don't think you should log in during your PTO or work every weekend. That's a sure way to burn out, and your performance and focus will get even worse. Do other things, have fun, refresh, have hobbies.\n\nAlso, maybe the stories that you get assigned are hard for your current level. A lot of companies don't even want junior developers, and don't know the appropriate level of tasks that they should give them.\n\nIf you are always given tasks above your level, then you will always feel like you are not enough. It's all relative.\n\nMy only advice would be to ask more questions and ask for help earlier in the task and not wait until the end. If you are unsure about how to do something, ask for advice or \"how to do it well\" or \"the best practices\" for such task. When you want to discuss your task with your senior, study your task very well, understand the code you wrote, and **TAKE NOTES**. \n\nDon't try to remember everything in your head if you can't. I always brought my notebook during meetings when I had to talk about my tasks and code and referred to it when needed.\n\nGood luck",

I thought that was hard, but it was actually quite easy compared to working within a properly organized tech company.\n\nFirst 6 months at my current tech job were absolute hell. I could not get anything done on time. All of my PRs would get torn to pieces in review. I caused a handful of significant issues in prod. I spent every single day worrying about getting fired. A few of my more complicated projects brought me to tears.\n\nEveryone I work with has like 7+ years of experience. I feel like a fucking worm compared to my teammates. Just like you said, they can do in an hour what I can't do in five. I can't even comprehend how people can work at that speed.\n\nHere's where our stories diverge, though:\n\nMy manager has consistently (like at least once a month) reminded me that I am doing an awesome job. They have reminded me that it's normal for me to be slower than my teammates, it's normal for me to struggle or have knowledge gaps, and it's normal for me to ask for help. My work is valued by the company even if it isn't as impressive as the work being done by industry veteran wizards.\n\n>“I don’t even know how to help you.”\n\nThat's your \"Team Lead\"? Their job is literally to know how to lead you. They are admitting that they are bad at their job. This is like the absolute worst thing you could say to a junior 6 months into their first dev role.\n\nYou should not take what this person said to heart. Maybe you *do* suck at the tasks you're being assigned, but that might just mean your lead sucks at assigning you appropriate tasks.\n\nIt doesn't sound like you're incompetent, but it also doesn't sound like you have imposter syndrome. It just sounds like you have a shitty boss that isn't facilitating or recognizing your growth.\n\nI would just keep your head down, do your work, and shrug off the shitty attitude from your boss. This early on, you should just take things one day at a time. Rack up a couple years of experience and then start exploring better opportunities.",

My company, which was fairly small, started to grow exponentially. I started developing websites from start to finish, creating more complex APIs and data pipelines, and working closely with outside companies and onboarding their users to our flagship application.\n\nMy advice? If you’re having trouble finding another job, but you have the flexibility in your current position, starting looking into creating bigger projects for yourself. You can either discuss this with your team or manager or you can look into any other tools/integrations that you can introduce to help boost your company’s business.

So if its a recruiter that's been in the game for a while, they have a bunch of candidates they've contacted before, or they already know where to look\n\nIf its someone who sounds a bit new, they send that initial contact msg and if you aren't responsive thats when they keep pressing\n\nSo not sure if you've noticed but sometimes you'll get hit up by different agencies where the JD is eerily similar if not identical minus the usual text replacements. It's because it is in fact, the same role for the same company\n\nIn either case, if you don't get any response, some other candidate likely already bit, and they've submitted them for the role (obvi they can submit multiple candidates) but you can see that you've got a better chance the sooner you respond to their initial contact. Maybe you did, but maybe there were also 10 others and they chose to go with candidates that gave them (the recruiter) better chances for selection\n\nI've mentioned this several times before with regards to recruiters - we're just race horses. If you show promise, they give you all the attention, because they're betting all their money that you get selected for the interview process and hopefully all the way to an offer.\n\nIf you're behind, or lacking, that's when you get ghosted.

If you can take the feedback and try to improve, you still have an incredible opportunity to become a better engineer.

If you're feeling really burnt out, then a good day is just spending the majority of time working your problems.

It's tough.

Because their assumption is that we are just not as technical as them. They don't do it consciously and if you mention it to them as a feedback to your manager they will 100% get defensive and you will come across as \"oversensitive and blaming them for sexism instead of responding positively to their feedback\". \nBut it's been my experience, my friends' experience and I ve seen it countless times.\nThere have been times that I saw men in my team doing things in a certain way and their PRs got merged. I tried to use their approach and my PR got scrutinized. \nI try to just stay on the facts, avoid making any accusations, just sharing code snippets and say \" we used this approach here, how is it different now?\". Most of the time, they don't have an answer.\n\nJust try to look at your output objectively. Are they really right to what they are saying? If not, try to remind yourself that your output is just being scrutinized much more than theirs. If yes, try to improve on the things they are right and also document what you worked on/what you did to improve. \n\nI also found that these issues significantly reduce when I work in teams with a more balanced gender ratios. My current experience at this job, has been really extreme and it makes sense since I am literally the only woman in a team of 15+ people.\n\nI wish you good luck! ❤️",

You got a CS degree and that is a testament to your knowledge and ability to learn and grow in this field.\n\nI don’t know what companies are looking for with respect to new grads these days. It used to be the case that companies hired knowing you had zero experience but the capacity to learn and grow into the role. These days, since there’s so many new grad applicants, the bar for hiring has been raised and so you’ll need to improve your resume to get interviews and improve your interview skills to increase the odds of performing well.\n\nThink of it as levels in a game, you'll want to focus your energy on one level at a time (more or less). Since you're not landing interviews, this the first level to pass. Get constant feedback on your resume. You should be iterating on it — share it with friends or redditors to get feedback, make improvements, and send it out to companies (job boards, networking, etc). If you get callbacks, this means your resume is good enough. If not, keep doing that iterative feedback loop until you do. \n\nOnce you feel you're landing interviews a bit more consistently, then you'll need to focus on the interview rounds. I don't really know what that entails for new grads, but you seem to be on the right track. Practicing leetcode as a way to prove your understanding of DSA is good. Working on personal projects is also good. Keep track of what problems you encounter and what you did to solve them, and be able to communicate that. They don't expect you to be an expert, just want to know how you think and tackle problems. It's great that you're focusing on infra and LLM projects btw. There's no right or wrong path here, the field is too broad so it's best to do what you're interested in because enjoyment is a crucial recipe for making progress and preventing burnout. It's better to have some depth here rather than shallow breadth. \n\nIt really sucks that this is the market you’re graduating into, but you’re definitely not a fraud, and you're definitely not alone in this experience. Do what you need to sustain a living and be sure to socialize, exercise, and eat well to keep your mental health in good shape too! Good luck.",

Not all companies have a good onboarding/ramp-up time for you, but that's not something you can control anyway. \n\n  \nOnce you get there, find out what you need to know for your team's projects and tech stack.

Use AI to quickly understand parts of the tech stack you don't understand. Feed it documentation and ask questions. Clarify your understanding, but be skeptical about what it tells you. ask it to confirm, ask it for direct reference sin the documentation if you're unsure.\n\nI don't really know what's best for a junior in this era of AI-assisted tools.

        "body": "The problem with academic programming in school is that business has an entirely different set of needs, tools and development processes. As a junior-level person, you're not expected to know all that stuff. There are a couple of exceptions to this rule -- startups frequently expect new grads to know as much and be able to perform at the level a senior with full implementation level knowledge of their tech stack in the first week. FAANGs might also have higher expectations and be more unforgiving as well, depending on the FAANG.\n\n\nLarger corporations that aren't FAANG will generally have well established IT groups who can offer a decent level of mentorship. Maybe focus on trying to find a spot at one of those.\n\n\nThe more you know in general the better. Being able to set up docker instances and CI/CD pipelines is a pretty good skill to have, even if you don't find devops particularly interesting. You might even want to go look at hashicorp's terraform and tools like that, that allow you to stand up a huge amount of infrastructure with the wave of a hand. I don't particularly care for terraform's configuration, would much rather do it in python, but it's still a pretty neat tool and a good one to have in your toolbox. You are very much building out a toolbox now, and it's good to know the things you have at your disposal.\n\n\nI wouldn't suggest coding directly with AI. There are a couple reasons for that and your instincts are good that if you just blindly copy and paste AI code, you're not really going to learn anything. Poke at the problem a bit and use the AI for inspiration. If it writes code for you, try to read and understand it and possibly even rearrange it a bit. Rather than \"Write some code to do X\", focus on \"How do I do X\" and try to understand the underlying concepts.\n\n\nAlso, relax! Back in the 80's when I was getting started, there was already way more to know about this field than any single person could know. Math has been like that since Isaac Newton's day -- before him, one single person could know everything there was to know about math. He gave us the map to an infinite landscape. Programming is similar, an infinite landscape of the mind. Don't try to understand it all at once and accept that there will be things you couldn't have even imagined were out there. Maybe you'll even invent one of them one day!\n\n\nGot a couple of funny stories for you if you care to keep reading.\n\n\nFunny story about relaxing: I decided to learn how to skydive when I was in my early 40's. My instructors kept telling me to relax. And I was all like \"I'M ABOUT TO JUMP OUT OF AN AIRPLANE! I AM NOT GOING TO RELAX!\" A few months later I went to the indoor skydiving wind tunnel and told my instructor I just wanted to mess around today and not focus on learning anything. As soon as I hit the wind I felt my whole body relax and I realized that *I'd never done that before!* And I flew so well that day. And knowing how to relax, my driving (which I'd been doing for ~30 years at that point) immediately improved as well. It took a somewhat extreme experience to get me to that point, and it's something I wish I'd learned much earlier in my life.\n\n\nFunny story about people skills: Empathy is a human superpower. We have the ability to think about what another person might be thinking and feeling and act on how we think they're feeling. Hone that power to a fine edge and it's as close to telepathy as we're gonna get. At some point along the way, I found that while reading code, I could get a sense of how well the programmer who wrote it understood the requirements and even their mood and how they were feeling when they wrote the code. It's weird when it happens.\n\n\nSo back in the poker craze of the early 2000s there were a bunch of guys around who'd go to bars and set up tables to run free poker tournaments. They'd arrange to get a small kickback from the bar for each customer they brought in. I got laid off from a company I was working for at the time so I started frequenting these tournaments, as they were free to enter and usually offered a free $30 bar tab to the winner of the tournament. I could pick up one or two of those a week and get one or two halfway decent meals out of them. Playing poker taught me to look at people. I can't read people as well as I can read code, but the first time I knew what a guy's hand was just from watching him while he was thinking about betting, I felt like a sorcerer.\n\n\nSo learn what you can about computers, but also learn what you can about yourself and the species you belong to. You'll find some surprising things there too, I think.",
