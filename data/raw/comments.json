My initial reaction to it was how well thought out it was and how well documented. It felt like a db platform built to address the pain points of battle weary DW practitioners.\n\nThroughout my career I've seen \"Tech X is better than Tech Y, why can't people see that\". It depends on whether those advantages are relevant to your business. There are always pain points. What impact, if any, do these have on your business and do they negate the advantages.\n\nI worked for a consultancy that was a Snowflake partner. We worked out how to run Snowflake, and other SaaS tech at very low cost.  As a Snowflake partner, this made us as popular with them as hemorrhoids in a spacehopper race.\n\nWhat people forget in Tech X vs Tech Y arguments, particularly in the SaaS world, is that both are watching each other, evolving, copying/stealing features. Yesterday, Tech X was ahead, today Tech Y is ahead, tomorrow, who knows?\n\nRemember too, it isn't the size of the wand, its the magic of the magician.  Lets suppose you can query infinite data infinitely fast. Management take one look at the results, don't like them and send your team off on weeks worth of wild goose chases to determine why the figures don't match their perceptions if what ought to be. Even if you prove the figures are accurate they are likely to insist they are wrong because the data on which the results are based didn't include other factors.",

If your processed data already resides on their platform, it's understandable you get dazzled by these new offerings because it is easy to use all of them and even faster to get a POC out in front of the executives.

Data engineering is the intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering. A *data engineer* manages the data engineering lifecycle, beginning with getting data from source systems and ending with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning.\n\nData engineering as a fundamental concept is always going to be the same, but how this is accomplished has evolved and changed over time. The scale of data has become larger, the requests for data have become more complex, and the data engineering solutions have changed. \n\nThe decoupling of compute and storage has been a big deal over the last 2 decades. The rise of columnar storage has made OBT a viable solution over Kimball's strict dimensional modeling. Kafka has changed how data can be incrementally ingested. \n\nMore recently, there has been a mainstream shift towards data mesh architectures, eliminating a need for a centralized data warehouse. Policy driven access control and dynamic data masking has changed how data governance is enforced. Snowflake and Databricks are continuing to gain market share. LLM's are changing what needs to be delivered to stakeholders.",

Never again. Its great at boilerplate and when you tell to follow examples to a tee. Otherwise, it kinda sucks. I ahave 8+ yoe. One mistake is fine. Over-reliance is bad. It should come out in a performance review. I believe what new studies are showing. Vibe coding creates so many bugs, it eats 20% more time. Boilerplate generation saves me time personally. Its why I bought the hype when I was sick and desparate to remain productive. Btw. QA is the most expensive part of any development process. For many of us, it already is the process.",

The application logic and authz is also in some cases deferred to the DB in Stored Procedures - a horrendous design driven by a data engineer who didn't/couldn't consider the whole application requirements\n\nThe best skill you can learn is to be commercial, understanding and improving the data task requirements and how to communicate and refine broad tasks from the business.\n\nLearn how to understand the domain/problem, application/software/data architecture and understand the tools you have/are available. Then communicate improvements to the plan in planning, spikes, reviews, retros etc. And ensure you know your data modelling fundamentals - you should know when to normalise/denormalise data, implement appropriate SCDs, and the different industry 'best' practices for updating and tracking pipeline tables batch updates.     \n\nSo many engineers in general just do the task without understanding the why or taking ownership.

First, it's a bank. Despite their desire and rhetoric it is not a tech company. The people in charge of technology have no idea what they are doing and because it is a bank they get to mandate their will without requiring buy in from engineering. I remember reading a blog post from Uber about their CICD initiative and how they couldn't just force their colleagues to use it. At Capital One you can roll out the biggest piece of shit and then mandate it's adoption across the company to the detriment of everyone.\n\n\nSecond, their absolutely insane performance management system completely cripples the company. I don't think I can return until they fix it and they never will until Rich retires.\n\n\nHaving to continuously fire the bottom fifteen percent performers is insane. I'm all for firing non performers but it requires the ability to identify who is performing. I've been in performance management meetings where I was the only other person who could open GitHub. If you're going to do extreme performance management then you need to have the ability to actually know who is getting work done. Instead, it's completely based on narrative. People who cannot code, do not know you or your product, will decide your merit. It is insane and stupid and many good engineers flee the company for the reasons mentioned above.\n\n\nThat said, there are very good people who for either spite or stubbornness (like myself) stick it out and try to make it a better place. They really are doing shit no other bank can. There are very good teams doing interesting work and very toxic teams where you will get fucked.\n\n\nJust like life it's a mixed bag. They pay well and if you aren't a coward you can learn a lot from those few awesome engineers holding down the fort. Take the money ride the wave and see where it takes you. ",

That makes it possible to handle massive historical datasets without expensive SSD clusters or rebalancing.\n\nFrom a performance standpoint, we’ve benchmarked Arc using ClickBench, the industry-standard analytical test suite.\n\nOn identical hardware (AWS c6a.4xlarge), Arc outperforms TimescaleDB and InfluxDB by a wide margin.\n\nWithout cache: Arc ranks #8 out of 60+ systems.\n\nWith cache: it climbs to #3 overall, just behind DuckDB and ClickHouse.\n\nBenchmarks and details here: [https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc?tab=readme-ov-file#performance-benchmark-](https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc?tab=readme-ov-file#performance-benchmark-), here too: [https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc?tab=readme-ov-file#clickbench-results](https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc?tab=readme-ov-file#clickbench-results)\n\nIn short, DuckDB gives Arc its analytics speed, but Arc extends that into a scalable, long-term time-series warehouse that can economically retain and query billions of records using Parquet and object storage.",

Arc’s focus is a bit different: it’s built for continuous ingestion and fast time-based queries, where writes are append-only and most performance comes from how data is partitioned and scanned, not from transactional updates.\n\nRight now, MinIO is the default because it’s stable, simple, and S3-compatible, which makes it easy to run Arc anywhere (local, on-prem, or cloud).\n\nThat said, we’re still very early in the journey, and the storage layer isn’t locked in stone, we’ll definitely explore other options if they offer better trade-offs in performance or availability.

The reality is your needs and priorities are going to shift 50 times between now and the next 3 hires and you need to find folks who can pitch in at all levels.\n\nThe biggest mistake I've seen is teams hire \"Analytics engineers\" that lean much more towards \"BI analysts/engineers\" and know BI very well and/or are specialized in a specific BI tool, then all sorts of logic ends up getting crammed in there as opposed to the data level. Nowadays with AI BI requires less and less complexity, the most important is bringing the data into a single place and modeling it correctly. Just my $0.02",

It’s on the job seeker to ask what the day to day and the stack is like to see if it fits their skills/preferences\n\n**Edit: To add some color from my experience from my last 3 jobs.**\n\n1) I wrote REST APIs to expose feature engineering datasets for ML model predictions it was a hybrid web/data job.\n\n2) The job after that I wrote Pyspark and Airflow DAGs delivering data to S3 and Redshift did all the data modeling in that and managed our infra manually ClickOps/CLI/Python scripts on AWS because they didn’t want to let us use Terraform/Pulumi. \n\n   There was an independent devops team who could’ve helped us with infra but they washed their hands of my team and forced us to use clickops since they controlled the infra repos and AWS credentials. \n\n3) Current job is very tech heavy, great engineering culture. We manage the whole stack infra, orchestration, all the way to gold layer end to end and deliver user facing products with analytics. Stack is Terraform, Airflow, dbt + Python, Snowflake, Fivetran/Airbyte. We write everything and every engineer knows their stuff. Team is only seniors though everyone has 7+ YOE.",

I was serving a corporate meeting dinner and spilled a whole gravy boat down some important person's suit jacket.\n\nTo echo what my old manager said to somebody who kept apologising, nobody wants to hear apologies.  Everybody just wants to see improvement.\n\nFirst thing is hold yourself to high standards.  Give yourself a rule - you're allowed to make mistakes once.  Once you mess up, you make adjustments to fix it.  I am quite forgetful and give myself a lot to do although I've found writing down a list of actions for a project, prioritising them, and then going through them one by one was great for my organisation.\n\nSecond is to also be kind to yourself.  Care about what you can control, accept that shit happens for things you can't.  If you miss an edge case that you can't predict, then honestly, there's no point beating yourself up about it.  \n  \nI'll give you another story - I was getting a user reporting a migration \"wasn't correct\" even though it was 100% exactly the same as it was before.  \"I don't see these characters that are appearing before.  They're there now.  The migration has failed\", they said.  If you look at it with the naked eye, you'd be right.  They don't exist...IN THE SQL DATABASE.  When converted to parquet they show up.  Shit was literally invisible to the naked eye and to the IDE looking at the text in SQL, but if you go and look at the fucking location specific character encoding and convert it, it is 100% there.\n\nThis comes with experience.  Some things cannot be helped.  Mistakes will always happen.  It's how we handle them after which defines us as people.",

You can parameterize everything and template your way out in Informatica as well, though their git support is not always as nice as I would love. \n\n\n> Does informatica integrate well with DBt?\n\nYes.\nYou are however talking about different services. Data catalog is obvious; given DBT's focus on metadata. I see no reason as to why it should not be a breeze, though I have not used CDGC and DBT together yet.\n\n> Can we kick of DBT loads from informatica after ingesting the data?\n\nYes. You can execute your tasks on command line or use the API and track the jobs through there if you need. \nBut if you already have an orchestrator, why push that into Informatica? Informaticas catalog can get lineage etc anyway.\n\n> Is it DBT better or should we need to stick with snowflake sps? \n\nNot sure what you mean. \nDepends on situation and circumstances.\n\n\nYou can use cdgc, data lineage, data quality and profiling in Informatica, without having Informatica to handle your ingestion or transformation. Or you can if you wish. Remember you can go to docs.informatica.com and download the scanners' document on DBT if you you wan't to know what is supported. Or any other systems you might thave, that Informatica supports. If you are to touch these tools you should have gotten an account so you can get the information that is requires an account.

Companies will need to rethink their entire data strategy, from ingestion to processing to validation, because legacy systems just will not cut it. The AI wave does not replace humans. It raises the bar for the humans managing data. In fact, those who understand how to design systems that consistently produce high-quality data will be more in demand than ever.\n\nIt is not just about feeding AI.

The tedious stuff like basic ETL scripts and transformations, that's already getting easier. But the hard problems? Understanding messy legacy systems, making architectural decisions, and figuring out data lineage in nightmare scenarios that still need humans who know what they're doing.\n\nThe bit about companies needing to restart their data operations rings true. I've seen organisations realise their data is basically unusable for anything sophisticated and having to retrofit quality controls they should've had from day one.\n\nI reckon junior roles doing routine work might shift, but experienced data engineers who can actually solve complex problems? They'll be fine. Probably busier than ever.\n\nWhat's your experience been? Are you seeing companies actually investing in proper data quality or just hoping AI magically fixes it?",

Another option is that you use an open source solution to process this before loading it into snowflake. Options include systems like delta lake and tabsdata. \n\nBottomline is that whatever you do, it should lead to operational dataflows that will continue to work after the current backlog is finished to ensure that the systems stay in sync until the legacy ERP is retired (which, brace for it, may never happen).\n\n(Edit: formatting)",

If you do not care to, for example, be notified of schema changes like type changes or field additions, or you have a limited nr of fields and you want to type manually, then maybe you do not care. If you do care, the discussion ends here - let dlt discover schema and accept the limitation that comes along. \n\nThat being said, there is also also a benefit to using json in db - the data is pre-joined so retrieval of nested data is faster than re-joining tables. For this reason we are working to add typed complex data support to give you nested with schema discovery option where supported by the destination.\n\nIf you do not care to manage schema then let's talk about the raw data  - there is a benefit to storing json for debugging. My personal preference is to use a mounted drive and persist the extract and normalize packages (raw and normalised pre-loading) data in a bucket with <30d deletion (serves debugging and implies with gdpr without extra management), or to load via a staging bucket. IMO json does not belong in SQL because once it's there you havw to take it out to be able to use proper tooling to handle it.  \n  \nregarding raw data - dlt doesn't change the data, so if you want to just debug the data, you can debug it in db. dlt does change metadata such as column names, adds types, or removes null-only columns (they have no data, cannot be typed)",

Provide a small set of vetted query templates for common asks; let the agent fill dimensions/metrics only. Lean on dbt exposures/metrics, cache the heavy queries with materialized views + TTL, and invalidate via lineage.\n\nHandle dialects by normalizing with SQLGlot; add a “safe mode” where the agent outputs a tiny DSL that you compile to SQL AST. Observability: fingerprint queries, tie to user/session, log rows, bytes scanned, and cost; sample results to detect drift. CI: canary prompts per dataset with golden answers and block deploy on regressions. Governance: row-level policies, redact PII before Slack, and cap output size. Backpressure: per-user budgets, token and scan quotas, and a simple priority queue.\n\nWe’ve paired Airbyte and dbt for pipelines, and DreamFactory to auto-generate REST APIs over legacy SQL Server/Mongo so the agent only hits curated endpoints.\n\nGet the sandbox, evals, and budgets right first-then the agent loop becomes manageable.",

Why:\n- being too specific with LLMs kills their agency. Semantic/metric layers often even define how you sort the data. It’s good for dashboards and such but not for exploratory analysis usually triggered by prompting — recommended read: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents\n\n- semantic layers are (due to how specific they need to be) are long and never ending projects. AI is moving faster, you don’t want to block AI to when semantic layer is ready (never)\n\nWhat do you think?",

For BigQuery, we had to push lineage via API/dbt metadata; otherwise you get spotty, table‑level links. Watch cost: cap the Data Map size, scan only curated zones, and schedule weekly not daily. A workable pattern was keeping GCP Dataplex/BigQuery lineage for engineers while using Purview for glossary, classifications, and compliance reporting. If open source is off the table, Atlan or Alation tend to give a smoother cross‑cloud UX and integrate cleanly with dbt/OpenLineage.\n\n\n\nI’ve used Atlan and Alation for catalog/search, and paired DreamFactory to auto‑generate REST APIs from Snowflake/BigQuery so downstream apps could hit governed datasets without custom gateways.\n\n\n\nBottom line: unless you’re leaning into Azure, Purview won’t match Collibra’s cross‑cloud polish-prove value with a narrow pilot and keep GCP‑native lineage in play.",

But they agree on Parquet, Deletion vectors, and I believe they've just aligned on geospatial data types too. So they're very similar and as a result, can be made interoperable. \n\nShould you prefer Iceberg or Delta Lake as your \"preferred\" catalog or open table format? Jury still seems to be out. \n\nBut if you end up wanting to change your preferred format, or end up needing to speak multiple to interface with tools that only handle one, that's very doable these days thanks to tools like Apache XTable.\n\nSee https://xtable.apache.org/. It can translate between Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Hudi metadata, without needing to duplicate the data itself. \n\nDisclosure: my employer contributes to Apache XTable (and offers table format virtualization et cetera as part of Microsoft OneLake: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/onelake-iceberg-tables)\n\nNot trying to sell you anything here though - Apache XTable is OSS and thus free to run on-premise of course (except for the hardware itself and your time, of course). If you have e.g. S3 api compatible blob storage on premise, believe it's supported: https://xtable.apache.org/docs/how-to\n\nAlso has nice docs on integrating with various other catalogs: https://xtable.apache.org/docs/catalogs-index",

In other words, a majority of this complexity is just the result of compensating for platform gaps, which ends up destroying maintainability and predictability.\n\nMy $0.02 - go with a platform that provides a declarative (as opposed to imperative) approach, where you focus on the data flow/transformation, and the platform handles the failures in a predictable manner. \n\n* If you are already on databricks, delta live tables are it. \n* If you are exploring alternatives and want something lighter weight, tabsdata is a good alternative that you can run on your laptop and expand on later. \n\nBoth these systems will allow you to use your favorite python tools without having to worry about orchestration overhead and failures etc.",

If the notebook and warehouse are in different workspaces, the MI will probably need at least Contributor in both workspaces. It doesn't need to have any permissions on the capacity.\n\nPerhaps the .synapsesql() just doesn't work when triggered by MI. This seems to be a related case: https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Data-Warehouse/Service-Principal-Getting-quot-HTTP-request-forbidden-quot-When/m-p/4832636\n\nAs a workaround, you can write to a Lakehouse table (and, if you insist on using a Warehouse, you can use API to do a metadata sync of the Lakehouse SQL Analytics Endpoint and then load the data from the Lakehouse SQL Analytics Endpoint into the Warehouse using a T-SQL script/stored procedure).\n\nRe: Storage blob contributor. No, it should not be relevant here. Storage blob roles are Azure roles. In Fabric, the Workspace Contributor (or Member/Admin) is what matters.",

It also saves time.\n   * You can expand the list of sources that you cover. You can take a look at ready-made platforms or open-source tools to ingest data from all these different sources you need.\n   * At this stage, the data would land in a place you control in a certain layout and structure at least.\n* In terms of formats, the answer would depend very heavily on the types of formats:\n   * If you have machine-readable formats like JSON, CSV, Excel files, Parquet files, and whatnot, this just becomes an orchestration problem, throw a data pipeline tool on it and you are golden.\n   * I presume that's not the only thing, since you give the PDF example. Parsing PDFs with varying schemas over time is a hell I don't wish my worst enemies to go through, so that's not easy.\n   * I have recently played around with Mistral's OCR model to extract a bunch of invoice data and it worked flawlessly, tackled \\~95% of our incoming invoices.\n   * This would still require you to build a data pipeline solution around this, where the underlying work would be done by an AI model that would extract the structured data.\n   * Once you have the structured data out, you would store this data in a data warehouse or a data lake with a clear schema and structure.\n\nFrom this point onwards, you would have a:\n\n* Central lake where you store the raw files\n* A data warehouse / data lake where you store the extracted and structured data\n\nThis would theoretically get you to a better place.

I’d lean to a separate overrides table keyed by the business key with columns overridevalue, overriddenat, overriddenby, reason; then finalvalue = COALESCE(overridevalue, sourcevalue). That lets you revoke, reapply, and report on overrides without touching the base record. If you keep it inline, make origvalue immutable, add updatedat/updatedby/reason, and guard the update path so file uploads can’t rewrite origvalue.\n\nPerformance-wise, COALESCE on a nullable override column is cheap; just index the business key. Keep raw in bronze, compute final in silver, and document the rule. Fivetran and dbt handled this cleanly for me, and DreamFactory exposed a small CRUD API so ops could edit the override table safely.\n\nSo yes, your approach works, just enforce immutability and plan for audits or use an overrides table.",

If this doesn't pass, the data doesn't leave the raw layer. \n\nThe second is more of a comprehensive data quality check (summary statistics and drift), which is usually performed further downstream and is business-logic dependent. Something like Great expectations or dbt expectations are open-source packages that can be used to handle this. Errors in this part are more subtle and usually indicate that something has changed in the data generating process.\n\nIn my opinion, the third part, imputation, falls rather into the ML/Data Analytics domain and should be carried out by the data consumers as it is completely use-case dependent.",

For each source object, canonicalize JSON (sorted keys) or extract PDF text, then compute a doc hash and per-chunk hash; skip unchanged docs and only re-embed chunks whose hash changed. Track docid, sourceurl, lastseenetag, dochash, embedmodel, embedversion, chunkid, chunkhash, qdrantid, status, and pagination watermarks. DynamoDB works well (GSIs on status/source + TTL for old versions), though Postgres is fine if you want richer queries. In Temporal, run per-document workflows with chunking/embedding as children; batch Qdrant upserts and use idempotency keys like hash(docid|chunkidx|embedversion). Keep S3 versioning and a manifest so you can replay safely. In Qdrant, index payload fields (docid, version), and retire old vectors by version when a doc changes. Airbyte and AWS Glue handled odd API pulls for us; DreamFactory helped when we had to auto-generate REST APIs from legacy DBs to keep ingestion consistent. Add the metadata DB early and rely on hashing/versioning so updates don’t blow up your pipeline.",

It sucks because you could be a perfectly competent data engineer who builds solid pipelines without knowing every detail of the DAG scheduler or executor memory management, but some companies use these deep theory questions as a filtering mechanism. The frustrating part is there's no universal standard - one company wants you to explain catalyst optimizer stages, another just wants to see you write a working transformation. Your best bet is to have a baseline understanding of the theory (what happens when you call an action vs transformation, basic execution model, why shuffles are expensive) but don't kill yourself memorizing every architectural detail unless you're targeting companies known for this style of interviewing.\n\nThe shift in how you prepare should really depend on the signals you're getting from your interviews. If you're consistently hitting walls on theory questions, then yeah, dedicate more time to understanding the \"why\" and \"how\" beneath the surface. But if you're getting through technical rounds and failing elsewhere, your time might be better spent on system design, communication skills, or just doing more practice problems. The truth is most associate-level work doesn't require you to debug Spark's physical plan daily, but being able to speak intelligently about it shows depth of knowledge that some interviewers value highly.\n\nIf you want help for these unpredictable theory questions when they come up, I built [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat) to navigate exactly these kinds of curveball interview scenarios.",

At deploy time, read the registry and build assets with consistent keys like source.table; new tables mean a small config change, not new code. Use SourceAsset for cross-repo dependencies and auto-materialize policies to keep downstream models up to date.\n\nPartition raw by ingestion date (daily/hourly), then map partitions downstream; avoid per-table custom partitions unless there’s a real reason. Cap fan-out with multi-asset nodes for shared transforms. Sensors: file sensors for landing zones, plus a “schema drift” sensor that diffs metadata and opens a PR to update the registry so assets get generated on the next deploy. Testing: unit-test asset functions with buildassetcontext, add asset checks for row counts/nulls, and layer Great Expectations or pandera where needed.\n\nI’ve used Airbyte for ingestion and dbt for transforms; in a few cases DreamFactory auto-generated REST APIs on top of legacy DBs so Dagster could pull from them without custom services.\n\nShort version: keep core assets static, generate raw assets from metadata.",

I would recommend forgetting you ever learned pandas as no serious company would ever use it for their data engineering. A far better modern solution for personal projects is DuckDB. SQL is always preferred over Python for data inside the DW. Knowledge of tools like dbt and sqlmesh again stand out to me here. For data ingestion know enough about APIs that you can use Python to loop through responses using a limit offset. Do you know how to read datasets from file storage (multiple files in a folder)? It should be a given that you understand data modeling, dim, facts, layers, etc. If you understand these core concepts I will know that you can learn anything.\n\nIn my experience data engineering is a very mentally challenging field and juniors who lack problem solving skills often do not make it. If you are an order-taker reconsider your choice.",

You are hired to deliver business value using data, do that. This will give you both credibility internally, as well as future buy-in for deeper technical decisions you'll make.\n\nIn the mid-term, I think your intuition is correct: you'll want to move the data into an analytical database and do the processing there. This would allow you to ensure the data is in the right shape, is accurate, and is easy and cheap to query from Power BI. You'll probably need to be pragmatic there too, therefore a first step in that direction could be something that you can run locally. That would mean no risky business in terms of access control, would be a bit of manual work for you but wouldn't require additional buy-in from different teams. The middle database could also be a SQL Server instance if the company is a Microsoft shop, it doesn't have to be Databricks if it is not available just yet.\n\nIn the longer term, you'll probably want to move towards whatever the rest of the organization is doing. In case they have ETL solutions, you'd probably integrate these new sources with those and make this data available within the boundaries of the organization.\n\nLong story short: it sounds like you are working in a political environment, if I were you I would try to balance the best practices with immediate value being delivered in order to gain further trust and also give your superiors more evidence that you are on top of this.",

Many people don't care, because they don't have to care, because they can just build on the existing layers of abstraction. \n\n\"Developer culture\" is different nowadays because it has broadened to a vastly wider population, not because the existing techniques have vanished. It's not like the knowledge of how to build an OS, or a compiler, or a web browser is some mysterious lost art. People can and do still perform the same kind of \"deep work\" today.\n\nIn fact, older software was quite primitive in a lot of ways. When we look back on things like early Unix, or DOOM, or HyperCard, it's easy to notice all the advancements that were made compared to the state of the art at the time. But there were also lots of limitations and missing features, because either the hardware wasn't powerful enough, or people just hadn't thought of them yet.\n\nAnd it's not like every developer back in the 80s and 90s was some hot-shot genius. There were a lot of mediocre engineers back then too. They just don't get remembered.",

It was common for mainframes to be used to emulate several early microcomputer for software development to test programs that were meant to be cross-compiled before Windows became dominant. And old programs made for older mainframes would sometimes be supported via emulation to allow businesses to upgrade their equipment as technology improved.\n\n\nThis all comes down to one of the most important skills in programming: the ability to take one big problem, and break it down into smaller sub-problems that are easier to answer. When you go deep enough into a computer, you will see that the whole thing is basically the idea of a lightswitch, on or off, just repeated billions and trillions of times.",

I wish I could remember more specifics about it. But the instructor was phenomenal, and I learned more about fundamental computing, memory management, etc. and C just finally clicked. \n\nYou’ll get there. It’s just different and takes some getting used to.\n\nEDIT: I don't recall exactly which course it was, but it was from University of New South Wales, and it was taught by Richard Buckland, who is an absolutely legend. It might've been the CS1 and CS2 courses, and it might've been the 1917 Advanced Computing course. Worth trying to find them.",

Sometimes the available precision is variable.\n\nTimezone information has variable context and relevance. Some calendar entries should move when the country you're in changed to summer time; others shouldn't; still others should move when a _different_ country changes to summer time. \n\nFor any representation, sometimes we want to handle an abstracted representation (eg as an integer), but at others we need to make sure we get a specific element of the localised representation right in a customised way.\n\nBasically, date and time are incredibly complicated.\n\nBonus: timezone weirdness means that (in a certain technical sense) a day can be 26 hours long.",

It's a good video.\n\nBut really it's because the thing you call \"time\" isn't just one thing. The measurement unit and restriction physicists and astronomers need and grapple with isn't really identical to the social construct involved in your alarm clock. The laws of physics, the laws of a country and the laws of an economic zone aren't even laws in the same sense.\n\nE.g. one difference between unix time and UTC is [leap seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second). There are a few different strategies to dealing with this on computers, like making the seconds slightly longer throughout the day, or adding a 61st second to a relevant minute, which may be enumerated as either `59, 60, 00` or `59, 59, 00`. All of the options fuck with software that has no clue what a leap second is.\n\nAnother example: [Sidereal years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_year) aren't the same thing as the thing you're used to thinking of as a year (here's a nice [veritasium video on that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUHkTs-Ipfg)).\n\nAnd those are just physics problems. In addition you've got all the social problems involved in timezones as the other commenters have gone into.\n\n\"Time\" is a simple word hiding a lot of horribly complex ideas. So the implementations wind up complex too.\n\nAnd then usually they get something wrong, or become unwieldy in attempts to become more correct, and are replaced with something that is promised to be more pleasant to use.",

It gets into an \"operations\" problem.\n\nThe short answer: just make a file on a Local Area Network (LAN), (usually just on your home network somewhere), and then access it by that local network's IP address.\n\nLong answer: By _default_, nothing has a domain name on the internet.  You have to apply to get one of those if you want it to be public, and it's a whole process.\n\nBy _default_, everything on the internet has an IP address.  This address allows the computer to figure out what other computer to talk to.\n\nMost (home network) LANs have an NAT (network address translator), which takes all the requests sent to it that are destined for the WWW, and translates them so the data gets sent back to said NAT, and translates it back to the LAN address.  This NAT is usually in a Router (a connection between two different networks.)\n\nWithout this router, you cannot connect to the LAN from the internet, so it is not public.\n\nWith this router, the stuff on your network is only public if you change the router settings to allow incoming connections (usually with Port Forwarding/Triggering)\n\nThus, routers have two different IP addresses.  One for \"the internet\" to communicate with it, and one for the LAN, to communicate with the LAN.\n\nAny computer connected to the LAN can talk to any other device on the LAN with its IP address.  This LAN address usually starts with 10., or 192.168., depending on how the router is set up.\n\nSo if you save the website on a local computer, then use the computers LAN IP as the URL on any other computer in that LAN, you get what you want.",

Nobody's going to accidentally discover that, but copying IPv6 addresses around is kind of a pain and the people you're sharing it with may not even have IPv6 access.\n\nThe easiest thing to do is just to not worry about any of that.  Get a domain name, run a server to serve your web page, and put a password on it.  Practically every web server will allow you to require a username & password to access a page, so you can just set that and then also give those out to anybody you want to access it.",

So I think the authors’ goal is not to teach strictly Python, but to teach general programming concepts.\n\nAt a conceptual level, most programming languages are all the same. They might differ on little stuff like brackets and indentation, or on big stuff like type safety and compilation, but at a high level they all expose the exact same tools to the programmer, like loops, conditionals, functions and collections.\n\nSo by playing a game where you solve problems with code, you’re still effectively learning to program. Once you understand these concepts - once your brain “thinks in code” - it’s easy to transfer those skills to another language and another syntax, whether it’s Python, Java, Go, JavaScript, C++, whatever. The syntax can be googled, but the concepts stay the same.",

In other words, I am very product-oriented.\n\nThink of a product that you actually want to exist in the real world. It's okay if the thing you want to build happens to be in existence already, just don't make \"clones\" of things that already exist. Like don't go make a Twitter clone because you'll get bored before you can solve the fun problems and there are about a thousand videos showing you every step of solving said problems. Not fun, not unique, not impressive, not engaging in my opinion.\n\nThat being said, there's nothing wrong with going forward with your own social media idea and forging your own path. I would even encourage you to do so if that's what you are interested in. And you can take inspiration from how existing products handle certain problems. That's a common practice. Copy the high-performers. Aggregate existing solutions from difference sources to create a new output.\n\nThe real gains are when you see a gap in the real world that technology can fill and then you capitalize on it. No good app to do some random thing that would be really cool if it existed? Build that app. Deploy it. Tell people about it. Maybe they will use it. Improve said app based on feedback. Maybe they will tell their friends. Next thing you know you have learned a world of information and built skills you didn't know existed.\n\nThat's how I stayed engaged. Not the path for everyone.",

Why are there 3 layers of indirection? Wat is this ;-; ?? \".   \n  \nThe gap isn't about raw coding skill - its about how \"professional\" code is shaped - it doesnt simply \\*work\\*, but is architected to survive years of changes, changing requirements, multiple contributors and weird edge cases. What seperates a Jr. SWE from Sr. SWE is more about instinct, rather than pure DSA knowledge. \n\n1. Read the classics.  \nReading literature is a great way to learn theory of things and new patterns.   \nStuff like *Design Patterns*, *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*, *Anti-Patterns*, *A Philosophy of Software Design*, *Clean Code -* not saying you gotta drop everything and read them \\*right now\\*, but imo those are some of the books that kinda live on the must-read list for devs at some point.\n\n2. Rewrite your own old code.  \nGrab a project you wrote quite a time ago and try to read it like you weren't the one who made it. Start asking yourself questions. Bonus: refactoring is way easier and faster now, because your \"thinking level\" has leveled up since then. You would be seeing it more as a system and not just a bunch of code glued together.\n\n3. Try contributing to large OSS projects.  \nTips:  \n\\- Dont just read the code - look at the directory structure, the test layout, how errors propagate.   \n\\- Look into how they are documenting it, how they introduce breaking changes, logging and observability.  \n\\- Notice how they isolate I/O, how they handle state across the application, how they make things testable.  \n  \nThe feedback you are going to receive in your PRs is going to be invaluable (even if sometimes served cold). Soft skills become more and more important the further you go in your career. You may write the cleanest code in the world, but if you can't explain your thinking, review someone else's PR and give them feedback or advocate for better design - it is going to hold you back. Communication is \\*key\\*.\n\n**TL;DR:**   \nReal-world code is about making it last. The instinct you will develop from experience, mistakes and seeing how big systems fail and evolve is going to shape how you design, develop and debug . Read literature to get the theory, revisit (and refactor) your own old code and see your growth, study bit open-source projects. Also, communication matters more than people admit.",

Evaluate your toolchain periodically, using a good IDE, updated compiler versions, linters, static analysis, continuous integration, etc. and treat compiler warnings as hard errors.\n\n\n2. Production code has what will probably look to you like an insane amount of error-handling code and error/debug logging. It's there for a reason. Amateurs like my former self are satisfied letting an app crash with a cryptic message.\n\n\n3. Similarly, an apparently huge quantity of unit test code. Former me was focused on \"getting the code to work\", but if it only works for the happy-path cases, that's not nearly good enough.\n\n\n4. Once it's working and tested, resist the urge to go changing things willy-nilly. When you change something, anything at all, you run the risk of introducing errors. Don't change things unless you have a good reason.\n\n\n5. If you observe something about your code that you don't understand, any kind of unexplained behavior... don't stop working until you DO understand it. It's very often an error lurking. Don't ignore it.\n\n\nThere's lots more. Again, you learn best by working with professionals and shipping software to real users.",

There was no Google and I had a \"secret codebook\" with some simple programming details, and I taught myself from there until I took a class in high school on C++. It's *way* easier to learn now. So yes, I would argue you can definitely do it!\n\nThe key thing is to start small. Take things one step at a time. Don't add a game engine before you know what a variable or condition is. You don't need to finish the whole [Harvard CS50 course](https://www.youtube.com/cs50) before you open a game engine, but at least a few intro videos can be a big help.\n\nFor game engines, both Unity and Godot are popular for beginners. Godot is easier to start with (simpler, no setup), Unity has more jobs/resources. Both are great choices.\n\nEither way, I'd take one of many online programming courses in Python or C\\# before jumping into an engine, or perhaps dig into the CS50 course for more structured learning. A game engine adds a bunch of concepts on top of programming that are specific to the engine. If you want to jump in with both feet, that's fine, but you may struggle with information overload. If that happens, I recommend taking a break from the game engine and going back to programming basics, then trying the engine again when you feel more comfortable.\n\nGood luck!",

Those of us who are ESL will very likely speak with an accent but can still be very capable at English, and without mixing languages all the time (if anything the contamination seems to go more the other way when younger people with a smaller vocabulary are overexposed to anglophone memes).\n\nSignificant semantic differences like that of string mutability should become reflexive over time, though you may also find that your expectations gravitate towards the strictest among the languages you usually use, as you don't get errors for being more conservative than you strictly need to be.\n\nThere are some things that are more trivial differences that I think you'll just have to live with though, like whether it's `s.trim()` or `s.strip()`, or `len(xs)` vs `xs.len()`. For those you basically just have to have a language server or some other step to catch your goofs. You'll be able to fix it immediately as soon as you get the feedback because you ultimately know the semantics you want and you do know both variants, but made a mistake on the level of a spelling mistake. (And of course it's possible to stumble into spelling mistakes that result in valid grammar with different semantics, just like in human languages.)\n\nSo I expect that I'll get the case right for `bool`/`Bool` because I can remember that convention for a given language, but I _will_ mix up whether or not it ends with `-ean` because that's not really something I can reason my way into.",

        "body": "A system call is basically just a fancy kind of function call. The special thing about a system call is that it allows *user* code (running with low privileges) to call *kernel* code (running with high privileges) in a controlled way.\n\nThe kernel can \"receive\" syscalls from user code, but within the kernel itself, plain old function calls are used. If you read the source code for Linux, which is written in C, you'll mostly just see a lot of functions calling other functions.\n\nIn terms of what those function calls within the kernel actually *do*: sometimes they just manipulate data, like any other function you might write yourself. For instance, the \"list of running processes\" is a kernel data structure, so when you start a new process running with the `fork` and `exec` syscalls, you're just calling kernel code that adds a new entry to that list.\n\nSimilarly, when you use a syscall like `write` to \"print\" text from your program, normally what you're really doing is writing characters to a queue (a.k.a. a pipe or FIFO). Some other part of the system (e.g. a terminal emulator) is going to read those characters and figure out how to display them on the screen. The queue itself belongs to the kernel, so programs use syscalls to ask the kernel to read and write it.\n\nOn the other hand, some of the kernel code has to manipulate hardware. It usually does this by accessing special memory addresses ([memory-mapped I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O_and_port-mapped_I/O)) which read or write the corresponding registers in a hardware device. The kernel's higher privilege level allows it to do this directly. User code is normally forbidden from doing this by the CPU's memory protection hardware.",

        "body": "This is an entire field called GIS. The short of it is that you have two basic types of GeoSpatial data, vector and raster. Vector data is basically a table of attributes, but one of the fields has a geometry. Think Latitude and Longitude for points, and then just an array of those for Lines / Polygons. Raster Data is an image that you drape over your canvas, but it has embeded or an extra file with information saying where and how to place the image, like a tiff world ‘.tfw’ file.\n\nAny geospatial data will have a spatial reference for the coordinates, like WGS84 for your typical lat longs in decimal degrees or degree, minutes, seconds. Not knowing your spatial reference is a good way to get your data to show up off the eastern coast of Africa on null island.\n\nAnyway, for vector data, like roads, the road name will be stored in a field in the table and can be displayed as a label. Rasters obviously can’t really store data as a field, but they can be used to store data like imagery (rgb values from satellites), elevation, land use classifications, whatever where you need a value for every spot on the map.\n\nNow you have all this data, collected at the municipal, State/Provincial, and Federal levels, but how you need to put it on a map. You could make static maps (pdfs or images) using desktop software like QGIS or ArcGIS, or you could make the data available through a Map Server or WMS/WFS service and then have a web map the requests the data from those servers. The web server is usually something like QGIS Server or ArcGIS server, and then you consume it using a map library like leaflet, open layers, or ArcGIS JavaScript API. \n\nOf course, over the internet, this can be slow depending on the size of the data, so then you start getting into tiling your data. So for rasters, you’ve pre-tiled your data (vector and raster can do this) at different zoom levels, so as a user pans around a map, they’re only calling the specific tiles they need to display on the map instead of asking for the server to constantly clip and send the data they need for their extent. \n\nAnyways, that’s my quick intro, and each of those areas could be greatly expanded upon.",

The cartographers' term for these imagery maps is \"orthophotomap\".  They aren't satellite maps, but they play them on TV. \n\nWeb servers spit out those images as \"tiles\". The web map viewers have all sorts of fancy Javascript to retrieve, scale, and rotate those tiles so they look seamless.

This ensures that either all or none of the table updates get processed.\n\nThis is part of the [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) properties that you want to have from a database management system. With a distributed system, achieving ACID is very difficult.",

Take 2 equations: f(x) = 100x + 10, g(x) = x (the simplest function we can represent with the same degree as f(x)).\n\nThe largest exponent for both of these equations is 1, so we can apply the above rule. Let's choose a constant of 105 for c.\n\nFor some values of x, f(x) > c * g(x). Take x == 1 for example. F would be 110 and g would be 1. 110 > 105 (1 * C). However, at larger values of x, this doesn't stay true. At x == 10 we get f is 1,010 and g is 10. So, for these values, f(x) < g(x) * c, since 10 * 105 is 1,050 and 1,050 > 1,010.\n\nBasically, this just sums down to the idea that a functions growth is capped to its largest exponent, which is why Big O notation always ignores constants (except for O(1)). So, even something like f(x) = 1,000,000,000x, the Big O notation would be O(x), because there exists a constant C and a value of x X0 that f(x) < c * g(x).",

In this case, it's nice to be able to pull in just the external data definitions, and not the rest of the class.\n\n\nIt's been a while, so I can't remember off the top of my head how this shows up when you hit a circular include, but keep it in mind as you start to add more features.",

They're not mutually exclusive.\n\nThere are products that are open-source, but they charge money for it. The motivations can range here - maybe the source is open to promote trust, maybe it's open so that hobbyists can access it for free while business users can pay for support.\n\nThere are also products that are closed-source, but free to consumers. I'm sure you can think of plenty of examples of this.\n\nSo in your case, I think the answer depends on the target market.\n\nIf your goal is to reach as many non-tech-savvy end users as possible, then no this is not a common approach. The vast majority of users will not go through the hassle of getting an API key. What most companies do is figure out a way to monetize the app sufficiently to pay for the usage. Maybe that means all users pay a fee, maybe it means ads.\n\nA really, really common solution is for the product to be free to most customers, but the \"top\" users pay more and that subsidizes the costs for everyone else.\n\nAs an example the game Geoguessr depends heavily on the Google Maps API, which costs money. They let free users play 3 games a day, and then charge $2.50 - $5.00 per month if you want to play more. They \"lose\" money on the free users but gain community.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're building this primarily for yourself and you just want to share, this is pretty common - enabling others to benefit from your work if they want to go through the trouble of getting it set up, at no cost to you. So if you just want to share and not create a business, then this is fine.",

That's a cool thing to do, but it's not entirely practical in most cases.\n\nMost open source software's purpose isn't to let every user build their own copy (though that's possible to do), but to let other users go over your code and help fix errors and vulnerabilities, as well as keep the project going, because if you don't maintain the project someone will copy it and create a fork.\n\nQuick edit: I mention this because it might be possible for you to split the cost among your users. 1 business key is most likely much cheaper than 1000 single user keys - single user keys might be free for that API for now, but if it becomes popular that might not stay that way.",

That translation from logic to code is where learning really happens.\n\nPractice on sites that start simple like **W3Schools**, **freeCodeCamp**, or **LeetCode easy problems**. Watch a short video, then code along line by line. Do not copy blindly. Change a few numbers, add print statements, see what breaks. That builds intuition.\n\nIf you want more guided support, **Ashtrix Robotics** offers **online coding programs for students and beginners**. Learners love the project-based format, parents trust the accountable and resourceful teaching team, and lessons are tailored to each student’s level and goals. They have students from over 23 countries, their learners have won national and international competitions, and their mentor earned a Teacher Excellency Award from MIT App Inventor in Boston.

These people will also not only just know the languages/tech that you mentioned, but they would also know computer science fundamentals like data structures, algorithms, OOP, etc. Obviously, most new grads are not experts in these things, but I’m just giving an idea of what you’d probably be up against. Related to that, you would have to learn leetcode, which is most of the time, not extremely relevant to the job/position, but usually required to pass an interview.\n\nYes you can learn all of those things yourself, but to add onto the issue of no degree, a lot of ATS résumé scanners used to look for candidates will immediately filter out people without degrees.\n\nSo, most people will suggest that you get a degree if you are serious about getting a developer or adjacent position. Not only would you learn important computer science concepts, but it is a good chance for networking and will help you to land a job.\n\nObviously, this is not guaranteed advice, as now, even  new grads with internship experience are struggling to find jobs. Yes, you can get a job while self learning, but it is extremely difficult. So if you are serious about this, I would at least consider the idea of going to school, or try self learning first and see if this is something you want to pursue even.",

You can do this over and over until they're small enough. That'll give you a kind of plan.\n\nFocusing on this skill first will let you realise you can split things into pieces and then do them in whichever order you like.\n\nThis is a skill that's totally useful for all programming tasks.\n\nThe second thing to learn is \"make skeletons\" or scaffolds — that's to say make it real as soon as possible. The way I do this is I get the minimum viable thing that can do **anything** in place first. When we first learn programming we learn how to do hello world because it's this; the minimum working program.\n\nFor your example, get a single hello web page up, served, online. Get that done. Ok. Now make it two pages that interlink, now make it slighly pretty, now add some graphics, now another page, etc etc. All the while your **big** aim is to build your finished website you have a plan of, but at each step of the way you're making it real, you're getting a serotonin hit from finishing tasks and you're feeling good because you're building things in reality, without doing too much at once, and this lets you get feedback early, too (from both yourself and other people). As you proceed, you may feel the pull to go down rabbit holes and add features, but you should really just add the features to your future list, and possibly change yours plans if it makes sense, and pick the next thing to do based on priorities of getting your project done according to your aims.\n\nAt any time you're free to tear it all down and start again, but this prototyping style of development is extremely useful in **any** kind of development (not just software), and will serve you well for the entire time you develop software of any kind. Get good at these two things, and then when a really big project comes along, you'll be equipped to tackle it by doing a bunch of little prototype experiments on the things you don't know how to do to prove to yourself you can do them, then break the project into pieces and build it bit by bit getting feedback along the way. (\"Agile\" development is really nothing more than keeping the list of next things to do prioritised on your end goal, and allowing for the fact that time is limited and you **may** actually never finish all the features because you run out of time).\n\nThere are other recommendations, but these are the two most important, in my opinion.",

I like the struggle (masochist >,>)\" This is the best attitude you can have. As long as you're enjoying the process of learning, it's just a matter of putting in the hours, hands on keyboard. So, don't stress too much about things, keep having fun.\n\nSecond piece of advice: It's really useful to have a concrete goal in mind. It sounds like you have this right now, but are getting pulled in a few directions by wanting to learn everything, that's okay. I have this issue when I'm working or learning, I'll get these great ideas for new features, projects, things to learn, etc. It's really easy to get sidetracked by them, since a lot of them are genuinely good ideas. My approach is when I'm working on a project, I keep 3 separate todo lists:\n\n1. What are the next steps for my project *right now*. These are things I *need* to get to in the next 1-3 days working on this project. If I am working on a feature and think \"Oooh, I can't forget to update this other thing or it will all break\" I write that down in this list. \n\n2. A list of future features for this project that might be fun to work on later. This could be something like \"Ahh, I want to redesign this component, maybe next week\".\n\n3. A list of other projects I want to work on, or things I want to learn. If I see a cool programming book. Or I have an idea for a cool new website to build. I'll write it down in this list.\n\nBy keeping these three lists, it really helps me avoid going down too deep into rabbit holes. I have a great idea, but instead of getting sidetracked for hours, days, weeks following it, I take a minute or two to get it into the appropriate list. \n\nAlso, lists #1 and #2 make it much easier to jump back into whatever I was last working on the next time I sit down to work on the project. For that reason, I try to keep a list #1 and #2 for each project I have, and I store them in the project itself, so they're always nearby.\n\nHope that's useful!",

Find a beginner friendly book or course about basic consepts of programming and go through it. Know what? If you are aiming to master C++, your initial learning doesn’t even need to be in C++. Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, didn’t start out with C++, of course. He also says in interviews that every programmer would benefit from learning a handful of languages. Find some pods with Bjarne Stroustrup!\n\nMister C++ himself perhaps wouldn’t agree with this, but much of the best books on programming basics use Lisps as a vehicle. This way, they can focus on the programming itself, rather than forcing complex syntax on the reader.\n\nOne good example is “The Little Schemer” by Friedman & Felleisen. If you choose that one, I’ll spoil one thing: The “rules” and ”commandments” presented in the book are just rules within the book, meant to be applied when solving the exercises; they are generally not rules of the Scheme lang. This could be a bit confusing, if you haven’t understood it. Another thing: if you don’t solve a problem now, you maybe solve it next time. This is a simple, little book, that kind of escalates sneakily. You can read it over and over again till you get everything.",

Those resources aren't guaranteed to be available to you, and you aren't guaranteed to find the right learning strategy if you go looking, but there is a very good chance that you are capable of this.\n\nRandom notes in no particular order from what you've said:\n\n* You're \"supposed\" to learn TypeScript, Rust, JavaScript, Python, React? Why? It is far more valuable to be a good dev in one tech stack than a novice in 10. I strongly suggest picking one set of technologies that you feel suits your purposes and sticking with that. Jumping languages and frameworks every 5 seconds is exhausting and doesn't really teach you anything useful in my experience. It's also much easier for a good Python dev to become a good C# dev than it is for a polyglot novice to become good at any language, IMO.\n* Find a practice/learning style which suits you so that the endless learning doesn't become too much of a chore. For me, implementation is everything. I don't often \"get\" things unless I practice them myself, so if for example I'm learning some new data structure I'll usually hand-code an implementation of it rather than importing someone else's and prove to myself first that it works as I expect, and second that I've gathered enough information to create it. I also use this with programming for other things - my mind is a sieve when it comes to calculus, for example, but writing programs that *do* calculus really helps me crystalise the knowledge.\n* Respect the ADHD. A lot of people aren't going to get it and will give you advice that amounts to \"just keep trying\". Ignore them. I strongly believe that banging your head against a wall or burning yourself out trying to force your mind to act neurotypical is a net negative for learning. If you find yourself struggling for more than, say, 15 minutes on a problem you're quite possibly reinforcing the struggle rather than the progress. Learn when to be gentle with yourself, when to give up and look up the answers. There is such thing as trying too hard.\n* Drink water, sleep, exercise, socialise, rest and relax! Too many junior devs treat their health like shit and then are surprised when they feel like shit. Your concentration and working memory are already compromised by a neurological condition - don't make it worse.\n\nI think I've rambled long enough - please feel free to ask any questions you might have.",

One way to do that was to run java on linux and run more open source, yes even in the enterprise.\n\nthe enterprise folks who ran stuff previously on Sun systems and the ones who used to run MS Windows Server systems both were able to run application servers (there used to be soooo many of these app server products) running java on linux. \n\nI think this was at least one big factor.

I got my first internship in game development right after my final year. At that time, my skillset in game dev wasn’t very strong , even though I had been learning it on my own for almost a year and had even taken a course at university.\n\n\n\nAnyway, once I was surrounded by senior developers during my internship (which later turned into a job), my skills started improving rapidly. I’m a passionate person, and having great seniors around me helped a lot. I took their mentorship seriously, never hesitated to ask questions, and treated projects personally. I often worked after hours on related stuff to improve myself.\n\n\n\nAfter just a few months, I cleared interview for another good job, not only better in terms of pay, but also because of the senior developers I got to work with. Being around skilled people and working on the same projects as they do gives you a huge jump. I even managed to handle the responsibilities of a senior with 5 years of experience who had resigned.\n\n\n\nSo in your case, I can see that you’re passionate but you just need the right environment. I realized that about myself too: I’m passionate, and I need a place that helps me grow. Even though I received another higher-paying offer, I didn’t leave, because I want to focus on building my skillset in these early years.\n\n\n\nWhen you work with brilliant people, you grow much faster , no tutorial or course can give you that. Starting from scratch alone can easily frustrate you because you don’t get that sense of achievement. Seniors usually have strong foundations, so when you learn from them, you learn the right way.",

Sure you could read books and do your own projects but will you?  Most people will not go nearly as in depth because we tend to be lazy and disorganized.  Our bootcamp enforced attendance and had weekly challenges which were difficult enough to require several hours of time outside the class activities.\n\nSecond our challenges and course material was carefully selected to reflect current industry demands.  If you are watching YouTube videos you will likely get sucked into a small niche of data analytics rather than learning the general concepts.  This paired with instructional staff who gave feedback, showed issues and helped refine your knowledge, lead to a good base.\n\nBut aside from this the students who did well and actually got positions, which were more than I expected, were ones who continued polishing and building a portfolio.  We got them running but the finish line often requires continued education.  But you do build momentum and result in several potential portfolio projects so it is better.\n\nTLDR:  Bootcamps provide structure and accountability that self learning rarely provides unless you are very organized and driven - but students often still needed to continue working on and polishing their portfolio to get their foot in the door.",

You feel like part of the community and you get to see real people teaching real stuff every week - so much better than regular pre-recorded YT or Udemy course. I had no troubles to stay engaged and complete the course and it was a great beginning for me to learn more.",

And the time taken to traverse the filesystem and open the file is even tinier. (Profiling will tell you just how tiny.)\n\nAnd as a counterpoint, whenever you go from having a single source of truth (e.g. the filesystem) to multiple separate data stores (the filesystem + a separate database), you increase the number of opportunities for complexity and bugs to creep into your system.\n\nFor *interactive* use, it might well be desirable to maintain a DB with metadata and indexes, so that you can quickly search for individual files. But for a big batch reprocessing job which is going to be slow anyway, I think it makes sense to just treat what's in the filesystem as authoritative, instead of relying on a DB that might potentially become out of sync if there's a bug. The difference in performance is likely to be small.\n\nIf the performance does actually matter (e.g. because you want to re-run your reprocessing job frequently) then what I would probably do is just maintain an index of paths/timestamps/checksums which are known to be \"good\" (don't need re-encoding). This allows you to avoid repeatedly scanning files that haven't changed. But the index itself contains no important data. If it gets lost, or stale, or corrupted, it's extremely unlikely to cause any kind of inconsistency or bad behavior; the worst that will happen is redoing unnecessary work.",

Kevlin Henney is another great lecturer to check out when it comes to code semantics and programming linguistics which can also lend a hand in your learning style.\n\nI would recommend beginning with compilers that you invoke via the CLI (g++ or clang, so maybe start on Linux or a Mac) instead of an IDE that compiles everything for you (such as Visual Studio or Code::Blocks.) This way you can learn how build systems work under the hood and get into makefiles and also expose yourself to valgrind (this is essential if you want to learn and do your due diligence in the craft.)\n\nAlso, it would be helpful to learn some C if you haven't already. I recommend c99 for simplicity unless you want to see what threading is all about, then go with c11 or newer. Furthermore, have a very in-depth understanding of how compiled languages differ from interpreted languages (static vs. dynamic languages, respectively)\n\nI could go at length, and for some context, I typically point to prerequisites before the actual topic one wants to study. The foundations are too important to ignore, imo",

Than this other game they didn't develop where they didn't have that loading screen constraint? How can you compare the two? How can anyone not in bad faith be affirmative that the current game is better than this other game they didn't develop without constraints?   \nI know you didn't come up with these examples, that they come from people looking for stuff to analyze and make content out of. But they are just bad generalizations.  \n\nIn any projects, you have constraints, and your goal is do the best thing possible despoite those constraints. And sometimes, being creative with those constraints helps a lot in doing that. but people don't intentionally self-inflict contraints when they want to do a product.  \n\nIt can however be a nice way to spark creativity or to develop one's skill by forcing oneself to do something differnetly than how they were doing it. I'm thinking of game jams (to stay in the realm of video games examples), where the goal is specifically to add two massive constraints (time and a custom directive) in order to force developers to be creative. The goal of these games is not to be products, even though some of them end up being great base ideas that later get expanded into full games.",

For those not familiar with shell scripting, this course provides an overview of common Linux Shell Commands and shell scripting basics.\n\nIt sounds like it will cover the basics, but it will also go deep into using Bash as a full-fledged programming language, which is probably overkill for what you need. And, after you finish it, you will probably still be left confused about some of the Python- or application-specific commands for running different repositories, which are probably not built-in Linux commands.\n\nIf you'd like to focus on the problem that you mentioned, I'd recommend simply Googling the specific commands that you're confused with, and spending a few minutes learning about each of them. I imagine that terminal commands will never become your main focus in programming, and so this way, you'll simply learn about the ones that you need.\n\nHowever, if diving deep into terminal commands and Bash scripting is still something that you're interested in, the course definitely does seem helpful, so definitely do go ahead and take it if you're interested.",

You can type in them, use the mouse to select text in them, but it’s basically a text thing.\n\nInside the terminal, you are usually discussing with a shell. That is a program that takes your input and acts on it. The form you give to that input, the language, is characteristic of the shell.\n\nOn Windows, the shell today is PowerShell. You get a terminal with that by clicking on the >_ icon somewhere. You can write scripts to be executed with PowerShell, so that you can use its power without having to type everything repeatedly.\n\nOn Linux, there are a number of different shells, but most resemble the original “sh”, and “bash” is indeed one of the best known. As with PowerShell, you can write scripts, and learning to do so is quite worth the effort if you are going to study CS.\n\nYou can certainly also use bash on Windows, but I think you have to install it.\n\nI hope this helped to clear up the basics.",

I've been trying to figure out how to get people into using the shell since it can go faster than booting up a graphical environment on an emulated PC. I think it'll just be a matter of preference though, people will use the easy GUI until there's something that can't be done and requires a terminal command.\nMaybe trying to ease people in with a TUI might be a good in the middle approach. \nSo your question back at you, how do I teach people to use the shell XD let me know if you find a good way that works for you.\n\n\nCross scripting for bash is a thing thanks to aliasing, so you can create a definition at the top of the script like delete=rm and then check if you're a Linux or Windows machine and set it correctly, to be rm or del respectivly\n\n\nI'm still working on writing a good script myself, but looking at you suck at programming it seems like I've got a lot to learn about bash scripting.",

As you can imagine, this book is pretty dry, so forgive me for not being very thorough in my research.\n\nThe author says AT&T, a stakeholder, imposed the meanings of 0b000 0000 (null) and 0b111 1111 (delete) ex ante.\n\nThe design committee also desired that 0 through 9 should be contained in a \"four bit subset\", and that   \n\"the numerics should have bit patterns such that the four low-order bits shall be the binary coded decimal representation of numerics\".  \n\nThis means that zero through nine were required to be placed in the code contiguously with the zero at a code point multiple of 16.  That is one of code point 0, 16, 32, 48, and so on; they chose to situate zero at 0x30 (48) partly to make sure that special characters appeared before numbers and alphabetical characters in sorted order.\n\nHope this helps.",

You'll find the first 32 values are all internal flags of some sort.  Some of those values helped with porting from prior system's encoding.\n\nThe ASCII table is actually pretty clever.  The 'A' at 41 and 'a' at 61 allow for upper and lower case conversion and testing to be simple bit operations.  There's a few more hidden gems in there.\n\nIt all comes down to bits.

Computers are not capable of storing anything but integer values, which is why we devise so many various encoding schemes for things that aren't integers.\n\nAnd the answer it is more useful not to when treating them as string/character values, and not really all that useful when parsing a string into a numeric type. First, the idea only properly works for integers. Second, it only really works in a useful way for single digits. You need a minimum of 4 bits to count to 9 (`b1001`) and then quite a bit more for letters and punctuation. Even if we eliminate all of the control characters and limit ourselves to printable characters included in ASCII encoding, you still need at least 7 bits to cover those 95 characters with values from 0 (`b0000000`) to 94 (`b1011110`). We haven't even saved a single bit eliminating those (generally) unnecessary codes, but there aren't a lot of machines using 7-bit addressing these days, so let's assume the smallest numeric type you could use for encoding is probably 8 bits anyway. So to store the value 255 you would need 3 bytes. What's the super easy conversion to go from `b00000010-b00000101-b00000101` to `b11111111`? There isn't one really. You could argue that the conversion is still slightly simpler, but it isn't really significantly so, and it's hardly worth losing the benefits such as simpler and more performant sorting for characters.",

Things that work good for your portfolio website is you want to focus on well designed landing page, you want it easily navigable to different parts of your website, you want things to be snappy, and for projects links to source code and maybe explanations of things will be a good idea.  \n\nYou can think of the website itself as a project, and its typically something you host on your own, either self hosted or on some web hosting platform.",

        "body": "Programming is an extension of technology, or you can also think of it as a microcosm of technology. The main purpose of technology is to **improve the way we do something**, either with a tool or otherwise. Instead of calculating numbers by hand, we use a calculator to automate the process. Instead of converting a lot of numbers using a calculator, we use a spreadsheet program to do it in bulk. A lot of the constructs of programming serve the same purpose.\n\nAt its very basic, most programs can be written with if-conditions and variables alone. However, we don't do that, and we use lists, loops, functions and classes instead, **not** because we have to (exceptions apply), but because we want to. Most of them serve the same purpose: **to shorten and simplify code at the cost of more complex and intricate logic**.\n\nFor example, instead of writing:\n\n    cout << \"Hello World\" << endl;\n    cout << \"Hello World\" << endl;\n    cout << \"Hello World\" << endl;\n    cout << \"Hello World\" << endl;\n    cout << \"Hello World\" << endl;\n\nYou can instead write:\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n        cout << \"Hello World\" << endl;\n    }\n\nClasses serve a similar purpose: instead of having loose, disconnected variables and functions all over the place, you \"group\" them into objects. This gives you many benefits, making it much simpler to code certain algorithms, keeping your code organized so that you don't confuse yourself and others as your code base expands, and in some languages, it provides a layer of \"code safety\" as well.\n\nBut to emphasize, you do **not** have to necessarily write code this way, in most cases. A lot of different syntax \"oddities\" exist to be **shortcuts**, such as how `i++` is mostly just `i = i + 1`. The same is true of a while-loop versus a for-loop, the former of which is more fundamental. \n\nThis is why it seems there are so many solutions to the same problem, but they all do the same thing in varying levels of efficiency, in terms of logic and/or syntax.",

In practice, all platforms I've seen would support `-2**31` as well. \n\nI.e. the values -2147483648 up to and including 2147483647 should fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

In practice, though, all platforms you're likely to use are using 2's complement. \n\nHowever, 1L << 31 results in 2147483648, a value that does not fit in a 32-bit signed integer, so you are invoking integer overflow (which is formally undefined behaviour, but since you're doing at \"at compile time\" maybe it's really implementation defined). \n\nIn any case, we surely can't expect that the result will be the same in this case between platforms (32-bit long vs. 64-bit long).\n\nIf you want the same behaviour, you should suffix ul on your integer constant (some people prefer writing uL or UL for readability). That way, you'll be working with 32-bit unsigned long vs. 64-bit unsigned long. The sizes are different but since you're still within the 32-bit unsigned range in your example, you'll get the same behaviour in this case. Since 1ul << 31 is unsigned long, you should also update the printf format from %ld to %lu to ensure the correct integer interpretation when printing it out.",

Literals are implicitly cast to the assigned type because this pedantic redundancy is a wholly unnecessary distraction that has no benefit in any sense of the word.\n\nSo I've played with it, and wrote the variations:\n\n    int x = 5;\n    int x = 5L;\n    int x = 5LL;\n    int x = 5ULL;\n\nAnd I compiled them under GCC for ARM and x86_64.

The type is determined by the type declaration of the variable being assigned, and the literal is implicitly converted at compile-time.\n\nNow as for your code:\n\n    printf(\"%zu %ld\", sizeof(1L), 1L << 31);\n\nYeah, the type is deduced from the literal itself, so of course you're going to get a non-portable result.\n\n---\n\nI think it's important to understand how to use primitive types.\n\nC defines a whole family of type aliases. They are guaranteed to alias the built-in types. First are the fixed width types:\n\n    int8_t\n\nEtc. The fixed width types ARE NOT guaranteed to be defined in the first place - they are only defined on platforms that actually have native hardware support for those exact widths. If there is no 16 bit type support on that hardware, there is no `int16_t`. This comes up on DSPs and ASICs the most, though you'll also see it on FPGAs, in some old or really tiny embedded architectures, like old 4-bit machines, or some exotic or esoteric hardware few have ever heard of.\n\nThe fixed width types are for implementing protocols. These could be file formats, hardware interfaces, or network/transport protocols. You will use these for defining types that are going to be serialized or mapped to hardware. You'll use these in data buffers.\n\nThen there are the `least` types:\n\n    uint_least32_t\n\nEtc. These types are the smallest widths available with at least as many bits, and these types are ALWAYS defined. For platforms that support fixed width types, they're 1:1. They may contain more bits, but you cannot portably rely on that, nor should you, because that defeats the point.\n\nUse these types in your in-memory data structures to maximize system and cache memory density and bus transfer efficiency.\n\nContinued...",

These are the most computationally efficient use of hardware registers on your platform with at least as many bits. Very often these will be larger than the bit size specified. Registers tend to be laid out in powers of two word sizes - word, double word, quad word... And so will these. Ideally, what you'll get is these values will be optimized and either never see cache or system memory - your code should be small enough that they exist only in registers - for sufficiently large hardware platforms.\n\nC has a weak type system, because C is a negotiation between the standard, the hardware, and you. This flexibility inherent to the primitive types is also a form of portability in its own right. This is how you can port Unix from one architecture to another, because you write code in terms of `int`, and you get whatever size and extent that hardware can handle, whatever hardware you go to. You get internal consistency. It's when you start working with external data that you need to accommodate data protocols and their data.\n\nMost of the time you don't need fixed width types - and it's actually not desirable for computation. They're either too big for memory, or too small for registers. Besides - if you're not defining a protocol, who cares how many bits you have exactly? All you care about is that you have enough - which is something you need to figure out at design time. What are you doing? How many bits do you need? Once you know, you want the fewest to store in memory, and then you don't care how many are used for actual computation, so long as it's fast and efficient.\n\nSo the `least` and `fast` end up being the types you use the most. They're completely inappropriate and not portable for protocols, and you want to get away from the fixed width types as soon as possible - at the fringes, where IO happens.\n\nSo this code:\n\n    printf(\"%zu %ld\", sizeof(1L), 1L << 31);\n\nIt's completely asinine. You're not outputting the size and extent of a type, but of a value, and the type of the value is up to the compiler's discretion - the implementation just PICKED SOMETHING, because it doesn't matter; in all other code, this would be narrowed or widened implicitly and correctly. This is fine for writing debug, but as you're writing to the `stdout` file descriptor and presuming you were trying to do something REAL, you'd be wanting to write in terms of a protocol, which means the correct thing to do is write this in terms of a fixed width type to make it portable.\n\n---\n\nThe other thing is about the C type system - an `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`. You are not expected to use the primitive types directly - you're expected to make your own types in terms of primitives, and then describe your solution in terms of that. If you didn't care what the type was - then you'd write your implementation as a macro, and practice the Generic Programming paradigm.\n\nYour `int` is always something more specific, a quantity, a range, a unit of something. Make your types and control your semantics. An `int` can perform all arithmetic and bitwise operations, but a `weight` can only add to other `weight`s, and can only multiply against scalars. A `weight` can't be negative. So:\n\n    typedef struct weight weight;\n\n    weight *create(int_least32_t);\n    weight *dup(const weight *);\n    weight *copy(weight *, const weight *);\n    void destroy(weight *);\n    weight *add(weight *, const weight *);\n    weight *multiply(weight *, int);\n    int_least32_t weight_to_int(const weight *);\n    int print(const weight *);\n\nNotice it's an opaque pointer. `print` returns an `int` because `printf` returns an `int`. `multiply` accepts an `int` because its an arbitrary value - unless in your design you know something better. An `int` is going to be the native word size, so efficient. Then you implement:\n\n    struct weight {\n      int_least32_t value;\n    };\n\n    weight *create(const int_least32_t value) {\n      weight *w = NULL;\n\n      if(value >= 0) {\n        weight *w = (weight *)malloc(sizeof(weight));\n        w.value = value;\n      }\n\n      return w;\n    }\n\n    //...\n\n    weight *add(weight *res, const weight *w) {\n      if(res && w) {\n        res.value += w.value;\n\n        return res;\n      }\n\n      return NULL;\n    }\n\n    weight *multiply(weight *res, const int v) {\n      if(res && v >= 0) {\n        res.value *= v;\n\n        return res;\n      }\n\n      return NULL;\n    }",

This may be why the Standard says you are only allowed to left-shift up to 31 bits for a 32-bit unsigned type. If the type of unsigned long is a 32-bit type on a particular platform (e.g. ARM), then indeed shifting it left by 48 is undefined behaviour.\n\nMore on this can be found discussed here: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3784996/why-does-left-shift-operation-invoke-undefined-behaviour-when-the-left-side-oper](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3784996/why-does-left-shift-operation-invoke-undefined-behaviour-when-the-left-side-oper)\n\nAlso, I'm not really sure you can avoid implicit integer promotion in a single expression like 1ul << 48. Even if you write UINT32_C(1) as suggested in the other reply on the thread, the type produced by that expression is actually uint_least32_t (i.e. it could be 32-bit or it could be bigger).\n\nSo in my view, an expression like 1ul << 48 is just not portable. I would hope that my compiler would give me a warning if I were compiling that code on a platform where unsigned long is 32-bit, but it's conceivable that on other platforms (where unsigned long is 64-bit), that it would compile with no warning but still be non-portable, as you seem to have discovered.\n\nIf you're really in a bind and need to do something like the above in a portable way, you could consider computing it at runtime. Though in this case it seems a bit like a waste of time, since it seems like we want the final value 0 in this case:\n\n    uint64_t tmp = 1ul;  \n    tmp <<= 48;  \n    uint32_t value = (uint32_t)tmp;  \n    printf(\"%zu\\n\", sizeof(value));  \n    printf(\"%lu\\n\", value);\n\nThis should give the same result regardless of what size long's are on the platform. And the result should be 0 on all platforms that support uint32_t (for all possible starting values of value), since vacated bits get filled in with 0 -- unless I'm misunderstanding something that could happen differently on some platform (seems unlikely though).",

It's also not portable - ever C standard library implements it differently, so for the same seed, two different implementations will generate different sequences.\n\nC++ has the `<random>` header in the standard library. It's kind of hot garbage. This is an example - C++ has many, of the standard committee taking something good and ruining it. There aren't many RNGs defined within it, you don't know the size of the initialization space for any of them - so you don't know how many bits of entropy is enough for sufficient randomness, and once again, every implementation is different, so the outcomes are not portable.\n\nThe thing to do is use an independent portable library for reproducibility and consistency. Boost.Random is an excellent library, and the origins of what the standard committee fucked up. The problem with the standard library is once something goes in, it basically can never change, because C++ doesn't break backward compatibility. It's why we have `std::thread` and `std::jthread`, because `std::thread` is fundamentally flawed.",

The better you understand code architecture and languages, the better and more efficient your code can become.

When things are broken, this will force you to read and decipher what the a.i wrote, and also constantly to refactor, that is basically the future of coding. One big problem though is best practices, i don't know how good a.i is producing best practices code and you as a human need to take into consideration the people in the future that will need to read and decipher the code, so try to tell the code to follow best practices and comment the code, and try to comment the code yourself for the other coders that are going to read it.\n\nOn the other hand, unless your trying to make an mvp (minimium viable product), then there is no reason to speed up your coding with a.i. And instead you should focus on good software design, as mvp is relegated primarily to startups. Established businesses don't want a.i spaghetti code in their software bases as it makes it more expensive to maintain in the long run. So it's good to know both approaches but unless your big into creating your own software, i would focus on good software design and limit a.i use or at least heavily monitor and adjust it.",

You don't *have* to use BP for keeping track of the current function's stack frame; that's just what C compilers typically do.\n\nThe only stack instruction that changes the contents of the BP register is POP BP.\n\nC typically sets up stack frames based on BP like this.  The assembly code for a C function called `myfunc` probably looks like this, regardless of what `myfunc` actually does:\n\n    myfunc:\n        PUSH BP\n        MOV BP,SP\n        ; ... function goes here ...\n        POP BP\n        RET\n\nBut again, that's just what C compilers [1] do.  Your own assembly programs don't have to do things this way; you could use BP to hold a number used in a calculation instead.\n\nThat being said, there are several reasons to set up a stack frame the same way a C compiler would:\n\n- It's a standard practice that makes your code easier to understand\n- BP can index the stack without a segment prefix override [2]\n- You must index the stack to access arguments from high-level languages\n- You can use stack as a convenient way to quickly allocate memory in your function (this is how high-level languages allocate memory for local variables if you have too many to fit in registers)\n\nI agree with another poster's recommendation to figure out a way to get assembly listings produced by a compiler.  For all the popular modern C compilers, [Godbolt](https://godbolt.org/) is an easy way to do this, but it only seems to support 32-bit or 64-bit x86 targets.  (The most visible difference between 16-bit assembly is 32-bit register names start with E, for example ECX; and 64-bit register names start with R, for example RCX.)\n\n[1] Different programming languages use different calling conventions, especially in the previous millenium.  Meaning the arguments might be laid out in a different order, or there might be some extra information.  For example if you're interfacing with, say, the QBASIC programming language instead of C, you will need a FAR return (to a different segment) that pops the caller's arguments off the stack, [like this](http://www.petesqbsite.com/sections/tutorials/tuts/doorknob/asm_appendix1.html), and the arguments are also passed in reverse order compared to C.\n\n[2] Segments are important for 16-bit assembly, which I assume you're working with as you say \"BP\" (16-bit) not \"EBP\" (32-bit) or \"RBP\" (64-bit).  But segments aren't relevant to 32-bit or 64-bit programs; the popular modern OS's all use flat memory models, and manage memory with paging rather than segments.",

But for some reason, the external system is rejecting the **valid** SQL queries that you want to do, because of unexplained \"security concerns\".\n\nI don't think inventing a new domain-specific query language, instead of just using SQL, is going to address your real problem. The real problem is how to **efficiently** extract only the subset of the data that you need from your underlying database, when you're being forced to go through a layer that is trying to prevent you from doing that. \n\nIf you did come up with a custom query language, then you would just have to translate it to SQL anyway in order to actually execute it, right? (Since Lucene's query language is nowhere near sophisticated enough to express what you want.)\n\nSo I think the answer is going to depend on the specific details of the restrictions that the system is imposing on your SQL queries.\n\nFor instance:\n\n> Pick this one if its status is \"open\" or if it's linked with ... which has 5 descendants and at least 2 descendants have at least one linked child of type biological.\n\nIt's fairly straightforward to express this with a SQL query involving nested joins. When you pass a query containing joins to the DB, the DB can optimize based on the details of what you're querying and the available indexes, so that it doesn't fetch more data than necessary. This is crucial for efficiency.\n\nWhat is the specific limitation you're running into when you try to write such a query? When you say the system rejects \"complex queries\", what is the actual definition of \"complex\" that's being used?\n\nFor instance: Suppose the system doesn't allow joins at all. Then you would have to implement your own query engine which queries tables individually and then joins them together (e.g. using a hash join). This will almost certainly be much slower than letting the DB perform the join itself. In order to mitigate the performance cost as much as possible, your query engine needs to decide what order to perform the joins in, and it needs to \"push down\" the join criteria to become filters on the individual table queries. (Of course, you will be limited in your ability to do this because you don't have access to all the low-level data that the underlying DB engine does, such as index statistics.)\n\nIf the actual restrictions you're facing are different from \"no joins allowed\", then you would have to design around those other restrictions instead.\n\nBut the *implementation* of this join engine doesn't really depend much on how you *express* the queries that you want to perform. So for expressing the queries, you might as well stick with SQL, or at least a limited subset of SQL.",

Define a small JSON AST with and/or/not, cmp ops, exists(relation, where), and count(relation, depth, op, value). That lets you say: risks where exists hazard with category = biological and count(descendants, depth=2) >= 5.\n\nPerformance: don’t hit the source for complex logic. Set up a read replica you control. Either a graph DB (Neo4j/JanusGraph) or SQL with a closure table/materialized paths for ancestor/descendant counts. Sync via CDC (Debezium or Airbyte), precompute transitive closures per project, cache id sets, and stream rows with keyset pagination. Batch relation lookups using a DataLoader-style layer to avoid N+1.\n\nI’ve used Neo4j and Debezium for this pattern; DreamFactory helped auto-generate REST endpoints over the replica so the UI could query with OData/RSQL consistently.\n\nMain point: adopt OData/RSQL plus a graph-capable backend and a small JSON AST with exists/count.",

More broadly than just answering messages promptly, it's important to know how to be seen as helpful and pleasant to interact with in general by others in your organization.\n\nThe other big one is the ability to work independently and take initiative. I'll find ways to keep myself busy if there's no obvious task (even if it's just self-study) and I'll do everything I can within reason to work through a problem before asking for help.

However, radio silence or leaving them on read makes your coworkers think you were goofing off or that you didn't understand their request. \n\n Very obvious in hindsight, but people would prefer a quick, prompt \"I'll look into it this afternoon, it'll probably take me a couple hours\" with the actual answer the next day.

In fact unless you're the rare 1%, you probably should be putting up less PR's as a staff, senior, etc. then you do as a junior.\n\nThat's because your job becomes more and more about improving the quality and speed of the devs around you. Devs on your team should be moving tickets faster with you there.\n\nThe reward becomes harder to see and it's not for everyone. You'll have less days logging off feeling great because you finally solved a problem that's blocking a release, but more quarters feeling good because you identified and shipped a solution that enabled 2+ projects to deliver quicker. Even though your name isn't tied to either.",

You need people who can guide other engineers, break down hard problems in a way that are tangible to less experienced engineers, and mostly when you’re building a piece of software, it’s rarely greenfield, but more about building a piece of the jigsaw puzzle in a larger ecosystem, so you need to talk to other people (who own the other neighbouring pieces of your jigsaw puzzle) to make sure you design the piece in a good way, and these skills are hard to come by, a combination of tech competence, understanding the system well enough to be able to decide the direction you want to take it in, is a harder skill than people understand. In reality it does sadly look a lot like jira tickets and docs/slides, but youre not becoming useless, unless you’re being passive, because you’re (somewhat) in a driving seat.",

        "body": "There's some meme somewhere about junior devs wanting to be invited to more meetings and senior devs wanting to not. The progression is natural, but you can carve your career a bit based on your own goals. If you want to maximize career growth, you have to align yourself with business goals and impact, and the way to do this is rarely to output more code but instead be a multiplier- train up other devs, lead initiatives, set up processes to streamline things. Part of this may in fact be figuring out ways to trim down meetings but still maintain same output and quality. This may mean you decline meetings that aren't useful.\n\nAlternatively you can also drive impact by being very technical and the expert on one technology. At my internship (circa 2017) Docker was still somewhat new and some guy named Sheldon learned about it at a meetup and introduced it to the company and he was the \"Docker guy\" who people would go to get help.\n\nOr you can choose to just focus on doing what you want to do and not min-max career development. My first job out of college was low 6 figures, and feasibly that was enough to never \"career develop\" again from financial aspect. If you are financially where you want to be, then no reason to let the corporation decide what you get out of your \\~8 hours a day you're giving to the company.",

I guarantee you, there are times when your deployment instructions or post-deploy verification steps are lacking, because no one is perfect. So rather than focus on which \"false bugs\" they filed, be a professional and ignore it. Come up with plans which prevent the DevOps from accidentally applying the wrong config file.

First of all, you’re treating H1Bs as a monolith, when in reality, there’s two “tiers.”The bottom tier H1Bs don’t work directly for big tech. They work for WITCH companies, insurance companies, oil companies, etc. They are modern-day indentured servants. In this case, if their employer can’t easily replace them by sponsoring someone else, it would stand to reason their wages would rise, not fall. They already couldn’t get sponsored by other companies. Not how it works for this caste. \n\nOn the other hand, there are H1B recipients who already worked for Big Tech directly overseas. They get sponsored. They insource their job with them. They were never begging for table scraps. They’ll just self deport and outsource their job with them if they get a $100k paycut. Moreover, people like that create other jobs. We’re outsourcing an entire team’s worth of jobs with them. \n\nYou’re also ignoring the consensus amongst economists as to why SF became the tech capital of the world. Why it outcompeted the hub around MIT in MA. Because non compete agreements are illegal in CA. You presume competition is a bad thing. Maybe it is for entrenched, enshittifying monopolies in isolation. But even those monopolies had been paying a premium to bring the world’s top talent to the place where they weren’t a big fish in a small pond. If they wanted to entrap their higher tier H1Bs, they would’ve done what all the employers of lower tier H1Bs did: moved them out to some godforsaken shithole in TX or NC, refused to sponsor applications for green cards, paid them below market rate, etc. At some level, even the monopolies realize competition is good.\n\nWe issue under 100k H1Bs per year. That’s it. And they don’t all go to IT/CS jobs either. India and China have nearly 3 billion people between the two of them. Do the math… We’re only getting the top 0.01% of them, for the most part. There are some serial abusers. The WITCH companies in particular ought to be permanently barred from H1B. But really, the problem with H1B is how abusive it is to the recipients. We should be more like Canada and just give them green cards when they arrive. Unironically. \n\nWhy do we make it so fucking hard for talented people to come here and pay tens of thousands of dollars a year in taxes, while some barely literate economic migrant from Venezuela just says the magic word “asylum” and they can come stay for years in a free hotel, no questions asked? It’s insane. Both sides of the immigration “debate” in this country are fucking unhinged. Guns and immigration are the only two issues where I’m an obnoxious enlightened centrist, I swear…",

I've had to give them whiteboard problems....and I really don't think either are very useful. \n\n\nPeople study for those things in a way that they do not study for their job. And I do the same. \n\n\nBut I get it. It's an attempt to be objective. Still, I don't think it's really that useful. LLMs haven't really changed anything, IMHO.\n\n\nHere's what I really did, at least when I was still in the office.\n\n\nLet me talk to them. It can even be over lunch.  We just have a chat about their last project, or any project they want. It can be academic or professional. It can be a Pokemon fan site. I don't care. Preferably something they are passionate about, especially for the earlier career folk.\n\n\nLow stress. I'm not trying to trick you. Explain it to me. Let me ask some questions. There aren't even right or wrong answers. It's about communication, and clarity, and a depth of understanding. Use a napkin and draw something out if it helps. \n\n\nIf I'm doing it right, it should be the easiest interview they've ever had. It hardly feels like an interview... I'm just like a slightly overenthusiastic fan of their work. I'm trying to help them demonstrate all the awesome stuff they have done. \n\n\nIt's not a sales job. There isn't any benefit in them practicing to prepare. The questions I ask are all over the place and are specific to their project and their previous responses. I'm intentionally asking questions that will let them demonstrate a breadth and depth of knowledge. It's not a prepared slide deck they could practice with. The way to crush this interview is to fully understand the ins and outs of a sufficiently complex codebase, or at least, section of codebase, AND the languages, frameworks and tools they'd use. \n\n\nPracticing for my interview would be exactly like practicing for the job. And our conversation is basically the same as I would have with a coworker who wrote XYZ in our codebase, except, ya know, I'd be less interested and ask fewer questions, but it's really really close. \n\n\nI've personally watched people who aced our technical problem _because they had seen it before_ get hired and be mediocre. I've also lied about a candidate who failed his whiteboard session miserably because they were nervous, hadn't prepped and hardly communicated anything, but during our 'culture fit' spent 45 minutes convincing me that he was an experienced developer who didn't do well under pressure. He was a great hire. I'm old, and he's actually progressed further in his career than I have. \n\n\nMaybe I've just been lucky, but I've never had a decently long chat like this with someone and thought 'Wow, they really know their stuff' and been wrong.",

I've had this happen where they throw a 'gotcha' and all of a sudden you're in a different vertical than what you thought they were going to test you on. Big fat waste of time for everyone involved because you can't code something you're unprepared for within less than an hour window, even though you could do it within 3 hours and a bunch of Googling. If you're going to build a Wordle game, tell them before. If they're going to fetch data, manipulate data, filter data, and display a list, tell them beforehand. These are two very different things and you could be super sharp at one and not the other.\n\n\\- Live technical test with AI. The key here is to check whether or not they are blindly accepting prompts from AI. Take the time to ask questions around what the code they just accepted is doing and why they think that is a good solution.\n\n\\- Timed test (take home/alone). Give them a quite complicated technical test and 3-4 hours to complete it with a submission deadline. They will have to use AI to solve it in that time. Then you follow up in another meeting to discuss the solution and why they did what they did.\n\n\\- Take home test. Make it complicated as above. They will use AI but how do they handle state management? How do they fetch data? How do they handle errors? Is it scalable? Etc. You can ask for more if you're permitting AI.\n\nYou can effectively assess someone's ability even when they use AI. All you need to do is ask a bunch of questions around the solution to see if they know what they're doing. Overall, just remember that you're trying to hire someone, you're not trying to catch someone out who can't remember a certain method on the spot, that won't tell you anything other than your process is an act of gatekeeping. If you judged a fish on it's ability to climb tree's you'd believe it was stupid so ask yourself if you're setting your candidates up for success.",

It's common in small companies, and even some companies that would surprise you.\n\nI know of a company that is basically a household name, and they shipped an app that was built entirely by one person.

All jobs were \"desirable\" jobs and companies. Sorry for being a bit vague, I keep the personal details vague on reddit.\n\nI learned two lessons from the search. First of all, make sure to keep in touch with your network, especially the people you did great work with in the past. Not all stretches of your career will have you working with people you click with and on projects that succeed, but the stretches that do are where your real network comes from.\n\nSecond, make sure to study system design interviews. They've become performance theater at this point like LeetCode and you're expected to \"know the moves\" at some places. Most staff+ interviews also had a project presentation and Q&A part which paradoxically is the opposite where you're cooked if you never had the scope and scars but you don't need to study for. Also expect newer companies to ask more non-memorizable-from-internet coding and system design questions, which IMO is a great thing because that'll probably trickle to the rest of the industry eventually.\n\nThe above is for ICs who are still hands on. The market seems to be rough for pure engineering management roles unless your previous team was a strong match for the role.",

You have to grasp that you are part of a team, and if you aren't a team player, it doesn't matter what merits you believe you have over another team member. You aren't the one handing out the raises and promotions. The leaders of the team decide what the team values. \n\nSo, if you don't like what the team values, that's fine. You can go find another team, but recognize that the game is the same. If you want to be valuable to the team, you have to show growth in ways that the team values, not just what you deem valuable. \n\nOn the other hand, if you can't do that, and feel strongly that you know what is valuable better than anyone else, that's the spirit that drives entrepreneurs. Your path to a good boss might be becoming your own, but you better be able to sell your authority as the guy who knows to clients, and understand what they find valuable.",

Go do a few LCs and you'll be right back to golden most likely. The important thing to recognize is that if you've done it once, you can do it all again. \n\n>Is my experience even marketable in the current climate, or is \"data integration and ETL work\" too niche or not in-demand right now? \n\nI think anything is marketable with the right verbiage, personally. You could be a mainframe developer and as long as you demonstrate the ability to learn, manage complex systems, and build out feature services I think most places would be happy with it. \n\nAlso, ETL is probably still very much relevant in the modern age. It's not like data pipelines are suddenly agnostic and all-encompassing. I don't have the personal experience with the BIG data boys though, as my only experience with ETL was with a financial firm myself doing similar work as yours but I can't imagine the practice is somehow deprecated and forgotten to time already. \n\n>And for people who've been through extended unemployment periods where your skills got rusty - how did you get sharp again? What actually worked for rebuilding that technical depth?\n\nYou can't really build technical depth without working on some larger systems imo. So either build your own or work with what you've got. I built some side projects for fun back in the day that I never really took anywhere but just used to keep my cloud knowledge fresh and available. But realistically you can probably just get by with some refresher courses.",

        "body": "I'm in the same boat and basically had to up-skill myself and work on side projects to refresh my mind. I relearned some fundamentals using Udemy and started working on my Master's degree. I also picked up courses in System Design using [hellointerview.com](http://hellointerview.com) and educative.io. I use ChatGPT a lot to create study guides for myself when I interview at companies, I try to get a refresher on their tech stack so I can speak their language. I also started doing Leetcode religiously, completed Neetcode's 150 and have about 170 problems on Leetcode.com.  It's been a rough journey where I've been passing DSA interviews and System design interviews, but now companies are starting to ask on the job syntax questions to really filter down candidates. There's just too many of us, the market is overly saturated.  So now I'm on the grind, building apps from scratch and iterating on it over and over again until I have the syntax down to a T as well. We'll see how my next interviews go. I've had friends in the same boat and I had one friend that studied LC for 6 months straight to get into Meta, but ended up failing the System Design. The other thing is they're super picky about languages now, if you say you know Java, they want you to do their stupid LC in Java. As if knowing syntax is going to make you a good engineer....\n\nI've been unemployed for a year and still looking, so you're not alone.\n\nPeople that are employed will never understand what we're going through. In fact, they wouldn't even pass their own interviews today. I can guarantee you that I have more skill than any of them in any system design interview or leetcode question.  All they know is how to interview people and of course when you have all the answers in front of you it's easy to do that.\n\nStay strong my brother, I've also considered other roles that are closely related like Customer Support Engineer, DevOps, IT Support, and wait until the economy gets better. I've been applying to those roles and it's been a lot better since they don't ask ridiculous questions and demand regurgitation of syntax immediately. This industries has a lack of respect for senior engineers with the way they treat their engineers. I, too, might have to exit the field as well. I still really enjoy coding and building things, but it may have to do be something I do as a hobby for now instead of professionally.",

At 4-5 years you should be mid-level moving to senior so that helps a lot. \n\nOnce you hit 4-5 years, you years working no longer matters so much (large breaks in work do still matter, try to avoid or if needed, have good a good reason for it). Now it's more about what sort of experience you have. In the past they'd say they didn't care if you worked with their exact stack, as anyone can ramp up to a new stack, but now there's so many developers begging for work that they often are looking for their exact tech stack in your experience, so this is why stuffing your resume and cover letter with tech stack names is so important. \n\nIf you want to make your future job hunting easier though, I would suggest expanding your network, keep in touch with previous colleagues, and be friendly, happy and positive at work so everyone thinks \"I love working with them!\" \n\nThere is no silver bullet for job hunting, the more different parts you do to make it easier, the easier it will be overall, but it's unlikely to ever be \"easy\" unless you're very lucky or have a great network filled with people working at companies that are hiring.",

What I do with my career is really on me, and is based on my personal goals and priorities. It'd be odd if my tech lead sat me down and explained what he wants me to do after I quit the company we're at.\n\nBut technical-wise, I had a great tech lead at my new grad company. His mentorship style was kinda trial by fire. He'd expect you to first try things on your own, do your own research on the company wiki, etc. Then, he'd be there to fallback on when you got stuck. Notably he didn't spoonfeed answers to anybody, he'd help nudge you towards the right answer. If I didn't do a good job of searching the wiki, we'd sit together and he'd help guide me down the right path. If I was missing some technical knowledge, he'd push me towards how I could've gained that knowledge myself with the right prodding. Stuff like that.\n\nMaybe most importantly he was really patient, and knew that helping others was a *part of his job*. He was always happy to help, and he did so with a smile.\n\nThat's one mistake I see a lot of people making on this subreddit. People think that helping others means they have less time to do their ticket, or that it makes them replaceable, or that it's not their problem when other people get stuck.\n\nThat creates a toxic culture. Helping others is a *part of the job*. If Ticket A is late because I needed to help somebody? Not a problem, I have very clear justification on why Ticket A is late, and I communicated that early and often. If you're giving significant mentorship, then a good manager/PM will make sure you have a reduced sprint load, or even give you dedicated consulting tickets with points on them.\n\nI'm really thankful for my new grad tech lead, because I was able to take those very healthy practices, and carry them with me throughout my career. I cultivate that kind of a healthy culture wherever I go now.\n\nThat being said, after I left that new grad job with about 3.5 YOE, I didn't really receive mentorship anymore. The expectation became that I was the mentor.",

Even if you aren't writing code, you are probably weighing in on design choices, diving deep into high-profile operational issues, or helping teams with disagreements, all of which require understanding technical areas - someone without that understanding usually does not do well. \n\nThe other thing I've seen in my own career is that while I have gotten more senior, things have mostly shifted from depth to breadth. There was a time where I knew everything about my area: if you had a question about how to build a Java app using Spring storing data in Postgres, MySQL, DynamoDB or Mongo, that used Maven as a build script - I probably knew the answer (and still might, at least for whatever old version I used back in the day). Now, the set of things I weigh in spans a very broad set. As a result, in a lot of rooms I do not have the most detailed knowledge of the topic at hand, but I have a ton of context about a whole bunch of other things and how the particular decision fits into 53 other decisions we as a team are trying to make.\n\n>it took 2 months to get *one component* shipped.\n\nThere are two different reasons why this might be. On the one hand, at larger companies the consequences of getting something wrong are much higher, so it is worth it to make sure that component gets shipped the right way. On the other hand, it could be that, yes, you are suffering from bureaucracy. If you've ever had the opportunity to work with a really senior IC though, one of the things they can be great at is figuring out how to remove unnecessary bureaucracy (and navigating needed bureaucracy).",

Similarly with administrative assistants, the barrier to entry is a lot lower, so you're potentially competing with a lot more people for fewer positions.\n\nTimes are definitely rough in CS-related fields right now, but if you look at a lot of other subs, there are also a lot of people unhappy with how things are (nurses, accountants, teachers, doctors). There's some similar themes of the happy people being on Reddit. \n\nIn the example of your friend, I'm sure there are plenty of other people looking for similar jobs who are having a much harder time.",

You are new to the dev world. Take it and start gaining experience. After a year, start looking for something else, job hop and increase your pay that way. \n\nPersonally, I started out at a really low paying job. But I worked my butt off. I learned the entire stack (building a server, configuring the network, building code, testing code, creating the CI/CD pipelines, deploying the code, [get blasted for not testing well enough], iterate on the code, redeploy, maintain the code. Then as time progressed, I learned more about micro services, cloud tech, load balancing and ways to handle very very large amounts of data. I got to the point where I knew the entire pipeline of the entire setup, I was then able to communicate with customers about what was possible and know how to fix stuff when things broke. \n\nIf you want to be the person everyone goes to, you need to gain the experience and know how to solve complex problems and more importantly be able to communicate the issues and ways to solve it in a way the customer understands.",

I’ve learned the most when something didn’t work or got broken and then fixed it. You can find tutorials/courses on how to set things up. They’re not perfect, and quality varies greatly, but what else are you going to do? Hope you can find a stranger with enough free time who is also good enough to give you free training? It does happen, but I think it’ll be very hard to find. \n\nThere’s more info available than there ever has been. You can even use LLMs for some high-level guidance.

A lot of my webdev friends are struggling to find work, but my C/C++ and embedded peers are only slightly affected by the downturn in the job market.\n\n\nAnother thing that can differentiate a project is using project management software to drive it. Most companies use Jira or similar to track tasks. Showing familiarity with Jira, it's git integrations, and following workflows does a lot to assure companies you can be productive and provide metrics. I, personally, don't put a lot of stock in such metrics, but the people hiring sure do. In the same vein, having examples of unit tests and CI/CD are also big.

The question is how to leverage that experience to get interviews.  \n  \nIf you can't get interviews your probably falling short at the application stage (missing some keywords in your resume, or languages/tools that are needed for the job). If you ever get a denial reach out to the hiring manager and see what was missing from your experience and work on getting that experience even if it's solo work. Worse case the hiring person doesn't respond, best case they give you some pointers. (This is assuming it isn't a fake posting) \n\nIf you are you're getting interviews but not moving forward, then the HR or panel stage is the crux to get over. The HR round is your chance to show passion and explain how your background can benefit the **company**. The panel round is where you prove your technical knowledge and problem solving skills. Use your HR round to figure out what projects are currently being worked on by the company and figure out if they're interesting to you. You will burn out if you find the work boring, and then you're back to square 1. \n\nYou mentioned companies hiring people with more experience, sure that will happen, but I have worked with people who have 10+ years of experience and they still got laid off with me. They are struggling to get past the HR round because they got too comfortable, they lost their passion, ability to adapt, and put less effort into what a company needs and is hiring for. Effort and curiosity counts more than people think. the only thing better is experience.  \n  \nFocusing on projects is the best idea to open you up to getting experience. Even better than that is trying to contribute to open source of projects you're truly interested in. You'll be working with other developers, getting real world coding experience, and getting feedback on your code. This is a HUGE advantage when getting through the panel round with other engineers reviewing your work live. Keep building and publishing your work, and make sure recruiters can actually *see* what you’ve been working on. That visibility can make a huge difference.\n\nAgain this field is beyond tough right now, but keep applying, there are so many of us with experience looking for a job, but we are still working with other engineers to continue growing out knowledge an experience. Find your passion and drive yourself into it, employers will notice that more than you realize.",

I got promoted twice, including to Senior, without any action or politicking on my part, they were handed to me on merit unprompted.\n\nI'm the last person to be \"buddy buddy\" with anyone at work. I don't like to chit chat, I don't like going to company happy hours. I certainly wasn't buddies with the CEO or CTO (or anyone for that matter). Doubt the CEO even knew my name. The CTO and I spoke once in a blue moon. I just went into work and did my job, and then left. And yet, huge raises, multiple promotions.\n\nPretty sure the people that were leaving those negatives reviews didn't get good raises or promotions *because they didn't deserve them*. So they blamed it on nepotism.",

Look at what FAANG/unicorn interviews expect and try and learn that stuff, that’s how you’ll get the most money if that’s something you care about.

So you provide them with optionality.\n\nSo my professional opinion is that you should focus your learning on what interests you most, and explore various domains. As you know, the field is also evolving extremely quickly, so it's nearly impossible to predict what will be in demand. Better go with your intellectual curiosity ;-)\n\nI know that it's a bit frustrating because it's not a clear answer, but this is the common approach I've seen in people with successful careers.\n\nI hope it helps!\n\nEmmanuel",

Cloud, networking, cybersecurity, and even data are all being enhanced by AI, not replaced. For example, AI tools might automate small tasks (like monitoring servers or cleaning data), but people will still be needed to set things up, make decisions, and handle complex problems that AI can’t. The folks who understand both tech and AI will actually become more valuable.\n\nOnce you build up a tech foundation, it’s pretty easy to switch paths. If you start in cloud and later want to move into AI or automation, your cloud knowledge will carry over. Same with data as if you learn Python and SQL, you can pivot into analytics, AI, or even DevOps later. So you’re not locking yourself into one lane forever, you’re just building stepping stones.",

You can also ask it to do web searches or research for you, if you tell it to find learning resources or videos for you (based on topics or styles that you tell it that you prefer).\n\nFor example, if you have an enterprise approved AI LLM you can use, then when one of your AI/ML peers publishes a document or a slide deck, you can just upload the doc and give it a prompt like this \"I am a software engineer, trying to learn more about AI/ML. One of my coworkers shared this doc recently, can you help break it down and explain what it means? Assume I know basic software and technology concepts, but that I have no advanced statistics or data science training.\" \n\nOf course, if you don't have a safe enterprise AI to use, then you can't be uploading sensitive documents to your personal subscription. But you can still take certain key phrases or concepts that are generic, and ask Claude or ChatGPT to explain then (e.g. what is XGBoost? how do you run an A/B test? what does stat sig mean? how does deep learning work? etc.).\n\nUsing an AI LLM is no substitute for real education or reading and studying textbooks, and it won't make you transform into a full ML engineer overnight or something... but it can actually be a very useful starting point for someone who is a beginner. Eventually you can use it to help you generate sample projects, build your own ML model as a tutorial, etc. \n\nAlso, once you feel like you've got a basic grasp, then you should graduate from asking your initially dumb questions to your AI LLM only, to asking (slightly?) less dumb questions to your actual coworkers. Don't pester them and don't make them responsible for teaching you, but generally speaking if you show serious interest in learning and put in work yourself, most people are happy to talk about their work with you (especially if, as an engineer, you might sometimes be able to help unblock them in various ways, then you can trade knowledge sharing and favors with them).",

I don't approve or disapprove of this; only mentioning it as a possibility.\n\nAnother option is to purse a combined Masters/Phd program.\n\nOr, since you already have a Masters, to leverage that and apply for PHd programs.\n\nOr, you can pursue an MBA, but it would be like adding an even bigger gap unrelated to software.\n\nIn general, I think a second masters is not the best idea, but anything is better than doing nothing.

And I know people that have children that just leave them in the States and either get a parent to watch them or hire a babysitter.\n\nI will never understand the people that just put their entire lives on hold as soon as they have a kid. If that's what having a kid is like, I never fucking want kids. But luckily I have plenty of examples of people I know that have still lived their lives to its fullest even with kids. Hell, that couple I mentioned beforehand? *They travelled more than me that year*. I'm single, with no kids. And yet somehow, with a newly born child, they travelled more than me. They're living life right.\n\nI know I didn't answer your question at all, and I introduced even more questions... so apologies for that, but I think your perspective is creating a lot of issues in your mind that don't need to exist. This isn't a \"now or never\" situation. Your career shouldn't be an ultimatum of \"I can only take extended breaks when I'm unemployed\". You can have a balanced life, and a balanced career, without reaching for extremes.",

Others have everyone fending for themselves. You need to try to figure out which one the company you're talking to is. Another problem is if they're a smaller company, they might have fewer clients. Find out how many clients they have and the nature of their contracts. I worked at a contracting company that tried to present themselves as a consulting company. They had two clients when I interviewed, but then lost one between when I accepted the offer and started. They eventually lost their last client and had some layoffs along with a bunch of people leaving to join the company that took over the contract. \n\nAnother challenge, like with any company, is how much the interviewers actually lie to you or not. For example, I was told during my interviews the contract was for three years. It was actually three 1-year options, so they had to be renewed each year. \n\nTry to get an idea if they're really doing consulting work or they are more staffing/contracting. Especially with less experience, you'll probably be doing more development work. Normally, the higher you are in a company, the more they want you to be doing sales. You also want to get an idea of how they get new projects, and what their project pipeline looks like.",

I will say usually when it's looking bad now, it's safe to assume to say it would look better in 3 years and the best time to get into something is when everyone is avoiding it. I get the fear of AI, but the way i see it AI will either replace jobs or can make more jobs. Like if a a team of 10 can complete 30 tasks  (3 each) in a month without a AI. But 1 engineer with AI can complete 6 tasks a month. Some companies may just fire half but i think most companies will keep the 10 like the fact that they can get more tasks done, meet deadlines easier, etc. Now that creates better bonuses and profit for everybody and the following year there may be enough money to hire more people.\n\nNow if you are struggling in your classes and are stressed out, id recommend going into EE or even CE. I knew many kids who dropped out of CS and CE because they couldnt handle the coidng classes. Coding was much harder than they expected. In my school IT was seen as the CS dropout degree because IT had a low application rate, but a high transfer rate. Like IT courses would be empty fall of freshman year but by spring of freshman or fall of sopohemore year, the classes would be packed.",

Like that’s literally the bar and you are jumping it. There was a big meme about google being harder to get in to than Harvard back in the day. It’s obviously not true but somehow still true at the same time: applications to a job take a lot less work than to a college (also college applications take money). Most problems asked in coding interviews are honestly not Leetcode hard level for big tech. You can get unlucky but they ask a lot of medium with follow up to hard. The interviewers are just people working their job every day and they don’t want to ask a question nobody can understand, there’s no joy to sitting awkwardly for 45 minutes.  But there’s always someone who will ask some fuck shit to put it lightly",

Managers will manually review the 100 applicants down to 20 they are interesting in doing phone screens with. The phone screens are ~15 minute conversations where the manager asks some very basic questions.\n* **Interview Stage**: 4 - 6. Managers will conduct phone screens with the 20 applicants and from that pick around 5 +/- a one or two that they want to interview\n* **Interview Rounds**: In my group we usually do two rounds of interviews. First one is typically remote unless the applicant lives nearby but the second one is always mandatory in person. Each round is pretty similar but with different groups of engineers. The managers will sit in and watch but let the engineers do all the actual interviewing. The actual interviews are about 30% behavioral/personality and 70% coding checks. The coding checks are pretty simple. Nothing from leetcode. Just basic programming questions or prompts to write simple functions. We are mostly just looking to see if you actually know how to code and didn't cheat your way through college. The questions barely get harder than fizz-buzz level and yet still like 50% of the applicants fail massively at this stage.\n\n\nSo if we use 2K as the total number of applicants. Then ~5% of resumes are actually looked at by a person. ~1% make it to phone screens. ~0.25% make it to interview stage. Keep in mind these percentages include all the non-eligible candidates which are all automatically filtered out.",

The amount of opportunities for \"new\" or impactful work.\n\nMost people don't have 1 or 2, so if you're middle of the pack it's very possible you get stuck with the short end of the stick just because the opportunities aren't there or you get stuck doing grunt work for a few months.If your peers have slightly better results or you make one mistake that others didn't then you may find yourself behind the curve without the opportunities to make up ground.\n\nOn the other hand, you will probably never need to worry about stack ranking if your manager knows the game and you are trusted within your org to deliver results. If you're liked and trusted to deliver you will almost always have your pick of opportunities, meaning you will almost always have good results to show for performance management. Most people don't have the required mix of soft and technical skills to pull this off, so that's probably why most of what you read is negative.",

        "body": "Startups can be a *lot* of fun, but for every 10 startups you'll find 1 great one, 2 great ones that will still fail, and 7 that are some level of bad to awful.\n\nA **successful** startup (and I can't stress this enough - those are VERY rare) will go through 2-5 rounds of fundraising, \"pre-seed\" is the first one. At this point, the company has managed to convince a venture capitalist to part with a small amount of money. Don't take this as a sign of confidence though - to you and me it's the equivalent of lending a friend $5 to play the slots and promise us 20% of whatever they win.\n\nIf they *are* successful (again - super rare) it can be an awesome pay day for you... but that pay day also can take a *long long* time. I joined one startup back in 2015 that *still* hasn't had an exit event - the $880 worth of stock I got back then is now worth about $110k (back of the envelope) but I can't (reasonably) actually do anything with it because it's still private equity.\n\nI joined another startup \\~2 years ago though, which had a more typical liquidation exit - I got a fat offer from the next company that hired me and more career advancement in the year of working there than in the 5 preceding years in FAANG combined, but my $160k of equity earned me a total of $0 because there wasn't anything left over after the debts and preferred stock was paid out. Even *that* was a pretty lucky case - I was working for *way* less than I was worth and really stretching myself to do so, if my next (current) employer hadn't taken notice of me I would have just found myself sitting around putting my heart and soul into something with nothing to show for it.\n\n**Startups are FANTASTIC for learning a lot of things \"in the trenches\" though**. **This is NOT appropriate for everybody.** If you're really ambitious and love being part of the rat race (especially early career where this is especially helpful!) it can be an awesome thing. It means late days, doing things *way* outside your comfort zone, learning skills that you should never have to deal with as an engineer... but that also means getting a broad skill set and great experience in a short time.\n\nIn my experience, judge the founders *very critically*. I like to ask founders hard questions to see how they react. It takes experience in business and industry to get a feel for what's good / not good, what you like / don't, I can't really give great advice here - but if you're interested in young companies and startups, the best way to get that experience is the hard way!\n\nIf you're happy with the base pay and want to hustle for a bit, it could be a good opportunity. It will be a hustle, odds are much more than 50/50 that you'll end up working your ass off for something that fails, but you'll learn a ton along the way and make some good connections. The people you meet at startups are, disproportionately, the kind of professional connection that'll be really valuable to you in 5-10 years as well.",

You may see people post LinkedIn premium stats where X% of people applying to an entry level role have a masters... but that doesn't mean they're *getting the role*.\n\nWhen a company is hiring for a regular SWE position that requires no specialized knowledge outside of a bachelors, if they see someone with a masters applying, all they see is a flight risk. They're not stupid. They know someone with a masters degree is just going to use that \"normal\" position as a stepping stone, and leave the moment they have a job lined up that has work utilizing their degree, and more importantly, pay reflecting the advanced degree.\n\nYou can claim that this is the job you want, and you're in it for the long term all you want.... but no sane company is going to believe you.\n\nNone of this is a problem if you're getting a masters/PhD in order to chase jobs that require a masters/PhD. It becomes a problem when you're using those degrees just to delay your entry into the market.\n\nStick it out with applying. Getting an internship sophomore year is pretty difficult. You'll likely have better luck after your Junior year. And even if you don't.... in my opinion your time is better spent in the market, applying until you get something lined up. Side note, are you applying to roles besides SWE? I did a PM internship after my sophomore year because that's all I could line up. That internship made it way easier to get a SWE internship the year after.",

I was interviewing as an E6 this time but I was told the initial screening was pretty much identical. I crushed the first problem and had tons of time for the second but the screener didn't understand my solution and kept interrupting me questioning my approach. I understood the approach they were suggesting and even explained it to them and why mine was actually superior and closer to real-world implementations for the specific problem presented. I tried my best to educate, and when it was clear that they just weren't going to get there I tried to power through and get my implementation in at least pseudocode hoping that either someone else would review it or the interviewer would research offline and get there eventually. That didn't happen and I was rejected. I reached out to the HM but their hands were tied by policy so I was screwed.  \n\n\nMoral of the story is that it's highly subjective and entirely up to how the screener decides to frame the interaction.",

Second problem was harder. Didn't quite complete coding it but maybe 90% complete. And missed an edge case. Still passed. I think tech screen is not as strict but they also don't expect you to take a whole bunch of time prepping for it. I scheduled mine like 10 days afyer the recruiter call, didn't prep at all (too busy with my current job).",

Containerize a small Java service, push to ECR, deploy to ECS Fargate or EKS. Provision with Terraform (VPC, IAM, RDS), wire CI/CD with GitHub Actions, add canary/blue‑green, alerts in CloudWatch/Prometheus, and cost alarms. Practice runbooks, rollbacks, backup/restore, and least‑privilege IAM. At work, volunteer to own the pipeline, infra modules, or a lift‑and‑shift of a legacy service; that experience counts more than certs, but AWS SAA then Developer or DevOps Pro will help you get callbacks.\n\nDay to day is less feature coding and more incidents, reliability, and cost/security reviews. Market’s decent for platform/SRE, but entry is noisy; real deployments and on-call stories beat toy labs. I’ve used AWS API Gateway and Kong to manage APIs, and brought in DreamFactory to quickly expose Snowflake and SQL Server as REST during a migration.\n\nIt’s worth it if you can show ops chops and accept on-call; your Java background plus a focused lab and internal wins can get you there.",

It’s one of the easiest entry points into tech because it builds directly on what you already know with organizing data, spotting trends, and presenting insights. You can start by learning tools like Excel (advanced level), SQL, and Power BI or Tableau. Once you’re comfortable, you can move to Python and basic statistics. Yes, data analysis includes some stats, but you don’t need to be a math genius. You just need to understand basic ideas like averages, percentages, and trends.\n\nFor courses, check out Google Data Analytics on Coursera, IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate, or freeCodeCamp’s Python and SQL tutorials. They're beginner friendly and look great on a resume. As you learn, build small projects like maybe analyze public datasets or create dashboards so you have something to show employers.",
