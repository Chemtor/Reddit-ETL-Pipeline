Then they wonder why they can't find someone or when they do ends up telling them \"I haven't done that before\" and throws off the quarters goals, which is unacceptable. No idea how to deal with it but I really think they're just using the shit job market to expand our responsibilities to save money in the short term.

You don’t want to make sure your 300 billions records are unique every time you add a new row.\n\nBut the concept of unique identifier should be introduced into almost all tables. That unique identifier is normally a surrogate key. Surrogate key are unique identifier derives from other fields. For example a md5 hash of the concatenation of 4 columns. This give you a unique identifier.\n\nWhat’s great about surrogate keys is that they are not random. You get consistency in any systems, if you migrate to another platform your surrogate keys are still valid and that’s very powerful. \n\nAlso you can reproduce the same results over and over again, which is not possible if you use a UUID generated by another system for example.\n\nThen depending on the tool you use you can validate the uniqueness of the fields yourself. \n\nThere’s some reason you might want to do this yourself and not the system like you would have in a normal db and is that because you can have multiple time the same records or a different version of what you consider the same records.\n\nSince the DW is for analytics you might want to analyze those different records which are not unique in your raw layer but could be in your marts.\n\nSo it’s a powerful thing to let you control de uniqueness of the fields yourself.\n\nObviously if you don’t manage it you’ll probably end up with a lot of duplicates. But since the DW store all your data it’s better to avoid having the constraint on inserts and give the users more flexibility. Because he might need all version for what he is trying to achieve.\n\nTLDR; yep a surrogate key should be something you have in all tables (when possible)",

You are getting confused by marketing terms and, unfortunately, that is by design. \n\nI think you can spot me what a database is. That's pretty straight forward. A data warehouse is just a very, very large database. There are two different database areas, operational and analytic. They are characterised by the SLAs you have on the data. Smaller databases are normally used for operational because you need fast response times. In analytic, the response times aren't normally as critical but they handle quite a bit more data; much of it historic. In a perfect world, if you could do both with the same system, you would. The problem is the cost to do them all in one. Of course, these are gross oversimplifications but it gets the idea across. In addition to the database component, the surrounding data ecosystems are different but they have many commonalities.\n\nData Lake and Lakehouse are both marketing BS. Nothing more. The same is true of \"medalion architecture.\" It is an attemp to make the standard three tier (staging, core, semantic) into to something different by giving it a new coat of paint. Someone noticed that you can store quite a bit of extra \"stuff\" in the staging layer beyond what the database needs. Of course, the marketing folks thought that needed a new name. I think we are at the point now where we just keep adding buzzwords to the names. It's like a technical pin the tail on the donkey. The latest is \"now with more AI!.\" \n\nA data ecosystem is a complicated enough of an endeavor without all the confusion that is being pushed on it purposefully. I haven't even started in on Inmon, Kimball, Stars, Snowflakes, the various normal forms, ETL/ELT, etc. Good luck on your journey.",

Especially when you work with things that are closer to ML, that have testable behaviours that only manifest when working on a huge dataset with specific patterns. This is not an intractable problem, though. You still can factor your code correctly and cover with unit tests as much as you can, and write queries for ongoing data quality monitoring (a good data analyst will be a very important ally in this activity). For more complex stuff, talk to your platform/infra/governance people about having a \"sandbox\" environment - prod data but all the sensitive parts masked. \n\nNobody understands the complexity? That sounds like your org needs more \"less technical\" people like analysts, not less. And yes, you as a DE need to be in touch with them, because they will be able to tell you what to expect of your data.\n\nPeople questioning numbers when they don't match vibes? Honestly that sounds like something a data product manager/owner has to tackle. As an engineer, all you can do is deliver data quality assurance, and point to that. After this it's with the PM/PO to sell the value of the team's work.\n\nVersion control issues? Yes, that happens when an org has a lot of DAs/DSs with more science/business background. I think the will to do git appears after one or two incidents when someone does a breaking change that nobody had a chance to review, or accidentally deletes some script on some server somewhere. If your data team is subsidary to technical leaders in the org chart, I think they're usually sympathetic to the idea, and you can go through them to push git adoption. You can also smooth things along by writing a \"git for dummies\" document for your DS/DA. No need to deep dive into advanced features, just teaching them commit/push/pull and merge requests should be enough. Do make sure your main is protected in all your repos, though.\n\nStuff outside of your control, but you have to fix it? That exists, yes, but I don't think that's unique to DE. Don't backend devs in microservice-oriented companies deal with the same problem?",

Acquire work experience consuming data as an analyst, data scientist, etc. Slowly transition your work to backend/production systems e.g. making changes to ETL code, finding out infrastructure requirements, doing incident response, thinking about data modelling.

But they don’t replace hands-on work. So the best learning path combines both: read to understand the concepts, then build mini-projects to apply them. For example, try building a pipeline that pulls data from a public API, stores it in a cloud bucket or local database, and runs some transformation on a schedule. \n\nWe have a lot of interactive courses, so feel free to check out our site and browse! \n\nAnd finally, don’t get overwhelmed by the tool soup.

Mostly, I was transforming and consolidating data using on prem tools to automate our processes. \n\nAfter that, I took a BI manager role with our data science team (data science was initially part of BI at my company). Spent a year there until a big reorganization occurred. We moved to the cloud, data science became its own thing, a data engineering team got stood up. I initially moved with data science, but it was clear my skills did not mesh well except for the data engineering, but they wanted to move all DE work over to the DE team eventually. I took that opportunity after just over a year in that position. \n\nOn day 1 with the DE team, we were building stop gap solutions. I spent that time getting really good with pyspark. I already had a large background with pandas, so pyspark was very easy to figure out. From there, we had consultants build our long term data platform while the full timers worked on ad hoc requests to keep the business moving and start making a name for our team. During this time, I learned I was really good at programming business logic and transformations. I was not nearly as good at ingestion or tools outside of databricks. \n\nEventually our SAAS integration started, and I was working directly with consultants. I was well out of my depth, but I learned the process pretty quickly, patched some early holes in my technical knowledge, and got rolling. \n\nI learned that I was really good at functional programming, but pretty bad at DevOps and way out of my league in OOP. \n\nNow, I'm working on a project to rebuild our data platform to one easier to maintain, more flexible, and moves data faster. I'm focusing more on architecture, but making sure that these new consultants are training my team and me every step of the way. My manager assigned me as lead for this project. \n\nMy manager wants me to train to become an engineering architect. Whereas I'm a decent engineer with a lot of potential to grow there, I am kinda a natural on all things architectural. So that is how I'm leaning now.",

As with all dev work there's a fair amount of \"it depends\" to be had in any situation, but I can't see where this level of normalization would ever be useful inside a data warehouse.\n\nI think people pursuing this behavior have lost sight of the \"why.\" The Star Schema model was originally created during an age with storage was the scarce resource so it was important never to store duplicate data. Nowadays, storage is so cheap it's practically free so it's compute that we must optimize for. Having to do dozens of `join`s to gain context on every record certainly doesn't support that. \n\nUsually, I practice some form of what you might call \"Star Schema Light\" in the silver layer where I create tables around business entities. So all the 'user' dimensions would be in one table (and it would probably have a companion SCD table), all the 'session' dimensions in another etc. Then these can be  `join`d and de-normalized in gold to expose to BI tools as needed while analysts can still have some flexibility by using the silver tables. \n\nHaving said all that, be careful. Myself and two colleagues were recently fired for suggesting this very thing and pointing out we shouldn't administer Snowflake like one would on-prem Oracle.",

That's how transactional databases are supposed to be. A star schema is a denormalized schema (it breaks the rules of normalization, 3NF).\n\nYour use case doesn't look very \"star schema\" to me as many to many relationships should be rare. Another way to reword this is that the UserTag entity is a fact table. You could add a date / calendar dimension to this fact and this would allow you to see how many users one tag have, which users have which tags... It also depends on how \"fast\" these tags are attributed. Could they be considered an attribute to the fact? It is hard to decide without having a closer look at your use case and the data.\n\nRegarding the surrogate keys. You don't need them on all dimensions. You need them on SCD2 dimensions, and not all dimensions need to be SCD2. You also need SK when combining data from different sources into one single dimension, and they don't have a common key.\n\nRegarding the project... 20 people working on one single star schema, 2 years. That's insane. Do you work in insurance? It sounds like something massively overengineered which goes against the premises of dimensional modeling: easy to query.",

For gov employees, figuring out how to securely condense environments to limit costs (dag bundles, rbac in dagster, you name it), learning to teach others what is data engineering v. Security/infrastructure. Learning to preach data quality over just throwing all your trash into power bi or an analytics tool. Learning rag and llms and what can feed them best (feels a bit like data mining). Possibly data mining (mathematically looking at data and performing tasks such as imputation and quality analysis on numerical variables). Mlops. Helping build agents for llm or buidling semantic layers. Helping find nlp tools for clean data and showing what happens when crap enters the system. Ramming quality reports down managements throat while Cys because theres always that guy. A lot of api work. Documenting and tagging everything. Doing more with way less aided by tools like claude.",

Assuming your whole team is fundamentally competent, the frequent late nights suggest someone is promising too much and/or failing to manage expectations. The bad news is that can happen anywhere. But if it's the norm, then it's probably time to move on and parlay the recognizable name into a better role.\n\nYou can definitely find consulting companies that take quality of work more seriously. I don't know how to vet them besides just talking to people in similar roles. When you do, ask about the sales process, the role of vendor partnerships (this can almost singlehandedly determine your technical focus!), how they go about scoping, how satisfied clients generally seem, etc. If you get engineers to answer those questions, that will shed a lot of light on the kind of environment you might be stepping into (which is tightly linked to the kinds of clients your sales and marketing people are able to reach).\n\n(Edited to add: If those discussions make it sound like that firm is bent on pitching solely AI everything these days...huge red flag. Obviously I'm speaking from my own biases here, but IMHO it's a recipe for perpetual scope change at best, and completely unrealistic expectations at worst. Too many un-serious people selling to other un-serious people who are spending still other un-serious people's money for no clear reason. Naturally, YMMV.)\n\nBy way of background, my data career has been solely in consulting. It's been about 10 years at a couple of relatively small firms (in the 100–200-person range) so I don't know what things are like at much larger ones. I have worked in-house before but in a very a different field. Overall, I'm satisfied with my career path, but it has its drawbacks, especially if technical learning is your *top* priority.\n\nThere have been long periods where my technical skills stagnated. Once I've reached a certain degree of experience with our bread-and-butter projects, most of the work is on the business logic and requirements side, not the technical side, since I've probably done it a dozen times before.\n\nObviously I'm always keeping up with developments from vendors we typically use (and what's new from others to some extent)...but it's not like I'm frequently taking on entirely new kinds of projects. That's not a bad thing in my book! All those less- or non-technical skills are extremely important. What's more, even if selling the same solution repeatedly isn't the most technically exciting, it's one way to keep increasing your effective hourly rate.\n\nGranted, my favorite clients have been smaller ones (like a few hundred staff members or less) who need all kinds of random data things solved. Sometimes that does require unfamiliar technologies, which are often equal parts fun and frustrating at the same time. But those more open-ended projects, where I'm sort of the \"data guy\" on call, are inherently less specialized, and often less lucrative as a result.",

Your pipeline might be written such that it extracts a delta of changes in the input db table and writes them to the output. This is because just copying the whole table every day is too expensive, and the changes are expected to be small, so could instead use a smaller machine. Now what do you do if the processing logic changes?\n\nOf course there are solutions to write a pipeline such that it handles both entire data and deltas, but those solutions always depend on the specifics of the input.

I know the answers to this test are nowhere on line.  I ran a few of these by others in the dept. and they were able to do them in ~30-60 minutes.  I didn't think that was entirely onerous.  It was VERY clear that what was being generated was essentially random and wasn't trying to get free work, just seeing if people had the chops to do what they claimed in the interview.\n\nI suppose someone could feed the whole thing to a GPT model and ask it the questions, but...that's just a hazard these days I suppose.\n\nI agree that people trying to have candidates do full-on business case + pipeline design for free are overreaching and I would never ask that of a candidate.\n\nThere's a lot of the 'fuck you pay me' attitude and that's not wrong per se, but speaking from the hiring side, if you get asked to do a 45 minute task to show you can do it and you reply with 'fuck off', well...that's a choice you can make.

But it works more or less the same as those hackthon coding test, it is also easy to cheat, even the question is a well crafted one, as long as the candidate has a very close friend who is a good developer. (Yes we do see cheating in this kind of coding test, basically, the hundsband help the wife). But for hiring a senoir or even intermediate dev, this is ridiculous. All employed seniors have tons of work to do,  no one will spend more than 4 hours on this kind of test, especially, there will be hours of interveiw coming up potentially. Also we will be careful to not helping the hiring company solving their problem. Thus it is more difficult for us to finish an assignment (I assume you will give serious difficult take home assignment in this scenario) without helping the hiring company to solve their problem. I would say, if you are a junior dev, take it, learn the new knowledge, if you are a intermediate to senior dev, just pass by, don't spend time on it. Meaningless, the one who review you result might be even less experience than you and give a false judgement and decide to not move forward with you.",

        "body": "Hi Guys, Snowflake employee here & just wanted chime in with a bit more info on this topic so you guys are clear what the new feature is and what it is not.\n\nPreviously, we had 2 main methods for Spark users to interact with or leverage Snowflake vectorized engine.\n\n1. Snowpark Dataframes: These were close to PySpark APIs but (not exact).  Initially (2,3 years ago) they were limited in coverage but as of now, do cover most of PySpark functions so if you tried it before, experience is much different now. Because Snowpark was not exactly as PySpark, it did require about 10% code refactoring so some migration effort was necessary. Benefit of Snowpark dataframes was that they were not held back by OSS PySpark Functions so you had access to Snowflake specific ML & AI functions and the newest features. Snowpark Dataframes allowed you to leverage 100% Snowflake Serverless Compute engines for SQL, Python, Java & Scala UDFs.\n2. Snowflake Spark Connector: This was meant to connect existing Spark clusters to Snowflake to read, transform & write data to/from Snowflake. Driver has some optimization where some of the aggr functions could be performed in Snowflake before delivering the data to Spark cluster but the Spark Compute Clusters did bulk of the work where Snowflake was input and/or output for the data.\n\nThe new Apache Spark Connect from Snowpark combines best of both worlds Apache Spark code that developers love & use for Data Engineering & ML and Snowpark which gives access to serverless vectorized engine for SQL, Python, java & Scala jobs.\n\nRecent innovation from Spark Connect from OSS Spark community was the catalyst that Snowflake was waiting for to integrate OSS Spark in to Snowflake ecosystem the right way.\n\nThis means you can now run your existing Spark jobs with 0 code changes on Snowflake compute which comes with many added benefits such as unified security & governance, performance, auditability & simplicity as compute is serverless and requires little to no optimization or maintenance.\n\nHow it works is that the OSS Spark sends the job details to Snowflake, Snowflake generates a new execution plan based on the original details that can run on Snowflake Vectorized Engine (SQL, Python UDFs & etc.) sot he original code remains the same but where & how it executes in back are different.\n\nOur initial focus for Public Preview was majority of the customer use cases that we have seen which are Data Engineering & ML workloads that use SQL, Dataframes & UDFs. We are actively working on collecting feedback and build  support for other new Spark features supported by the OSS Spark Connect project so definitely would love any feedback that you guys have to take to our PMs.\n\nI understand this may not be the right fit for every Spark team. If your team enjoys tweaking Spark params & cluster configs to get every ounce of performance out of clusters then this solution may not be a good fit. However, if the team enjoys Spark code and has a ton of existing pipelines but would rather spend their time building & deploying new projects vs. optimizing & maintaining cluster, it will be a great benefit. Especially if Snowflake is the downstream analytics layer as it would eliminate any Export & Import jobs(time & cost) between Spark & Snowflake environments. \n\nThe main goal is to meet developers where they are by offering ways for them to leverage advances Snowflake capabilities by offering them different means to work with Snowflake in their preferred language and coding frameworks.\n\nIf you guys give it a try and have inputs don't hesitate the reach out and let us know feedback.The good, bad & the ugly.",

It's just that the API is so powerful and sometimes you just need dataframes over SQL and being able to use that in Snowflake without hassle is a plus.\n\nOne thing related that i'm excited for is that it means support for Spark SQL in Snowflake. Snowflake's SQL dialect is very rich and improving all the time (qualify, group by all, union all by name, your new ->> operator...) but one thing that Spark recently introduced is BigQuery's |> sql pipe operator that adds orthogonality and being able to write clauses in the order they are executed and it is just so ergonomic. I'm anxiously awaiting its arrival in Snowflake's SQL dialect as well so if you are still not sure about that one please consider this one customer's voice as a pro :) It takes away a lot of the pain of quickly iterating and explorting with SQL and neatly slots into existing SQL codebases as well... Examples below:\n\n[SQL Gets Easier: Announcing New Pipe Syntax | Databricks Blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/sql-gets-easier-announcing-new-pipe-syntax)\n\nBut nice work on bringing painless Spark to your platform!",

I don't want to spend CPU cycles testing MS SQL Server features that have been in place for decades.\n\nIf you don't mean that kind of dupe, then that starts a valuable but lengthy discussion about what we DO mean by a duplicate; the answer for us varies by table/entity, and is generally too complex for any off-the-shelf tool to handle (that I've seen).\n\nSo in short, for us the only business value is in a much more manual DQ process (manually defining what DQ means, not manually checking it!).

From there you just get better at breaking down these transform functions to make it easier to write unit tests for. You can also write your runtime data validations as functions in the same way and write unit tests for those to make sure they catch bad data.\n\nThis separation of transform code and connecting/reading/writing code makes it easier to abstract and consolidate the latter and write integration tests for those.\n\nSo in your hypothetical “process_data_to_silver.py”, assuming that’s an etl task will likely not need much unit tests of its own. It’s simply importing a dataset processing function, passing it inputs, and then publishing the output.

First came BI developers/ETL engineers, they built warehouses and reports so analysts could do their work. Later, data analysts became more self-serve and focused on interpreting the past. Then data science took off, using that historical data to predict the future.\n\nBoth analysts and scientists quickly ran into the same problem: clean, reliable, well-structured data was hard to come by. That’s when the modern data engineer role emerged, not just to build infra, but to make data usable at scale.\n\nEarly DE work was infra-heavy, but as platforms matured (Databricks, GCP, Azure, Snowflake), more of the plumbing became automated. That doesn’t mean the job is going away, it means the focus shifts. You spend less time reinventing connectors and clusters, more time on things like modeling, scalability, governance, security, cost optimization, and integrating multiple data sources into a coherent system.\n\nThis is also where analytics engineers come in, they work closer to the business, doing a lot of SQL/dbt modeling and BI integration. In small teams, AEs might cover most data needs; in bigger orgs, DEs still handle the scale, complexity, streaming, and compliance side.\n\nIf anything, the “easy” DE tasks are disappearing, which makes deep skills more valuable:\n\n* Real-time pipelines (Kafka, Pub/Sub, Flink)\n* Data contracts, governance, compliance\n* Multi-cloud / cross-platform integration\n* ML data pipelines & feature stores\n* Performance and cost tuning at scale\n\nI wouldn’t say DE is shrinking, it’s just changing shape. The safest way to future-proof yourself is to stay close to both the business context *and* the technical challenges. Platforms will keep automating, but stitching them together, governing them, and making them serve the business well? That’s still human work.",

Not sure how big the team is but it sounds like a lot of stuff to glue together and maintain.\n\nI have quite a bit of experience working with multi-tenant data architecture, and almost always they benefitted significantly from shared larger data warehouses rather than per-customer instance, so I suggest centralizing. Down the line some new usecases will require cross-client insights, some new developments will benefit all the customers at once, and you'll thank yourself.\n\nIn terms of the architecture, it sounds like SQL-only stuff might not fit the bill here. I would suggest:\n- land the data in your dwh somehow\n- run transformations in SQL as much as possible, go with python where needed.\n- stay off of Spark, I don't see any benefit here for you, it is a complicated piece of software that is not even modern at this point.\n\nFor individual pieces, you can either go bit by bit, e.g. one tool for ingestion, another for transformation, orchestration, etc. There are quite a lot of good alternatives, e.g. Fivetran + dbt + airflow. I suggest taking a look at [ingestr](https://github.com/bruin-data/ingestr) for ingestion stuff.\n\n[Bruin CLI](https://github.com/bruin-data/bruin) could also fit the bill here since it is like dbt, but does ingestion, transformation with SQL and Python, orchestration, quality, and governance. It is open-source, you can run it anywhere you'd like.\n\nHit me up if you'd like to chat, sounds like an interesting problem you are tackling. Good luck!",

Adjectives ordering should follow the English grammar rule. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective#Order\n\n- Good: `monthly_amazon_payments`:\n  - a row represents monthly aggregated properties of Amazon payments: revenue sum, unique customers count etc.\n  - processing order: source `payments` table > Amazon only filtering > monthly aggregation\n- Bad: `monthly_payments_amazon` (a row does not represent an Amazon)\n\nIf you need to group tables together so it is more readable for a specific use case, or you need to restrict access, put them in the same schema/database. For example, all the gold tables for the financial analysts go in the schema `finance`.\n\nThis is not a dogma, maybe your context needs to have a specific strongly discriminating qualifier first which could go against the rule 3.

But I wouldn't expect a senior position to provide projects, generally our work is owned by the companies and repositories are private; and we've stopped doing \"presentable\" projects outside of work. \n\nI have multiple friends in various industries looking for work, including a previously staff backend engineer from Instagram and they're all having a hard time. I know that doesn't help but looking for work is soul crushing, and legally it's in the companies best interest to give you zero feedback on why they went with someone else. Also if you don't mind shorter projects (still FTE) but 3-6mo projects don't skip applying for the major cloud vendor PSO companies. At those companies \"YOU\" are the product so they can often be hiring when others aren't. \n\nHope something comes your way soon!",

Developer/Team/Enterprise are all tiers within dbt Cloud, and yes, the semantic layer for PowerBI is Cloud-only. Fusion is a feature within the Cloud product.\n\nHere's the thing though: we were on the Teams plan and everything was fine until we hit 8+ people. Then dbt Sales basically forced us into Enterprise tier. The initial quote? $300/seat/month on a 3-year contract. Even after heavy negotiation we only got it down to $220/seat/month.\n\nFor context, that's $26,400/year for 10 people, which feels pretty steep for what's essentially a task scheduler running on top of open-source dbt.\n\nIf you're just getting started with the engineering side, I'd honestly suggest sticking with dbt Core + your own orchestration (Airflow, GitHub Actions, whatever). The semantic layer is nice, but probably not worth $20-30k/year for a small team. You could build your own metrics layer or look at alternatives for way less.\n\nJust something to keep in mind as your team grows. The jump from Teams to Enterprise pricing is brutal.",

They also are sort of limited in that you can't build a full model with multiple tables, each semantic model is 1:1 with a dbt model, which is one table or view.  If you use an obt data structure then you are good.  If you have a star schema or something like that that you want to represent semantically then it doesn't work.  We wanted to to do a PBI on top of dbt thing too, but ultimately just built a big model in PBI because it did what we needed it to.  There are a few other options out there right now like Cube and Snowflake just released a few options if you use that platform.

They’re powerful tools, but for most of my early projects, SQL could have solved 90% of my problems faster and more cleanly. SQL is easier to debug, easier to optimize, and much more universal across platforms. If I could go back, I’d master SQL-based transformation first before diving deep into dataframe libraries.\n\nThat’s why, instead of jumping straight into Docker/Airflow, I’d start with a SQL-centric transformation tool like dbt (or Bruin, which also lets you run Python and handle ingestion). This will teach you the fundamentals of data modeling and pipeline design without the operational complexity of containers and schedulers. Since you already use Tableau, learning the “one step before the dashboard” will make the whole puzzle click.\n\nAnother big lesson: don’t get lost in technical rabbit holes. The fastest way to grow is to chase the highest-impact business problems, things that save your team time, increase accuracy, or unlock new capabilities. If you focus there, you’ll naturally pick up the right technical skills along the way.\n\nAlso, don’t work in isolation. Get your code reviewed, and review others’ work. You’ll learn more from those reviews than from most courses.\n\nIf I were mapping a path for you, it’d be:\n\n1. Master SQL + data modeling (dbt/Bruin/SQLMesh)\n2. Add Python tasks in the pipeline only when needed\n3. Develop a tool in Streamlit and deploy it for the use of business team\n4. Develop an ML model, and deploy it.\n\nYou’ll hit Docker and Airflow eventually, but starting with modeling skills will make everything else much easier.",

Actually quite nice overview in the automatically generated reports with stats on all your metadata in your profiling. It is annoying that you have log in to a different system to see them, but you can extract the metadata through the API if you want to collect it in your regular data warehouse and do your own reports.\n\nBut it is expensive.

Talking about your example, I would split them up, keeping one change per changeset. Also, createTable and createIndex should not be considered a single operation. It is very common to create indexes sometime after the table is created. e.g.. Create the table, ingest the data, then create the indexes.\n\n2. Again, I would not keep them in the same changeset. Having the CREATE OR REPLACE clause helps make the change idempotent, but the function and the trigger are still two different objects.\n\n3. I believe in this case, you should add a rollback for the trigger.\n\nAgain, as I mentioned earlier, I don't have experience with Liquibase, and I'm aware that following the guidelines strictly can make everything more laborious, so please take it with a grain of salt. I don't think you should be so strict if you are creating the database from scratch, for example. In that case, I would develop changesets to create multiple foreign keys and indexes, for example.

When it comes to the time lost commuting to and from the office, that’s a whole different story. I personally like having a good amount of remote work, but in the first company, even though it’s fully remote, if I wanted to go to the office to meet people, I probably wouldn’t run into anyone from my project or others, based on how they’re organized.\n\nOn the other hand, people close to me always say that even if remote work gives me more free time or time to improve technically, working at a more well-known company and going to the office will help build a stronger resume and make valuable connections, which they see as much more important than being technically skilled but unknown. I partially agree with that statement, but I also think it has its flaws. Interestingly, my former classmates from university tend to believe that, in our early career years, it's more valuable to focus on becoming technically strong for the sake of our long-term future.\n\nI'm pretty lost when it comes to balancing the importance of becoming technically skilled versus working at a well-known company or building valuable connections, even though I don't believe these goals should be mutually exclusive.",

We are about to roll out Debezium event collector on ingestr as well, which could help you consume them from the broker and land on Snowflake.\n\nAnother alternative could be openflow maybe?

There were arguments to be made for separate - the data volume of these use cases is lower than our analytical workloads, and so Azure Functions/Logic Apps could be sufficient. However, then we would need to use a non-Databricks orchestrator, which would be a bit annoying for some of the multi-step operational workflows. Doing it in Databricks meant that all of our data jobs live in one place and are orchestrated through one set of tools, regardless of whether they’re operational or analytical in nature. Databricks Asset Bundles have been great for us in this regard, in terms of allowing us to define our job configurations as code. \n\nOnce we got past that, we came back to the medallion. We landed the operational data in its own schema in our bronze catalog, but rather than moving it to “silver”, we created an operations catalog that serves as the use-case layer for all of these operational pipelines. They’re still sourced from bronze, and in the future, we might source analytical “silver” tables from either the bronze or operational catalogs, but this approach has been working well for us.\n\nWe leverage Databricks secrets (backed by Azure Key Vault) for all of our connection secrets, and give our service principals READ access to the scope in each environment. We have also modularized our code for SFTP/FTP into a helper library so we don’t have to maintain the same logic in each pipeline. We try to stick to asynchronous patterns for our downstream writes (e.g. we drop off a file somewhere and some downstream system picks it up), but if we had to, we could also make a direct API connection and write our data that way. We just haven’t really had to do that for our use cases thus far.",

By passing a few secrets to our helper class, the helper handles the rest and supports both key and credential-based auth. It saves us from having to write the same 30-40 lines of code in each pipeline, since we can instantiate our connection object with a single line of code. Our class also has prebuilt functions for getting/putting a file, checking a hash of a file against a previous version, and a few other operations we have found helpful.",

No need encode star rating or guest count in path; that info is inside the JSON and query engines can read it later. Cheap storage lets you keep whole history for replay.\n\nEach night run a compact job with Spark or any lake engine. It reads yesterday’s tiny files, writes a handful of big Parquet or Delta files, then deletes the fragments. Big files mean faster scans and less metadata load. Create a lake table on top of those compact files and partition by the field you filter most, usually `check_in_date`. Too many partitions slow things instead of helping.\n\nFlatten and enrich data in a second pass, then load it into a serving database like Postgres and put indexes on hotel\\_id, date, guests. The lake stays the single source of truth, the SQL db is only for fast API reads. If something breaks you just replay from the raw JSON folder and rebuild everything. Simple flow, little maintenance, still keep all the data.",

So if I'm at a point that I want to productionize my prototype the codebase is mostly ready. \n\nTwo other points would be metadata. I almost always want to record when the record was fetched, as the time series makes it easier to observe patterns or know when a job wasn't performing correctly so I can disregard it's responses. Like maybe the hotel returns cheaper prices for future reservations on Mondays than on Saturdays. Or if my request was made with an apple device identifier vs a windows one. \n\nLastly performing any updates to data is easier in a DB. Plucking attributes from inside the json to it's own column for filtering/indexing is simple. Or while processing each new batch of data I can perform a ranking to generate an SCD2 type table of differences with lags can help reduce storage over time (ie have a record for each change rather than a record for every request). \n\nI generally never use sqlite anymore and use duckdb as I like it's datatypes more. I mentioned sqlite as I think more people have heard of it.",

These migrations should contain only raw SQL using op.execute() to create roles, grant/revoke privileges, or update access logic. Keep each migration focused on a single, clear purpose (like adding a new role or adjusting privileges for a group). Version control these migrations alongside your schema migrations, but prefix them or organize them in a way that makes their RBAC nature clear (e.g. use filenames like \\`20250724\\_add\\_readonly\\_role.py\\`). This keeps RBAC changes auditable, repeatable, and tied to the same deployment process as schema changes. Good luck.",

I worked as a chef for 10 years and before that in media and now I transitioned to programming.\nOne thing that was worth it from the bootcamp that helped me a lot was the access to mentors. I have been thinking that it is a shame that a lot of people pay so much money just to access to a weekly 30 min call with a mentor (sometimes even less). The material to learn is already online with even well structured tutorials or learning path, but free mentoring options are missing.\n\nI have been planning for quite some time to build a website in which programmers and other professionals can offer free mentoring options for people who are learning or starting. It doesn’t have to be for a long time or long sessions but some guidance or even code review could work. \n\nWould you be open to help me build this project? Would anybody be interested in something like this? Does a similar platform exist? It has to be completely free of charge (kind of like freecodecamp but for mentoring)",

What you do is make a list of tasks. If you can't think of how to solve the task, you split it up again. If you can't solve the individual parts, you split those up again. And again.\n\nYou wanted a way to 'describe it in English', and this is possible. You distill the core of the problem by focusing on what you want to do and the nouns in the problem description. You must first clearly state your problem. For example:\n\n- Problem: \"I want to know how often a word appears in an array of words and write this to the screen.\"\n\nDistill the core:\n- array of words\n- count how often\n- word\n- write to screen\n\nTo do this, I need:\n- An array of words (so I must define this).\n- A way to keep count (so I must define some data structure for this).\n- A way to look at each word in the array. (Thus I need a loop to pass by each word in the array.)\n- A way to decide if I already counted the word before (if yes: increase counter; else add word and set counter to 1)\n- To Write the result to the screen\n\nSimple code (pseudo; language is not important yet):\n```\ndefine array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana]\ndefine keep_count = object\n\nfor every word in array_of_words {\n\tdecide if you counted the word before\n}\n\nprint_result(keep_count)\n```\n\nNow you have the array of words, and a way to keep count. The thing you didn't work out yet was \"decide if you counted a word before\", so that's what you do next:\n\n```\nif word is in keep_count {\n\tincrease counter for word by 1\n} else {\n\tadd word and set counter to 1\n}\n```\n\nSo now you put that solution into the previous block of code:\n\n```\ndefine array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana];\ndefine keep_count = object\n\nfor every word in array_of_words {\n\tif word is in keep_count {\n\t\tincrease counter for word by 1\n\t} else {\n\t\tadd word and set counter to 1\n\t}\n}\n\nprint_result(keep_count)\n```\n\nThen refine it a bit:\n\n```\ndefine array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana];\ndefine keep_count = object\n\nfor every word in array_of_words {\n\tif word is in keep_count {\n\t\tkeep_count for word: increase by 1\n\t} else {\n\t\tkeep_count add word: set to 1\n\t}\n}\n\nprint_result(keep_count)\n```\n\n\nAnd you're done. You've written your program. Now you only need to translate it into the language you are using. A large part of the starting year of a computer science education is actually learning to do this, starting with small things like this and increasing the scope of the problems you're solving. Alongside this you'd learn about often-used data structures and algorithms.\n\nRepeat this again and again for years and years on end and you'll get good at it.\n\nThis is a skill that can be learned, but not in \"Javascript bootcamp\". The above is programming; \"javascript bootcamp\" is writing code in Javascript. That's trivial compared to actually thinking up the solution.\n\nYou always start with a problem, which you'll break down in smaller and smaller parts (where each part can be a function, which is also broken down into smaller parts), and in the end you'll be left with a (very long) list of tasks to do.",

This is all very valuable.\n\n\\> What can I actually *do* with these skills? Is there any career path that values competitive programming? Or should I just start from scratch with web dev like everyone else?\n\nWell, new flash for you. There are essentially no applications out there that are not fundamentally web applications. Today anything that is user facing is either a mobile app, a game, or a webapp. Every other kind of development are essentially in support of application developers. Why do we make operating systems? So that we can make applications to run on them! Why do we make databases? So that we can make applications better. Why do we make AI models? So that we can use them in applications.\n\nSo should you learn webdev. Yes, you absolutely should. Because most applications will be web apps. Now you don't necessarily need to be extremely good at it. Especially if you are going to work in more inner layers of computing. But no one will take you seriously if you don't seem like you can cobble up some application up.\n\nI personally never really do front end work. I hate it. But the easiest way to share what you do is to set it up as a webserver of some kind. I tend to focus on the back end pieces where most of the interesting computation happens.\n\nWhat should you do? Where should you go? I don't know. It depends on what YOU want to do. But it seems to me that you want to solve deeper problems than making a cute applications. And good for you, I hate that shit too. How are you going to get a ob, well, you are going to need to find  company that does this kind of work. You need to figure out what you care about and what you want to do.\n\nThere are plenty of database companies. There is plenty of work in server administration, cloud, and infrastructure. There are plenty of needs in AI, model, development, optimization. There are plenty of jobs in various kind of data mining. We still need compiler people. I had a student hired to write kernel modules. There are a lot of \"systems jobs\".\n\nTo qualify for them, you need good system understanding.

One path is great for your resume and behaviorals and another is great for your technical interview ability. Focus on whatever you need at the moment to get a job. Not getting interviews -> learn in demand skills for a domain. Failing interviews-> learn problem solving.\n\nPeople who say DSA etc are useless completely ignore it’s the foundation of computer science which is all their shitty web app, pc game or ai girlfriend is at its core. Most companies work on proprietary technology at such a scale that no matter what solo project you did the most transferable skill you could bring is your raw compute power.\n\nAnd that raw compute power doesn’t come from going through sheets of questions. Learn to recognize patterns and extract relationships from data. it doesn’t take a 1000 Leetcode or blind 75. You learn by doing and you get better by failing. In fact people who learn problems instead of problem solving can pass interviews by cramming but it quickly becomes time wasted once the short term memory fades. But you probably have a high paying job by then so jokes not on you if you can keep it. \n\nNow companies that aren’t at that level giving out Leetcode style interviews, fuck them.

        "body": ">Is there any career path that values competitive programming?\n\nNo, competitive programming teaches you how to write unreadable and unmaintainable code in a very small context. \n\nCompetitive programmings only benefit is learning how to write algorithms in the most efficient way possible which is great, but when you've got a team of 5-10 other developers working on the same code base, the last thing you want is your code to be difficult and hard to understand. In 90% of the jobs out, saving 10ms of execution time isn't a goal (unless your in trading software for example).\n\nI'd much rather have someone who writes clear, understandable code and help them understand performance than the other way around.\n\n>I don’t even know where to use the problem-solving and coding skills I built up\n\nThe reason why is the problem solving skills you learned are not the problems you face in the real world. You figured out how to write some algorithm in the fastest execution time possible and out in day to day life people are writing integrations to make 2 systems talk to each other, aggregating data from 3 different databases into one export, building API's with infrastructure that scales based on user load.\n\n>Or should I just start from scratch with web dev like everyone else?\n\nYes, its what is in demand and jobs are looking for. You are more than welcome to say \"well i don't want to learn web dev\" and attempt to land jobs on old stacks no ones taking (like winforms) but if you limit yourself to just c/c++ your options become even smaller (game dev, embedded dev...etc) as a new grad.\n\nThere are backend, front end and full stack roles. Look at whats in demand near you but i imagine you'll see more full stack/backend than just dedicated front end roles these days (At least i do in my area).\n\n>Anyone else been through this? How did you figure it out?\n\nIf you enjoy programming and building stuff, you should stick with it and learn a more marketable skill within the domain. Meaning, look at pluralsight, udemy for courses that peak your interest or seek out a mentor in your area or online to help guide you towards a path that will result in a career.",

I don't know the libraries I should use. So, I let the LLM give me ideas and eventually settled on Python as the language.\n\nI've got a 2D array that is supposed to color a cube I'm having the LLM draw. However, it doesn't understand how to associate that 2D array with parts of the cube. It gets it upside down or backwards. I feed it screenshots, and it still can't figure out what's going on. It keeps proclaiming \"this will fix it\" and makes some random changes.\n\nHaving said that, I did get it to work, eventually. If I had to do it on my own, I would probably have never started. It seemed too daunting, that I had to learn too many new things. So, it got me started, and while I was frustrated at times, it got me a lot closer to finishing than I would have done just by myself.\n\nIt's the first coding project I've completed on my own since, well, almost ever.\n\nI think someone who knows NOTHING only builds really small stuff or has it solve homework problems. I can't imagine they get a real app working.\n\nThose who think AI will take over and don't want to learn programming should try it out. It's still far from easy to use, and you'd think it would be easier.",

It’s tempting to dive into a little bit of everything, but in my experience, especially with newer people, they offer more to a team when they come in with some capability in a certain role. You can always learn what you need to about other areas on the job, but if you decide you like front end stuff, dive into it and do it strategically. Maybe ask an AI what front end frameworks are in the highest demand right now… pick one, like react, and learn it well. \n\nThe sooner you can start contributing something to a team, the better. Too often we see juniors in our world who are smart and capable but need too much handholding, so coming in with a real understanding of what you’ll be contributing to and you’ll be shocked at how grateful senior people are to skip the handholding phase.",

For example, if I want to write a function that calculates the cumulative age of all the users of the system, the input is the user list, and the output is a number. Then, I know that number needs to be a sum of each age of each user. So, I need to get user age from user entry. So, I need to compare their birth date with current date.

People often try to use the first to reinforce the second, but that's the wrong order imo. I got stuck in that pit for a long time.\n\nTake stabs at stuff on your own (ie, watch a tutorial, then put it away and try to recall by coding yourself - bonus points for meaningful variation from their example) and I promise you that muscle will grow pretty quickly.\n\nSomething more actionable that helps me a ton is writing out the comments for what needs to happen at each step, THEN flesh it out with code.

If you know HTML and CSS you could skip that part of course and directly start with Javascript. They also have projects you have to do which start with stuff like Rock Paper Scissors and you end with a project at the end of the course where you have to build a full stack Social Network.

That kind of interactive support is something a lot of other platforms don’t offer, especially not at this level of integration.\n\nHowever, the pricing model is a bit of a downside. Like you mentioned, it’s not very transparent upfront. You get into the lessons and then suddenly find out about a subscription. I think they could do better there. And yes, some of the early Python lessons are very basic, which might not be ideal for those with prior experience. But if you push through the first few modules, the content does become more challenging and engaging.\n\nWhat I’d love to see from Codefinity is more intermediate and project-based learning paths especially for things like data analysis, web development with Python, or real-world app building. That would make the platform not just a good starting point but a long-term learning tool too.\n\nFor anyone searching for a Codefinity review, wondering if Codefinity is good for beginners, or looking for online platforms to learn Python, I’d say give it a shot just go in knowing the pros and cons. It’s especially helpful for people who like learning through doing, rather than watching endless tutorial videos.",

I’ve been testing out Codefinity myself, and I think it’s a pretty underrated option for learning to code especially for anyone starting out with Python or just dipping their toes into programming. If you're searching for an honest Codefinity review, here’s my take:\n\n✅ **What I liked**:\n\n* The platform is clean and beginner-friendly. No need to install any software—you can code right in your browser, which saves a ton of setup time.\n* The course structure is well-paced. Lessons are short, interactive, and easy to digest without feeling overwhelming.\n* The built-in AI assistant is a nice touch. It’s not perfect, but when I got stuck or needed something explained in simpler terms, it actually helped me move forward instead of getting discouraged.\n\n🔍 **Things to be aware of**:\n\n* As others have mentioned, the pricing model isn’t super transparent. You’ll probably get into the learning groove and then be hit with a subscription prompt, which can be frustrating.\n* The early lessons might feel *too* simple if you already know the basics. It starts very slow, but it does pick up and get more practical.\n\n🎯 **Why I’m using Codefinity**:\n\nMy goal is to learn Python for data analysis and later move into web development. I’ve tried platforms like Codecademy and Udemy in the past, but Codefinity has been the one that’s helped me stick with a routine. The gamified elements and instant feedback really help with motivation.\n\nOverall, if you're searching for the best platform to learn Python for beginners or wondering is Codefinity worth it, I’d say yes with a few caveats. It’s great for building foundational skills, but you may eventually need to supplement it with more project-based or advanced content from elsewhere.\n\nCurious to hear what others think have you used Codefinity for longer than a few months? Did it help you move into real-world projects or jobs? Are there better alternatives for learning Python step by step?\n\nLet’s make this a helpful thread for anyone researching Codefinity reviews or trying to choose the right coding platform in 2025.",

        "body": "Honestly, there is no such thing as a \"programmer's mindset\". That's a myth and a general excuse for people too lazy to invest the necessary effort, discipline, persistence, diligence, and work to learn.\n\nThere are things that can make learning easier, such as being a logically inclined person, but even that can be improved and learned.\n\nI am a firm believer that most (not all) people can actually learn programming to a certain degree. They won't all be able to reach a professional level, but they can definitely learn it.\n\nAfter all, programming is just creating and translating steps to solve a problem in such a way that the computer can execute these steps.\n\nWe humans solve problems all day long, just we mostly don't even notice it as it is intrinsic. We work in steps every single second of the day, but we don't realize it.\n\nLearning programming is learning to consciously devise steps, to utilize our intrinsic ability to think in steps consciously.\n\nMost new learners focus way too much on the *code*, on the *implementation* in a *programming language*, which is only the last part of the process. Sure, it is absolutely necessary to learn a *programming language*, but after all this is just very limited vocabulary and very simple grammar.\n\nThe real part of programming happens way before the code. It is the process of analyzing, breaking apart problems/tasks and solving them in sequences of discrete steps (again, a skill that we generally are intrinsically good with) that *then* can be *implemented* in any programming language.\n\nHere is also the problem with most tutorials and with many, even high quality courses: they focus too much on the code and too little on the design, on guiding the learner to devise the solutions.\n\nWhen I started out with programming, there were no tutorials. There was no internet. There were barely any knowledgeable people in my (rural) area. It was way back in the first half of the 1980s in the advent of the \"home computers\" (Commodore ViC20, C64, BBC micro, Acorn, Amstrad CPC-464, etc.). All I had was the BASIC (programming language) manual that came with my computer and a lot of curiosity. A bit later, we had some \"programming\" lessons (in double quotes because it was more a joke than anything serious) at school - one lesson per week where 8 people were crammed around 4 Apple II Europlus computers where we initially learnt AppleSoft Basic and later UCSD Pascal. Our teacher made us draw flow charts before we were even allowed anywhere near the computer. This seriously helped. Using a visual representation of the steps to solve our tasks made us think more about the actual steps than about their *implementation* in a programming language.\n\nFlow charts, Nassi-Shneiderman charts, bulleted lists, pseudo-code, all of these help and are somewhat underrepresented in modern computer learning. If people started out learning these for short time, they would learn much easier and much faster as most learners don't fail at the *languages*, but fail on *programming*.\n\nThe above is also the reason Harvard chose to start with *Scratch* for their famous CS50 course. It is a visual programming language (in the style of Nassi-Shneiderman diagrams) that lets the learners focus on the *algorithm* on the *steps* instead of on an actual *programming language* with its keywords and grammar. Yes, Scratch comes across as childish because after all it was designed by the MIT to teach young kids programming, but that is actually the biggest advantage of it. Way too many people dismiss Scratch as childish and useless, yet, had they invested a couple hours with it, they would have seen its value.\n\nWay too many posts here are in the tone of \"I've learnt programming language X, Y, and Z, but still cannot program\". Why? Because they all focused on the wrong thing. They focused on the *implementation*, on the *end product*, on the completed car, instead of focusing on the *design process, the considerations, the decisions* that ultimately *lead* to the *implementations*.\n\nSimilarly, way too many people claim \"they can *read and understand* code, but not *write* it\". Similarly, just because one can *read and understand* novels it doesn't automatically enable them to *write* meaningful, comprehensive, fully developed ones.\n\nThen, we have the \"I've watched X tutorials, read Y books, but cannot program\" people. Yes, sure, you know the theory, but you have never applied your skills in practice. This is like sitting in the desert and watching countless Olympic Splash Diving videos and reading all about it. Unless you get wet and actually do it, everything will just be plain theory and you will fail miserably in practice.\n\nPractice is the key. Even a step further: independent practice. It's not *copying* tutorial code after tutorial code. It's sitting down, thinking about something to program and starting working on it, without tutorials, without AI (don't get me started on that for learners), only with one's own work.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with tutorials for a *certain use case*, e.g. for small, detailed, specific parts where one is unsure, but not for entire projects, e.g. the typical \"how to build X in language Y\" ones. If you need something special, e.g. \"how to work with SQLite tables in Python sqlite3\" or something alike, tutorials, blogs, etc. are perfectly fine.\n\nToo many people fall into *tutorial hell* because they don't dare to just simply start working on their own. They are afraid of not achieving their goals, they are afraid of failure, which is the completely wrong mindset for programming. Failure is an important part of learning. It is *gained experience*. It is equally important to know how not to do something as how to do something.\n\nThen, we have the \"do projects\" people who think that projects need to be huge, complex beasts and that instantly get discouraged by that thought. Again, wrong mentality. Every single program, no matter how small, is a project. One can only grow with their projects. People need to start small and simple and then work their way up to gradually larger and more complex projects.\n\nThen, we have the people who despair because they see the huge amount that is there to learn and only look at the summit, at the vast mountain of learning ahead of them instead of looking at the *path* ahead. One does not climb a mountain by just focusing on the summit. One climbs a mountain by looking at the path ahead and taking one step after the other.\n\nThen, we have the ones who declare \"programming isn't for me\" after investing mere *hours* (couple days/weeks) without much effort. Learning programming takes effort and doesn't come natural.\n\n*Fast tracking* in programming doesn't work (it actually doesn't work in any trained skill). There is no 0 to 100 in no time. Learning anything is a marathon, not a sprint. Slow and steady wins the race.\n\n> Recommend any books, courses, etc. that helped you most.\n\nHere is a knack. The most helpful books have actually fairly little to do with *programming*. They are about the *design*, the steps before the actual programs.\n\nThe typical recommendations for this are:\n\n+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul\n+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas\n+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman\n+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles Petzold\n\nAnd if you're hardcore: \"The Art of Computer Programming\" by Donald Knuth et.al.",

Someone posted a question asking something along the lines of 'What is the most important trait in a programmer?' and the most upvoted answer by a country mile was simply 'Perserverance'. It's euphoric when all the parts of a solution click into place and we get to sit back and watch it fire on all cylinders, but man it's a rough road to get there at times. The ability to stick with it when everythings broken and nothing makes sense is crucial.\n\nThat leads me nicely onto the second one really - embracing and even celebrating failure. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist that has a few podcasts on how learning works, and listening to him explain that it's repeated failure that triggers the learning process really changed my attitude and I wish I'd embraced it sooner. There's a quote along the lines of 'The master has failed more times than the apprentice has even tried', and whilst I probably spread my interests too thinly to master anything in particular, I'm doing my best to fail my way there.",

At the time these words were coined, Fortran and COBOL were the dominant programming languages, and they were extremely barebones compared to the modern versions of those languages. It's hard to fathom just how much we take for granted with modern programming languages today.\n\nIn terms of encapsulation, folks were mostly just proposing what we now think of as modules or classes. Basically, the idea boils down to creating public facing APIs that do not expose their inner variables. I like [this source](https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/1-object-orientation/01-objects/02-encapsulation/) which quotes from some of the originators of OOP-- Dave Parnas and Alan Kay. \n\n> Parnas and his peers pushed for not just hiding the data, but also how the data was manipulated. By hiding these implementation details, they could prevent programmers who were used to the globally accessible variables of early programming languages from looking into our code and using a variable that we might change in the future.\n\nBarbara Liskov is another big name in the OOP world, and [she covers encapsulation in this fantastic paper](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/barbara-liskov/data-abstraction-and-hierarchy.pdf)\n\n> For abstraction to work, implementations must be encapsulated. If an implementation is encapsulated, then no other module can depend on its implementation details. Encapsulation guarantees that modules can be implemented and reimplemented independently; it is related to the principle of “information hiding” advocated by Parnas [15].\n\nThose three formed the basis of all modern OOP concepts. They are the definitive sources. I think much of the confusion comes from the second wave of folks who implemented the popular languages and who each definitely went their own way. Because their languages are so popular, their opinions are almost equally valid despite the fact that they all disagree with each other on minor things.\n\n- Bjarne Stroustrup\n- James Gosling\n- Brad Cox\n- Bertrand Meyer\n\nAs a side note, when discussing design patterns, there are a few definitive sources:\n\n- [Design Patterns](https://www.javier8a.com/itc/bd1/articulo.pdf) by the Gang of Four\n- Pattern Oriented Software Architecture, most notably volumes [one](https://daneshjavaji.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sznikak_jegyzet_pattern-oriented-sa_vol1.pdf) and [two](https://archive.org/details/patternorienteds0000unse_u5t3)\n- [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZoranLi/Books1/master/Patterns%20of%20Enterprise%20Application%20Architecture.pdf)\n\nHowever, most of those were written over twenty years ago, so [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/) is a good resource for putting these concepts into a modern context.",

Others write that encapsulation is about *hiding things* — like, you add `private` where needed and boom, that’s encapsulation. Then there’s the group that says it’s about combining data and methods together. And so on.\n\nAnd N-O-B-O-D-Y ever cites anything to back up their claims. It’s like: *“Well, I said it, so you should believe me.”*\n\nSo in the end, I can go to an interview, and the interviewers can tell me absolute nonsense about OOP — and I can’t even call them out on it, because there’s no monumental work, no axiom, no precise definition from an authority that I can point to and say, **“No, this is the correct one.”**\n\nEveryone just interprets it however they like, which leads to the absurd situation where: if I’m the lead on a project, then *my* definitions are the truth. If you’re the lead, then *your* definitions are the truth.\n\nIt’s hilarious to see this in a field that’s supposedly the pinnacle of precision, rigor, and concrete definitions.",

You probably can't sustain your hobby forever, just doing whatever you want. Think of it like playing video games, sure you can say \"I only want to do what I find fun\" and sit in your room and play games all day. You can also sit in your room and program side projects all day. At some point you have to face reality, and find a way to make money and have some kind of success in your life. This is usually painful - a job you get programming will rarely be the same kind programming you enjoy doing as a hobby. When you get a programming job, your job isn't to make aimless side projects, it's to solve problems for the business using your skillset.\n\nProgramming is a specialized skill and having a degree helps get your foot in the door, and many companies require one. I know it's painful / annoying / stressful / frustrating right now, but that's irrelevant. Dropping your major now would be short sighted and impulsive.\n\nLast thought is your priorities might change laster in life.

With connection from that small company, he just keeps growing. \n\nYou can get a degree related to it, and it does help imo. I got a degree, but I wasn’t doing the best when I was in college. I switched from business to SE and it was gonna take extra year in college. I ended up trying to do as many credits as I could in each semester, absolutely regret it. I almost failed in every class. Didn’t have time to actually study what’s going on. And yeah, it sucked when I graduated and needed to land a job. I ended up doing online tutorial to refresh my memories before I was able to land an SE job. My degree helps a lot on resume, but I think your projects you will be doing matter more. Companies want to see what kind of things you’re capable of doing. I could be wrong. I’ll wait for sr dev or someone to give some more opinions about it.",

It shows you're not giving up, and that's a mindset you must keep if you really want to become a programmer - especially a good one.\n\nIn general, experience > degree. I'm not a CS graduate myself - I actually studied chemistry - but I've still found my dream job writing code. It's absolutely possible.\n\nBecoming a good programmer is so much more than just hitting keys and shipping code. You'll need to accept the endless grind. In the beginning, everything feels exciting and kind of easy. Then reality hits. And honestly? There's barely any course out there that truly teaches you how to think like a developer - the pattern recognition, the problem-solving mindset, the \"sixth sense\" for asking the right questions.\n\nThat said, not studying at all is a bad idea. You don't want to end up without direction or skills that can support you. But studying doesn't have to mean going to university. I'm from Germany, and here many young people start paid trainee/apprenticeship programs for around 3 years to learn a profession. Maybe something like that exists where you are too?\n\nIf university isn't an option for you - especially if it's expensive or forces you into debt for something you're not passionate about - then yeah, don't rush into it. It could become a trap.\n\nGiven your situation, there's no guaranteed path. But if I were you, I'd try to find a mentor - even if it costs money. Good guidance can save you a lot of wasted time and effort.\n\nAlso: besides programming and avoiding university in your city, what else interests you? Maybe you can find some creative crossover - tech isn't just web apps and games. There's a lot of space to combine different passions.\n\nWhatever you decide, don't just think about the next year. Think in decades. It's your life - build something that lasts.",

While this sounds great on paper, it also increases overall complexity as there's more to consider when picking what you need.\n\nThen we have languages with a smaller library with fewer abilities.

No. They could just give you array construction and indexing and leave writing methods like map(), reduce(), join(), forEach(), find(), and so on up to each programmer. And then somebody would write a library that has 50+ methods that do all those things, and everybody would include that library in their code, except that some people would use a different library or no library at all, and you’d be here asking why the language doesn’t just expose all that functionality so that it’s standardized.\n\n> Seems like massive overkill.

Spending an afternoon learning how to use your IDE's debugger will save you hundreds of hours later.\n* Trace the execution path systematically - step through your code in the order it actually runs, not just how you think it should run. Use the debugger's \"step over/into\" functions or add print statements to follow the flow and catch where logic diverges from your expectations.\n* Use 'Rubber duck debugging': explain your code line by line to someone (or a rubber duck). You'll often catch the issue while explaining.\n\nDebugging - like programming - is systematic. Don't approach it like guesswork, but like a detective or scientist: observe the symptoms, form hypotheses, test them one by one, and let the evidence guide you to the root cause.",

You open the hood of the car, and start randomly doing stuff, hoping the problem will go away.\n\nDo you think that's a solid approach to fixing the car? Would a real mechanic do that? No, they would try to figure out what the problem is. Of course, being experienced, they have a series of tests they can do to isolate the problem and the confirm it is the problem, and they have an idea how to solve the problem.\n\nIn a way, you need to do the same. Randomly changing your code is not going to fix it just like randomly doing stuff to a car engine won't fix it. You need to understand your code.\n\nBecause I've taught beginners, I've seen this \"I do random stuff and hope to fix it\" before. Why do beginners try this approach even as they would admit, it won't likely work.\n\nIt's because the code looks daunting. If I say, tell me what each line of code does, one step at a time. Be the computer. Do each step. To a beginner, that seems like crazy slow. It would take forever to do that (even though they wrote the code). Random fixes is a lot quicker. Do something rather than do the right thing which is slow and tedious.\n\nOK, so some steps.\n\n**Determine why you think your program is broken**\n\nI've had students who tell me their program doesn't work. When I press them, and ask \"what's wrong\", they just say it doesn't work.\n\nWhat they really need to say is, \"I think this is wrong because when I put in value X, I get answer Y, when I expect Z\". Those three parts are key. What input (X) did you use? What answer (Y) did you get? And what answer did you expect (Z)? \n\nThis is the first step to debugging. Why do you think it's wrong?\n\n**Try a smaller input**\n\nThe next step is to put in the smallest input that causes the problem. Sometimes, we'd give students some sample inputs that were pretty lengthy. Their code would break, but it was hard for them to figure what was going on because the input was so lengthy, they didn't know what part was causing the problem (imagine the input is an array of numbers).\n\nThe first step is to see if it can handle the smallest input possible (say, an array with one element).\n\n**Test your functions**\n\nA smaller version is to test functions. Determine\n\n* what are the input parameters\n* given certain input values, what are the output values\n\n**Write more small functions**\n\nInstead of writing one big `main()`, break things up into small functions. Then, you can test each function.\n\nWrite a comment for each function and give some sample inputs and expected outputs for that function.\n\n**Test as you go along**\n\nDon't write all the code with no testing, then test after you wrote all that code. This won't help if the code is already written, but can help in future coding.",

Yeah, it might be faster because some parts are already done and just need tweaking, but that works for small scripts since they are simple and easy to track and fix. However, it's impossible for an AI to create a full app exactly as you want because you can't specify all the details.

There are no AI writing apps on demand, you could use something like Copilot, but it won't make a big difference unless you're doing repetitive coding.

I figure that at this point, people will look at the work I've done and what I can do, because I've had a decade to produce things, but perhaps if I hadn't made anything yet, it'd be much more helpful to indicate I had a vague idea of what I was doing at least.\n\nSome members of my family like that I have it for some reason, but personally, if I could go back, I wouldn't bother. I didn't learn anything I wasn't familiar with already from work and personal research, and some aspects of what was taught would actively hinder my job if I tried implementing them as it would slow productivity to a crawl.\n\nI did mine part-time, I can't imagine doing it full-time. If you have already got the ability, and you have some way to show it, I really don't think a degree is going to change things any more than spitting in the ocean. The times I've had bigger offers have all been because they've seen something I've done and liked it, but I've never had anyone stop to mention the lack of degree, or ask about it since I got it.\n\nOf course, I imagine different goals and different locations might change that, from my understanding, large multinationals tend to like degrees, but I'd rather switch to a different career than work for any of them.",

My honest advice for you is to try and calm your anxieties for now and build a good relationship with programming. Go and pick a youtube tutorial Playlist you like, familiarize yourself with compilers/code editors, and just practice the basics like variables and loops. \n\nDon't try and make it into homework or work, just have fun with it, make it low stakes. If you like podcasts or lofi play some in the background while messing with some loops to familiarize yourself with them. Write a loop, change the variables. Add stuff, if it breaks, oh well, start over, delete the whole loop and write it again and start testing new stuff out.

You now have a few months to practice coding and get a feel for if you like it over design/story telling. \n\nAlso don't be afraid to not get into programming and just stick with what you know (design and story telling). I know it sounds cliche, but you'll never be happy doing things to prove your worth to other people. I wasted a lot of time and opportunities in my 20s because I couldn't learn that lesson. Maybe consider pivoting your degree to design (some uni's have game design specific courses) or to something that would better suit storytelling for game development. \n\nMy degree was in IT with a focus in programming and software engineering. To me the hardest thing in my program was understanding the \"thought\" process behind solving problems with code. A great way to practice this for me was actually playing the game Human Resource Machine on Steam. It forces you to \"think\" and \"problem solve\" in a way that is really beneficial to coding. The reason I harpe on this is because to me, my C# and Python classes were pretty similar. The foundation of WHAT you were doing was the same, but the syntax you use to execute it is different.",

I know people can get ROMs from game cartridges by using a special reader that plugs into their PC and lets them insert a cartridge in it and then dump the data from the cartridge (such as [this device](https://www.cartreader.net)).  I haven't really heard about people extracting data and editing the code though, just playing the games with the ROMs..\n\nIn some cases, it sounds like you can save (AKA \"dump\") game cartridge ROMs directly on a console and save them to an SD card.  For instance, for a Nintendo 3DS, I found [this guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide/dumping-titles-and-game-cartridges.html).  For older systems,\n\nTo look at the code though, you could use a disassembler and load the ROM into it - but it would only show you the assembly language instructions; you can't extract the original higher level code (i.e., C) from that.  Reading assembly code and understanding what it's trying to do takes significant effort, as it's about as low-level as you can get.  And if you want to make changes, you'd modify the instructions and re-assemble it (it doesn't get re-compiled like a higher-level language does).",

I don't want to say things aren't bad - they are - but things are **always** bad in one way or another. Tech-related jobs have been in constant flux for at least decades, Your aim should be to make yourself as employable as possible **even as** the world changes around you, which it will continue to do. The best way to do that is to avoid jumping on bandwagons and to learn the solid skills necessary to adapt. You are already doing that with your engineering degree.\n\n>Should I start learning Python just to keep up with everyone?\n\nYou should start learning Python if you're interested in it, and not if you're not. Python is a great tool. But also, not everyone will be a Python dev in the future, and **not** learning Python frees up valuable time for you to do something else. (You can also learn Python later if you want to. What's stopping you picking it up at age 50 if you need to?)\n\n>Any advice or roadmap would mean a lot right now.\n\nMy advice is: everyone's roadmap looks different. Yes, you should work hard - but whether that means \"get a paid job\" or \"aim to get a high grade\" or \"learn Python\" or \"learn French\" or \"brush up on your maths\" or \"do some volunteering\" or \"learn interview skills\" or one of a million other things depends on you. All of those things are good, and different employers will value different skills, and no one person can do them all.\n\nYou also shouldn't forget about the rest of your life - family, friends, relationships, hobbies, rest, eating well, sleeping well, etc. No point in being the most skilled engineer in your company if you burn out at age 30, or have a heart attack at 40, or regret not starting a family at 50, or whatever.\n\nIt's a lot to juggle. You'll drop a few plates here and there. Don't worry about it. It's a marathon, not a sprint.",

I think a good frame of reference is if something can easily be done by genAI (very small and focused scope), it's probably not challenging enough\n\nthere are many smaller details about how you can approach this, but ultimately what you really have to do is commit to a larger project. in my uni program we already had 2 big (for 1 dev to do in a couple of weeks) projects also requiring UML diagrams and MVC code structure in our first course\n\nI'm also always going to recommend beginners to start out with static-typed languages and NOT something like javascript. languages like these both make it harder to understand what the code you're reading (that someone else has done) is doing, and it potentially lets you skip certain fundamental knowledge that is important and helps you orient yourself with programming. if you really do not want to drop css+html+js I think you should just go on with basic fullstack and use something like java or c# for the backend",

Now, it depends greatly on what your project is, but in a typical project there's just a few scenarios where you'd use recursion. The fundamental one is when you're working with a hierarchical data, especially with arbitrary number of levels (so a tree topography basically). This can happen with stuff like tables (where row can have sub-rows) or file system.\n\nI would personally try implementing a flattening function (i.e. turning a list structure where there's a few top level elements to begin with, but each can have some children, of which each can have some children..) and the output should be a flat list of elements (flat list of all parents and all children, of all levels). When you're done you can move on and you'll probably forget about recursion for a long time. Also, keep in mind that most conventional (i.e. not purely functional, like Haskell) languages are not necessarily built to deal with recursion natively, and using recursion can cause stack overflow (due to every call being put on stack, instead of simplified/ignored, like a language natively supporting tail-call recursion would). In short, you generally don't use recursion unless you have a very good reason to, and you usually don't.",

Sometimes you have to write code that doesn't work to point you to the code that does. You get better at your initial stabs as you gain experience. But that is a crucial part of software development - you will often face having to choose from a number of different possible ways to do things, and having more experience helps to whittle down the possibilities. But it takes time to gain the experience, and making mistakes is part of it.\n\nAnd sometimes, the different possibilities don't really favor one over the other. Or which one you choose is dependent on the context more than the specifics of the code itself. There are no simplistic answers.\n\nIn terms of recursion, I rarely use it. There are problems that are naturally recursive, and then there are those you could try to force recursion onto. But it rarely makes sense in the latter case, especially if you run the risk of blowing up your stack when the problem gets too large.\n\nWith recursion, each time you recurse, you get a new context. Every time you make a call into the function, that function has a new \"environment\" that can differ from the caller's one. Recursion really works well when each of those contexts is different, and you need to return to a previous context at some point - and if you weren't using recursion, you'd have to track the state yourself, often as a queue or manual stack.\n\nTraversing a tree, for example, is a good case for recursion, since as you're processing the children, you need to remember where you were, so that you can go back up when you reach a leaf. A recursive solution handles that for you automatically, as exiting the function takes you back to the previous context. The recursive process automatically tracks the different transitions down and back up the tree.\n\nIn the case you have above, though, where you're just building a list, you don't gain much from recursion over iteration, as you don't really have anything to \"remember\" at each step. The context changes, but you're not really *coming back* to anything after that can't be handled by simple variables (no stack necessary).\n\nI'd say: hang in there and keep working through problems. It will get easier, as you'll develop instincts for when to apply different techniques. And the best way to know which techniques to use is by having tried the wrong ones - making mistake. It's part of the process, so don't be afraid of goofing things up. Right now, writing software is your own sandbox. Experiment. Play. See what works and what doesn't. Fortunately, there's no harm in smashing a sand castle design that didn't work out and trying a different one.",

At times you will manage to fit some together and as you connect more pieces it will get easier and easier to find new connections. Focus on the fundamentals and try to have some sort of own project at the side that you can tinker with on your own when you feel like it.\n\nMy own experience - I found it hard when I had gotten my degree to structure and design code. Like you I felt frustrated and a bit lost. We had very briefly talked about the concept of Clean Code during one of the courses without going in-depth at all so I ordered and read the book. I found it to be extremely helpful and taught me structure and a bunch of common patterns and idioms when writing code in a very straightforward and helpful manner.\n\nLastly - if there was something that I wish the school had focused more on to prepare me and my fellow students for the real world, I'd wish we'd gotten more time to work with how online services talk with each other, what protocols do they use, how is information exchanged, request/response etc, as well as how you work with web/appservers etc. It was all very hand waved and the only server we had to setup was a light-weight Firebird local server to host our SQL-dbs.\n\nSo, personal opinion - focus on learning the programming fundamentals, read Clean Code, and check out how apps communicate with each other and get som practice doing that.

The regex related stuff is a fixed pattern for applying multiple replacements to the same string.\n\nBut for the purpose of this discussion important observations are:\n\n* I think `_emojify()` is a better name than `convert()`. Converting *what*?\n* I decided against introducing additional local variables. They don't seem to add anything. In particular, naming a value just to immediately return it doesn't tend to provide much useful information to readers.\n* No comments like \"get input\". Comments are useful for providing information that's not visible in the code. If an `input()` function is called, I can already see that we're obtaining input. The thing that would benefit from a more detailed comment in my version would be the regex stuff, as this is highly non-obvious for people who don't already know this pattern.

What you have to watch out for is\n\n* \"scope\" - the contexts that a name lives in, within a module/function etc., and\n* functions that change values, vs. return values.\n\nIn Python, when you assign a new value to the name \"user\\_input\", that is scoped in this case to the whole function.  In a larger function body, you might have loops etc., and you can negligently change a name that elsewhere you've been assuming represents its original value.  It's OK here, it could be a really bad move in another context.  You know, like old school guys like me will use 'i' for an index counter, and then use it again in another loop inside that, and that of course is not going to work right.\n\nFor the change/return thing ... Somewhat miscategorized as such, because what we have here is a function return.  But from an object method.  The .replace.replace thing Harvard handed you here, you have to decide what you think about that.  It's vaguely familiar as if imported from a \"functional programming\" model, and I think Python programmers commonly get some jollies from doing things like that.  But it's a little less transparent what's going on in an OOP object.method model and I personally don't get the attraction.  I might split that up into separate assignments to user\\_input\\*.  Consider how that would relate to your question - would you want to reuse user\\_input, or have a trail of new identifiers - user\\_input, user\\_input\\_with\\_happy, user\\_input\\_with\\_happy\\_and\\_sad ...?  Again here I'd reuse user\\_input, but in another context the more specific names might be more informative.",

I know plenty of people in the field who did CS and SWE, and similar. It's barely a specialisation really. You will most probably discover that Software Engineering and Cloud Computing undergrad degrees share some kind of \"common first year\" with straight Computer Science degrees and about 10 other \"degree pathways\" at your university, to ensure everyone has the basic knowledge required to move on. After that period, at the beginning of each year, you'll get asked to choose some modules in addition to the core modules totalling the credits for the year. This is the \"specialisation\" aspect. Different degree pathways are just different module choices each subsequent year, which is why many universities allow you to switch between degrees before you get to modules that are only available on certain pathways (essentially change your degree title and pick other modules).\n\nWhether or not you will be ahead or behind your peers depends not solely on your degree pathway, but also on how well the *contents* (what you study) aligns with what you would like to do for work. You don't mention this (even though it should be the biggest factor in your decision) but assuming you want to be a Software Engineer, neither CS nor SWE will give you a large advantage over the other, and the module choices available are likely to be very similar. I've never personally met a Software Engineer with a Cloud Computing degree, but this doesn't mean much, as much of the content is likely to be very relevant.\n\nYou won't save any time, they're the same length. Feel free to skip any work experience years if you're confident in your ability to land a job. Use your best judgement.\n\nNote also that employers rarely care deeply about the exact degree title. \"Computer Science or similar relevant degree\" is common to see on job ads. They do often (not always) care that you get a 2:1/2:2 or above. Nobody regards 3rd well. I'll add from personal experience that I've had certain professional opportunities that were only open to people with 1st at undergrad, a full decade *after* getting the degree. You don't know what the future holds so make the most of it. I'm glad I did and richer for it. If you look at how your university calculates your final classification there's often an alternative formula that counts your first year marks (they award you the best mark using all formulas typically), so don't believe any nonsense like \"first year doesn't count\" etc. It might, depending on specifics.\n\nEdit to add: **A-levels are not 'instead of' a degree.** **No employer is going to pay much attention to your A-levels alone, and having an undergrad degree is preferred but not a hard requirement, to directly answer the title question.** You just need to take the A-levels that meet the requirements for university courses you're looking at. The requirements are listed on their sites. They usually either don't care about specific subjects, or list one subject they require you to have studied at A-level, possibly with grade requirements.",

You’re not nitpicking — you’re trying to build actual understanding, and that takes time. It’s 100% normal to not remember everything or to need to look things up multiple times. Everyone starts that way.\n\nIf you want to level up a bit without getting overwhelmed, here are a few simple tips:\n\n* **Keep a small notes doc** (which you’re already doing — big W)\n* **After each week**, try to build a *tiny* project using what you learned. Doesn’t need to be fancy — even a simple calculator or guessing game helps things stick.\n* **Don’t worry about memorizing syntax.** Focus on *what* each thing does and *why* it’s being used.\n* After a section, try explaining the concept to someone else (or even just to yourself out loud). It’s wild how much it helps.\n\nYou're doing the hardest part right now: showing up consistently. Trust me, this isn’t wasted time — it’s the foundation that makes future stuff way easier to grasp. You're doing great. Just keep going.",

I watch it however many times i need to, I watch other related videos, I look up things i need a little more detail on. Its good cuz, I know the thing that I want to code, isn't exactly the same as whats being taught to me in the video. At the end i've gathered bits and pieces of what I like from each piece of content.\n\nand then, with AI, i describe my understanding of that thing, and i have it just confirm my understanding. this leads to a lot of back and forth with AI because now i'm able to discuss the topic with it, adjust my understanding, correct the AI where it sounds wrong, and by the end of it, even if its not fully fledged out - i have a plan\n\nonce i start coding, i have a stronger sense of the separate pieces of the puzzle that i need to build, and it becomes way easier to connect them all together",

It's a bit of a complex topic, so I'd suggest watching a YouTube video about it, but here's a short explanation:\n\nImagine you have a library of books. You could store those books in a `list`. If you store those books in a list, though, you have to check every single book to see if you have `Harry Potter` in your collection. Instead, you can put those books in a `set`. Books in a set are stored in piles. Each pile contains all the books starting with the same first two letters. So, to check if you have `Harry Potter`, you go directly to the `Ha` section. You don't have to go through the entire library.\n\nNow, let's say you only want one copy of each book, and you are given another copy of `Harry Potter`. You go to the `Ha` section and check for `Harry Potter`, if it is there, you just toss your new copy. If not, you add that copy to the `Ha` section.",

        "body": "The key idea behind sets/maps are that they use the value itself to determine its position in the list. \n\nAs an example, take a string \"Hello world\", which you want to add to the set. We call hash(\"Hello World\") and it returns the hash for that string (lets just say it is number like 66457). Then, we use that hash to determine the index the string belongs in, in the list. An easy way to do this for this example is to use the modulo operator. So say, our set implementation has 10 \"buckets\" (each bucket is an element in the underlying list), we can do 66457 % 10 = 7 so we place the string \"Hello world\" in index 7 of the underlying list(i.e. we place it in bucket 7).\n\nThe core idea here is that we never had to iterate through the list of buckets, we derived the index from the value \"Hello world\" itself. We dont have to look at any index other than index 7 for duplicates because (assuming our hash function is deterministic), \"Hello world\" *always* maps to index 7.\n\nHowever, there is a problem. Say there are 10 buckets, but we input 20 elements. Since there are more elements than there are buckets, its inevitable that some buckets will have multiple elements in them. Because of this, it is actually true that we have to do some iteration to find duplicates. If there are multiple elements in bucket 7, then we have to search the bucket to check if \"Hello world\" already exists. I'm not completely sure datastructure python uses to represent buckets though, if its lists then yeah there would be iteration but technically it could be any data structure.",

Python's hash tables use [open addressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_addressing), so the function needs to try multiple slots until it finds either an empty one or an existing object that's equal to the one being inserted. \n\nSets are fast because on average, this loop will terminate after a small number of iterations, *if* the hash function gives random-looking output *and* the fraction of occupied slots in the table is not too large. In order to make sure that second condition holds, the code calls [`set_table_resize`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/setobject.c#L253-L330) to rebuild the table with a larger number of slots whenever the table gets too full.",

That being said, it's important that he's interested in the topic you choose.  Scheme is a great way to learn about language design and functional programming, but as a beginner I found a course in python to be a great first language.  It's fairly simple and straight forward to learn the basics and it has a depth of features to explore depending on where your interests move as you learn more",

You say you want to avoid scratch, but note that the first week of cs50 is a gentle intro via scratch. Scratch is great for beginners though if he hasn't had any experience.  I've introduced a 10 year old to scratch and it's pretty phenomenal to see them get their head around basic programming concepts and talk about them without necessarily having to take on a text based syntax.  It's excellent preparation for taking on that text based language because you already understand how things work conceptually, learning your first text language is just adapting the concepts you know to new syntax.",

Having a solution to a problem is very different than taking that solution and selling it to enough people to make a living. If you spend an extended period of time grinding on the project, my advice is that you should be doing it because you're motivated to learn, not because you want to make it your job.\n\nI've always learned while passionately building a project that would eventually get thrown away, and I've spent a lot of time convincing myself that these things would pan out, but that's not really how the world works unfortunately.\n\nTLDR: Look for a job, build as much as you can, maybe get hired, see what professional development is like.",

You cannot blindly trust that LLMs generated code is correct, especially if you are planning to deploy your app. Code may contain vulnerabilities (e.g. vulnerable for SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery, etc), all kinds of bugs and missing features. Who know, maybe even real API keys that found their way into the codebase somehow.\n\nThat means, that we should still know fundamentals. Not sure what you meant by low-level stuff, but learning definitely will not hurt. Just make sure to apply your knowledge in practice and build something. That will improve your understanding of the material and help it stick in your memory for longer. Don't be afraid to reinvent the wheel for the sake of deeper understanding. At the same time, try to build something new, useful and challenging to really stress test your skills and \"level up\".\n\nThe difficult thing is to focus on cultivating the right kind of skills and fundamentals. There is just so much to learn and to know. I don't know the answer either, besides the obvious: learn 1-2 programming languages well enough, learn data structures, pick a framework, know network protocols (at least HTTP), maybe OAuth, maybe cybersecurity fundamentals could be useful. Yeah, take this with a grain of salt. I actually started reading \"Structured computer organization\" by Tanenbaum. That maybe useful for low-level and system programming, i guess?\n\nThat said, I would suggest to give these AI tools a try every once in awhile if you haven't done so yet. Just to see what they are capable of.\n\nI shared your hesitation at first. Then, I tried it recently and found it quite useful for generating boilerplate code and writing tests. No agentic stuff, just multi-line autocomplete mode. That way, you still are in control and can immediately review the suggested code snippet, but it saves you a lot a hand-typing.\n\nAs for the AI, I am not gonna be a judge of whether the hype is justified or not. But, people do use these LLM-powered assistants in professional setting, at least to a degree. It's worth to at least keep tabs on from time to time.",

Also, depending on what kind of tools you’re building, you might want to check out Gadget.

But it also has a lot of Perl-like CLI convenience stuff, like built in regexp.\n\nIt has flexible metaprogramming, so you can define little DSLs (domain specific languages) within Ruby.

Really, really slow. Sometimes this is not a problem. Basic UI, testing, etc. is usually ok being slow. However, when I am a financial firm executing trades on the stock market, I cannot afford for my trade to take 10 seconds to execute. I’m looking for microseconds. Not milliseconds, microseconds. This is physically impossible in Python. \n\nSometimes I need good concurrency and good speed. For example, if I am Wikipedia and am regularly serving over 100,000 requests per second (https://grafana.wikimedia.org/), I need a combination of speed, multithreading, and multiprocessing if I want to avoid spending enormous quantities of money on extra servers. Python is incapable of doing this as efficiently as a compiled language like Java. >!Wikipedia actually uses PHP and JavaScript (https://meta.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_servers), Java is just an example.

        "body": "There are a lot of questions in one here, but here's a brief attempt to cover most bases:\n\n* Why not just use Python for everything? Because, even for relatively simple uses, it's inherently pretty slow. It's simple **because** it hides a lot of the detail from you, but that detail is often where optimisation lies. Video games or scientific data analysis tools, for example, are often doing billions of calculations per second; they **need** to be heavily optimised. Python simply doesn't let you.\n* Why could the engineer get away with using Python (apart from the above)? Among other reasons: because he programs a single, small piece of software for one specific device that doesn't need to run anything else. A lot of the difficulty of low-level programming is getting incompatible systems to talk to each other - and you'd be surprised by how many similar-looking systems are incompatible. Does your computer have an x86 processor or an ARM processor? Most people have no clue, but they fundamentally speak two completely different languages. Python's solution to this is to force everything to run inside its interpreter, which solves the problem, but also isn't always what you want, because e.g. you can only run one piece of software inside the interpreter at once. (The home computer I'm writing this on currently has hundreds of processes active all at once.)\n* Are certain programming languages better than others for certain tasks? Yes and no - it depends what \"better\" means. You can achieve more or less anything you want on a computer by programming in C, for example. But if you really need to eke out every last drop of performance, you'll probably have to switch at least part of your code to Assembly. If you prefer to think in an object-oriented way, then programming in C might be very slow for you personally, and you might prefer C++. If you're paranoid about memory safety or whatever, then you might inherently distrust C and become a Rust bro. If your project is simple, and you're not actually worried about performance or portability at all, but it's large, then you might want to pick something simple to code in like Python to minimise developer time. If you want to make use of community-maintained libraries for working with large datasets or whatever, you might find that C doesn't quite do what you want, and writing it yourself from scratch would take months, so you just pick the thing that already exists in R. If you're working on decades-old financial software, then you might find your entire million-line codebase is in COBOL, and while it's technically **possible** to rewrite it in C, a subtle mistake might cost billions of dollars and crash the economy and send the whole country after you with pitchforks, so it's probably wiser just to learn COBOL.",

Very little hand holding but because you have to do so much work, including your own memory & stack memory management, you can write very small and very fast pieces of code.\n\nSQL was designed to work with databases.\n\nPERL was designed to work with text.

We built some template workbooks and a simple importer. This was the perfect solution, as users could see the date and easily track down bad results. \n\nWe moved to larger datasets, and obviously Excel started to struggle, but we also knew the data pretty well, and knew from users what to look for.  \n\nWe switched to a compare written in python with pandas.  This was the perfect solution, we could run multigig csv compares faster than Excel could import one of the CSVs, users knew our process, so we could just send them the reduced outputs, and we could customise the scripts per compare, and still churn through them quickly. \n\n\nThen we moved on to aggregate data. TB to PB of data. We had c++ code written to do in place compares. This was the perfect solution. We didn’t need to do export/import shenanigans any more, the code was pretty static, and we didn’t need to see intermediate data. \n\nEach of these was literally the perfect solution for what appears to be the same task across three iterations. But in each iteration the tool chosen was so much better than the other two approaches it was obvious what to use. Different tools really shine for different tasks. We could have used one tool for all three iterations, any of the three tools we chose. But for the wrong phase each tool would have increased our time and pain levels exponentially.",

Doable, but hard. I also found their first-year CS modules a bit irritating because of how simple they were, really. I love their approach: starting small so you can succeed in your course regardless of your qualifications, but if you have any existing skills in coding, wasting your already limited free time in Scratch can be... frustrating. I ended up using my OU grades to move to a \"brick\" uni full-time, so I could get a maintenance loan and have a part-time job. Served me well. Still, I'd say that OU is better than nothing - why?\n* Degree: Let me phrase it like this - I'm doing an engineering PhD, and my friends in software were surprised that I got any interviews without a degree specifically in CS - and that is with a few projects in my portfolio and a tech part-time job I did during my undergrad. Another thing I'd consider is how much drive you have to go through the \"boring\" but necessary aspects, like algorithms and data structures, without uni forcing you to do so. You can build a portfolio without them, but my rusty knowledge in the area backfired against me in many interviews for junior or even intern positions.\n\nTl;dr: Imo a degree may help you a lot because getting your foot in the door is quite hard. If you manage to get a low-level tech job, this may be a way to go, too, but even this might me a challenge (especially if you don't want to be paid very little).\n\nGood luck!",

        "body": "Hey man, here's my take. That second option you mentioned is actually pretty solid. Getting a low-paid tech job (support, QA, junior dev role) while continuing to self-educate can be way more valuable than sitting in lectures. You're already doing Odin Project which is honestly better than a lot of university curriculums I've seen.\n\nThe UK job market is tough right now but your joinery background actually helps. You understand craftsmanship, attention to detail, problem-solving under pressure. That translates well to coding.\n\nAbout the university route, look, I dropped out of med school to build Metana and honestly don't regret it. But your situation is a bit different since you'd be working hospitality on the side anyway. That sounds exhausting and might actually slow down your learning.\n\nIf you do go the self-taught and job route, focus on building a really strong portfolio. Employers care way more about what you can actually build than where you learned it. Plus you'd be earning instead of going into debt.\n\nOne middle ground option, there are intensive bootcamps that might work better than a 2-year degree. Shorter timeframe, more practical focus, often better job placement support. Might be worth looking into.\n\nEither way, the fact that you're already committed to \"NOT programming is NOT an option\" tells me you'll figure it out. Trust those same instincts that worked with joinery.",

If you’re just building up skills though here are some tradeoffs to consider:\n\n- Web development has kind of forced its way into everything now. Knowing JavaScript is kind of like speaking English: it may not always be the most appropriate language to use but because so many people speak it you can kind of get around anywhere with it. Websites? Desktop apps? Mobile apps? Backend servers? Robots? You name it and there’s probably a way to do it with javascript.\n\n- Web development, however, is all very high level, meaning there are several layers of abstraction between the code you write and what’s actually happening down on your system hardware. A rarer and more valuable skill set these days is knowing how low level systems work, because without that knowledge, you’ll never really be able to understand how to write performant code. It also offers a lot of perspective on why things are the way they are in high level languages, which can be useful from time to time. C++ is still considered pretty high level but since it’s an extension of C there are more low level concepts to there to explore. At the very least it lets you interact directly with the operating system as opposed to JavaScript which runs in its own isolated environment inside your browser.",

(For instance, a lowercase `t` consists of a single outline but would be drawn with two strokes. A capital `H` has one outline and is drawn with three strokes. An `O` has two outlines, and is drawn with only one stroke.)\n\nFor the kanji diagrams you're talking about, somebody had to manually draw each character's strokes in a vector graphics program. This data was released for free by the [KanjiVG project](https://kanji.sljfaq.org/kanjivg.html) and now lots of other websites and apps use it.\n\nA bit of googling turned up [this project](https://github.com/brownvc/decoupled-style-descriptors) for the Latin alphabet. It includes a dataset with letter strokes from a bunch of actual people's handwriting, plus a data-driven algorithm to generate new variants by interpolating between them. You might find it useful as a starting point.\n\nOnce you have the strokes, animating them is fairly straightforward e.g. by varying the SVG `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` properties over time.\n\nP.S. In principle, you could imagine using various computational geometry algorithms to extract the [\"skeleton\"](https://scikit-image.org/docs/0.25.x/auto_examples/edges/plot_skeleton.html) of a letter in a TTF font, and then try to reconstruct a set of strokes from that. But getting something that works reliably and gives good-quality results would likely be a very challenging project, IMO. Certainly much more difficult and time-consuming than just redrawing the letters by hand.",

This feels like a python kinda project, but it also depends on your familiarity. SVG fonts is a bit more of a rabbit hole than I'm gonna dig into right now, but this feels pretty feasible, although you might need to make your own font to get the strokes and directions to what you want.",

You'd then animate the percentage from 0->100%.\n\nYou didn't mention what platform you're on, but on web Snap.svg has the `getSubpath()` method which can perform that operation, and on native, Skia has the `SkTrimPathEffect` API that can do the same. There are likely other libraries out there that have an implementation of a similar API.\n\nIf you're interested in how this works, typically the input Bezier spline is chopped up into a bunch of tiny linear segments, which have very simple closed-form length and interpolation computations. To get the overall length of the spline, sum the length of the tiny linear segments. To get a % length of the spline, grab all the tiny linear segments up to that % of length.",

        "body": "The whole industry has been feeding on its own grift for a while now.\n\nEver tried explaining SCRUM to someone who doesn't work in tech? They'll look at you like you take the short bus to the office.\n\nThe average software engineer now applies to over 400 job postings for every interview. And many of those interviews are what, 6 rounds? No other industry comes close to that. And it's not an imbalance of supply and demand. It's a hiring practices problem.\n\nDon't even get me start on leetcode. Yes, I know it's supposed to weed out the fakers so the company doesn't end up with a bunch of devs who can't code their way out of a paper bag. And yet those same companies still end up developing massive piles of overcomplicated crapware. Almost like the devs aren't the bottleneck. Also, senior devs can spot the fakers a mile away.\n\nAnd now with the vibe coding. I'm seriously considering starting a new service that just fixes the messes people make with their vibe coded apps. I bet I'd make bank by advertising it with a bunch of LinkedIn posts saying how the service will \"take their vibe code to the next level\". Cannot wait for that bubble to burst.\n\nThing is, it wasn't like this even 10 years ago. These are all problems the tech industry has created for itself.\n\nNow for the fun part. To people outside the industry, your skills are like magic. And it's not even the complicated CS stuff.\n\nDo you have any idea how many small businesses out there are paying marketing agencies to do SEO for them, yet they don't even have access to their own traffic data? And the agencies make up excuses because really they're just Wordpress shops that can't get their tracking pixels hooked up to Salesforce correctly so the data is useless and they can't say that part out loud.\n\nThe reason so many people are talking about AI (aside from the grifters and enterprise salespeople) is because they want to be able to do the things you can do. They want their tech to work the way they think it should, yet every time they talk to a dev shop about it they end up talking about nonsense like user stories and sprint timelines.\n\nIt took me way too many years to figure this out. The kicker was when I was working as consultant and somehow ended up on a small side project that was basically setting up a SquareSpace site for a local business. Our sales guy managed to bill it out at $150/hour. For a SquareSpace site. My techie brain thought this was a drastic overcharge because I thought the whole point of SquareSpace was that you didn't have to hire someone to do it for you. But for that local business that sold old muscle car parts, SquareSpace was over their head and it was worth $150/hour to have me do it for them.\n\nEventually I got fed up building the umpteenth enterprise iOS app so I quit working with companies that do anything enterprise-y at all. It's too soul sucking.\n\nAnd you know what? Turns out it's not so hard to sell my skills to non-tech companies. What I think is easy is what they think is magic. That's a win-win.\n\nThey don't buy unit tests (not that I want to write them), but they're game for anything that helps their sales funnel.\n\nMy advice for anyone burning out in the tech industry is this. You probably see your skills and dedication to quality as an investment for a company. They probably see you as a cost center. So next time you get stressed by the nonsense, start thinking about how to apply what you know in ways that would help non-tech companies. Think outside the box. Then do the hard part and reach out to a few of them. You might be surprised at what you learn and end up with a whole new perspective on how all this really works.\n\nIf nothing else, the experience will certainly help you write better Upwork proposals.",

It's asking your interviewer. In my experience, interviewers don't care if you have some dumb syntax memorized, they don't care if you stumble on how to do X in Y language. Those things don't matter on the job, and they don't matter in the interview. It's the problem solving they care about. Usually interviewers make it clear you can ask them syntax questions like that, or other nudges AI-as-a-tool would normally help you with. I've also been in interviews where they're totally fine with you googling, you just have to let them know you're doing that before you do it.\n\nIf it's the latter though, good fucking luck. I don't know about you, but I always dreaded open-book tests/exams in college. Because they were always made difficult enough to *warrant* them being open book.

Including here.  **This sub has learned nothing from history.**\n\nWhen oil prices are high relative to extraction costs for extended periods of time, petroleum engineering ranks SWELL.  When prices sit at commodity levels above extraction costs, petroleum engineering ranks dwindle fast within 2 years.  The median petroleum engineering graduate becomes UNEMPLOYED.\n\nIn the boom times in the 21st century, petroleum engineering grads were walking out of school to 20 offers in the 195k-225k range with a large bonus potential.  They'd go bust their ass many many hours a week out in some rustic environment somewhere.  There was all kinds of \"what should I specialize in\" conversations like should I do wireline, or logging, or MWD, or be reservoir side, or whatever.\n\nAnd then POOF.  Prices fall... extraction costs rise, and that project you were paying the PE 225k to babysit no longer makes money and STOPS.  STOPS.\n\nPetroleum engineering had 2600 +/- BS grads (and don't forget several hundred MS students too) in 2017.  Less than 600 now, and what looks to be about 600 in 2024.  7 years to fall.  Using the broad numbers you posted, this is like the 100,000 CS grads in 2025 becoming 23,000 by 2032.\n\n**Does this REALLY make petroleum engineering look attractive to you?**  A major that's seen 80% drop in enrollment in 7 years because the industry cannot support its graduates?\n\n> With the massive datacenter boom, this is pretty hot right now.\n\nDatacenters employ so few people once built; you can build 100 more of them, and they're still a minor player.  Design of datacenters is mostly electrical, mechanical, and structural engineering, there might be ONE or TWO IE on a major datacenter design project.  Hell there's going to be more architects than IE's.  If you want to WORK in a datacenter, good luck.  If you want to DESIGN datacenters, electrical, mechanical, or structural.  I literally work for a company that does MANY data centers for companies we've all heard of, and I am a chemical engineer.  I LITERALLY WORK HERE, and for $1,000,000 I couldn't get on a data center project.  Mechanical, electrical, structural, and architects, or GTFO.\n\n> These engineering fields: Nuclear, naval...\n\nGAH... horrible.  Do not study nuclear engineering.  You do NOT do what you think you do.  The nuclear side of the nuclear world is a solved issue and even a large new nuke plant requires very few nuclear engineers.  I do firmly feel that there will be a nuclear renaissance in this country as people figure out that nuclear power is safe and can help with a lot of power issues in this countries, I am very excited for this, and actually personally would love to get in on the action given I live close to one of the major SMR players main office.\n\nHOWEVER, in a new nuke plant... the majority of engineering design hours will be spent by mechanical engineers, structural engineers (which come out of civil), electrical engineers.  If you want to work in that industry, THOSE are target paths.",

A really successful small firm could die in a month if they were to lose two contracts back-to-back. For the huge companies, any sign of work slowing will often result in teams being let go. They're usually done silently, but in this case it's likely to be more noteworthy because layoffs and offshoring are popular right now. From a business perspective it's good, because it makes you look efficient. After all, if everyone else is doing it, it's fine, right...\n\nIt's also worth noting that in contracting firms, a LOT of people might be classed as technical/service staff when their job is essentially a PM or AM role, basically tracking work, making sure the client is happy, etc.\n\nFinally, this is my own personal perspective on contracting, but the idea that a contracting firm will have any advancements in AI is utterly laughable. It's not even a skill issue, but one where work will need to be billed to a client, and there's no fucking way that TCS is billing someone for the time taken to mess around with AI issues. Contracting firms often believe that they're at the forefront of technology, but my experience of subcontracting for TCS was arguing with a PM because I had written unit tests and they viewed it as \"unnecessary work we will not pay for\". When I pushed back, their response was \"well, it should work first time\". It's an environment of shortcuts, and while they probably love the idea of AI doing dev work, it'll end in tears without any shadow of a doubt.",

You network so over time, your \"brand\" (you, your work, etc) increases in value.\n\nThen later, when a company wants to fill a role, employees with connections will typically refer people from those connections first. This gives those candidates a significant advantage in the market.\n\nNetworking also builds a repertoire of trust.\n\nIt's much much easier to land remote jobs with a good network, since the gained trust can be converted in to more flexible working conditions (since companies will have an easier time trusting you to get your work done).",

Whatever process we used to use, you can call it Waterfall or something else, GANTT chart based projects… they had a very different progression.\n\nYou’d have long periods in the beginning of a project where you’d read and write documentation, do planning, research, exploratory code. Then things would ramp up, and you’d start getting the real work done. Towards the end of the project, the deadline would loom, and the real problems would start to appear.\n\nYou’d enter “crunch mode”, which truly sucked, deeply sucked horribly. This could go on for a month or two. Eventually you’d launch and settle back into the beginning phase of a new project. This was a HUGE relief. Then you’d do it all over again.\n\nSounds bad? Well enter Agile which aimed to solve these problems, supposedly. How? By turning everything into a constant drip of 2 week sprints. Every sprint is a deadline. It’s all a micro version of the old way, you never get into the massive crunch time (maybe), instead you trade it for a constant, unrelenting stress. It never lets up, not for a second - and you spend your entire career this way.\n\nIt’s far worse.",

Try to find a niche that you can learn more about than anyone else. Is there a part of your job processes that feels like toil, or takes a long time, or nobody seems to fully understand? Spend some time trying to improve that thing. Research alternative tools, try to write documentation (the kind you wish were there for you right now), see if you can reverse engineer it.\n\n\nYou will probably get stuck early on, or feel like you're missing some fundamentals, but that's okay. Ask questions when you can, and keep chipping away at it. Eventually, when you have something that you think is an improvement over what's there (probably won't be all that hard to get to that point to be honest) you can let it be known that you've created a new resource or process, and get some people to review it. Chances are good you'll end up being a go-to person for that thing in the future. You'll have very experienced devs coming to you for help/advice/best practices in that domain.\n\n\nFrom there you'll probably incidentally pick up a lot through the process. You'll recognize things in the codebase as being in some ways similar to the thing you took ownership of. You'll get a request to integrate your thing with some other unfamiliar thing, and then you repeat the process until you understand that thing really well too.\n\n\nBit by bit, you'll start feeling pretty confident. \n\n\nSource: my own experience, feeling like a bad developer for many years and then having my confidence grow as a contributor once I figured out this mindset",

In a lot of organisations, if you don't spend your budget, the budget will be reduced next year, so there is no incentive to save money.\n\nI would never defend anything Elon Musk does, but the fact is he reduced headcount at Twitter by over half, and it's still functioning, it turns out over half the people there didn't really need to be.\n\nI'm not saying this is good or bad, but the fact is most large companies employ far people people that they realistically need.\n\nI think if all companies ran efficiently, or at least tried to, there would probably be 50% unemployment, so it's not like it's necessarily terrible that companies employ more people than they need.",

In many ways I would say it is similar to mainframe. Those industries that still run mainframes really need developers who know what they're doing on mainframe.

They're very passionate about AI and use it in everything they do, yet they're always hitting walls. I think firms on Wall Street are just really excited to lay people off because that prospect is so wildly profitable for them. But I just don't see things getting done correctly up to production and scaled without people that know what they are doing. It's just not happening.\n\nFrankly, I'd like to pick up some talent, so if organizations start laying off their super senior staff that is going to be a boon for me.",

Nobody in history has been able to predict the future of innovation with any kind of accuracy. There are periods of history where there is massive continuous innovation in a given field in a short amount of time and then there are certain  problems that nobody can solve for decades even hundreds of years. The next paradigm shifting innovation in AI could take another 100 years or it could happen in a dorm room at Stanford next month. None of this is predictable.\n\nI think with the AI we have now its clear there is some use cases that are very valuable and the tooling around it will get better. Which should increase productivity.

I'd focus in more on specific roles using specific skillsets, then have templated, tailored resumes for those roles. Right now, your resume seems a little scattershot. As an example of what I mean, in your language skills section you have Java listed first, which tells me you'd be most comfortable in Java, but none of your projects or experience mention Java anywhere, so I don't have much to go off of regarding how skilled you actually are in Java other than current coursework from mthree, which doesn't tell me much.\n\nI was in a similar boat as a new grad, and it took me 10 months to get a job (2 months after graduating). I would have 2-3 resume's with the same or similar information, just re-ordered to fit the job description. Is the job a front-end position using React and TypeScript? You better believe I'm putting that first on the resume. If the job is enterprise Java, then Java, Spring, JUnit are all going to bubble up to the top. Normally I'd suggest having a cover letter too, but it just so happened that all my callbacks came from applications with no cover letter, so your mileage may vary. Last thing I will absolutely recommend is to **bold** the **relevant skills** in your **experience** and **personal projects**. So things like **TypeScript, Tailwind, etc.** should be bolded. HR people don't have a lot of time to sift through applications, so the easier you make it for them to find the technologies they need to see the better. Don't go too crazy with it though. If around 15% of the text in your bullet points are bolded, I'd say that's good.\n\n  \nThat's just the path I took though, there's other ways to go about this. My job hunt was from November 2024 to this month and took about 300 applications sent total , but I got the best results most recently when I was only sending 2-3 applications out per day to places I was 100% sure wanted new grads with little to no experience. I'd also like to know what your application-to-interview ratio is. For me and the people around me, it was normal to get 1 interview for every 50 applications or so. If you're not hitting that (or anywhere close to that I'm guessing) then you might be applying to places too liberally. That's all I've got! Good luck, going that long without a job is rough.\n\n  \nP.S. if your personal projects fall on the gaps in your employment, it might be worth putting the timeframes you worked on the projects. That way it would at least show you're doing something between your internship and mthree, but idk how effective that would be.",

Recruiters with even less technical experience and patience, might glaze over it or hit the reject button when looking for buzzwords. I'd either try to simplify the language or concepts of what you actually delivered or just tailor this section to specific types of jobs (like how in these projects you used Python etc. to deliver).\n\n\\- Probably remove the EE degree in progress as it's not really relevant or use it in your EE-only resume.\n\n\\- The undergrad teaching assistant role sounds like fluff, and no employer really cares about how many assignments you graded etc. you should probably write something along the lines of what you taught and areas of focus you excelled at teaching like red-black trees or something etc. Or try and take a look at other undergraduate TAs on Linkedin or something and see what they wrote. To me, at least it seems very \"I want a TA job.\"\n\nLast point is you probably want to tailor your resume to each of those roles you listed that you're applying for. At best this looks close to an \"EE major that used to be CS looking for an internship/jr role\" to me, but has some mixed signals so you'd want to orient the resume better towards those kinds of jobs if so.",

HR's claim about building HIPAA-compliant enterprise software in a year with two non-developers is either complete fabrication or they bought something off-the-shelf and called it custom development. Either way, they have zero understanding of what they're asking you to do.\n\nThe red flags are everywhere: contract misrepresentation, title bait-and-switch, absent management, conflicting directives, and now performance criticism based on fantasy benchmarks. You've already delivered a 75% efficiency improvement in three months, which proves your competence despite their dysfunction.\n\nA service like Applyre might be helpful for finding actual development roles where technical decisions are made by people who understand technology. This law firm treating you like a code monkey while expecting miracles is not normal.\n\n3 months at a toxic workplace won't hurt your resume, especially in tech where short stints are common. Frame it as \"seeking a role focused on software development rather than mixed responsibilities\" and emphasize the automation project you delivered. Most hiring managers understand that some companies are disasters and respect candidates who recognize bad situations quickly rather than suffering through years of dysfunction.",

It drained me. \n\nIm not saying that the other job isnt worth it, im just saying just because it's eremote doesnt necessarily mean it will be similar expectations. \n\nTbh, if you like this job, Id say ask for a raise. Say you have been offered a place with a 20% raise, give your job the benefit of the doubt too (assumingyou like being there) and say that you prefer to stay but you have to do what's best for you and see if you can come to an agreement. Maybe they give you 25% more or maybe they give you 15% more. Would you stay if they didnt match the 15% but gave you around the same ballpark (10-15%?)?",

If you have more time, learn another skill that you can make a craft or \"retirement job.\" Personally, I trained weightlifting and martial arts and while it's my hobby now, I see myself maybe teaching this when I get older. I also explore digital marketing in the form of blogs, email, social media and video, so I could technically start a business or digital marketing agency or consultant if push comes to shove. Once you're comfortable, try your hand selling something based on your expetise so you have a test business. Your therapist, according to your comment responses is saying \"your feelings are valid\" and I'm reading it as since it's valid, your brain is probably detecing signs that you're going to actually become destitute. There are signs and writing on the wall that's why you're screaming internally and theres something you need to do about it. And I think you need to take it seriosuly. Be around people solving the problem. Be around people in higher positions within your career track. Be around people who are more successful and ask for their advice. Then do something. My suggestions are just examples. As I've had that thought since I entered the marketplace.",

The biggest mistake would be positioning yourself as a career changer when you're actually a seasoned developer expanding your skill set. Your deep understanding of how applications work from the client side gives you a massive advantage in backend development because you understand the full picture of how data flows and what the frontend actually needs. Companies should see you as someone who can build APIs that actually make sense for the consuming applications, not just someone learning Java from scratch.\n\nThe interview struggle you're facing is real and frustrating, but there are ways around the traditional leetcode gauntlet. Target smaller companies and startups where you can often get in front of actual engineering managers who care more about your ability to solve real problems than your ability to reverse a binary tree under pressure. Focus on companies that do practical coding exercises or take-home projects instead of whiteboard sessions. Your strength in systems design and high-level thinking is incredibly valuable, especially for backend roles where understanding architecture matters more than memorizing algorithms. Some companies do hire based on these skills alone, particularly in more senior positions where they expect you to learn the specific technical details on the job.\n\nI actually work on [AI interview helper](http://interviews.chat) to navigate exactly these kinds of tricky interview situations where you need to showcase your transferable skills and handle technical questions that might be outside your current wheelhouse.",

Not \"knows how to write a join\" but solid data base creds. Including dealing with databases from inside languages (APIs)\n- décent SQL proc skills\n\nFor true backend like what I'm doing also add amateur DBA skills, knows how to troubleshoot queries, procs, multiple databases (SQL and noSQL), mainframe maybe... \n\nI work in healthcare administration and insurance and our databases are generally humongous so I'm a little too biased on the last set! I was also a UI UX designer and researcher but after a couple decades of UI work i migrated to backend.",

If you didn’t get the solution you failed the interview.\n\nI dont think it's as binary as you think. For me when I've taken coding interviews, i've gotten jobs at major companies when I dont even get the question entierely right. If im in the ball park and my explanation as to why I got there is correct, i've impressed the interviewer. There's def been times I didnt get the answer but I also realized my mistake or didnt and said \"my next idea would be to do XYZ since this didnt work\". \n\nFor me all 3 are just as important but the more Jr you are the more the coding interview should matter. The more Senior you are the more leadership and system design should matter. Because as a Jr it's important to know how to code and learn system design within the company, as a principal it's more important to know design/leadership over code. Seniors and mid-level need to know more about leadership/system design than Jrs but less than principals. \n\nSo for percentages id say:\n\nJrs - 80% coding, 15% System, 5% leader\n\nMid-level - 65% coding 25% system, 10% leader\n\nSenior - 40% coding 30% system, 30% leader\n\nPrincipal - 20% coding, 40% system, 40% leader\n\nThe higher you go in this career the less you code so for a principal coding shouldnt be important because at that point it's assumed you already know.",

It does help to make your resume look a bit nicer and might get you a slightly higher role and pay off the bat, but to me it's not worth 2 years of missing out on experience to do for an extra 5k-10k in pay you would've just likely had if you started to work. The key really is if you can get a job to pay for your masters degree. So in summary, it's not worth the MSCS unless you get someone to pay it for you or if you can escape paying minimal and not having to get loans. I had my job pay it for me and I grinded for 2 years as a part-time student and only had to pay 5k out of pocket those 2 years. But I also did summer courses as well to finish on time. \n\nAs for your leetcode grind. I am not someone who really thinks you need to \"grind\" leetcode to get a job. You can and might be good at it to land the job, the problem is that many people think they can just grind it and dont care to learn the ins and outs of what they are doing. So they basically are hoping to get a similar question where they can think \"omg that's leetcode question #100 or similar to it, i just need a map\". But they dont care to learn why they need the map, or if there's a slightly different approach they could take. I have been in the job market twice in my career, never had to grind leetcode and I got into two big tech companies (one of them a Mag7 company) by just following a google DSA guide I will link below. It has videos from cracking the coding interview author that explain DSA very well. Also links free leetcode study guides with example questions to practice on. \n\nCompanies dont care if you get the questions right, they only care if you know what you are doing and explain your thought process well in the questions. I got both those jobs and didnt do 100% well on the questions. A few times I got stuck but because I explained my thought process well they liked my approach. They know you wont get it 100% off the bat, they just want to know where your heads at. So for me i like to say \"hey i think I can possibly use a map here because of XYZ possibly a set\" and then I try it. I also go step by step. So usually the first thing I tackle is the return cases. I.e. if I am doing a array traversal the first thing I write is the return case if array is empty. It sounds dumb, but they appreciate when you tackle the small things first that could easily be forgotten. Also it's one of those things of once you start coding your nerves go down even if it's a simple lin. \n\nThen at the end I write test cases and try to go through multiple different cases (empty array, edge cases, etc). If any of them come out wrong, then I quickly refactor.\n\nGoogle DSA link is: [https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/)",

Most tech companies care way more about your ability to solve coding problems and demonstrate practical skills than they do about advanced degrees. A master's degree might open some doors at research-heavy companies or for certain specialized roles, but for the majority of software engineering positions, you're better off investing that time and money into sharpening your interview skills and building a portfolio that shows you can actually code.\n\nThat said, the interview grind is real and can be soul-crushing if you're not strategic about it. Focus on understanding patterns rather than memorizing solutions, and make sure your projects actually solve problems or demonstrate technologies that companies use. The market is tough right now, but candidates who can confidently navigate technical interviews still get offers.

        "body": "So to start, this can vary a lot from person to person, but this may take a fair amount of time to pan out. With today's market, you got to be pretty competitive (4-5 years ago, you had a better chance of \"getting lucky\"). Working full-time is a pain, and even putting just 10 hours a week into transitioning into SWE can be hard. All-in-all, I wouldn't be surprised if it took you over a year to line up your first job.\n\nI will say though, as a self taught dev with no degree, you got some strengths here: You have a CS degree and you've been working a job that will generally look respectable on a resume. I do think you have a pretty healthy shot at transitioning into SWE, but the market is bad and it's pretty rough out there.\n\nI'll assume you have some rough experience with programming (how to reasonably use classes, functions, if statements, for loops), or at the very least, all that will come back to you pretty quickly.\n\nIf you want to get into fullstack, I would start off by focusing on Java / Springboot for backend, JavaScript / React for frontend, and use Git. I would ***probably*** recommend taking a Udemy course (I never personally tried Udemy, but I often hear good things) for both React and Springboot. You can just watch a YouTube tutorial for Git. Try to get to a point where you can work on a project pretty consistently. Just have one project you're pretty committed to.\n\nAfter that, there's interview prep. Go through the roadmap on https://neetcode.io (mainly focus on the video explanations, don't waste a ton of time trying to solve questions yourself at this stage). After the roadmap, do some random questions LeetCode, and try to get to a spot where you have like an 80% chance of solving an unfamiliar medium-level problem in under 60 minutes (if you haven't solved it after 2 hours, just look up the answer and try to think where you went wrong).\n\nMore than anything else though ***talk through the problems***. You wanna be good at \"solving\" problems because sometimes you get \"assessments\" (basically you have to solve a LeetCode problem before getting to interview anybody), but for \"interviews\" you need to be good at talking technical. You should look up \"mock coding interviews\" on YouTube interviews to see what mean here.\n\nYou should start applying before you're 100% confident with anything though (you're never going to be 100% ready to start applying). In fact, I would honestly recommend you just start sending out like 3 applications a week ***right now***. Just half ass it, get it out of the way, and get used to it. Don't waste too much time \"waiting to feel ready\" (I wasted a lot of time on this back in 2021).\n\nFor your resume, skim through the wiki on r/EngineeringResumes. You'll have to adjust a bit though because of your background, but do what you can to leverage your current work experience (be detailed), and mainly try to sell yourself as \"an important team member that holds some key responsibilities and/or accomplishments\". I know that can be really awkward, but again, I think you got quite a respectable role.\n\nAnd finally, as far as applying goes, apply to any role that looks reasonably relevant, doesn't look too \"specialized\", and asks for less than 5 years of experience. Don't be too picky, just focus on playing the numbers game more than anything else.",

Python, SQL (start writing your own soon!), Power BI/Tableau are great tools, and healthcare companies are constantly hiring analysts who can work with lab or patient data. Bonus: you can build portfolio projects using synthetic healthcare datasets to show immediate relevance.\n\nThat said, if you’re more drawn to building things end-to-end, **full-stack with Java + JS** is solid—but it’ll take longer to ramp up, especially if your coding muscles are rusty. One middle path: try backend-focused roles or automation scripting in Python to bridge between the two.\n\nYou don’t need to “catch up” on everything just pick a direction, build 2–3 focused projects, and you’ll have a strong story.

Maybe I'm taking the wrong courses. \n\nBut yeah, I just started learning Java with Spring Boot tonight. Decided to do a common project (Making a Letterboxd \"clone\") , but rather than watch a video tutorial, I'm using chatGPT to learn. At first, it's been giving me a bunch of code snippets to paste and I'm going through with that to learn the process in how to make a project from start to finish with a backend and frontend, but I think moving forward, I'll ask it to give me less code snippets and more just explain concepts and theories with examples without the code directly related to the project I'm working on. \n\nPerhaps I'll try to get the fundamentals down again, maybe make a solid project or two (Nothing too crazy) and then start applying within the next week or two. Thanks for being encouraging about my chances. I'll try to leverage my science/healthcare background and maybe look for more niche roles in the biopharmaceutical industry related to tech/SWE. Obviously, they won't pay as big as tech or finance companies, but I'm just trying to learn and get my foot in the door ASAP to gain more relevant experience. Thanks again for the advice :)",

I dont mind talking to him but I felt it may be best to bring it up to you so to avoid the wrong approach.\" Something like that.\n\nUnfortunately in this career there are always hostile devs. Some you can learn to co-exist with them, others it's impossible. I've worked with 2 guys like that. First guy, was a screamer. His way or the high-way. I was terrified of hij when I first go tthere. Then I had to work with him. Funny thing was, he ended up being the nicest guy. I learned how to work with him basically. I noticed that if I had a difference of opinion I had to back up my words. Most of the time I was still wrong lol, but sometimes I was right and he gave me credit. I think he liked that I did my own investiagation and even had my own points. I wasnt just taking his word as the god given truth. \n\nNow in my second job, I could never figure out the hostile dev. He had no people skills that I could crack. In a lot of ways I compare him to Michael Jordan. He was the guy that knew everything of the project. He produced in his sleep. He didnt mind working 12 hour days. He told managers how to do their job. I fhe didnt like your work ethic, he didnt want to work with you. And I think he realzied early on he didnt like my work ethic (Im more of a9-5 guy). I worked with him on a major project he had created and it went terribly. I kept finding erors and had to change my design like 20 times because each time I came up with a design, another problem would come up. Then he gave my manager a list of his complaints of me. My manager kind of walked on eggshells for him tbh. I will admit some was fair, but others just seemed unfair. The biggest one I remember that I felt was unfair was that my manager said that I have too many commits in my MRs. That happened once and it was because the design changed so much. I fought it but my manager even 6 months later was still using that against me. I ended up getting fired. I dont blame that dev but it defintelty felt like the beginning of the end when I wasnt on his good side.",

Sometimes they are completely clueless people that don’t understand that using a wide audience chat is not how you deal with things.\n\nSo, we’ve fixed this a few ways. \n\nFirst step is to document every single time they call you out on a wide audience chat of any kind. If this person does this to others, probably should document that as well. The more records you have the better. Screenshots are also preferred.\n\nSecond step is to let your manager know that you don’t appreciate being put on blast by this other dev in a company wide chat especially when they you’re not at fault for the issue. Include your record of every time they  call you out specifically and what the actual issue was that had to be resolved. Ask your manager how this should be handled. The wrong answer is “nothing”. We had to do a meeting where all the devs agreed to not individually name people even in our team only chat for issues. Senior Devs can ping people directly and handle it not in a chat.\n\nThird step is if this behavior continues and your management doesn’t do anything, notify HR with your documentation. Make sure you have save this documentation somewhere you have access to in case they retaliate (manager, HR, senior dev).\n\nOn most of my teams, we never had to get past step 2. Only once did we have someone get to step 3 and HR talked to the offending dev and manager. Behavior stopped for a few months and then started up again. In that case, the guy was gone in like 48 hours after he started again because he started blaming people who weren’t on our team or didn’t work on the project with issues.",

When you're employed and job searching unsuccessfully, your mind begins to think \"If I could just do this full time surely I'd line something up quickly and that'll solve all my problems!\"\n\nThe problem is that's not how it works. If you're getting 0 interviews now, job hunting \"full time\" will continue to get you 0 interviews. When you're not even getting *interviews*, that's not a problem you can solve by just buckling down and committing more time to the search.\n\nIf you were struggling with leetcode, or performing well in interviews, that argument would hold more weight. More interview practice means better performance. But you're not even getting the interview. That's not something that'll get better if you \"practice\" 8 hours a day. There's nothing *to* practice.\n\nI'm not invalidating what you're feeling at all, I'm sure it absolutely feels like quickand, and that you're stuck in your career.\n\nBut want to know a worse feeling? Being unemployed, draining your savings, while still having all of those exact same negative feelings. That'll be way worse. Getting into that hole is how a lot of people spiral into a deep career-ending depression.\n\nQuitting your job will not be a magic fix. If anything, it will make your search *harder*. It's always easier to find a job while you're employed with an income. An important consideration a lot of people don't think about is because you have an income you have the power to reject job offers that aren't good fits. Imagine you get another offer for a role *just like* the one you're currently in. Obviously you wouldn't want to accept that, right? That's the whole reason you're job searching, to get away from this kind of role.\n\nWhen you're employed, you just turn down the offer, and you continue the job search. There's no rush.\n\nWhen you're unemployed, you feel an intense pressure to accept *anything* because you need to put food on the table. So you accept a bad offer, and inadvertently end up back at square one.\n\nHold onto this job, and job search on the side. This is how most people change jobs.",

        "body": "You need to learn how to code on a team, and usually the best place to do that is product teams that are PM driven and essentially feature factories. I'm not sure what infra you are working on, but when I took an infra job, I ultimately left because I was frustrated with the shit code we wrote and the lack of any sort of real development work. I did all sorts of stuff with cloudflare tunnels, DNS migrations, and dealt with TLS certs, plus on call. The work I really wanted to do, on the database engine, was just not a priority for us, compared to cloud operations.\n\nI've seen juniors and new grads do well on infra teams, so it's definitely possible, but all things career progression depend on how much you excel in your roll, and the opportunities your org has to promote you. I'd say that's equally true as a junior engineer trying to make senior in 5 years, as it is for a senior trying to make staff and looking for projects with company wide impact, at least under the system of stack ranking that will average on the organization level.\n\nI basically left infra to go back to product, and am trying to make staff now as a team lead. There's no shortage of impactful projects, especially if you can step up and be a leader. I am hesitant to think one domain mints more staff engineers than another, and I'm staring down a company wide rollout of our project for next year, so that hasn't been the case with me.\n\nIn my experience, the biggest factor is just what you want to do. I tried infra, didn't like it, so went back to product. If you like infra, do it, the amount of work is pretty much insane, and when you don't like it, you'll really struggle to outcompete the equally smart people who do. Most of the job is simply showing up everyday, moving the ball, and stepping up when you need to. If you're looking for opportunities, there's no shortage of that in either domain.",

It is ideal if you end up on a platform team that builds products for other engineers, but product engineering can work out poorly for infrastructure in terms of designing systems and making plans that account for reliability, scalability, and anticipating technical debt. Product engineering relies heavily on quick iteration, optics, and easily marketable impact which can be hard to do with infrastructure and legacy systems. You can have a harder time getting promoted and may need to spend more time on painful parts of the job instead of pure coding experience. ",

Be ready to discuss specific projects from your research background in detail, but frame them in terms of business impact or real-world applications. VPs care about ROI and strategic thinking, even from juniors, so connect your technical work to broader outcomes. They might also probe your adaptability since startups move fast and priorities shift quickly compared to academic research environments.\n\nI'm on the team that built [AI interview helper](http://interviews.chat), and it's designed exactly for situations like this where you need to navigate senior-level conversations and think through how to position your experience effectively during high-stakes interviews.",

You actually have a decent amount of leverage here, since you'd be taking a paycut, even at the max salary as u/marsman57 mentioned, and you'd have to move and deal with all the financial and personal burdens associated with that.

Sometimes the skill is also in realizing that they've asked the wrong question and proposing an alternate question with a more useful answer.\n\nUnless you've very recently answered the same question for someone else, or the question is related to the work you were doing moments before the conversation began, being able to give a deep, accurate, off the cuff answer is not expected. Give the best answer you can in the moment, be clear that it's a preliminary answer, tell the person you'll get back to them with a more complete answer soon, and then follow through on that promise as quickly as possible, e.g. via email or chat. (In my position, the real challenge is having time to follow up on question A before I get questions B, C, and D coming in...)\n\nThe other senior engineers you see answering questions off the cuff are either answering about their current work, or giving a rehearsed answer to a common question, or (worst case) bluffing about how complete/correct their answer is. You might occasionally encounter someone with a near photographic memory for technical things, but it's not the norm. I don't expect it from my team, and I don't feel like others expect it from me.",

For example, say you infringe a copyright as a part of your work, and the company gets in trouble for it. Or if you leak sensitive company information and it causes damages to the company.\n\nIt's still a scary clause, and one I don't recall ever seeing. Talk to a lawyer first. Most lawyers would be happy to have a quick consult with you for cheap, some might even do it for free. And I mean a *real* lawyer, not a reddit one.\n\n2 - NDA's aren't unusual. *Especially* for a paranoid startup that's still in the stage where they think everyone's out to get them. You leaking their big beautiful startup idea even a couple years after you quit could cripple the company. At least that's what they're imagining.\n\nOutside of the startup world, and the government-adjacent world, NDA's become less common.",

So I think the answer that I would have here is to think about what you're doing to set yourself apart from others and how you're showcasing this to potential employers.\n\nOther than that, I'd say that software engineering jobs seem harder to come by than usual, even for those with experience, and the first job people find after college in their career field is typically the most difficult job search they have, so finding a job will probably take a while. TBH 100+ job applications really isn't that much and I kind of think you have unrealistic expectations on how long and how much work goes into finding a job as a new grad.\n\n  \nAlso, in addition to the resume advice others are giving you above that you should listen to, your resume also seems to be missing a skills section which generally should be included for a software engineering or other technical role.",

I looked up the university given the non-4.0 grading scale, TCS in India had [big layoffs](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mb7cxe/offshore_services_giant_tcs_is_laying_off_12000/) and that's not a good sign for the industry as a whole. Still, you should at least make it past the initial screening\n\nOne of those companies should have wanted to hire you or offer a second term to come back. It's not a big stretch to think you were just resume boosting and didn't really want to work for them. Better to have 3 internships than 0 by far but you really only needed one.

TikTok looks like the standard ML Engineer new grad job posting -- I'd bet they have a similar one for master's students. I'd expect the first Spotify post to have a de facto MS expectation for a new grad.\n\nI have an unrelated math PhD and no CS degree. 10 years ago, I would have applied to all of these and would likely have struck out on TikTok (no one wanted me in their new grad pipeline) and Spotify research (both because I'm arguably unqualified and because people focused on first-author papers and conference \"quality\" *do not* know how to interpret math CVs). The others probably would depend on which way the wind was blowing that day and the company culture (for example, Google seems willing to talk to anyone plausible).",

I would recommend masters if you are potentially interested in research route otherwise if you want to continue with regular SWE, then your position, salary etc will solely depend on your interview performance and if an undergrad does better than you, they will end up with a better salary. So imo masters won’t be a good bet. \n\nWould highly recommend reading technical books to work on your fundamentals and get them strong and in parallel work on your soft skills (this is a game changer that most engineers don’t focus on and allows one to stand out). Doing this catapulted my career to senior from new grad in under 2 years over other engineers with 3-4x the amount of experience.The books you read will depend on what you want to focus on. For eg, my area of work was distributed systems so the main books I read were around that but the general ones I recommend are the following 2: DDIA, philosophy of software design. Then also diving into design patterns, pragmatic programmer, etc\nBased on what you are curious to learn and specialize in (FE, BE, DE, DS etc) you pick up relevant books there and start diving in. Also you don't have to read books cover to cover (though the previous 2 I mentioned, do read cover to cover) unless they excite you or you think you are learning from them. I usually use books as a frame of reference so when I get stuck I know where to look (tbh AI like ChatGPT has made that much easier now).\nFor soft-skills (the real game changer), I would recommend focusing on good documentation (and I don't mean writing docs that no one reads, but being strategic with it) like writing summary docs to summarize complex discussions, writing well-thought-out design discussion tradeoff analysis docs to promote healthy, structured discussions and building alignment, etc. Speech is equally important - the phrasings used, the tonality used etc can immediately set an authority apart from a noob - this also translates 1:1 into slack threads, and code reviews as well. Small tweaks like that can instantly make someone come off as authoritative and knowledgeable.",

This burnout is the shape of *doing everything right* you learned growing up - how can you abandon it when *everything went right?* \n\nIn a very human way, you somehow both know you are burning out and are also defending against realizing it by distancing yourself from the knowledge of this fact - cognitive dissonance.\n\nYou feel real bad about it and come here thinking we can provide the correct mindset for you to peacefully exist in a state of cognitive dissonance. \n\nThe only way out is to resolve it, not to live with it. That's your choice to make. \n\nYou may be lying to yourself in other ways that promote your coping with unhappiness. If you find yourself asking yourself \"do I feel this way?\" You should perhaps instead ask \"if I felt this way, what do I do? Does that seem right, why or why not?\" \n\nI think the actions you'd suggest for yourself will bypass your thinking self and give you a gut reaction feeling that will tell you tons about what you really want and eliminate some confusion\n\nJust my thoughts and I'd be proud if any of this gives you any value",

You will never finish more work than the incoming one. That's a lost fight, so don't bother.\n\n4. You will get burnt out, no doubt, just a matter of time. You can have a Porsche and love it, but would you still love it if you spent 15 hours a day in it, every day, while you technically had an 8-hour drive? Maybe for a short while, would quickly become a burden.\n\n5. There are plenty of good companies that people enjoy working for, don't overthink it, you are not the only one who is happy with the workplace. People are not after your job, relax.\n\n6. If you establish unrealistic perspective of yourself delivering the amount of work that requires 15 hours of work and pretend you work 8 hours then they'll quickly assume you work fast and you'll be expected to work that fast all the time. Once you finally get tired of it or how other things to do in your life (working 15 hours a day is a really bad idea, means you literally have no life off work), you will be seen as underperforming out of nowhere and you'll have to answer \"some\" questions.\n\n7. Overall if you work for a good company, as you said yourself, the amount of work and team velocity is more or less known and established. If you deliver on time the amount of work you are expected to deliver, you'll be fine and that should be your performance measurement. Working 15 hours a day only means working 7 hours too long and taking 7 hours a day from your life which you will never get back and cannot buy and you will regret it when you get older. You will realize how stupid that was not to use your life, but instead you either got extra money or/and better position. Neither of which are worth it.",

I worked there for 4 years and I know each company and project is different but in general pros and cons are:\n\nPros:\n\n\\- Chill and relaxed. Deadlines aren't a big thing in this industry and most of the time past 5 pm you dont hasve to think about work. THe office is ghost town after like 6pm. \n\n\\- Easy to coast - i knew people who worked 4 hour days and coasted the rest of the day. Some older people would leave after 4-6 hours and charge 8. \n\n\\- Work life balance is amazing. \n\n\\- Good benefits.\n\n\\- 9/80 - you set your own time but you can't work more than 80s hours in a pay period. So what a lot of people like to do is work 9/80s. Basically it's working 8 days of 9 hours (monday-thursday of both weeks), then work an 8 hour day on one friday to get the 2nd friday off. Some companies allow you to put extra hours in a OT bank hours. Since you can't charge OT, you put it in that bank and can use it to leave a bit early on a different week. What most people di dwas use it to save on vacation hours. So theyd work enough to have a week worth of OT hours and then use those hours instead of their PTO when they were on vacation.\n\n\\- Job security - I cant speak now (especially with some of tracking of government jobs) but befroe that, the defense industry was a great place to have job security. Because you needed securty clearance and that's expensive to get. So even in years where the companies didnt do too good, theyd avoid trying to layoff engineers becauset ehy knew once things got back on track theyd need as much as they could get. \n\n\\- The projects are really cool and working with real hardware makes it worthwhile.\n\nCons:\n\n\\- Lack of learning. It's very easy to coast and because of it, unless you really try you wont really learn much and going to a bigger company you may feel behind on how to work in big code systems with huge deadlines. \n\n\\- You can get stuck in maintenance hell. If the company is running out of projects, they may keep you in maintenance in one of their legacy projects. Lack of developing there. \n\n\\- Pay isnt that great compared to other CS industries. It's still better than most careers but dont expect big tech pay and you may need to jump around your first 10 years to get a good check. I made 75k off of college and with a promotion and few raises was at 90k after 4 years. Some of my friends who job-hopped to competitors are making like 120-140k as Senior level engineers. \n\n\\- No RSUs. \n\n\\-",

I think earning the CS degree will help you code projects when you haven't picked up bad habits yet.\n\nAs a beginner, I remember I wanted to test out nulls on objects with try-catch and to recover from the catch to continue execution and not crash. You don't need a 500 line project for that. I also confirmed with the built-in multithreading API that the order of threads finishing wasn't deterministic. I had each one output the sequence number it was created in at start and stop.\n\n>I really hate front end\n\nMe too. Good thing it pays the least.",

Apply more.\n\n***Q2:*** *Is there anything that stands out heavily about me that makes me unemployable? I keep thinking about going to GA Tech for their OMSCS just bc I'm failing at this CS stuff rn.*\n\nYou're not unemployable. OMSCS is a good idea if you can handle it. It's a legit degree that fails people out. But first see about getting employed now. You graduated in May. After 100 to 1000 applications, you might get one offer. How entry level life is. Like taking 3-6 months to get hired is not unreasonable.\n\n***Q3:*** *I really like coding in Python and maintaining apps built in Py, but is Python currently too competitive for me to proceed? Should I focus more on my Java side?*\n\nNo, proceed in both. Python is not fringe but there aren't a whole of jobs that require just Python. Like it's common to script in it alongside C# or Java or to supplement fullstack that wants React or Angular. Python + Java is good for banking. I mean, see the job descriptions for yourself.\n\n***Q4:*** *Should I work on more projects for my resume, or focus on Leetcode?*\n\nAgain, projects are worthless. Fine to learn Java techstack that requires Spring Boot and a database like Postgres using JDBC would be nice. No need to share the code no one will read. Leetcode is a bad use of your time except for applying to FAANG cult that I'm not sure would hire WGU anyway.\n\nRest of world, 495 of the Fortune 500, is practical coding you should have learned at WGU. Like array and string manipulation and building a map to count the number of unique in a paragraph of text after you filter out punction. Half my interviews give me no coding at all. Just talk through techstacks and design. Can study system design.\n\nAgain, you have internships. They trump everything. Apply to more stuff and build up Java techstack to qualify for more positions. Still an uphill battle to get credit for anything you haven't used on the job. Apply to consulting. Especially the WITCH stack for being a US citizen.",

Focus on roles that align with your strengths, and try reaching out directly to engineers or recruiters where possible instead of just mass applying.\n\nStick with Python if you enjoy it your passion will show and brush up Java only if the roles you're targeting demand it. One strong project + Leetcode is a solid combo, so balance both. OMSCS can be worth considering, but only if you're truly excited by it not as a fix for temporary rejection.
