However, the issues you’re citing don’t have much to do with Pandas itself. It seems to be either an issue of your understanding or you’re using it in the wrong place. \n\nOthers have mentioned this but why are you using Pandas to sanitize dict data? There are other tools (like Pydantic mentioned upthread) that help you to sanitize input before it’s converted into a tabular format like a data frame. There are also tools that do the reverse (letting you  query, cleanse and normalize JSON input). I’m not even sure why you’d use Pandas to output JSON data. Why can’t you cleanse your dict using other tools and then use the Python json library to output the JSON? How does having a tabular representation of your data help you in producing JSON output?",

Handling a collision at write time would mean shifting the entire array in memory.\n\nAnd if you are pre-allocating the memory for collisions, even if you account only for one you are basically doubling the size of the table. And if you have another collision beyond the pre-allocation and to avoid array shifting you are storing it in the next available collision slot to leverage linear reading, you are then negating the benefits of the prefetch if you're unable to find a free collision slot in the prefetched data.\n\nIf the implementation falls into any of the above, I can only assume this implementation would only yield any real world benefits exclusively in tables that you almost never write to, which you did mention indeed, but I'm not sure how often you stumble upon such cases and how big these tables tend to be in practice to warrant a higher performance algorithm for joining them.\n\nSuper cool research nonetheless, kudos to you!",

You're correct that this stack is overengineered for *a simple case* of anomaly detection.\n\n>Could you have achieved the same outcome with far fewer dependencies/failure points?\n\nAbsolutely. A very simple, yet very error-prone, stack could be: direct DB writes + Postgres + pg\\_cron/cron + dashboard.\n\n>What could you scale to with a far simpler stack?\n\nThat simple stack can handle tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of events per minute. The real problem is not just the raw throughput, but the architectural fragility. This is tightly coupled and brittle, and has other issues apart from scalability:\n\n* Adding another consumer requires us to change the existing architecture/code\n* DB failure causes data loss and downstream reporting failures\n* Schedulers like pg\\_cron/cron lack automatic retries and timeouts\n\n>Would this stack you have built be required for the typical workloads you'd be working with in a real system?\n\nYes. These patterns are fundamental to high-volume data platforms. I've chosen each component to solve specific problems that emerge with high data volumes, complex workflow orchestration, and advanced processing requirements, though not all of them may be required in every case.\n\nThank you for your feedback.

Take every opportunity to learn. Take online courses and build things. I became a DE by taking a bunch of courses, presenting a business case that transitioning to DE software could save us money, and building it. Now I use it to solve every problem I can to build my skills. I even did the courses on the clock to meet my company's yearly training time goal.\n\nYou mentioned contractors, you may not have a senior employee, but those contractors know more than you. Hire them to do the things you don't know how to do, and then have them teach you. Include it in the SOW as \"knowledge transfer\" or \"support time\". This is literally how I learned a bunch of Azure products. Now the next time that task comes up, you know how to do it, and you don't have to hire the contractor.\n\nLastly, get a project manager. Make the case that you can't be in meetings AND be building stuff, and that having a PM will save you on contractor costs by letting you build more things yourself.\n\nLeverage your company for your personal growth, it's a win-win.",

I'm not paid to be on-call so I'm not on-call.\n\n\\> Does your company/team culture actually support flexible schedules or is it more lip service?\n\nA bit of both. Flexible enough but they would certainly like it if it was more traditional. People got too comfortable with flex schedules during COVID and now they can't go back without like mass firing and hiring new people and my industry is niche enough where that is too much of a headache for them.\n\n\\> How does meeting culture affect your flexibility (lots of standups, stakeholder meetings, etc.)?\n\nI have 4 meetings a week most of the time which is nothing.\n\n\\>**Background context:** I'm considering transitioning into data engineering and schedule flexibility is important to me.

Dagster is asset-native; its primary abstraction is the data asset itself (a table, a model). You define the asset, and Dagster figures out the tasks needed to create it. Airflow is task-native; its primary abstraction is the task (a unit of work). You define the task, and can now declare what assets it produces. This makes Dagster's worldview intrinsically data-centric, while Airflow's is operationally-centric with data-awareness added on.\n2. In Dagster, lineage is automatic. When you define an asset that depends on another, the lineage is instantly captured in a unified graph. In Airflow, you must manually declare lineage by specifying inlets and outlets for each task or using the @asset decorator. This requires extra effort and is prone to being overlooked or misconfigured. 3. Dagster's integration understands your dbt project natively. It automatically ingest your dbt manifest and displays every model, source, and test as a first-class asset in its graph with no extra code. Airflow's integration orchestrates dbt runs. It excels at running the dbt run command as a task within a workflow, but the deep, model-level visibility and lineage is not inherent and requires more setup to achieve. \n\nAirflow will try to somehow catch up to Dagster by narrowing this gap, not just copying the exact way of doing things!",

If Flink was as bad as  in your case suggests no serious company would consider it.\n\nSince you use it for stream processing you very likely partition the input using keyBy(). Make sure that cardinality of the key value is finite as state is kept by key. E.g. if you keyBy eventID which is uuid, job state will grow indefinitely.\nAlternatively setup a timer to cleanup the state manually.\nIf you use FlinkQSL it's rather easy to miss such things as you need to think in terms of unbound streams rather than in terms of db tables.\n\nRegarding rewriting your stream processing job in Go (or any other language). Writing stream processing job is not that difficult. Writing stream processing job that is fault tolerant, can scale beyond single machine, supports SQL to write logic, makes checkpoints, holds state for longer than your Kafka retention period, guarantees exactly-once processing etc etc etc is more of a challenge. Think twice\n\nWhy do you think Flink exists if everyone could just write their stream jobs? But maybe your organization does not have the challanges Flink supposed to address. Then Flink could indeed be an overkill.",

In practice we pick 128 or 256 buckets, write both tables with dynamic partition pruning off, then the shuffle map stage almost disappears and the join drops from 45 min to under 10. Z-ordering helps read performance and filter push-downs, but the join still shuffles because the hash distribution of the customerid won’t line up across files. The only time Z-order beats bucketing here is when the join key also drives most queries with range filters; otherwise it’s a nice-to-have. Pain points: keeping bucket counts in sync across incremental writes, compaction to avoid many small bucket files, and limiting buckets so Spark doesn’t create too many tasks. I’ve moved between Databricks Delta, BigQuery, and DreamFactory as integration layers, and the bucketed join logic is what consistently saved compute. So if the join is always on customerid and the tables are stable, bucketing still wins.",

Seems like Dremio allows users to build folder structures to align data product collections with the business model (e.g. sales folder, finance folder), so a different way of organizing your catalog.  But it's only structuring views and tables, not translating tables, views, relationships and columns into their business equivalent concepts.  \n\nSomething like Cube allows you to copy your data model in such a way that it will dynamically generate SQL based on the user's selected dimensions and metrics.  It governs your metrics and definitions since the user only has to select the metrics and columns they want, not recreate the formulas and joins themselves.  They just drag and drop from a selection of objects that equate to their business concepts.  Not all implementations are equal of course, but this is generally the capabilities I see with most tools calling themselves a \"semantic layer\".\n\nIs Dremio working toward adding that capability as well?  That would be interesting.",

I'd regard quite a lot of time spent doing data pipeline work and visualisation work as a company who is save money by having their analysts do DE work, even though they are primarily analysts and not engineers.\n\n>Am I stretching too much by applying to Data Engineering roles that list cloud experience as requirements?\n\nMaybe.  I'd say this is an opportunity to become more confident in cloud related stuff.  There is a lot of overlap between services so if you understand broadly speaking how cloud works, why cloud would be used, and the popular services you can at the very least feel comfortable in conversations if pressed by a recruiter who usually knows nothing about cloud apart from the words in front of them.\n\nAWS has a free cert which you can take and add to your CV. \n\n>Feeling stuck but unsure how much of this is my own doing/how much control I have over it.\n\nAs always. job hunting is three parts: technical competency, confidence, and likeability.  You can control all three and it just boils to what happens on the day.\n\nLeverage your experience as much as possible because that is by far your greatest strength.  When you have no skills in something, always focus on your passion and motivation to learn the subject you want to progress in (in this case, cloud and modern stack).  Work how your current skills fit into your objectives.  Be honest - \"I'm experienced in some things and will use that as a foundation to work on things I'm not experienced in\" sounds much better than \"I know everything\" and be found out as a lying piece of shit.",

That might sound like a given in all shops on this subreddit. but it's not necessarily the case for us.\n* **Cheaper options**: A simple CRON would already cover our needs, and slapping a lightweight UI (like Kestra or Prefect, even) gives us observability without the footprint.\n* **Business ROI**: Going managed isn’t an easier sell either, because our business won’t see 2x value just because we run on Airflow Cloud (or on-prem).",

Performance of those views might suffer with a lot of scalar UDFs?\n\nI'm not sure how you're calculating your final combined DQ score: I'd be wary of that as it's easy to end up with something a bit meaningless.\n\nI use a different approach where each individual _relevant_ data quality concern gets its own view (one \"rule\"). So a validation of website format would be one view, returning 0 rows if everything is correct. Each problem is one row, then. I would probably use SQL UDFs if I needed to abstract one piece of logic for multiple views, but that doesn't happen really with our data. \n\nThe views all follow a consistent approach with common column names etc, then I have a process that collects and merges records from all views. Because each view is doing just one thing, it's very performant. But the view quantity does rack up. The overall data quality measure is just count of problem rows collected that day, and count of rules with at least one problem.\n\nThere's also metadata in a special magic comment in each view (written using JSON syntax), describing why the rule is important to the business, who is responsible for keeping it empty, and how to go about clearing it. For me, that stuff is essential to maintain somewhere, because it ensures the results are actionable. This metadata is snapshotted daily to a SCD table, so business users can explore the full  \"rulebook\" for data quality independently from current extant problems. \n\nIn time I plan to have PBI send emails to every owner of problems, every day that problems exist, nagging them to fix them. 🙂",

I really like DMS -> Kinesis -> Firehose which will stream data to your snowflake table in real time. This requires some DMS settings adjustments but DM and I’d be happy to send. BUT if you have to restrict your Smowflake account to certain IPs then it’s no good because Firehose uses Amazon’s service range of ips which is like over 100 and they rotate and change constantly.\n\nSo the DMS -> S3 is also solid just read the docs for settings.

Usually they reflect the \"primary way\" a table is accessed. By default it's an id, but significant foreign keys can also be used as index sometimes... What column they use, what are their names, usage statistics etc can all help...\n* Stratigraphy: now that one is mainly for systems with many years of lifetime... As successive generations of devs work on a database, they bring their conventions with them, resulting in \"strata\" of tables showing the different periods of evolution. Having at least a loose idea of how these strata are working can also give clues (if that reminds you of archeology that's normal, I have worked in an adjacent field before data).\n* Ancillary data: data like creation timestamp, creation user, logging related ids etc... Are usually added at the end of the table when creating it the first time. Since columns usually keep their sequential order over the lifetime of the database, you can sometimes use these to assess what was part of the original table DDL statement, and what was added after...\n* Take notes of everything.

Way too many people in a similar position to yourself spend so much time trying to min-max, find the \"best\" or \"most efficient\" approach that they have already wasted a week just thinking about it.  That week becomes a month.\n\nMost efficient method is to start with something and build from there.\n\n>  \nHonestly i dunno its dumb to directly go for DE at my level nonetheless i hope to get your insights\n\nBy all means, take an introductory course into DE.  I myself did a ZTM course and found it enjoyable and useful.  That being said, it's worth mentioning that all courses are exactly what I said - an introduction to the topic.\n\nA lot of people who are self taught, myself included, will always say \"I started with a course and 6 months later I  got my first DE job\".  Whilst true, it neglects the huge gap between finishing the course and getting a job.  For reference, I was actively learning, coding, and applying for jobs for 60+ hours a week after finishing introductory courses doing a mix of watching informational YouTube videos, hands on programming building projects, applying for jobs, working on my CV, calling recruiters trying to help build a profile etc.\n\nThe process for getting a job is much more involved than a lot of people would have you believe because it doesn't sell and it's definitely not sexy.  It's tough, it's arduous, and takes way more energy and time than completing a £20 online course thousands of other people have completed at your own leisure.  \n\nIt's not to say that you can't do it.  In fact it's the opposite - you absolutely can.  Provided you're realistic about the journey ahead.  \n\n>Can this depended on to get hired as an entry-level?\n\nI will say this repeatedly because I still believe it to be true - get the idea of entry level out of your head.  Just go for mid.  The junior market has pretty much never existed in DE even during the DE boom about 4 years ago.  The mid market, in my opinion, has always been the strongest and the bands are so wide they have absorbed the junior market.  Completely benefits the companies who can advertise for a mid level position, get mid-senior level DEs on a borderline junior salary since the bands are so obfuscated.  One of the genuine drawbacks of the field.\n\nForget junior level positions.  Aim for mid level positions.  Be technically strong and well read, but not necessarily experienced.  Be good at communicating.  Practice being a mix of honest about what you don't know as well as curious to learn new things.  If you take the advice that some people have to lying in order to get a job, then forever live in your own head feeling insecure.",

Pick a public dataset, push raw files into an S3 bucket, orchestrate ingestion with Airflow, transform with dbt, land in a warehouse like BigQuery or Snowflake, and surface a simple dashboard. DataTalks DE Zoomcamp walks you through that for free; Zero-to-Mastery covers similar ground but spends more time on theory, so combine it with hands-on practice or you will feel lost in interviews. I tried Airbyte and Meltano for quick ELT demos, but DreamFactory was the tool I kept because it instantly exposed my Postgres tables as secure APIs without extra code. Document everything in a GitHub repo, add a CI pipeline that reruns daily, and mention the link on your resume; recruiters love evidence over certificates. Spend six focused weeks building and documenting a real pipeline and you will stand out more than any bootcamp badge.",

Look at cloud data engineering certifications (any of aws, Google, azure) or ISV certifications like Databricks, Snowflake. \n\nThey are also helpful during shortlisting when HR may use keywords.\n\nI also suggest maintaining a log of your learnings - either as a public blog or as a personal journal.

They have a lot of short-term (6 months to 1 year) missions with TJMs between 500 and 750€ (in top tier companies).  \nI know for sure that they work with TotalEnergies and, despite the fact that they look, most of the times, for experience with geosismic data, during the interview this is often seen as secondary. What comes out is that the experience with moving data from one sink to another is much more important (and also a little bit of PM).  \n  \nIf I were you, I would also add Streaming to the portfolio and that will be it. Experience with near-real time analytics is quite rare and very in demand in big companies (mainly for IoT applications). Once you have done your first mission, you will be aware of the \"rouages\" and more capable of correcting the \"cap\".\n\nA+",

If I'm correct, is your idea to learn the technical skills on my own in terms of how to use languages like SQL/Python and focus my degree into deeper subject matter like the mathematical appliances inside the role? My first impression going into the field was to have a degree as it would verify my technical abilities more than certifications. I do know that this is where projects and a portfolio would be handy to showcase my abilities. But I was also under the assumption that getting my degree in data science/engineering would just give me an upper hand as well with the alumni connections I would make while studying in the program. \n\nAgain, thank you for taking the time to reply!",

SQL \"order of execution\" is very important and critical to learn because in the background, SQL is executed in a completely different way than it is written in the frontend. Knowing that will also help to write efficient SQL queries. ",

When using `:memory:`, you won't have any persistence.\n\nDuckDB by itself, even outside of dagster, handles its own multiprocessing. As far as I know, it doesn't allow sharing blocks of C-reserved memory space across multiple python processes. I also don't see why it should, that model doesn't make much sense.\n\nTo bypass this somewhat, maybe it can work to set your executor to in_process_executor, and force dagster to execute your run in a single process. If setup/teardown of the resource only happens once per run, then maybe you get lucky and it stays available.\n\nMultiprocessing in the DuckDB steps will still be available because DuckDB itself will spin up processes. You just won't be parallelizing your DAG steps.\n\nIf you're trying to parallelize both your DAG steps and your processing steps to the same data (without being willing to persist your data to disk), use an out-of-process DB instead of DuckDB.

Writing to rows to a database through an open connection is also quick. Creating databases is slow. Restructure your script to do things this way and performance should increase by orders of magnitude. Then - if you're still not happy with performance - you can look into parallelizing reads and writes. May well not be necessary though.

NER or a vision LLM should get you the entity spans that you can use to determine which blocks you need to redact.  Some vision APIs will just give you the blocks too, but at a higher cost + additional requirements for HIPAA in cloud services.\n\nDepending on how your data is structured, you may want to find the convex hull of the blocks.  This can cause issues if an entity span is across multiple lines in unstructured text so you’ll want to account for that.  You can do a quick check of sum(block areas) / (convex hull area) and default to block-wise masking if below a threshold.\n\nThen pad the blocks / convex hull and apply a mask to that region.  You will also probably want to export the final image in a raster format so the mask can’t be undone.\n\nSome helpful algorithms for this problem include:\n* Longest Common Subsequence\n* Levenshtein Distance\n* Convex Hull algorithms - though it’s trivial if all blocks are parallel rectangles",

In lean times, keeping your job is the reward.\n\nIf you want to make even more money in bad times, your relatively accessible options are: holding your company hostage (e.g. the only person who can do X, which is mission-critical), changing company, taking a role with way more responsibilities for far less pay than the person they just fired who was doing that job, doing something else on the side, or finding a way to profit from things getting worse. \n\n> Everyone seems to be hanging and doing nothing.\n\nThat's because everyone else has figured this out already, probably because this is not their first downturn. They are investing in other, more promising areas, or just waiting it out. \n\n> Is this a cultural thing here in NL? Or a moment in IT field?

For what you're talking about, the app side of it is pretty straightforward (conceptually). It just needs to be able to check for flood alerts and deliver those alerts to users based on their location data.\n\nThe very hard and expensive part is all the infrastructure you need to track and collect that data. You refer to that as the \"other half\" of the problem but it's probably more like 99% of the problem. Ideally the Malysian weather service would provide flood alert warnings, like the [NWS does](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) (used to do?) in the US. I can't read the website for the [Malaysian weather service](https://www.met.gov.my/), but you should start there to see what information they currently track and provide to the public. It could be that they have an API similar to the NWS that provides alerts.\n\nAll that being said, I was a little curious why an app like you describe doesn't exist yet. And it does look like there are already [apps and warning systems in place](https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2024/10/07/dont-panic-all-the-steps-apps-numbers-you-need-for-malaysias-flood-season/152650). Are you sure that this an issue that needs a new app to solve it? Maybe it's just an issue of people not being aware of their options. You might be able to accomplish more by helping people download and learn to use existing apps and resources.\n\nETA: removed overuses of \"already\"",

        "body": "So, how serious are you in working in this?\n\nFor near real-time river water level (around 15 to 30 minutes delay), you can get information from https://publicinfobanjir.water.gov.my/. Which also has rainfall data. So you don't actually need to develop a device and place it your self. \n\nIf you explore the website above:\n\n* Water level information, such as normal, warning, danger, caution.\n* There are links to some states sensor telemetry website.\n* State specific infobanjir. With more detailed information, such as camera feed.\n* Link to [https://nawabs.water.gov.my](https://nawabs.water.gov.my), where some data is open to public, but some data needs login.\n\nThese are public domain governmental data. There are more public data under various subdomains under [water.gov.my](http://water.gov.my), but it's not really surfaced out to public.\n\nYou can get some MetMalaysia forecast data freely through https://api.met.gov.my/.\n\nYou can use this data, especially the water level, show alerts in you app (or notification) when it passed the warning level.\n\nAs for your technical question, you actually will need more of backend + frontend. Backend means a server getting all these data from the various public sources and processing them. Frontend means your mobile app + website. Your website and mobile app will show the data from your backend.\n\nI'm saying backend, because you may need aggregate the data first, then process them into the form your frontend can use. \n\nYou may skip the backend, and do everything in your mobile app, but there's no guarantee that the format and access of the data would not change. Not to mention, you mobile code will be so bloated.\n\nAs for your question of native or cross-platform. If you need advanced platform specific functions, you will need native. If you don't, cross platform is fine. Do note that simple device function such as camera, GPS, storage are considered basic, and easily supported in most cross-platform framework. Anyway, example of cross-platform framework are Flutter, KMP, and React-Native. Of which, I'm familiar with Flutter, and would recommend Flutter.\n\nSo, you want to make publish an iOS app? This is a hard requirement from Apple, you will need a MacOS hardware to produce the installer file. You can either rent a MacOS during the app compilation or get one yourself. You would also need 99 USD per year. \n\nFor flood detection, you need to monitor water level and rainfall predominantly. If you want flood detection in wast coast, you will need to monitor wind field as well. \n\nThis is possible. How long it would take, depends on your complexity. Simple app that get data from JPS and MetMalaysia API and show them in your app, probably 3 months. Not including getting the developer account, the Google/Apple process. You want flood detection, you will need a backend to process all this data, and for machine-learning forecast on your own. It will take probably a year?\n\nHere's are some other nation example. [https://signature.bmkg.go.id/](https://signature.bmkg.go.id/) (seems to be offline right now). https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/flood.\n\nI do know several private companies that is working with government on a current project that address most of your concerns, as well as to match the service provided by the example above. To extremely summarise it, it monitors rainfall, produce instantaneous flood map (through ML and pre-forecasted based on rainfall condition), and more importantly the impacts. So you can see which road/bridge will be flooded, and how deep the flood it is. At a 1 km x 1 km resolution. Most of these information should be public domain once the system has been deployed, with certain information available only to government departments.\n\nAnyway. You will need basic Computer Science for coding the frontend and backend. You will need some Meteorology (of which no universities in Malaysia specifically teach it), to understand basic weather and climate knowledge. If you want to delve into forecast, you will need to understand Dynamic Meteorology. You will need System Administration if you want to deploy your backend yourself, instead of going through paid services. You will also need learn several programming language, depending on your choice of frontend and backend.\n\nIf you want authoritative knowledge of Malaysia weather and climate, you can read https://www.umpress.com.my/index.php?route=product/product&product\\_id=1059.\n\nAnyway, there's one thing you need to understand why Malaysia forecast is not that great compared to other country:\n\n1. This is a country in tropical belt. The hardest type of region in the world to get accurate forecast. Compared to USA, UK or Japan forecast, those are easily done. Even UK forecast experts says Malaysia forecast is much more challenging officially (after some Malaysia minister question MetMalaysia experts and tries getting input from oversea experts).\n2. Believe it or not, our climate and weather can be affected by winds all the way in Siberia Russia, MJO in Indian Ocean, ENSO in Pacific ocean. So many things needs can affect Malaysia weather. In comparison, UK and US mainly only needs to monitor polar region, and jet stream.\n3. Under ocean phenomenon like Thermohaline Circulation should have some effect on Malaysia weather, but I have not look into that specifically.\n4. Most weather modelling software were developed by upper latitude northern hemisphere countries, which means they don;t really focus on the physics of tropical region like Malaysia.",

One option is to use a wildlife camera that simply runs off of a battery you can change every couple of months. You can time it to take pictures every x minutes, and send them through a mobile data network or something to the server. Once there, simple computer vision solutions can be run (and I don’t mean deep learning, just normal image manipulation and OpenCV or the like) to detect where the water is on the image. If it crosses the place or percentage of the image, you can issue a warning theough the app. The key here is placing the camera somewhere it sees the water and the bank at the same time and is not blocked by vegetation, maybe on some pole or the wall of a house. Also important to cover the lens from rain so that the pics are not just wet blobs. If you want, you can also place some reference point on the bank and measure its visible portion’s length on every image.\n\nIf you’d like to chat about the data collection and processing aspect of things, drop me a DM.",

Ask them to explain their problem solving and thought process. It’ll be specific to that problem, of course, but over time you’ll start to see the patterns.

Build small, focused projects where you only practice one concept (e.g., a to-do app for CRUD, a weather app for API calls, a notes app with React state). Once you’ve done a few, you’ll naturally start connecting the dots and see which tool to use where.\n\nAnd don’t feel dumb if a colleague solves things faster, it’s just experience.

Every progammer will feel this at some point, you're joining a long long line of great engineers who've walked this path. Welcome ❤️\n\nAs for breaking a problem down, there's a few ways to do it, as you can imagine. Here's my 2 cents for you:\n\nIf you can't clearly see a structure for your solution, consider starting with a monolith. You'll build a thing that works (customer says yay) and the natural boundaries/seams will likely reveal themselves in the process. Kent Beck was saying as much the other day on LinkedIn.\n\nWhiteboard is king. And bring a friend, use them as a rubber duck. Or use an actual rubber duck.\n\nFinally, don't get cute. Most languages have some fancy features you'll be tempted to use. Resist their siren song 😅\n\nThese are suggestions. There will be situations in which they represent bad advice. Keep your eyes open.\n\nSuper lastly - good engineering is, I believe, about human communication. Strive to build good partnerships with other engineers... Then steal all their good ideas and ways of thinking! Haha. In a loving way, of course.\n\nBest.",

That is kind of the core loop of any engineering work.\n\nExpress yourself either in pseudocode, or use some features of the programming language that lets you gloss over details while you work out a general structure, like [the `todo!` macro in Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/macro.todo.html), that always passes typechecking but crashes with a `not yet implemented: your message` if it ever actually gets called.\n\nSometimes you'll find that what you thought was a decent strategy for a solution can't be implemented for whatever reason, then you have to think about that sub-problem again and see if there's some other way to get at it. And preferably leave a comment about the strategy you thought of first and why it's unworkable.\n\n> I guess it's probably with coding a lot, having experience and more.\n\nThat helps, but everyone has to start somewhere.

If you wish to do so, you can pin up to 6 of your best projects to your profile page. You can also make a USERNAME repo to put a custom readme on your profile page (just make a repo named to same thing as your profile name and put a readme.md file in it with what you want displayed [I would recommend a little bit about yourself, your technical skills, your interests & hobbies, projects you want to show off, and eventually your professional links]).\n\nEdit: I forgot the most important reason for uploading to GitHub. If your computer crashes or your files get corrupted you can retrieve your old code. AND if you break your code some how you can roll back to an older working version. I wish I had been used GitHub when 6 was beginning, I have months/years of code lost. It would be neat to go back to look at.\n\nEdit 2: One benefit of make your code public is that is anything happens where you lose access to your GitHub account, you will still be able to download your old code.",

I always recommend starting away from the computer, and simply **sketch out what you are going to do**. It can be diagrams, it can be pseudocode, or it can simply be a bullet-list of what the program should do, like this made-up example inspired by your problem:\n\n* start the game\n   * reset score, health and positions\n* game loop:\n   * if spawn-timer = 0, spawn enemy, restart timer\n   * move enemies\n   * move player\n   * check collisions\n      * if player hits enemy: inc points\n   * if player-health < 0, exit loop\n* game over\n   * display score\n   * display: try again button -> restartGame -> arrow up to start the game\n\nsomething like that - that you gradually build up while adding features.\n\nThen when you want to add a new feature, you experiment a bit with where it should be, put it where it initially makes sense, and then \"run\" through the steps of the program on paper where you talk aloud: *\"Then the game restarts, and that triggers the rewarded ad, but then everything is reset and the game loop starts ... hmm ...\"* and you try to put it somewhere else.\n\nThis doesn't take hours of planning or analysis, but simply a few minutes of \"playing the game in your mind\" and checking if it makes sense - and it helps a lot to have a simple script like this on paper, and someone to talk to - they don't have to answer, it can be a child, a pet or a **rubberduck**, just talk aloud! You'll be surprised what you hear yourself say, and hopefully quickly realize how wrong you were!\n\nAs you do this more and more, you'll sometime be able to do the entire thing in your mind, without writing or talking, but I've found that it is important to start being as external as possible.",

But as for my promo, everyone was really sweet and the more skilled didn't hesitate to make rounds to see if anybody needed a helping hand. \n\nAnyway, after that first week passed I kinda had a click. While I struggled to even understand what I was supposed to do before, I now had some bases on which I could rely. And after overcoming the hurdle of \"what the fuck are pointers and how do I use them?\" it was more or less smooth sailing. I knew how to use what I had learnt previously in order to progress steadily through the following exercises \n\nI finished my piscine at the C07 courses (malloc) with a score of 54 at the final exam (against 0, 0, and 10 the previous weeks...).

I didn’t even know what a terminal was, and I thought typing commands was the same as coding.\n\nYou’re *supposed* to feel overwhelmed, that’s the point. The piscine is a selection month. The school is checking if you’re a good fit for their system and looking for any red flags.\n\nThe main things they look at are:\n\n* **How you handle adversity.** Do you shut down when you feel in over your head, or do you push through?\n* **Your learning curve.** You might not be able to write a function today, but can you make progress by next week? They’re measuring growth, not starting ability.\n* **Collaboration.** How well do you work with others, both giving and receiving help?\n* **Time commitment.** 12 hours a day is common, and if you can manage it, you should.\n\nIt’s also important to remember that the piscine isn’t just the school testing you, it’s also **you testing their system**. The curriculum projects later on will feel very similar: vague, ambiguous, and challenging by design.\n\nOne last tip: **don’t measure yourself against your peers.** Some people will have math degrees, CS backgrounds, or years of coding experience. That doesn’t mean you’re behind. You’re on your own track.\n\nAnd yes, you’ll encounter some snarky people, both in school and in these threads, who lack awareness of how different everyone’s starting point is.

It will help you alot and it will also give you better ctrl R results for these pesky specific cmds that you might need in a hurry later on\n\nAsk people around you general questions but always try to decompose your context, ask questions about the problem itself and its sub problems, as for the solution make sure to always ask for the approach more than the raw solution itself, what did they google ? What was their initial self asked questions? What resources or algorithms were used to find an answer ? Once you have some clues STOP ASKING QUESTIONS AND START DOING RESEARCH YOURSELF !!!!! \n\nIts very important that you have a good grasp on the “context” of each subject, you should always consider a tech theme like some sort of information space, you might know some parts to some degree, however the biggest issue will be the things you aren’t aware that youre supposed to know, afterall it can always be an infinite amount of information thats missing in order for you to get the bigger picture, THATS WHY WE READ THE MANUAL/DOCS, it allows us to estimate what the information space is made up of, thus giving you a much clearer picture of what you already know, how much you need to know, but most importantly everything that you dont know yet.\n\n\nLast couple advices, STOP PANICKING! Start small, what is vim ? How do i save ? How do i edit ? How do i exit ? Is there any meaning behind the letters used each time ? \n\nWhat are the useful shortscuts, can you focus on that efficiently without having your brain stress you about the next thing you’re supposed to do or are you going to just do everything but master nothing ?\n\nHow comfortable are you getting with your current “ignorance” ? Can you detail the things you need to improve on and read/code more about so that you can tackle the theme of the subject? \n\nAnd make sure to REST ! Do not try to race with everyone like i did, ull just end up collapsing on the 4th week and thats very dangerous because exams are the entry criteria and your last exam is the most important one\n\nMake sure to understand that you need to pass the exam with just vim and a terminal, so all these people who are flexing their speed might suddenly get doomed since they would basically be coding in the dark, while if you keep struggling and working on a serious coding approach, you are actually more likely to get even better results on your exams, do not fall for the peer pressure, your peers are only there as a source of knowledge for you to absorb \n\nAnd have fun dude, the piscine is actually fun, the real hell starts when you have to recode your own C and C++ libraries so you can make bigger programs later on, these are the actual manifestations of hell, even chatgpt cant help much with the maths heavy subjects later on, the whole point of 42 is that coding is about approach more than anything else",

Beyond that, a lot of machinery is built to allow for flexibility and extension of the project, when you feel like your code works, try and come up with a new feature and implement it, you'll see how painful your design is and then you can try and come up with ways to write it that would make changing it easier.\n\nThe feeling of not knowing enough doesn't go away btw.

I was talking to a new engineer on our team and I realized the vocabulary I was using isn’t something a rookie would follow, but that whole time I had always thought and still feel that I’m the rookie. \n\nThe best thing you can do to get better at coding or really anything is to seek out a group that is already doing it. So I always advise newcomers to seek out a friend or a group or network of other people also interested. I also recommend if possible to look for people who are already skilled that you can just bounce a conversation with. Then when you’re out of your depth as OP says, you’ll learn a ton in order to keep up conversation with these folks.\n\nFrom my experience the best engineers always seek out this out of their depth feeling. I used to have so much self doubt in college and in life until I figured out that anyone can do it if you put your mind to it. These things take time and programming has a high skill floor. You just have to trust yourself and have patience. \n\nNow I’m at a point in my career where I’m learning to “trust myself” that I do have those qualities. There isn’t one path but you should learn to trust yourself and gain confidence that you do have the ability to put in the work to make it happen.",

        "body": "Professional programmer with 20y of experience here. So it really depends where you live and do you want to become a corporate dog or you're more of a loose cannon.\n\nThing is in North America the most popular set of technologies are few things, in Europe are other things. No idea what they use in Asia and South America.\n\nEither case, first of all it's great to know more than one operating system. Knowing iOS or Windows is fine, but learning linux is a must. And you must be able to install your OS from scratch and do basic maintenance.\n\nSecond - learn git. In the modern world nothing goes without git. The entire planet nowadays can't live without git. In rare cases they use other things, like TFS (Microsoft), but git is a must.\n\nThird - you said you know SQL - this is great. SQL is a must too. Choose a relational database and learn it. I would say choose MySQL (or MariaDB) or Postgres. You must be able to do basic queries, you must know in theory what are the normalization forms and you must be able to design a simple database.\n\nNext - you must know HTML, basic CSS and basic javascript. Which means to design some html form, being able to validate it with javascript before form submit.\n\nAnd here we come to a very sensitive point - you must know how to properly write a Word document and basic knowledge of Excel. Because if your'e a master programmer but your resume or CV looks like crap - it speaks bad of you.\n\nFinally - programming. It really really depends. There are several ways you could go.\n\nFRONT END DEVELOPER: Be a master of HTML, XML, JSON. Magician of CSS and commander of Javascript. And you must know working well with Photoshop or a similar program (like GIMP which is free).\n\nDATABASE DEVELOPER: Master of SQL. You must be able to effortlessly write 3rd Normalization form (at least) queries in your sleep. You must be able to optimize SQL queries for fun. You should know database administration to a degree.\n\nBACK-END DEVELOPER (ANY LEVEL): You must know what is Object Oriented Programming. You must know and use at least 3 Design Patterns (but be sure to read the book).\n\nBACK-END DEVELOPER LOOSE CANNON: Know PHP but know it real good. Last time I used PHP was in 2004, before I get my first professional development work. I was designing small websites. After that it evolved a lot. There is one framework called Laravel which from what I hear is very Popular. Be sure you know how to build web apps with it. This does not save you from learning HTML and basic Javascript with some CSS. And SQL is a must. Loose cannon level means working for you as a freelancer or working for a start-up. Nothing wrong with it. They give you great freedom of technological choice which lots of people love. Yes, PHP is not widely used nowadays but it's still used a lot. You could learn Perl instead, which is a super-strong language and I've built my career with it, but I won't recommend it. If you want to easily be able to get a job - learn Python. Python evolved a lot. I first learnt it and used it professionally in 2007 but in 2025 Python is a whole constellation of itself and I adore it. If you go the Python way - learn Django.\n\nBACK-END DEVELOPER CORPORATE DOG: You must be a master of either: C#, Java or Python. You must feel fluent in at least one of the popular cloud platforms: Azure, GCP or AWS. You must be able to write CI/CD pipelines. I have no experience in C#, so don't ask and last time used Java many years ago. For Python - Django and NumPy are a must here. You should be into AI/LLM and Machine Learning here.\n\nCoding editors: Yes, learn how to use VSCode, but also learn vim or neovim (or emacs).\n\nSide project: Learn how to make presentations in Power Point or a similar app.\n\nSo geographically speaking - last years what they loved in North America seems spreading into Europe as well and vice versa. But choose a path you want to go and choose technologies accordingly.\n\nLast word and probably the most important: Winning a technical job interview nowadays is way harder. Make account on Leetcode or Hackerrank and start doing the exercises there. Which means - LEARN DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS! These websites will help.\n\nGood luck!",

        "body": "Short story...When I learned to weld, I started out fixing.. grinding, fixing, grinding, fixing. Until one day they said \"Hey, you wanna weld?\" Which at the time I had no idea what I was doing. Completely messed this handrail all up. Then my boss came back and said \"HA...You messed that up.....fix it....\" ao I did. And I did...and I didn't until I finally started figuring out what needed to happen. 4 years later I had my own welding business and was contracting out my old boss because I was too busy and needed an extra hand on jobs.\n\nThis isnt welding but same concept applies. I'm still very green so definitely not a \"senior dev\" response. But learning without a conventional school before, I'll say this. You can only learn so much in a sandbox  (meaning guided help and projects, not your own). You won't have motivation brcause they arent your own problems or things your solving. Now, if you code your own app and run into a problem, when YOU fix the problem YOU will remember how you did. And if you dont, you'll remember enough about it to know where to look. You will force yourself to start approaching things differently. You'll feel more accomplished, you'll learn more in the sense of \"real world skills\" vs book skills. \n\n\nSomething I noticed learning to code and currently being self taught is you will run into a roadblock everyday. Some of them are big, some are small. I'm currently in one regarding github and git that I messed up so bad I cant even code right now until it gets sorted out (thank God for reddit help and kond people). \n\nDownload vscode, get on here, ask questions, check youtubes, start doing it! Make a portfolio about your skills and experiences for future employers, make one solely for shortcuts with code (things you use a lot of need to have on hand but cant remember). Start building that base now so later when you're deeper and have a dev job you can look back and not only see how far you've come but also you have a huge set of cheats to look up. Better yet, create an app for said cheat sheet that categorizes your cheat codes! There are 3 projects right there that solve 3 problems for you that you can show employers. \n\nBiggest thing is focusing on what's important. Is learning react important? Yes. But dont force yourself to not ask for help on that. The more you work it the better and easier it'll get. Code? Force yourself to not throw in the towel when your stuck, thats important. Work it for 20 min or even more before you say \"alright, I'm gassed\". Make it a point to code every day and have atleast 1 meaningful push to github so your activity level stays up on there and dont miss a day. Focus on 1-2 languages and dont switch from them until you are comfortable enough to tell an employer \"I dont know all the answers but I know where to look and I can articulate what I need to happen.\" In essence, I know I want my background to be red, purple and black and I want it to fade into eachother in a circular pattern. I may not remember it's specifically conicle-gradient (or whatever it is). But I know its a gradient and I know to look up gradients for colors and backgrounds.\n\nThis is longer than I thought it would be. But keep going! Get react, vscode, node.js, get a github, and start coding. Its daunting at first but once you start it'll flow. \n\nOh, and when you do get a win, whether it's fixing a problem, finishing a project etc. Dont stay there long. Accept the win, give yourself 5 minutes to freak out and jump around, but get back to the next win asap. That helps me with keeping my momentum up.",

However there \\*are\\* quite different ways we have to work with and encode textual data. Distinct from numbers.

Some of the answers (and indeed debates you are getting into) relate to people pointing out that you can look at it your original way in some context, or in a third way in others. \n\nThis is really the useful skill. I've been around the block a bit and I can conceive of a relevant problem in terms of say, a functional programming solution or an object one or a procedural one.

When the operation is done then the CPU is notified by an interrupt.\n\nThis was truly enlightening to learn and helped me understand asynchronous programming in C#. If you do an I/O operation synchronously then you're just blocking the thread and at most waste the CPU with instructions that wait for the interrupt (this is handled by the OS).\n\nBut if you use await/async with Tasks then you're really sending a fire and forget signal. Once the I/O operation is done the interrupt is handled and continuation of your code might run in a different thread (based on the task scheduler).",

Like both C and C++, Rust enjoys full native code performance since it doesn't require a runtime and focuses strongly on zero-cost abstractions whenever theoretically proven possible and safe, and is also a true systems programming language, meaning you can write bare-metal code that talks directly to hardware like embedded applications, firmwares, virtual machine hypervisors, and operating system kernels entirely with it, and I'm talking from personal experience here, not just parroting someone else's opinion.\n\n Rust is still a bit niche since it's a relatively new language with 1.0 only having been reached 10 years ago, and the learning curve is quite steep if the goal is wrapping your head around its revolutionary memory safety paradigm, but its popularity cannot be contested, as it has consistently ranked first in the StackOverflow developer language preference surveys ever since reaching its 1.0 milestone. It's also the only other language allowed and actually being pushed as a viable alternative to C in the Linux kernel, and pretty much all big tech from Microsoft to NVIDIA is pushing it, with the only exception being Apple which have their own safe native language strongly influenced by the original Rust author's language design, whom Apple themselves consulted with while designing Swift. Even features available in Rust that were originally not implemented in Swift are now being brought to the latter because Apple's alternative design decisions focusing on developer accessibility ended up proving somewhat problematic. Finally and unlike the C family, Rust actually has pretty good tooling as well as a package manager called Cargo.",

That too is a really great introduction to the abstract power of computer programming and the power of thinking computationally. In that book, they use Scheme, which is one strand of Lisp.

Had you done that, you would have found countless posts telling you to start with small and simple projects and grow in all directions. A ToDo List app may be too ambitious for your skill level - not programming wise, but design wise.\n\nYou need to learn the design and planning processes that go from idea via specification, detailing, breaking down, solving individual parts to final implementation in a programming language.\n\nYou most likely directly started at the computer and naturally were dumbfounded and got stuck. You tried to write a novel without even having a detailed plan of what you want to write - common \"writer's block\".\n\nSit down with pencil and paper and flesh out your ideas before programming. Write down what your program should do, what parts it should consist of, what features it should have. Then, think about each individual feature. Determine what you need for that particular feature, make a detailed plan/roadmap.\n\nThis specifying, breaking down, analyzing, solving process is the really important part of programming, not the implementation in code, that's the actually easy part (and the part that to a certain degree can already be covered by AI).\n\nAs with every similar post, some book recommendations: \n\n+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul\n+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas\n+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman\n+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles Petzold\n\nAll these books focus more on the process that leads to the implementation in code than on the code itself - hence, the used languages are fairly unimportant.\n\nAlso, consult the **Frequently Asked Questions** in the *sidebar* here for a cornucopia of project ideas on many different levels.",

Do you want it to run in the terminal or be a proper app with an UI ?\n\nI find making the things and looking up what I need when I'm faced with a problem has helped me much more than aimless tutorial watching, I have also found remaking my old projects with new knowledge to be really entertaining and good for motivation and a to do list might be perfect for that. You can challenge yourself to do it at different levels to learn everything that comes with it, something like :\n\n- level 1 : using python lists and methods like append and remove, use print and input to make the whole thing work in the terminal (can do a simple menu like 'if input()==\"1\" : list.append(input(\"What do you want to add?\")) elif input()==\"2\"...')\n\n- level 2 : using OOP to create each task as an object, you can set up your classes to have some more info like a date, the person the task is for or notes, make your methods yourself \n\n- level 3 : using a database to store the tasks, you can use sqlite3 for a local one that's going to be in a file or if you're up to it you can make a proper server to run your SQL in.\n\nFor bonus points you can make it into an app with an UI, I quite like QT at a beginner friendly level, it comes with PySide6 and has an app called \"designer\" you can use to create the UI graphically rather than writing it completely in code.\n\nThe more you do, the more you learn. Try finding interesting ways to practice with the things you learn and finding things you can partially do but need just a bit more learning to do and work towards that. Good luck learning",

A really good chef might show how they make something, but then you ask, how do you know this, how do you know that? How did you cut that chicken? They want to get to the point when they make something, not teach you all the basics of cooking.\n\nSimilarly, you want real-world code. That's difficult code. People aren't writing bubble sort by itself, something so self-contained and short that it can be explained. Also, when you ask an expert to explain something, unless they have experience teaching, they will skip over many detail that they assume you already know (but you may not). They may use a bunch of terminology that have no idea what they mean.\n\nThis is the problem with one-way communication. How much should an expert assume you know? At some point, if they have to tell you why a nested loop works, then they are spending more time teaching you the basics of programming, and not talking about the project the build.\n\nThey have videos of people coding, but then you watch them click this, type that, etc. They barely say anything so you get nothing from watching even though many beginners want  to see a real coder code until they realize it's like watching a real chess player play chess. It can be incredibly difficult for a master chess player say why they make certain moves. They can tell you why some moves are dumb and they see things you don't, but unless you start to play and get in those situations, watching an expert doesn't help.\n\nTo be fair, chess is a super extreme example, but at least you get the sense that even if you study for a year, you still couldn't figure out why a top chess player makes the move they do.\n\nIn effect you're saying\n\n> I want real-world code, but something super simple that I can understand, then explain all the detail and the thinking behind it as if I were five years old.\n\nMost experts explaining their code wouldn't do it at that level, but even if they could, they'd invariably leave something out that you would want explained.

If you go to Udemy, Academind has courses that follow that pattern. Their React course is particularly good and there are a few sections of that course where Max (the instructor) walks you through projects like that, and then challenges you later to try it on your own. It's a long course but it's worth the time (assuming you want to learn React.) They also have courses for Node and Python. \n\nGood luck to you.",

Initially I don't have knowledge about reactjs, so I study read the basics of it. Then, they gave me access the repository to see what their source code looks like and to see what tools, libraries they used. Nobody explained to me about how the source code interact to each other, you need to dig deep and learn to read .similar to php, never done it and laravel for backend so I need to teach myself. So I guess, what I would suggest is that.. try to build something you are interested.. then, once you finish try looking on open source project similar what you did and analyze it and how they did it. Then, you could do the same. Try learning design patterns also .it is really useful and a lot of professional used it .",

Whenever I’m working in a new language I get a quick hello world primer to learn the differences between languages I know and whichever one I’m working in.\n\nFor example, with Python you can just print hello world, or you might check if the script you’re executing is named “__main__” which is the entry point for your program. This differs from Java where you have to declare a main function with specific syntax, and also declare a class that shares the name of the file you’ve created. Knowing those details is required to get a valid Java program, so hello world is the easiest possible thing you can do to learn those requirements.",

It's just the thing you do when setting up your tools, to make sure compiling works, to make sure you can run the program that you just built, to make sure you can see what output your program is generating, etc.\n\nI think the book The C Programming Language explains it best. It seems like the book is the origin of the practice but according to the writing, the tradition was around before that. At that time, the message was apparently \"hello, world\" and not \"Hello, world!\" (i.e. someone added the capitalization and the punctuation to the tradition along the way):\n\n> [Printing the words hello, world] is the big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to create the program text somewhere, compile it successfully, load it, run it, and find out where your output went. ...\n\n> Just how to run [the hello, world program] depends on the system you are using. As a specific example, on the UNIX operating system you must create the program in a file whose name ends in \".c\", such as hello.c, then compile it ...\n\nAnd then it continues to show how to do it on UNIX (steps which still work today on modern Linux, BSD, etc.).\n\n\"Create the program text somewhere\" may entail installing/learning to use a text editor in case you have not done so before. \"Compile it\" means you need a compiler and need to know how to use it. \"Load it and run it\" may mean you need to learn how to use your system's shell to run programs in case you don't know already. Or if you're using the GUI and double-clicking on it each time you want to run it, you may have to add in a \"press any key to continue . . .\" type of message to avoid that the terminal closes right after the program is done.\n\nNowadays you may also have to configure/inform your virus scanner that the code you are generating is not dangerous. Well, ..., technically the code may be dangerous. But you need to convince certain dynamic scanners that you are generating code intentionally and not trying to do something nefarious.\n\nIf you have an IDE a lot of this will be automated for you. Many IDEs today even automatically create a literal \"hello, world\" boilerplate for you when you create a new project. The idea is that you run that first to make sure it's working, then you change it to put in your \"real\" code and keep doing the same thing, to practice iterative development.",

The key is to get past that, be able to hear a simple problem, and figure out how to write code that accomplishes it.\n\nFor the vast majority of things you can think of, you won't have any idea how to write code that does that.\n\nBut for a few very simple tasks, you might be able to do that. For example, there is a game called \"Hangman\". Someone gives you a word. All you know is how many characters it has. Let's say the word is `pineapple`. You would only see \"---------\". that is, 9 dashes.\n\nThe goal is for someone to guess letters until the entire word is solved. A person is allowed to make 6 incorrect guesses before they lose. They aren't allowed to repeat a letter they've already used before. If they guess a letter correctly, you reveal its position. For example, suppose they guess `e`. Then, you show\n\n   ---e----e\n\nThis reveals the \"e\" at the end of \"pine\" and at the end of \"apple\". The other characters are hidden until the guesser guesses it correctly.\n\nThat's a program you might be able to code up with some basic knowledge of programming.\n\nCurrently, you are likely copying some existing code and getting it to work. Most people find they understand how code works, but when asked to write it, they don't know what to do. Their mind goes blank. You're starting to be a programmer when your mind doesn't go blank and you have some idea of what to do.",

Learning one lanuage and transitioning to another is all about language specific rules, syntax, methods etc but the mental model remains the same. Its something i realised not too long ago (only started learning to code in jan so still fresh), early on i was trying to remember everything and then relised i need to remember less and understand more. Unfortunately the concept of thinking like a programmer and real problem solving skills doesnt get effectively communicated in courses. \n\nI think the issue of learning syntax 'too early' stems from general impatience and not understanding what programming entails. People want to see themseleves code, probably dont want to spend the first few lessons building those mental models even though it is a crucial aspect.\n\nAs i was reading the article, i realised this is equally applicable in learning a new codebase or framework. Read through and focus on the logic, the data flow, the why behind the what. Then when you understand why it is the way it is, go back and read the syntax, the specific methods used.\n\nInteresting read, thanks.",

You can say you covered pretty much every basic of JS, but if you need to understand problems, fix errors and write code yourself without help, you need constant practice. For this, I would recommend you to start with any one JavaScript tutorial (not a video; time-consuming). \n\nJust get good with the basics, Learn 2-3 things and do some practice, like write something yourself. Revise what you learn that day the next morning. After one week try to build something from what you have learnt. Once you are good at the basics, find some simple projects online and try to build them. Here you can depend on some YouTube videos, but I still recommend not wasting too much time there. First watch and learn how it's done, and then do it yourself without help. Then you should be able to come up with a new idea and build one. \n\nJavaScript has a lot of fun things to learn about, and there are many interesting libraries and tools.\n\nYou will be able to find useful resources here: [roadmap.sh/javascript](http://roadmap.sh/javascript) (if this is overwhelming for you),   \nYou can do freecodecamp: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#build-an-rpg-creature-search-app-project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#build-an-rpg-creature-search-app-project) or w3schools: [https://www.w3schools.com/js](https://www.w3schools.com/js)\n\nAfter you have done all this and are still serious about it, try LeetCode and crack some basic problems.",

Companies want you to be profitable for them from Day 1 on; they don”t want to have to invest in you or train you first. Also everything frontend is flooded with applicants and under high pressure due to AI automation. With basic coding and basic reporting in Data Analytics it’s similar. So I’d suggest you focus on cloud, backend, data science or machine learning. Learn the programming languages you need for that as much as possible and get the necessary and relevant certifications. Europe is still in need of moving its economies fully into the digital age, so there will be plenty of opportunities. But it’s specialists that will be needed, not generalists. And (as already said) you really have to elevate your foreign languages to the business fluent level (and also get certified in that).",

        "body": "You don't call `wait` to provide thread-safety. You call `wait` because you want to wait for something, and you want to do so in a thread-safe way.\n\nFor instance, suppose you're implementing something like `ArrayBlockingQueue`. If someone calls `take()` when the queue is empty, you want to block until it's non-empty and there's something to return. Therefore, the implementation of `take()` might need to call `wait()` on some underlying synchronization object. And conversely, the `put()` method calls `notify()` to wake up any thread that was waiting for the queue to become non-empty.\n\nThe reason `wait()` interacts with the same \"monitor\" that the `synchronized` keyword operates on is so that you can do this in a thread-safe way. For instance, suppose you do something like:\n\n    while (internalQueue.size() == 0) {\n        wait();\n    }\n\nIf you do this *without* holding a monitor that protects the queue state, then it's possible that after you check the queue size, but before you call `wait()`, somebody else will add something to the queue and raise a notification. But you've already made the decision to wait, and you missed the notification. So if a second object is never added to the queue, you might end up waiting forever, even though the queue contains an object. This can cause deadlocks.\n\nOn the other hand, if you hold the monitor the entire time you're waiting, then you prevent any other thread from adding anything to the queue. This also causes a deadlock.\n\nThe solution is for `wait()` to **atomically** release the monitor at the same time it suspends the current thread and adds it to the \"waiting\" list. And then when the thread wakes up again, it re-acquires the monitor. If you read the javadoc, that's exactly what `wait()` does, and this is why it does it.\n\n----\n\nIf you didn't have `wait()` and `notify()`, you would have to implement a blocking method with a spin-loop or polling, along the lines of:\n\n    while (true) {\n        synchronized (obj) {\n            if (internalQueue.size() > 0) {\n                // do stuff\n                return;\n            }\n        }\n        Thread.sleep(T); // sleep without holding the monitor so other threads can access the queue\n    }\n\nBut no matter what you do, this will perform poorly. If you set T to a small value (or zero) it will waste CPU repeatedly checking the queue when nothing has changed. If you set T to a large value, you will add a lot of latency and cause the CPU to unnecessarily sit idle.",

Just a html file with a style section. Play around, stress the concepts you don't grasp. Make a todo list layout, make it look fancy to you.\n* Learn programming bare bones. No 3rd party libs at all. Just node and something you want to solve.\n* Learn server side bare bones. Use a web server package at most. Store your todo lists. Write them as json files on disk and load them back.\n* Learn browser JS bare bones. Just a html file with script section. Add fancy function to your todo list layout. \n\nOnce you have all that it should become easier to bring everything together.",

Now I'm a 3D artist who writes a bit of code, and that can be very useful to some organizations.\n\nAlso, my thoughts on AI: investors want everyone to believe that AI is about to get so good that it wipes all of us out, but I'm just not seeing it in my sector. In fact, I just got hired at a new job, and I barely even use it. Mostly just as a Google replacement.

It might limit how many jobs some companies would have but it won't take every job.\n\n3) Just about, maybe a tiny bit riskier especially since there's so many people that do it. Electrical is a very safe area in general since it's not as popular and so many areas need it. \n\n4) Frankly, just learn how to learn. Take in stride what your teachers say about how to get information. Because even years down the line there'll be points where you don't know what to do but if you can look up the right things in order to learn what you need you'll be good. \n\nGenerally uni will teach you coding from scratch so it's not like you need to learn a whole lot by yourself beforehand. Ofc that will help with assignments and allowing you to feel comfortable with coding but not required. I do recommend you learn a little with whatever language your school uses the most in order to be ahead of the curve. Also, look into the different areas of compsci, see which path may be interesting to you, this will change for sure as the years go on but its better to have an idea and change it than to start with nothing.",

While college programs don't usually require that you have any previous experience, it will be a big advantage for you to have already gotten some experience on your own time, especially if you're already familiar with the programming languages that specific college uses in its first few courses.\n\nIt is definitely possible to get really good at coding in five years. Going right into freelancing from that point is harder, though, because colleges don't really give you the set of skills you need to be a professional. Being a junior programmer on a team and learning about stuff like code reviewing and navigating large codebases and source control and development methodologies is sort of a separate education from the college degree.\n\nI'm not at all scared of AI taking the software jobs. I think it's a useful tool, but I don't imagine it replacing the need for programmers any time in the next few decades. On the other hand, plenty of people I respect disagree with me. AI is probably equally a threat to lots of jobs, including programming but also art, engineering, and medicine. I wouldn't worry too much about programming specifically.\n\nMy advice: figure out what programming language your intended university uses for its introductory classes. Learn that language. Find a big pile of beginner coding problems and regularly practice. Try and do something fun with programming that ties to some interest of yours. Make a game. Make a guitar tuner. Make a thing that calculates football statistics. Whatever you find interesting.",

I started out with two years of informatics lecture in my school which ended 3 years before I graduated Gymnasium (I think similar to high school). I can tell you that I did manage to get my Bachelors degree (but not with high grades) and my Masters degree did work out much better.   \nI can tell you, that you will learn coding well enough if it is similar to my experience in Germany. But as you go on I felt that theory is taught over practical things and I felt little prepared to enter the job marked. What I would suggest more than focusing on learning everything there is to know in theory, get a job on the side and learn there. \n\nI feel the need to tell you that if given the chance of doing it again I would not study CS anymore I would start out working and earning certificates on the side, but that is my personal experience.  \nIf you want to learn some techniques of CS and if you have the spare money to earn some degrees, I would recommend Hack the Box (students pay less per month) and Portswigger/BurpSuite. They are really beginner-friendly.\n\nRegarding AI, I think if you get some courses in CS focusing on AI you would get a head start, as many currently employed and finishing students did not get the possibility to take these. But there are also different specialties in CS that only few people want to specialize in. Most of the students in my experience are not really good at the mathematical part (e.g. cryptography), I have an interest in law in the side of being a CS major and worked for some time in a field which focused on the area where these two specialties meet. There are not a lot of law students who have an interest in computer and not a lot of CS students have an interest in law. If you want to be special find an area which most of your peers do not like and get good at it :)\n\nIf you have any further questions feel free to message me :)",

It will, that’s pretty much a given at this point. Now that you know that, you have 5 years to get familiar with the ways you will interface with AI tools so that you can make sure your skills stay relevant. Keeping your skills up to date is  a requirement of most jobs, certainly most tech adjacent jobs, so you just know one space you’ll need to focus on well in advance. \n\nThese are valid questions but I don’t think any of them are actually unique to computer science and you should probably be asking the same questions about anything you’re considering as a career.",

If you want to schedule an event at a future time, using UTC can result in the wrong local time, when timezone rules change (and that happens frequently around the world):\n\n[https://www.creativedeletion.com/2015/03/19/persisting\\_future\\_datetimes.html](https://www.creativedeletion.com/2015/03/19/persisting_future_datetimes.html)\n\nBut even outside of that, a universal \"prefer UTC\" rule doesn't work for every case. It sounds like for your particular app, you care most about the day in which something happened, according to the person who did an action on that day. The fact that an event happened at 8am for one user but was simultaneous with an event that happened at 9pm the previous day for a different user is NOT important to your app.\n\nThere's no single best answer. For your case, I think storing the local date in one column, local start time in another column, local end time in a third column, and timezone offset in a fourth might be one easy solution.\n\nThat would make finding all events on a particular day trivial. The only tricky thing might be if someone traveled across time zones in one day, but it would still handle that just fine. Everything would still be stored relative to the local day.",

In every large program I've looked at, I've seen code that made me feel dumb, as well as code that I knew I could improve upon.\n\nIn a real project, the mathy people of your team will tend to do the mathy stuff, for example, and to ideally wrap it up in a nice, easy to use callable interface. Personally if I were trying to solve a real problem like that I would look to see if a library were available and to use that.\n\nThat said, I personally don't think Simpson's Rule ought to be hard for a programmer to understand, but if I look at typical explanations, e.g. in Wikipedia, something about the delivery of the explanation, with lots of mathematical symbols and so on -- tends to make my eyes glaze over. \n\nIf I were basing this on the Wikipedia explanation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s\\_rule), I would start with the \"**Approximating the natural logarithm of 2**\" example listed there (that is easy to follow) and once that one makes sense (and once I'd written a simple program to calculate it that way), I would work backwards to make it work with the \"general composite 1/3 Simpson's rule\", for example. At that point you should basically have computer code that is a computer version of what the Wikipedia article is telling you.\n\nIf SICP has a \"mathematical background\" section in the appendix, I would try reading that first and then representing all of the notation as code as a sort of \"translation\".",

        "body": "I'd recommend The Odin Project if you want to do Fullstack Development, it's completely free and it will teach you pretty much everything you need to know and it highly encourages projects and research and in my experience doing The Odin Project that is one of the best ways to learn. By practicing and reading and researching, so check it out if you're looking for a good course, it teaches HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some backend fundamentals like Node.js, Express.js and PostgreSQL. As for how long it took me, I mean it took me about 3 months to finish just the JavaScript course because I was really taking my time with it, but in reality the amount of time it takes you to learn doesn't really matter. What matters is that you practice and you stay consistent.\n\nAs for AI tools, I really only think they're good for people who don't care that much about the technical side of web development. Creating software isn't as simple as just sitting down and coding, in the real-world there is some real planning that goes behind it because real people will be using that product. So, don't get discouraged by it, I've used AI here and there and it's super unpredictable and unreliable and in an industry where creating reliable and predictable software is key, I don't think AI will get very far in replacing any programmers. Also, if you're planning on building real and useful skills I would suggest staying away from AI as much as possible when coding. If you want to learn how something works or you need project ideas then sure, AI is great for that, but as soon as you start using it for generating code your skills will go downhill because it gives you a false sense of learning. You'll see the AI's code and you'll say \"oh yeah that makes sense, that's simple\" and you'll feel like you can do it too but then when you try out a project and you try to make anything by yourself then you're going to realize that you're stuck because learning isn't watching and reading code, it's writing and understanding and breaking things. So, if you're going to use AI for learning, be very wise with it and don't use it for generating code. Also, don't be scared of the struggle of learning, you're not going to understand everything and that's okay. Struggle is learning.",

Seguir vídeos gratuitos como o “Future Fullstack” é uma excelente escolha; muitos desenvolvedores começaram assim, usando materiais abertos e criando projetos próprios.\n\nO tempo de aprendizado varia bastante: algumas semanas de prática constante costumam ser suficientes para se sentir confortável com HTML e CSS, enquanto Java geralmente exige mais tempo e dedicação, dependendo dos objetivos. Praticar todos os dias, nem que seja um pouco, e transformar ideias em projetos reais faz muita diferença. Na minha opinião, esse é o melhor método — só não digo que aplico sempre (minha história é longa!).\n\nFerramentas de IA são ótimas para automatizar tarefas repetitivas e acelerar protótipos, mas é importante entender a lógica por trás das linguagens. Isso permite criar soluções próprias e compreender de verdade como tudo funciona. Use a IA como apoio e complemento, não como única fonte, para evoluir como desenvolvedor.\n\nDeixo só um alerta: excesso de informações e possibilidades pode causar confusão ou até esgotamento mental. Falo por experiência! Mesmo com acesso a muitos cursos ótimos, às vezes fico perdido sobre o que realmente quero aprender.

A repetição e aplicação prática vão solidificar seu conhecimento melhor do que qualquer tentativa de decorar.\n\nPor fim, lembre-se que a jornada da programação é longa, com altos e baixos — e o medo, a dúvida e a insegurança fazem parte dela.

        "body": "The short answer is that being good at this is entirely what being a \"senior developer\" is about. It's a very broad and deep skillset that you develop through experience. You can eventually develop this experience on your own, but it's not going to happen fast. I made a lot of stupid design decisions when I was a junior dev.\n\nIf it's important for your startup to be building good software in the short term, then your startup needs to hire senior developers, both to make good decisions and to mentor juniors.\n\nSo it's not even remotely possible to do your questions justice in the span of a Reddit comment, but I'll try anyway:\n\n> How do I design the DB schema to be effective for a large number of users and such that my in-app operations are fast? I have learned about normalization and indexes but I still don't come up with elegant solutions like AI does honestly.\n\nUnderstand *how* queries and indexes work: how the data is structured internally (e.g. as a B-tree) and what the DB engine is doing when you write a query, especially when it involves joining multiple tables. Have this knowledge in mind every single time you write a query. Inspect the DB's query planner output (e.g. using `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) to confirm your assumptions.\n\n> How do I monitor apps cheaply/easily to see what’s hogging resources? My company has been using New relic but it just seems too complicated and has too much going on and seems overkill.\n\nThere are a gazillion tools for this, including basic ones like the Unix `top` command. I don't have experience with New Relic but I've used Datadog (flexible, but very expensive) and much simpler self-hosted tools like Prometheus.\n\nThe important thing is to measure, and then drill down into those measurements to figure out what to measure next. If your app \"feels slow\", add lots of timers to measure which parts are slowest. Try to reproduce the problem locally and use whatever local profiling tools are available in your language. If one user request \"fans out\" and depends on lots of different subrequests, then the 99th-percentile latency of those subrequests matters more than the average.\n\n> How do you actually test your app? It feels like such a pain and I do it manually for every project going through typical user flows and fixing stuff on the fly.\n\nTest automation is critical if you care about software quality. Write test cases alongside your code. For core logic, you can use unit tests, along with test coverage tools to help make sure you don't have obvious gaps in testing. For UI, the testing strategy depends on what framework you're using.\n\n> How do I check if my apps are secure and a motivated individual can't exploit it?\n\nUnderstand the general kinds of mistakes that lead to security flaws. There are lots and lots of these -- buffer overflows, escaping mistakes, confused deputy attacks, time-of-check-to-time-of-use, and so on. Be knowledgeable enough to recognize these, and disciplined enough to guard against them. Get other skilled developers to *carefully* review your code.\n\n> Am I making the right tradeoffs or over-engineering (e.g. Ex: should I use BullMQ or will node-cron suffice for my app that runs a CRON job to fetch a lot of data by calling a vendor's APIs?)?\n\nImpossible to answer in the abstract. A system is \"overengineered\" if it has more complexity than necessary to accomplish its goals. So you need to do a detailed analysis of your actual requirements, and the actual behavior of the complex option vs. the simple one.\n\n> Should the solution be a monolith or a bunch of microservices?\n\nThere are a lot of opinions about this but I'll just quote from [\"The Grug Brained Developer\"](https://grugbrain.dev/):\n\n\"grug wonder why big brain take hardest problem, factoring system correctly, and introduce network call too\"\n\n\"seem very confusing to grug\"",

Is there desire to  grow and take this public or is the intent to sell it off to a larger concern. That at least tells you if there is enough money or resources in your future to make real changes in your areas of concern. \n\nTo find your hot spots (frequently called or slow bottle-neck code)  products like DynaTrace and App Dynamics are helpful. There are many vulnerability scanning tools like Veracode, Black Duck etc. As for database optimizations that depends on your platform but lots of tools will suggest indexes to help performance and eliminate table scans. \nHang in there. If your company is trying to grow, their focus is likely on adding customers through new  features and much of what you are worried about will be pushed to the back as \"technical debt\" until your platform actually crashes, or gets hacked out of operating and held for ransom.",

I think you're hitting on a fundamental issue which is that software development is an extremely unregulated and undisciplined field. There are a lot of people who don't pay attention to any of the questions you're asking about, and still manage to have careers just cranking out sub-par code. (Especially nowadays when it's easy to just rubber-stamp the output of an LLM.) And on the other hand, if you push yourself, there is no upper limit to how much you can learn, or how much care you can put into your work.\n\nBut there's not really an objective, accepted standard for you to measure your skills by. There's just the outcome of your projects, and the judgment of your peers.\n\nThe good news is that there are a lot of extremely smart people in the field who have published a lot of text and video content that you can learn from. You don't necessarily have to take everything they say as gospel. Pay attention to the things they say that resonate with you, and use them as jumping-off points for your own explorations.\n\nJust as an example, you can find a lot of interesting talks from the now-defunct Strange Loop conference. Check out [\"Simple Made Easy\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4) by Rich Hickey (designer of Clojure) and [\"The Mess We're In\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4) by Joe Armstrong (designer of Erlang). Or if you care about security, look for interesting talks from DEFCON or CCC. Pick a random topic that interest you, and if it turns out to be way over your head, the stuff they talk about will at least give you more topics to research.\n\nAlso, check out software-related social media such as Hacker News or Lobste.rs (if you can trust yourself not to use them for procrastination). Don't get me wrong, those sites have a lot of bad opinions and irrelevant content. But they can serve as a good way to stay in tune with the zeitgeist of what other tech-savvy people are thinking about.\n\nEDIT: Oh yeah, and you'll probably find more useful advice over in /r/ExperiencedDevs than in this subreddit. To be honest, I think your questions are so broad that you wouldn't necessarily get comprehensive answers there either. But you can browse through previous discussion threads to see the kinds of advice that senior devs give.",

Should I just keep practicing and trust that it will click over time?\n\nThis question gets asked over and over again, and the answer is the same: practicing **with** AI will not help much if you want to get better at coding **without** AI.\n\nThis especially applies to the skill of taking a complex problem and breaking it down to simpler subproblems. This is what programming is really about, and everything else (like the syntax of different programming languages) is trivial in comparison. And if you're always letting AI spoon-feed you by telling you what bullet-pointed subproblems to solve, you're never practicing that skill, so it will never improve.\n\nIf you're unsure whether you could rebuild your projects from scratch without AI, then why not just try it, and see where you run into difficulties?\n\nIf you get stuck, try reading documentation, or even taking existing examples and seeing what happens when you modify them. If you insist on using AI tools, then don't ask them to write code for you, or even come up with a design. Ask them to suggest learning resources (e.g. documentation websites) or project ideas.\n\nIf you're still repeatedly getting stuck trying to rebuild your projects from scratch, then it's a sign that your skills really are underdeveloped. So go back and do the same thing, designing and coding from scratch, on a simpler/easier problem. Repeat as necessary.\n\nFinally, practice your research skills. When there's something you want to learn about, practice searching online for it, reading what other people have said about it, and thinking up your own follow-up queries. Don't just let a chatbot tell you what it thinks is the right answer.",

Most developers I work with have never even studied programming, they are ex-artists who tinkered on the side while putting shots together and realised they could get paid a lot more to write code.",

In that case you'll need to either write your own Node.js plugin in a low-level language like C++ or Rust, or switch to an entirely different language for the whole project.\n\nBasically the same general situation will apply no matter what high-level language you choose.

This lets you track progress incrementally, create rollback points, and makes code reviews way easier.\n\nYou can also use story points as milestones. Like a 1-point story = one commit, but a 5-point story gets broken into multiple commits as you build the feature.\n\nExample:\n\n* Simple bug fix (1 file) → feature-based commit\n* User auth system (tons of files) → progressive commits: model → service → UI → integration\n\nThis way you match your commit strategy to the actual complexity instead of being rigid about it.",

For web or backend development, focus on [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core (if you stick with C#), APIs, databases, and service communication; unless you have a very specific need, you can mostly ignore advanced algorithms. For games, Unity will teach you a lot, though some types of games rely heavily on algorithms (pathfinding, procedural generation, optimization). If you aim to design new or improved algorithms for AI, security, compression, or simulation, deeper math plays a bigger role than coding. If you’re just using existing libraries, you don’t need advanced math—basic knowledge is enough.\n\nThose are just 3 examples. So your next step is deciding the direction you want to follow. Once that’s clear, your study plan will be much more focused and effective.",

Have this code interact with a UI front end based on something like Vue (I think Vue is the easiest). This might sounds complicated at first glance, but AI can be your friend for hints.

Any *actual* animation that a user makes will have some finite length, even though there's no predefined upper limit on how big that can be.\n\nAny standard data structure such as a list, dictionary, etc. will allow you to put as many entries in it as you want. The only practical limit is the amount of available memory. \n\n(Technically, there's usually also an upper limit defined by the maximum value of the integer variable storing the data structure's size, typically on the order of 2^31 which is roughly 2 billion. But you're likely to run out of memory long before you hit that limit. And nobody is likely to be creating animations with 2 billion frames.)\n\n>  See, I would really love to poke around in the code of a pre-existing animation program to see how they did it, but once again, when I try to search about the code of an animation program google doesn't listen to me.\n\nThe specific programs you asked about are closed-source and proprietary, so the source code isn't published anywhere. Google can't find something that doesn't exist on the internet.\n\nThere's a 2D animation program called Synfig Studio which is open source: https://github.com/synfig/synfig/ But it has hundreds of thousands of lines of code so it's not going to be easy to understand for a beginner.\n\nBut see, for instance, this class which defines a `Keyframe` object and a `KeyframeList` which is a sorted list of keyframes at different times: https://github.com/synfig/synfig/blob/master/synfig-core/src/synfig/keyframe.h",

        "body": "When I was laid off from a corporate job a few years ago, it took me 18 months and over 500 applications to get my next role and I had 15 years of experience at the time. 95% is normal or even good, I think I got only 3 interviews out of my 500 applications so you're doing better than I did. Keep applying, set up alerts so you're one of the first applicants to a role rather than the 1000th, your chances go way up.\n\nTry to apply for things more out of your comfort zone because it may be that your skill set/tech stack is too common which means a lot of competition - if that's the case what feels uncomfortable for you may be uncomfortable for other applicants too. Do what you have to do to survive, I had to sell some investments to stay afloat.\n\nYes it is very demoralizing, it was my first time being laid off and I didn't realize how much of my feeling of self worth was tied to gainful employment prior to that, the depression sucked, but after some soul searching and figuring out what I actually wanted to pursue and what I would be good at, I took on other things that gave me purpose. I used my free time to volunteer for causes that were important to me, and I got to build some APIs that helped streamers fundraise for Planned Parenthood (we ended up raising over $60k grassroots) and eventually it was this project that landed me a role at a large nonprofit where I currently work. It's funny because I didn't do it with the purpose of landing a job, I legitimately just wanted to help out the cause and later when I found a nonprofit job posting that matched my skillset I realized it would be very relevant to them and I'm pretty sure that's what set me apart from the other candidates.",

Got some interview prep from one company telling me to prepare to be able to write a debounce from memory, and to brush up on asynchronous data fetching, manipulation of strings and arrays. Felt we were quite clearly going to do some sort of data fetching, list rendering and filtering. Nope, full blown JS fundamentals challenge around building a Wordle game in 45 minutes, obviously no AI allowed. Bumbled my way through the whole thing trying to remember the best way to map over stuff and comparing index's for matches and partial matches. Didn't even get close to finishing. Was surprised they did that challenge despite looking for a RN dev as it’s a different vertical than what they are looking for.\n\nSecond company interview didn't send any prep, passed the second round which was a live 1 hour coding test in RN, third round was a discussion on architecture with some white-boarding. Passed it until they pulled a gotcha right at the end with 15 minutes to go. Gave me another coding test on JS fundementals, which I passed, not satisfied they deleted that one and gave me another with 5 minutes to go that I couldn't finish in the allotted time. They haven't even bothered to get back to me.\n\nI question the people who decided the processes to be honest, I don't think they know what they're looking for. The whole process feels broken because they don't know how to handle the whole AI aspect of things.",

The overzealous vibe coder trope.\n\nWhat that underlying question is looking for is not to shit talk AI and be dismissive of it, nor is it to circle-jerk over AI and how it's revolutionized your life. It wants a more measured answer that talks about the pros/cons of AI, where it's useful, where it's not, and demonstrating understanding that it needs to be used with caution no matter where it's used.\n\nWe all get that it's not good at complex tasks. We all get that it sucks at being able to understand business logic to do anything useful. We all get it sucks when it needs to work in a large codebase across multiple files.\n\nBut it has some pros you didn't seem to mention at all.... the biggest one, which is what I use it for regularly, is as a faster Stack Overflow. Back in the day, when I was getting some error I wasn't sure why I was getting, I'd go Google that error. Then I'd sift through Stack Overflow questions until I find one that's close enough related to what I was doing that it can push me in the right direction, and usually hit my head against a wall until things finally work.\n\nNowadays when I get an error, I type into Copilot \"Why am I getting \\[pasted error\\]?\". Copilot looks at my code, scours the internet/docs to find answers that are directly relevant to my code, and can give me relevant answers way faster than I could get on my own. It's of course not always right on the first try, but with a follow up prompt or 2 I almost always end up with an easy fix with very little effort from me. This is like 90% of what I use AI for, and it's absolutely been a massive benefit.\n\nI also like it for very mundane tasks that are conceptually simple, but are time consuming. Coming up with unit tests is one. AI can easily read code paths, and shit out enough tests to get good coverage. It's usually pretty bad at *implementing* the unit tests, but I can take over from there, it did the boring part for me.\n\nAI's also great at just asking general questions. Why read through AWS's terrible docs when I can ask a single prompt, and get a right answer most of the time.\n\nI'm on your side that I think AI's pretty bad at doing most code generation tasks beyond very simple or very isolated stuff.... but you're being overly dismissive if you can't think of any ways it can make your life easier.",

There are a couple of differences I want to call out in response to some of these comments and to address OP’s question \n\nFirst, there are different types of recruiters: agency and corporate.  Agency recruiters work for a staffing company that services lots of clients.  Corporate recruiters are internal staff at one company and only\nwork on openings for that company\n\nAn agency recruiter indeed does have high metrics they need to meet and will tend to send LOTS of invites/messages.  They are usually working on multiple jobs and building pipelines for the various clients and skill sets they know their clients need.  LinkedIn typically produces a less than 10% response rate for recruiter pings so you need to send a very high volume to get traction\n\nCorporate recruiters do also send a decent number of invites/messages via LinkedIn but are typically more selective.  We do have metrics as well but they are typically focused on actual candidates moving forward versus connects.  Corporate recruiters also pipeline and fight the low response rate but because we are measured more on speed of filling a job, our approach is more targeted.\n\nSo why are you getting tons of pings when you haven’t engaged with your LI profile?  Likely bc of the skills you selected in your profile, your job titles, the companies you’ve worked for, etc. These pings are likely agency recruiters or sourcers ( those that literally feed recruiters profiles to reach out to).\n\nPersonally as a corporate recruiter, I’m only  reaching out to those that have a well built profile so I can validate if they could be a match.  But it is true, we are using linkedin to source even though we are we are drowning resumes. For example, I have a SDE 2 role open that hit 2k apps in 3 days of posting with only 10% meeting the location requirements.  From there only 5% meeting the bare minimum experience.  Add to this the number of AI generated fake resumes, the folks that lie about being in the location or other qualifications and that pool of 2k apps is maybe 50-60 decent matches.\n\nI understand how tough this market is and how hard it is to be a job seeker ( I HATE the BS so many companies put candidates through) but it also makes it hard is as recruiters to find you through all the noise.",

I’m glad mental health is so well-known these days, but these conditions are not new and plenty before us have succeeded.

I have to make a ton of tiny tickets, the daily standup is one fucking hour long, and everything is constantly delayed… all in the name of “efficiency” and the idea that they should get better eventually. \n\n\nI fear our two current open roles will be the last US dev hires for a long time. \n\n\nThank globalization for the fact that Defense and Finance are the only dev roles with US job security (anything needing security clearance).\n\n\nEven I worry being outsourced in the next 5 years once these dudes actually get decent at coding. \n\n\nRemote labor compensation is unfortunately a race to the bottom now. \n\nIt ain’t like the old days. 😮‍💨\n\n\nThere’s easier money in construction work lol \n\n\nmy advice? Become an electrician and start your own business. The CS Dev industry will be completely screwed for USA workers in like 5 yr. Already is screwed. If you’re not in it now with a few years of experience, tbh I’m not sure how you will get in. Wishing you luck",

It takes a lot more money piled up to retire than most people realise.\nA veteran cs worker, for example, earning say $300k a year would need to have more than $4M in earning assets ( so their main home does not count ) - minimum, to keep their income at the current level. - let alone they are giving up future income growth. \n\nWe, of course, hear the stories of stocked up people who got good exits from companies. But it’s far from the majority - and not enough to make a dent in this area. \n\nAnd the final issue is that the reality is that a lot people still enjoy the work enough in return for that $300k a year… it give purpose and something to do. So even if they could take early retirement financially, a lot will choose not to. \n\nI once worked with a person who was a technical founder, who exited. I don’t know his exact net worth, but his payout was somewhere between $10-$20M \nHe was working with us a senior dev, earning like $200k. I was having a beer with him on day and asked him why he was still working at the age of 40 and did not need to. His answer was pretty simple:\n- he had been a hobby coder before starting college and liked it. \n- he retired for a while, but drove his wife crazy. \n- this money he could spend on whatever he wanted, without concern. \n- it gave him a sense of purpose. \n\nHe was motivated, despite not ‘needing the job’ worked just as hard as anyone else. In short he enjoyed working and helping others, but had decided that he did not want the stress of being responsible for managing or paying others.",

They brought in a consultant who tried to talk down to me and make me back down. This guy looked me in the face and said “I don’t know if you’re worth $150K, $40k or what.” After one or two weeks of back and forth like that, I gave up and just started searching. About 2 weeks after I stopped talking about it, I think the CEO figured out I was probably not happy, and gave me their promised pay bump. I gave my two weeks a few days after. \n\nI learned two things from that experience, first you have a choice in what you spend your energy on. It can be fighting for a raise, or it can be find a healthier and better position. It’s up to you. Second, if you have to justify your value to someone else, and your salary is a measure of your value, then either you value your self too highly, or they don’t value you enough, either way, this always leads to a toxic environment and you should probably just bow out. \n\nNow, I don’t even really bring up salary points. I just tell my manager if I feel valued, and this is what I do for the company, and they get the message and talk to their manager about getting a raise because they value me.

The individuals contribution to the business and the market. \n\nI use the word contribution to the business, because I have seen people whose skills are too much for the startup they are in, so they won’t get a rise. \nThe market is also important, a company will not pay more if you are at their perceived market. \n\nIf you really like this company, search local job ads, download the national salary get the data together and work out what you could get elsewhere. \nThen you can have a data based conversation - but keep in mind, maybe they don’t ‘need’ someone with you higher skills and be ready to accept that you might need to get another job\n\nRight now the market is pretty tough globally.",

Those have nearly all disappeared - so don't get your hopes up in landing a job at the few that remain. Remote is now tied to the local market rate for talent, and even takes a haircut for the \"convenience\" of being remote.\n\nBefore you do something irrational in an otherwise crappy job market, evaluate the \"total value\" of your setup which includes:\n\n1. Your total compensation (base, bonus, equity)\n2. Your company provided benefits.\n3. The convenience of being able to WFH (reduced transportation costs, time savings, reallocated travel time to fitness/health/wellbeing)\n4. The social benefits provided by your country (health care, pharmacare, etc)\n5. The purchasing power you have per euro/dollar spent\n\nIts very important that you actually measure the value of (#3-5) in order to compare the \"real compensation\" you earn. Most folks younger in their careers only measure #1, and #2 only comes nominally later when you have kids. As a result they are easier to manipulate when the industry is in a boom.\n\nYou should index your total compensation against the percentiles for your country. 73K euro could put you in the top 5%, 10% (many european countries), 15% (e.g. Canada), or 30% (e.g. US) of earners depending on the country you reside in. This will help you ground your expectations a little more.\n\nIts not wrong to demand more compensation for increased scope of responsibility and outcomes delivered. However, you want to weigh your situation before engaging in a confrontation with your company/CEO. If you already have a better offer lined up, then the risk versus reward of engaging in the confrontation is tipped in your favor. If you're in a low percentile earner in your country/region (e.g. 80-100%), then you may not have much to lose and more to gain.\n\nThere is a good time to engage in this kind of dialogue, and a bad time to do so. Good times are when there is lots of hiring, easy-to-find opportunities, and very few people available to replace you. At this very moment in 2025, it is a bad time to engage in wage negotiations without something like a Union backing you. Depending on the percentile compensation, there are many people willing to take up the task.",

Software dev isn’t the end all and be all of the tech world and there’s plenty of ways you can stay in the space but find things more interesting to you. You may also find that a certain niche is more up your alley, like data, backend, database developer, etc. there’s a lot of places you don’t have to be as “creative” and can just plug along with tasks.

While the rest is like data science/AI/ML adjacent. However, there is a pretty small section of industry looking for people who are good at security/reverse engineering. I heard it's growing but it doesnt seem in vogue.\n\nI'd recommend leaning into trying to become a security engineer or reverse engineering research. It's very niche but so is your skillset.

So if you’re the same my advice there is to approach everything in a similar way, learn the underlying concepts (even if they’re “outdated”) before moving onto the more modern approaches. For instance, with frontend web, just start with plain HTML/CSS/JS, then start bringing in some libraries like JQuery (or maybe could skip this part), then move onto more modern frameworks like React, etc. And similarly when learning something like React, just start with that, then later start integrating other libraries into it (say for state management, etc.). \n\nWhat parts of git, CI/CD, unit testing, DBs, are you struggling with?\n\nAlso maybe some books on different architectural design topics might help with the OOP or general software design principles.",

Frameworks are abstractions of behavior. And like most of the not low level software, it's made up of low level software. So maybe read up on how to make a rest server from the ground up. Or how to use JS to create a simple framework. Granted that's if you want to go in that area.\n\nAlternative look for roles more focused on C/Unix, you can also start using AI tools to judge your code and see what they come up with. As much as we hate AI it can be used to learn what to learn. Ask what's expected of a Dev in a role you want, then make it give you a small project to practice the skills you are lacking. But keep in mind that you can't simply code for yourself, you gotta pretend someone will have to use your code sooner rather than later. 5 years ago getting feedback on thst without coworkers was hard, but now you can ask AI to help you figure out how to do something better.\n\nGit and CI/CDs are tools, learn them like such, an online class for git will teach you more than you need.\n\nTesting your own code should just become 2nd nature to you for low level, it's just code that verified other code is doing what you expect it to. Web framework tests have more in mind depending what you are testing, so I wouldn't touch that just yet.\n\nAs for OOP C code, have you tried looking at how some popular repos do it? Tbh certain languages have poor OOP implementations so it will always look ugly for them. And tbh some OOP code will be ugly regardless due to the complexity they can accumulate.\n\nDon't give up!

You now have the option to rollover your 401k funds into the solo 401k. This is opposed to doing a rollover to an IRA.\n\nWhy do this?\n\nWith a solo 401k you get two advantages:\n\n* Controlling the fund menu within a 401k. Meaning you can have access to favorable funds.\n* Keeping your money outside of pretax IRA space. This is important if you are doing the backdoor Roth IRA strategy where a positive pretax IRA balance will influence pro rata taxation on traditional IRA to Roth IRA conversions.\n\nThere is also a third advantage.\n\nA 401k has an annual limit for both employee and employer contributions. For 2025 employee contribution limit is $23.5k. Employer limit is $46.5k. So a total of $70k.\n\nThe employee limit is the aggregate of all 401ks under your name within the calendar year. The employer limit is **per 401k acccount**. In other words if you have access to two 401ks and actively working for both employers then you can, at maximum, have access to $23.5k + 2 \\* $46.5k = $116.5k space. This scales up with every 401k you have access to.\n\nSo with the solo 401k you can contribute 20% of your net self-employment income on the employer contribution side of things.\n\nYou just need a valid reason to open a solo 401k.

At my university there was no real campus life, more like a regular job where you go and then take the train back home (last time I was at UCI the huge area for parking freaked me out again lol, the universities around Boston were much more similar to what I've been used to).\nThen I first had to Google all those \"dean's list\" things etc. ;)\n\nBut that's been even worse for Asian CVs. Everyone's a medal winner for something, a ton of different ranks and levels etc. \n\nEuropean CVs are usually rather plain in that regard and more descriptive (longer CVs and photos have been around for much longer as well. When I started you also had to put age and confession and martial status etc.  - awful). It's fun to see that often when the descriptions are very mathy and technical, probably C or C++ mentioned, it's often Eastern Europe while for example Germans have a very business- and process-oriented language (requirements analysis (\"Pflichtenheft\" ;)) and ISO standards and optimizing business processes blabla Siemens mainframe blabla).\n\nHiring internationally is interesting but also exhausting.\nBesides the business lingua CVs the worst I found to be the Indian CVs listing everything under the sun (experts in Gmail, excel, YAML, XML, JSON, Jira, Slack... basically dumping their current browser tabs and pyproject.toml/requirements.txt in the CV).\n\nI'm definitely on the conversational side but I'd say half the people we rejected obviously didn't have a lot of depth in what they've been talking about (e g. tell you which model they used and once you talk about it it comes obvious they haven't even read the abstract of the respective paper). Other half is social aspects, obviously not caring about the topic they should be working on, being super hard to talk to or just plain cocky, forgetting about the interview, not letting others speak/speaking over interviewers all the time, suddenly sharing their screen to show their bitcoin price predictor after we tried to wrap up the interview 5 times because it's been 9PM for us etc.",

Chances are, you're part of the problem too. \n\n\\> I have been working in the same feature for at least 10 months now.\n\nThis is not good, if I'm being honest. Even in the worst places I've worked I've seldom actually seen a single feature take that long to finish without reasonable blockers. If the issue is genuinely \"I don't know how to do this\" then you and management both have issues. \n\nNo one typically just lets a feature story just creep for 10 months without bringing it up to either backlog it or give it to someone more capable. Not saying it never happens, it's just incredibly rare that it would go for so long without anyone checking. Especially if you work somewhere remotely credible or a start-up. \n\n\\> The last thing that happened that pushed me to the edge is that the manager asked a Senior to help me out with this feature and he just started asking a bunch of questions of the technical decisions I made and was ultimately confused and suggested we change a lot of stuff to make things right, basically saying that the last 9 months of work was poorly done by me.\n\nThis speaks to me that people are tired with your work and that you are not prioritizing your learning and improvement at all. You're telling me that you didn't update anyone on your work for 9 straight months? You didn't communicate with a single person on your team to get feedback on a PR or something? This sounds really unbelievable and I really doubt this story as being true. Whatever though, assuming it is true; I understand people are going to tell you that it's management's job or your senior's job or someone else's job to teach you and make sure that you're doing well but it's really a two way street. You also need to communicate to them properly, especially as an engineer with four years of experience. You're far beyond the point of being some baby junior who doesn't know how to get the job done, or at least you should be. \n\nIt's part of your job to make sure you're improving and actually getting better.

Yeah, probably. But honestly, from what you've described, this seems like a systematic communication issue between the team. How large are the sprints? How large are the features that you're working on? Do they encourage you to talk to other teammates to get advice? Do they encourage you to find optimal solutions before implementing them?

But then I would reflect on my work, what I've contributed, what I've done poorly and what I've done well. Over time I realized that, while I have made mistakes, a lot of the issues I had were systemic and involved me to build the environment I wanted to work in. \n\nJust something to think about. Hang in there.\n\nEDIT: Also, I would like to add, no developer should be working on one feature for 10 months. Even in my worst moments on the job, a feature would take 2 months max before management or a senior could clearly see that I was struggling and would step in to help, or pivot me to something else. This is another sign that this might be management and not you. Again, I don't know you and I don't know your work ethic, so I can't say that you're perfect or anything, but anecdotally, and based off of what I've read, that's just what it seems like.",

He usually asks why I did things a certain way, and why I didn’t go down a different route. This either ends up with him agreeing it was a sensible decision, or suggesting looking into alternatives. When you reach out for feedback on a regular basis, acting upon it becomes far more manageable and feels much less like your work is getting crapped on.\n\nYou can’t expect every line of code you’ve wrote and decision you’ve made over the span of 9 months to be the best option available. That’s an insane standard. Recognize that all developers are prone to making mistakes or suboptimal decisions, and take the initiative to reach out to your senior developers and get feedback more frequently.\n\nPersonally I ask my architect to be brutal when critiquing my code so I can avoid repeating the same mistakes even when they’re small.\n\nWhen you go 9 months without reaching out for feedback you’re pretty much asking for every subpar decision you’ve made to be pointed out to you all at once. It can be hard to take that without it feeling like 9 months of effort is being crapped on.\n\nAsk for feedback more regularly, act upon it quickly, and take everything you learn from it with you moving forward. It also has the bonus of making the work feel more collaborative, and helps build a good reputation with your seniors in my experience.\n\nEdit: just to clarify, when I mention getting feedback, I will literally hop on a call with my architect and walk him through all the code changes since the last time he’s seen it, explain what it does, and give him a minute to glance over it. It usually ends up with him either saying “looks good” or asking more questions and then suggesting changes or accepting the reasoning. This approach allows the architect or senior to take some accountability for the code you’re writing which takes some of the pressure off.",

You need to not only finish your own work but also grow people and that’s pretty hard to do remotely. Maybe you are the exception… Have you done that successfully while leading junior dev’s growth remotely? you just confident because you’ve been an effective IC remotely? Those are two different things, tbh. Your manager’s concern is not unfounded. Especially since you’ve never been a manager before. Learning how to be a manager as a remote manager…good luck. I’ve had 3 remote managers at this point in my career and none of them grew me nearly as much as my co-located managers.\n\nAlso, managers are supposed to (imo) shield their reports from unnecessary office politics as much as possible. How would you do that if you aren’t even in the office to keep tabs on the said office politics? Your reports, especially the junior ones who don’t know how to manager up, may suffer alone and not know whom to turn to or how to deal with it.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind…it’s fine to stay an IC and prioritize family. Not every stage of your career has to be growth oriented. Please don’t become a manager for the sake of the next promotion - those usually end up the worst managers. Become a manager when you are ready to mentor and grow people. When you are thinking about starting a family, it’s ok to take a backseat and coast/autopilot a bit in your current job. You can always become a manager later. But your kid(s) only grow up once.",

You're not alone, you are capable, and if nobody else has said it, I fully believe in you. Build cool stuff you want to build while you're applying to jobs. Apply to those jobs anyways, because most skills are taught on the job in the first 6 months.\n\nI never finished my degree, however, I did take a lot of college courses on computer science. I have to be honest, college really does not teach you much in terms of preparing you for working on the job. If you think about it, it makes sense, a lot of jobs require you to understand tooling, specific frameworks, working within a team building, large-scale applications, etc. \n\nThe issue is that frameworks change, if you spent a semester learning Spring, .NET, NEXT.JS, they could all have insane updates mid-semester that would require the professor to alter their coursework mid-semester. With that being said, this stuff is really hard to teach. The tech industry is constantly moving forward and evolving. \n\nBecause of this, a lot of degrees in computer science focus on theory, data structures and algorithms, maybe programming language fundamentals and, if you pick a specific focus, AI for example, GIS, or game design or whatever, you learn that niche.\n\nThat's why a lot of jobs don't require degrees and seldom hire Junior developers that have degrees. Especially in today's job market. People with degrees can prove that they made it through their coursework and they might have some capstone projects under their belt. But they can't code their way out of a wet paper bag, or they don't have a lot of real on-the-job experience. You shouldn't let that stop you though.\n\nYou should know that you are good at what you do, you have the degree. You've proven that you can do the work even if you just coasted. Just work on a bunch of personal projects, building stuff that interests you. It doesn't have to be big or glamorous, just stuff you enjoy. You will quickly gain a skill set that you would want to enter the job market for. It could be full stack development, mobile development, game development, front end, back end, big data, whatever. Right now, just focus on building cool shit. \n\nA lot of programmers leaving college are in the exact same boat you are in. They have a degree, they're kind of good at coding, and they understand theory, now what? I'll just say this as a trade secret, 90% of engineers that have a job, learned what they know now on the job. Unless you're applying to mid to senior level roles or doing contract work, most jobs teach you everything during \"ramp up\" which usually takes about 6 months. \n\nYou got this, man. Take it one day at a time and don't be discouraged if you get rejected constantly. The job market is tough right now but, I believe in you. Good luck.",

But there's a really deadly spiral that a fair amount of people get stuck in.\n\nThey land at a shit job where the things you're talking about are the norm, then they get burned out and desperate for a new job, and because of that desperation they fail to do their due diligence in the reverse interview and/or aren't picky enough with the new job, so they end up somewhere just as bad. Rinse and repeat, and your entire career is just shit job after shit job.\n\nIt's a hard cycle to break once you're in it, because you never ditch that feeling of desperation.\n\nLayoff/management changes aren't really unique to our industry. What is fairly unique to this industry is our painful interviews, which only makes it harder to get out of the deadly spiral once you're in it because you're both burnt out from your shit job, *and* the shit interview process. Double burnout.\n\n>How do I just find some peace in this field?\n\nSo the things you're talking about re: stress, unrealistic deadlines, mismanagement, shit culture, etc aren't *inherent* of this field. They're inherent of toxic companies. The trick is finding a company that isn't toxic. Just because a company has lower pay doesn't mean they'll be lower stress/not toxic. Just because a company has higher pay doesn't mean they'll be higher stress/toxic.\n\nThis requires you to get really get at reverse-interviewing to sus out companies like that, *and* to be able to have the patience to not humor offers from companies that sound like they'll have cultures like that. I've said \"No thanks\" to plenty of companies.\n\nI've worked at 4 companies since graduating, 2 more if you count my internships, and I'd only describe one of them as turning toxic. That one was *great* to work for for about 2 years, but they had a CTO change who slowly tried to turn up the heat on the devs, which resulted in me and most of the good devs jumping ship before it got really bad. The other 5 companies though? Great WLB/cultures. I left one because I wanted to move to the east coast (100% onsite days), some of my friends are *still there* 12 years into their career. I left another one cause I was sick of the industry it was in, but honestly this was probably a mistake. The 3rd was the one I said turned toxic after 2 years. The one I'm at now is still smooth sailing over a year in.\n\nGood companies are out there. You just have to find them.",

Something so blatant in the company's eyes that they'd refuse to hire you even if you were the smartest person on Earth.\n\nHaving scheduling conflicts, doing an interview with bad enough internet that you can't finish it, aren't *good* things. But they're not so terrible that the company would refuse to ever work with you if you performed well in an interview.\n\nChill out, wait 6 months, and re-apply.\n\nI have an anecdote from my last job search in 2024. I was in talks with a company that I didn't really care about, and they had a really bad reputation for WLB. I just appplied because why not. Well, they sent me an OA to do and I just.... didn't. I didn't respond to the recruiter, I didn't decline/submit the OA, I just... ghosted them. The recruiter kept reaching out to me, warning me of the deadline, offering an extended deadline, etc... and I just, didn't respond. Shitty of me? Sure, ghosting sucks in either direction. But it was what it was, I didn't have the energy to respond to them, I was in talks with other companies I actually cared about.\n\nWell, that exact same company reached out to me again to interview with them no less than 3 months later. And they've continued to reach out to me (not just one recruiter, but several) non-stop ever since then. Every few months I'll see a few emails from a few recruiters about open roles.\n\nI ghosted them. That's shittier than what you did. And I'm still not on their blacklist.\n\nYou're fine.",

So does your team actually need to produce a replacement? You say you're doing code reviews but how is that possible without requirements and a development plan?\n2. you say the team is oversized yet still drowning? Unless they're all completely useless that doesn't make much sense.\n\nThose inconsistencies aside, it seems clear why the lead position was open. Either the previous lead was incompetent and built the wrong team for the task, or they were setup for failure and that happened. Or they left on their own after either creating or being put in a failing situation. The cause doesn't really matter here, the vacancy is just a strong hint that this team is dysfunctional. \n\n I would start by having a 1:1 with your immediate boss (senior lead? director?) and be totally upfront about the issues. DO NOT SUGAR COAT ANYTHING. Tell them that you don't believe this is the right team for this project and need to rebuild.  Say \"The staffing on the team is not appropriate for the project.\" or something like that.\n\nIf your boss doesn't agree, then you have another data point on where the incompetence is that caused this mess. Schedule a 1:1 with your skip and repeat.\n\nThe key here is to be direct and back it all up with as much evidence as you can. I assume that you have had 1:1s with your new reports so you have some direct knowledge. Pull all their commits and review them. See if they're that bad or just complacent under the previous lead.\n\nGet your lead or your skip on board and then have HR start the separation process for all the dead weight engineers on your team. If you rebuild an effective and more efficient team and actually ship this project then you'll in a great position. If it goes south, then I don't think that just sitting around hoping for it to get better would have worked either.",

There are also levels beyond staff (senior staff, principal, distinguished, fellow).\n\nThere's different leveling structures across the industry like Amazon's SDE1/2/3 and Microsoft's 59-80, and there's companies with different title progressions (e.g. again Amazon, where there's no \"staff\", or IBM, where \"staff\" means mid level and comes before senior), so talking in terms of \"L5\" just makes it easier to talk about level equivalency across companies.\n\nEach level has rubrics for both hiring and promotions, largely based on amount of scope/impact, and these rubrics are similar across different companies for the respective levels.",

The reason why a lot of new grad roles start very (typically between 2-4) is that anything under might be an intern role or a role at the company that is just lower. And for which level you interview for, it depends on your previous experience. Assume L5 is senior, if you apply to this role most companies will assume you have been senior or you have showcased senior capabilities already. Some companies will up level you or down level you depending on their definition of the level. For example meta e3 is new grad and you actually can’t have experience (I think you need less than 1) , so above that you can be E4, if you have the experience you might be E5, if you have 3 yoe but you experience aligns highly with what they want and you perform well in interviews they might up level you to E5 (rare).\n\nAlso L6 is not necessarily best engineer or something. You can move up your career just having a lot of luck too (probably still a good worker). I know someone at my company who went from L3 equivalent to L6 equivalent in 1 year (internal job change, pm).\n\nYou move up by showing that you have already been performing at that level. Sometimes you can’t move up though due to budget and other office politic reasons.",

I had been working at a sort of low grade data engineering job for a few years out of school, bc I had moved to a smaller town with my ex, but those didn’t amount to anything in my new job. I spent probably the first year there feeling like I didn’t know what I was doing. Because I truthfully didn’t.\n\nBut they hired me knowing what I knew, they liked me personally and believed I would figure it out. After a year or so I felt comfortable with HOW to ask questions, which is a HUGE thing. And to do that, I had to work on things to understand why I was doing them. That’s very much how I learn, and I think many engineers find a level of enjoyment from the field, and that’s what a lot of teams look for. It’s worth it for a company to invest in someone who will learn to do things the right way.\n\nRelated: The code base was a mess, as it turns out, and direction was directionless as this newly minted unicorn startup ramped up hiring.  So a few months after I felt confident they fired half the engineers and the other half 6 months later. This was a week before moving to New York. \n\nI spent 3 months applying to jobs and interviewing and practicing questions from my new apartment for no joke, 12 hours a day. I went out after that and enjoyed my new home. I got hired at my current company 3 years ago and found they had the same approach to letting us learn and tinker with things. Now I should be on track for senior this year and I know I’m a good developer in my own eyes and get the sort of work that reflects it. \n\nJust get in and get your hands dirty and learn to enjoy it, they spent a lot to hire you and if you’re asking questions and showing your thoughts to them, they will do their best to get you there. But really think about the content of your questions. Identify exactly the last thing you did before you got stuck, recall the steps. Reboot your computer and try again, clear the local cache (check your policies for this first lol), present it like it’s a problem/hypothesis/method like a science doc and let them fill in the conclusions. It’s their job, and they will only be bothered heavily if you’re saying “idk what to do”",

I was labeled a \"temp worker\" with no benefits or PTO, yet I was given consistent a 40 hour schedule each week, with no expected end date. And was doing work that was definitely worth far more than what I was being paid.\n\nAll I had when hired was a CS degree, good GPA, tutoring experience, and some data related projects. (machine learning based, but was a good example of data handling as well)\n\nI just kept taking on more challenges because they didn't have others who could do it. my suggestion is to aim for old \"fossil\" type non-tech companies. they are trying to modernize so they want people with these skills, but they don't pay super well, and wont have any mentors for you. They will like people who can independently teach themselves how to work with new systems. If you can make a pivot table in excel, your basically a wizard in those places. lots of room for recognition and self development.",

If not, work with your manager to see if you can get there. If your manager is unhelpful or otherwise can't provide a path forward, then it's time to look for a role on another project, team, org, or company, where you will be given that opportunity to perform at and earn the next level.",

If you're confident that it's not medication worthy (it really doesn't sound that bad imo from what you've described) then I'd say try finding a hobby that really engages you that can help you take your mind off of work and reset when you're out of it. There's a reason so many senior+ engineers have hobbies like brewing, woodworking, carving, hunting, etc. that have nothing to do with computers. It helps reset the mind and relax a bit from the constant work state.",

Your resume probably isn’t the limiting factor.\n\nIf you want a big tech general SWE position then get better at the things it demands of you. If you want to be more specialized then double down on that speciality, and just round out your rough edges. Maybe that’s learning more about clever embedded algos in a heterogenous compute environment or internalizing a test driven design coding style or learning all the crazy dark corners of c++ or whatever. \n\nMaybe you want to pick some application domain and become more knowledgeable in that.

I don't need to actually plan rolling out those changes; only reflect on whats going well versus isnt. then maybe I look up how other people have solved those problems, and decide if they are in a better, worse or the same position as we are.\n\nthats how to build up architectural strength; spiral out from what you know well and work with often to technologies you dont know as well and reflect on how their application to your work might be good or bad.",

I went deep into clean/hexagonal architecture, event-driven architecture, DDD, CQRS, and the C4 model, and applied it all to my finance project.\n\nTo get there, I had to learn to view the project from multiple high-level angles. I studied how frameworks like Symfony and Laravel worked, read obsessively, connected the dots, and eventually everything \"clicked\".\n\nIn the end, once you reach the stage of designing projects from scratch, you realize it’s just an endless list of “next steps.” The key is having the right tools and knowing when to apply it.",

What would I have done differently? What can I \"steal\" for my future coding problems?\n\n\n* Understanding the codebase better\n\n\nWhen I get stuck on a programming task, the first question I ask is \"why is it broken\". The second question used to be \"how do I make it work\". But now I look more at \"what does it do\", \"how does it do that\" and \"why does it do that\" before I ask \"how do I make it work\"\n\n\n*  Generally understanding technologies, services and concepts better\n\n\nI had to learn what a nosql database was before I could understand why I would choose to use one. Understand what race conditions were before I could try to avoid them. Know what different kinds of caches there are before I could choose a good one. Know what cloud services do before I could choose which one to use in a system.  \n\n\nThis last one can seem like a lot. And no one really wants to study after work. But I just found a YouTube playlist with systems design concepts and listened to it while commuting.

        "body": "I've been in the Dynamics space for almost 20 years and I also came from a .NET background. Your friend is absolutely correct:\n\n>it’s less about hardcore coding and more about understanding business requirements, troubleshooting, and communication\n\nI go back and forth whether it's \"real programming\" or not. You're not technically building anything from the ground up, but instead are modifying or adding onto an existing application. However, that can be said for some legacy systems, too. The language isn't not hard to pick up at all and I feel like you can definitely tackle some interesting technical questions/problems. So, maybe you can think of it as programming at a very high (abstracted) level.\n\nAs for your questions:\n\n1. **Does moving into Dynamics 365 with a .NET background really give me an edge?** I have always valued my .NET background because I understand what is going on \"under the hood.\" I've run into some interesting issues over the years and knowing how the framework works has really helped in getting to the root cause of the issue. I've also talked to a few managers at different companies and they have said it's nice to have someone with a non-Dynamics background.\n2. **What are the core skills I should focus on to actually get hired?** If you already have a good handle on understanding business requirements and communication, it would be beneficial to take a look at the development ecosystem so you see what you're getting into from a technical perspective. I can only speak for Business Central, but the MS documentation site has a ton of information, including some tutorials: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-programming-in-al](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-programming-in-al)\n3. **Is the market really hungry for more Dynamics 365 people, or is that just hype?** I feel like there is an uptick in the market, but I don't have any data to support that. As a customer, it's easier than ever to get started and the product does offer a lot. \n\nIf you're kind of over the grind of traditional \"programming\" and want a little more interaction with customers, then it sounds like it would be a good change for you. \n\nOne really nice thing is that the language has been going through quite the overhaul the last decade and MS is really working to improve the developer experience. It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than when I started. \n\nI will say the only issue I'm running into is I've just about hit the upper limit of the pay scale -- the last offer I received was for the same salary with just a bonus added on. Because of that, I'm looking to make the opposite move and go into a more traditional developer role. \n\nI hope that covers all of your questions! If not, feel free to ask more!",

This project is at a level of 3rd year undergrad student, but definitely not at a 9 YOE level.\n\nIf you're absolutely adamant about looking for a new job now, your best bet is not to bring up this project at all. Focus on your experience, and try to make that sound cool (9 years is hella impressive!). At that point, interviewers rarely care about personal projects. You'll have to learn about how best to present yourself, though.\n\nHowever, if you're not in a rush to find a new position, I'd recommend that you upskill. Try to think about as many interesting and complex features as possible that can be added to your project. The more complex it sounds, the more you'll learn from it. At the very least, learn some basic AI/LLM stuff and add it to your project. Also, your UI looks kinda bad. I get it that you're not a frontend person, but you can just use ChatGPT or whatever LLM of your choice to generate a beautiful UI for you. The first impression anyone gets about your website is from how it looks, so don't make them prejudiced against it by making it look bad.\n\nAs for the freelance - no idea, honestly, don't have any experience with that. However, that would also really depend on your sales skills, so evaluate those first.\n\nAnyways, good luck to you and all the best!",

If I stood in front of a recruiter and tried to explain some super specialized project I worked on, I risk losing them. They might not understand it or get bored, even if it’s actually interesting. People who haven’t gone deep into a specific topic can easily dismiss it, like “You optimized a feature for 2 months? Should’ve done it right from the start!”\n\nI imagine a situation where a company is choosing between two candidates: one has a simple app that works and can be tested, the other talks about complex systems needing a special setup or ecosystem. Which sounds easier to evaluate?\n\nI get that adding AI/LLM features is seen as highly valuable these days because so many projects have some AI angle, whether needed or not. So yeah, more AI features is automatically cooler, I get it.\n\nI totally agree I need to get better at presenting myself and that the UI could definitely use improvement.\n\nI’m not in a rush to switch jobs, but somewhere I do need to start researching the market and my place in it.\n\n Thanks a lot for your honest reply.",

Of course, since you already have a background in react, you may have an easier time switching back than I am having making that pivot. But I have read that this is a hard switch for others as well even if they did it prior.\n\nPlatform/ops work is a lot of being on call and putting out urgent fires.

You may just be working on tooling and framework stuff that isn't a stressful, but anytime you work on a horizontal as opposed to a vertical, you are liable to be pulled into issues in parts of the system you don't know about and expected to help troubleshoot them during high pressure situations.

Your instinct to prioritize algorithms practice is spot on. Google has a very standardized interview process where they want to see your problem-solving approach, coding skills, and ability to optimize solutions rather than test your memorization of computer science theory. Save the CS fundamentals review for other companies that explicitly test those areas.\n\nThat said, having solid fundamentals knowledge never hurts and can sometimes help you think through algorithmic problems more effectively, but it shouldn't be your focus right now. Google interviewers are trained to evaluate candidates on coding ability, communication, and technical reasoning within the context of algorithmic challenges. Spend your remaining prep time getting comfortable with medium-difficulty problems, practicing coding on a whiteboard or shared document, and being able to clearly explain your thought process.
