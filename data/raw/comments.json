You'll be faster using Prefect or whatever other python orchestrator than you will with n8n. Why? Because n8n wasn't built for complex data pipelines. Your boss can choose; would he rather you spend your time building out more exciting use-cases or grappling with trying to force a square peg into a round hole.\n\nAs someone who has built a declarative saas Orchestra-tion tool (I am not saying what it is but you can guess which one!) I've often struggled conceptually to define why we're better than something like n8n for data use-cases, and I think fundamentally it just has to do with the level of abstraction. It's the same as any orchestrator really\n\nwhen you bake in the things data engineers need it's a lot more than just firing off an API request, which n8n does exceptionally well ;)",

So you might imagine how that sucks if you have a good processor. Think Apple M series, Intel i series, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, Spark will use all the available cores of your machine and you will essentially run your app concurrently with n workers (where n = numbers of cores of your processor).",

MR defaulted to writing every round back to disk before starting the next. This made things significantly slower than a similar operation in Spark.

A little story time: Our team once had a major pipeline outage (fun fact: it was when we upgraded our Hadoop infrastructure to a new major version, what a mess 🤦‍♂️). Suddenly, everyone in the company understood our value, because they saw what broke when our tables and processes went down.\n\nUp until that point, I often struggled communicating our value to stakeholders. Then, during a sales call with a third-party company, they asked me, \"What are your data products?\", I heard it the first time and thought it was just management speak. But actually, it became quite a useful tool for me.\n\nWhile software engineers ship visible features, data engineers build invisible infrastructure. Our work powers decisions, reports, and systems behind the scenes. That makes it hard to demonstrate value.\n\nTechnically speaking, I'd define a data product as a composition of assets that, taken together, deliver a result with business relevance(!). Assets can be anything involved in the process: input tables, queries, processes, models, intermediate results, etc. If we're talking Airflow specifically (because this is well known by most), that means tables, Dags, tasks, everything involved in delivering the outcome.\n\nFrom a data engineering perspective, data products are a communication framework to make our work visible. Simple concept, but powerful for explaining what we actually deliver.\n\nFrom a management perspective, a data product is a measurable business asset with clear ROI and accountability. It's something you can point to during budget discussions, assign ownership to, and track performance against defined SLAs.\n\nHowever, not every table, task, or Dag is a data product, but it might be part of one. It's a good exercise to identify them by looking at: Business impact (if this disappeared tomorrow, would executives notice? Would customers be impacted?), orchestration complexity (we had a super Dag triggering lots of other Dags, that was a clear sign for a data product), and high-value consumption (multiple teams depending on it, feeding executive dashboards, etc.).\n\nLook at all your data assets, try to group them together as data products, and also learn what value those data products generate (e.g. what are the tables, reports used for? Is there any measurable impact like revenue, cost savings, increase retention times along the chain?). This will help you to communicate the value of your work, be it internally or when applying for a new job and it helps understanding what needs monitoring and observability.\n\n**Basically: When they work, they're invisible. When they break, everyone notices.**",

As an example Sentry is built on top of a self managed clickhouse.\n* In general anything that needs fersh data, quick queries, high throughput, high concurrency, etc. Canva for instance serves +200M users with a managed clickhouse\n\nFolks that used OLTP for analytics (postgres, mysql, redshift) are moving to clickhouse and others looking for fast queries on their data warehouse (bigquery, snowflake).\n\nThere are some pains on managing it yourself, but in general is great technology.",

I worked with a Microsoft MVP (recent MVP), author of several books, and expert level. His academic training is religious studies.\n\nIt’s also true that a non-computer science background puts you at a disadvantage you should consider. It would be wise to strategically plan how you will overcome this gap - and which areas you need to cover in what order. Surely, you don’t need to go back to school and major in it - but you also can’t ignore it. \n\nIt sounds like you are approaching this in a very logical manner. I suggest you spend some time looking at real colleges, reviewing their requirements for computer science (classes) and look through some syllabus’s. The outcome of this exercise is to gain visibility in what you are missing - essentially benchmark. Then you can look at this and see what you think is relevant to you. For example a class in TCP/IP may not be so important for data engineering. This should  all your anxiety by helping you to understand how you fit. Once you find some classes you think you are missing, just look at the syllabus, find the book, and buy the previous version of the book on Amazon for $10. Read it, study it, master it - move on. \n\nI really don’t see computer science degrees teaching data warehousing - so keep this in mind. You might be better off starting with Kimball (follow my same instructions). I would prioritize star schemas over compilers!\n\nEdit: a computer science degree isn’t a finish line, it’s a piece of paper. Looking at my peers, 20 years later, some of them were brilliant and really accelerated in their careers. Others got A’s on tests but couldn’t do hands on. They didn’t survive in the real world. I did very poor on tests, well on labs, and great post university. It’s all about how you apply your knowledge - the piece of paper only gets you the job interview.",

Move the early steps, such as intent parsing, task planning, and tool calls, to smaller models like gpt-4o-mini or claude haiku. Keep gpt-4 for final synthesis. That shift alone can drop query cost from around $0.75 to roughly $0.30.\n\nThen tighten the workflow: cache outputs, remove duplicate sub-queries, and resolve data conflicts before the LLM using a simple source hierarchy (billing wins). When conflicts remain, show them to the user with context.\n\nLangfuse is great for tracing, but you’ll also want per-tenant caps and cost alerts at the orchestration layer. Once you hit about 5,000 users, that’s a must.\n\nThat $75k/month burn is real, but with routing alone, you can get it down to $35-40k.",

In the project I'm working on, there are hundreds of clusters, it's impossible to manage, track and make the necessary changes manually. When we use Terraform, these tasks are abstracted using Git. And there is also DABs (Databricks Asset Bundle) which is based on terraform to manage the databricks assets.",

SSIS can handle on‑prem migrations, but you’ll write more glue and own the failure modes. If you stick with SSIS: use the SSIS Catalog (project model), environment variables, SQL Agent with retries/alerts, CDC components, bulk-load to staging then MERGE, and a metadata-driven pattern (BIML helps).

More pipeline-focused.\n\n**Orchestrator built-ins (dbt, Dagster, Airflow):** These track lineage *within their domain* but don't connect downstream to your actual reports/dashboards. You get table → table lineage but it dies at the data layer. No BI tool integration, no report ownership tracking.  \n  \n**Commercial:** Collibra, Atlan, Select Star, Monte Carlo - all have report lineage features. Expensive. Some have limited BI connectors or require their agents everywhere.  \n  \n**TL;DR:** If you want report → dataset → pipeline end-to-end lineage with ownership/KPIs attached, you need a proper catalog. DataHub if OSI-approved open source matters (procurement, contributions, full commercial freedom), OpenMetadata if the SaaS restriction doesn't affect you, commercial tools if you've got budget and specific BI tool needs.  \n  \nThe gap most orgs hit: their orchestrator shows them pipeline lineage, but nobody knows which dashboard broke when table X changed.

First DE assess the DBT code, snowflake way of handling features, then back to the data model. Sometimes, changes needs to be made at the snowflake level or at DBT level or at the process level like incremental load vs full refresh and model doesn't need to be changed. That way you have everything in place, easy to debug, easy to document and track.  ",

One day you will want to add unit tests for the transformation, for corner cases, etc. and having logic in pure functions (functions that takes DataFrame and return DataFrame) will simplify things, because you won't need to mock i/o, but can just write tests.\n2. Move configuration logic away from transformation logic. You can create a singleton \"context\" class or an abstract class for the \"job\" and re-use it everywhere. When I say \"configuration\" I mean things like partition dates, input schemas or s3 paths. Again, it will simplify both maintenance (anyone who wants just to check a path or a config do not need to dive into transformation logic) and testing (you can test config and transformation separately).\n3. Do not write a very long chain of pyspark transformations, it is really hard to read. Instead separate logical parts into small functions. Simplify reading the code, transformation and testing.\n\nOverall: the main benefit of using PySpark DF API over SQL is that you can benefit from all the Python tooling for working with growing complexity of the codebase (functions, classes, imports, objects, tests, etc.). So, such a migraton, imo, makes sense only if you are going to use this benefits. In other words, you should start thinking about your ETL as about the software product and use the correspondence best practices. If you just convert SQL to DF API calls it will be much worser: you won't use benefits of DF API, but you will suffer from downsides of DF API.",

Ideally once a year so that you can can use the latter one to look for improvements or failures.\n\nI've found this to be extremely successful, with comments from users like this priceless one: **\"the metrics aren't well-organized or very accurate so whenever I need a metric I look for multiple redundant metrics and just average them together.\"**\n\nI then took the survey results, formatted them into insight categories, and used them to create some projections, like:\n\n* Query writing cost:  20% of the 200 users provided survey responses, we'll assume that this is a representative sampling.  Based on this it appears that new queries take an average of 2 hours to validate we're using the data correctly, given X new queries per month this translates to Y total time and vast friction.  Given improvements in the data model & data catalog we believe that we can get this down from 2 hours to 15 minutes - which saves us Z total time.\n* Data quality cost: same approach\n* ETL & modeling cost: same approach\n\nGood luck!",

Specifically, my suggestion would be for them to simplify the model as they work on delivering on the roadmap initiatives and focus on decluttering one entity in the model during each initiative.\n\nAlso, a nice side effect will be downstream items consuming the model will break as you make the updates.

It has helped us accelerate onboarding time, reduce debugging, optimize pipelines and rationalize compute. Instead of provisioning multiple large personal clusters on databricks for each contributor, we can do the same with a single SQL warehouse serverless and some k8s, for a cheaper infrastructure cost.\n\nI witness a lot of poor Dataiku deployments with poor architecture choices, relying on the underperforming DSS engine for most task.

Environment and Deployment\n * Poor Environment Isolation: Requires cross-environment connections (e.g., Staging to Production).\n * Manual Bundles: Deployment is a manual, proprietary \"Bundle\" system. It ignores standards repository  like Nexus/Artifactory and consumes a lot of  disk space.\n2. Kubernetes  Use\n * Inefficient:  Dataiku-built images are  large and vary by environment.\n * rigid : It's difficult to set accurate resource requests and limits for efficient cluster operation.\n3. Vendor Lock-in\n * Value Trapped: All core data science/analytics value is locked inside the platform runtime . \n * Despite being Python-based, best practices steer us toward using Dataiku-specific libraries, making migration very complex.\n4. Operational Overhead\n * High Boilerplate Tax: Significant custom coding is required just to make the platform reliable (e.g., managing logs, users, and bundles).\n\n\nNote that Dataiku is API-driven, and a lot is possible with the api, but solving these issues requires an insane amount of custom engineering effort.",

Perhaps it is assuming a data type for that column and converting to float? ok, then let's try this:\n\n    > sed 's/0/9/g' worldcitiespop.csv > ./worldcitiespop.0-to-9.csv\n    \n    > zsv select ./worldcitiespop.0-to-9.csv -W -n -- 2 1 3-7 > /tmp/zsv.0-to-9.out\n    # ^^^ runs without error, as expected\n    \n    > duckdb -c \"COPY (from './worldcitiespop.0-to-9.csv' select #2, #1, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7) TO '/tmp/ddb.0-to-9.out'\"\n    Conversion Error: CSV Error on Line: 173277\n    Original Line: ba,anici,Anici,BD,,44.8489556,18.8372222\n    Error when converting column \"Region\".

As a non-regular duckdb user, I did not expect this\n    # just because I replaced 0 with 9 in the original CSV\n\nI didn't try to address these issues and then re-compare on performance.\n\nzsv was designed not to make opinions about your data, without explicit instructions otherwise. I understand there are a lot of good reasons in favor of being opinionated by default, but that's a separate matter. Re performance, I suspect if duckdb is using indexing or parallelization, which is not yet implemented in zsv, it could be much faster in elapsed time where core/CPU is not maxed, but I can't see anything from these quick tests suggesting that DuckDB is faster in total CPU time or in a single-threaded environment, or in an environment where all CPU cores are otherwise being maxed out. I'm not even sure DuckDB's output is correct when it doesn't report an error (see above example with the extraneous text in the output)-- I see plenty of recent issues reported that DuckDB does not handle double-quotes correctly, though at least some seem to have been resolved. That said, I'm very interested in any evidence anyone finds to the contrary of this brief dive!",

I will comment again when I have verified for certain but I believe that your tests show that DuckDB and Polars can be much faster in \"wall clock\" time if they parallelize (multi-thread) and the computer is not CPU+core bound, but that ZSV is still far faster on a per-pipeline / thread basis-- notice that the user time is 3x and 5x faster, respectively (which is actually a much better difference than I would have anticipated).\n\nI suspect DuckDB and Polars are only able to parallelize when they are not reading from a stdin stream and by making certain assumptions about the CSV, that could break under certain input conditions... but I may be wrong.\n\nI know that all of the above sounds a bit conjectural and unsupported, so I am not expecting to convince anyone here-- just mentioning, and I will go do some digging and verify either way. Once I have done that, I will update the zsv home to provide more clarification per whatever those findings are.\n\nIn any case, I appreciate the comments!",

        "body": "If you want this to run in near real time, the classic route is CDC out of Postgres with Debezium or logical replication, pipe those events into something like Kafka or Redpanda, and do the denormalization in a stream processor like Flink before writing to ClickHouse or BigQuery. That setup gives you second-level latency, but it’s a lot of infra to maintain and debug.\n\nIf you’re okay with a few minutes delay, it’s usually easier to land raw CDC tables in a warehouse using a managed connector and build an incremental dbt model that joins them together. You can re-materialize the wide table on a schedule, and it’s much simpler to manage than a full stream topology. For 500M rows, ClickHouse will handle this fine if you pick a good sort key; BigQuery works too, but watch out for costs on frequent MERGE operations. I wouldn’t rely on triggers in Postgres unless you have a very low write rate. they’re painful to debug and can slow your OLTP side.\n\nWhat kind of latency do you actually need, and are those 7 tables small dimension tables or all large fact-like tables? \n\nAs a fully managed solution, you could check out Estuary. It can handle log-based CDC and any of your destinations + a bunch of cool features like schema evolution. I work at Estuary, so take that into account.",

The goal of the library isn’t to replace pandas, but to save people from rewriting the same pattern every time: extract the columns, modify them, and reindex. Functions like `swap_columns` or `move_after` just centralize that logic, handle bulk operations, validate inputs, and keep everything consistent so users don’t have to think about the mechanics each time.\n\nAbout `sort_columns`: yes, the pandas one-liner works perfectly. The value of having a single entry point is mostly convenience. You can switch between variance, std, mean, correlation, NaN-ratio, or a custom key without changing how you write the code. For some workflows that reduces friction; for others the built-in one-liners are already enough.\n\nAppreciate you taking the time to look at it and share your thoughts.",

So they just start there...\n\n\nSince I'm so new, I think it might help if I do a lot of small tutorials (Github project-based learning/build your own x, big book of small python projects, or automate the boring stuff) to get exposure to what projects look like and what I'm capable of.*\n\n\nI'm currently doing things that I find fun (learning DSA and reading books like Eloquent JS), but I plan to incorporate your advice soon. \n\n\nI think it's a matter of taking one big topic, breaking it down until you can't, researching those broken down topics, then breaking it down more until you have something actionable. \n\n\nI just haven't done that for personal projects much yet, so it's easy to feel overwhelmed. \n\n\n.\n\n\n*Perhaps since I enjoy learning how things work, I can use what you said and learn how to make something like YouTube (or whatever else works) until I can recreate a crappy version myself. \n\n\nI won't be building my \"own idea\", but I'll learn the skills needed to do so (similar to what my initial idea of learning from those other materials, but framed in a different way). \n\n\nIdk, I'm just rambling.

I was only able to do a semester of computer science, but I was attending a university generally quite well regarded for their computer science / cybersecurity programs. I ended up having to stop attending for financial reasons, unfortunately. \n\nAnyway, what I LOVED about their program is that it broke everything down to the fundamentals. It's been a few years so some of the following may be incorrect. This is just an example, but they had us learning C++ and started us off by learning how a computer works. Then they had us learning how a variable is basically just assigning a name to a block of memory, and storing data in that location. Or how arrays are sequentially assigned blocks of memory, so if you know where X index of an array is located in the memory, you can find the other indexes. How you can't dynamically increase the size of the array due to how C++ is reserving memory, how typing works, etc. \n\nI find that with most learning resources, they just don't even *attempt* to explain how a particular thing works beyond a basic level. But then when you try to wade into the waters of reading documentation, it's so filled with technical jargon that it's often incomprehensible to a beginner. \n\nI don't want to build legos and just slap stuff together. I don't want to know how to USE a particular programming concept, I want to actually know how it works. \n\nI recall when I was younger, attempting to build some small projects. Inevitably, I would write a bit of code that I thought understood in one project, and try to re-use the same concept in another project with a slightly different use-case, only to find that it fundamentally was not doing what I originally thought it did. When that happens now and again? Not a big deal. When that's happening pretty frequently? It becomes frustrating, and it makes me think that even when I can re-use a concept in multiple projects successfully, that I still don't totally get what it's doing. \n\nThat's the issue that I have with trying to learn by just trying to make something. I care a lot less about making any one particular project, and a lot more about knowing how everything I'm doing actually functions. \n\nAnyway, huge block of text over. If anyone has any advice for where/how to learn things in a way that is more complete than \"this is X, use it like this.\", I would love you forever. I've currently just been working my way through boot.dev's python course.",

Graduated 4 years ago and got into software dev role two years ago and was promoted to lead after 1 1/2 years.  \nI will give you some honest advice.\n\n1. Get that thought of \"letting anyone down\" out of your head right now. It will kill you mentally and will lead to burnout eventually. Just do the best you can in the time and the resources you are given. It's a job and you and your job are replaceable, your mental wellbeing is not replaceable. There is no point in beating yourself.\n2. As a lead developer it means honest communication towards your boss is paramount. Do not lie and be real. Don't be afraid to say \"I don't know.\". If you do not know something, your answer also should be \"I will try to find out.\". If you land in a dead end for a problem, just be upfront if anyone asks. It's also a learning experience for you, no one was born a master and mistakes happen. The best employee is someone who is honest with his bosses so they can make the best business decisions. When you are stuck do not be afraid to ask for help.\n3. Build prototypes and MVPs (minimum viable product) if needed to test things out before diving deep into frameworks or libraries. That way you mitigate the risk of making bad decisions, which are only noticed weeks or months later.\n4. Since you are working alone you need to be really self organized. Write notes, write documentations, make todo lists for yourself (e.g. a small scrum project management, a kanban board). That way it's also easier to get a grasp on what your goals are, what you are doing. This also has the advantage if someone asks you, you have everything in your hand.",

AI, at least right now, is prone to bad coding style, prone to bugs, prone to weird decisions. A person who lets an AI do his task for him and does not oversee the result, he also will leave such nonsense in his project. And it will be visible to recruiters. Some recruiters for sure will leave out such people.\n\n2)interview stage: when a person does not know what he is doing it will be much more apparent during the interview. He can't explain why he wrote his project the way he wrote (well, the way his AI wrote). He is unable to make changes when asked. Sometimes the interview will give him Leetcode exercise. As he did not solve his assignments on his own, he will be unable to solve these Leetcode exercises on the spot.\n\n3)probation period. First 4 months or so. Then the team is testing if the person is even suitable for the job. A person who just relies on an AI will generate more nonsense to pull requests. He will have more issues with his task. Perhaps the internal team blocks certain AI-tool-related communication and he can't even use the AI tool. Because some projects are proprietary and the client has not given permission to use cloud-based AI tools. The person most likely will fail in these 4 months and has to leave.\n\nSo, do not care much about such people. Concentrate on your own studies. They will not have an easy shortcut to a paycheck.",

It’s pretty easy to go to C++ with an uunderstanding of C, but hard to come back to C when you’re accustomed to things like vectors, stdlib functions and so on.\n\nI urge you to have atleast a minimal amount of pure C programming in low level fundamentals like memory, containers like arrays and so on. You can continue using C++, but you’re still being abstracted away from low level, just that you still have an option should you choose it.\n\nBy extension, learn a tiny bit of assembly as well. It’s generally impractical and isn’t seen as a general use language, but it comes in handy some times. Not to mention the theoretical understanding you develop in learning to use it, and a few discouraged programming paradigms that it makes you use like goto. It makes you think in interesting ways.",

You’ll learn way more by diving deep into data structures, algorithms, and systems programming than by trying to juggle two paths at once. Add Git, Linux, and CMake early, and after each topic, build something small, a console app, a mini game, or even your own data structure implementation. That’s where real learning happens.

But they were awesome and genuinely pushed for it, you sometimes had to work late or a weekend for a release in prod but you got taken care of, worked 3 hours at 2am due to an escalation? Go ahead and take all of Friday off and relax, worked for a release Sunday night just take all of Monday off. And they actively forced you to take that time for yourself to recharge even with huge deadlines looming, my old company would have had you doing 80 hours that week and nothing reward you at all. That company was also big on giving you time during the week to learn and do your own stuff to improve yourself and leave early to miss traffic or come in after morning meetings so your commute is easier.",

It focuses heavily on electrical theory and its application to digital systems. Main focuses are electronic components, signalling systems, control systems, circuitry, embedded and integrated systems, logic design, and system programming. Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering students will typically have a high degree of common courseload.\n\nComputer Engineering students at most universities will do a lot of VHDL/Verilog programming, as well as a lot of C programming. CE programs often include a number of compulsory Software Engineering courses focuses on operating systems and data structures; at some institutions these courses may fall under Computer Science.\n\nComputer Engineering is not for the faint of heart. It is brutal, but if you enjoy the guts of computers, you will love it.\n\nSoftware Engineering is a fairly new Engineering discipline and is still not as widely accredited as Computer Engineering. Software Engineering is an endeavour to apply the principles of engineering (ethics, public interest, safety, principled design, etc...) to what has historically been a tradecraft.\n\nPurist arguments aside, Software Engineering focuses almost exclusively on the practical aspects of programming and software development with a light dusting of multi-discipline studies.\n\nA spate of high-profile and high-casualty structural failures (bridges, buildings, viaducts, waterworks, etc...) during the early 1900s taught us that traditional engineering disciplines needed to be carefully regulated to ensure that members of the public weren't put into danger by people who had no idea what they were doing.\n\nA spate of high-profile and sometimes high-casualty software and/or control system failures (Therac-25, Cherynobyl, Three-Mile Island, the entire company of Boeing, Mars Climate Orbiter, etc...) during the 1970s through 2000s taught us the same thing about software development. Everyone involved in critical design and decision making needs to have their eye on the ball at all times; failing to do so can result in death.\n\nComputer Science is a field of applied mathematics and is more concerned with theory and abstract concepts than practical application of those concepts. I once worked with an individual with a PhD in Computer Science who hadn't done *any* actual programming; his interests were largely data driven business analytics.\n\nWhereas Computer Engineering and Software Engineering are accredited Engineering programs with a fairly standardized level of instruction across institutions, Computer Science is not. A Computer Science program at one institution may be radically different than a Computer Science program at a different institution.\n\nIn Summary,\n\nIf you think you might enjoy Computer Engineering, buy yourself an inexpensive FPGA development board such as the [Terasic DE10-Nano](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=167&No=1046) or ask for one for christmas. If you enjoy mucking about with that, then Computer Engineering is the field of study for you.\n\nIf you think that you might enjoy Software Engineering, start biting your teeth on C and C++ if you haven't done so already, do some tutorials in Qt (or any other application development framework), and get familiar with POSIX operating systems\n\nIf you think that you might enjoy Computer Science, study the differences between binary search trees, B-Trees, and B+-Trees. Read up on the latest AI craze. Try and understand what a Quaternion is and how it is used in 3D graphics.\n\nFeel free to throw any questions my way.",

It's useless to just have knowledge if you can't \"run\" fast enough, or \"jump\" high enough, mentally-speaking, to do actually code at an effective level. That's why using generative AI to help too much is basically  shooting yourself in the foot, as you're wasting all that time and money for no actual gain.\n\nComputer Science mostly involves math and logic.

You need to know what to learn and at what point. Then once you think you got it by reading the theory you must prove it to yourself by doing a project and using the theory to build something. Here the Odin Project also does a great job. You learn the theory and then you build a project they provide where for each project you need all the theory you were supposed to learn prior. The course is hard and takes a long time to finish but imo is far better than a 5 hour youtube tutorial. Just watching someone code or just copying a project is not the same as creating your own version of a project which you will be required to do in the Odin Project. It reads like an ad but I did use it to learn Web Development and I just legit think it's a fantastic course if you are ready to put the time and effort in.",

Remember that a computers biggest strength is that it does exactly what you tell it to do. The only problem with that is it does EXACTLY what you tell it to. Knowing how to tell it something and knowing what to tell it are very different things. \n\nLike everyone is saying, the only real way to learn how to program is to just program. Make things. Make things work. Break things, then fix them so they work. You can spend 10 years learning the theory but until you actually code something it just won't really click. Like trying to learn to be a mechanic by watching YouTube but never actually touching a car. Sure, you could figure things about and fix them, in theory, but if your car actually broke down well, don't strip your nuts over tightening~ \n\nPick a project/s and just code them out.

Maybe a mod for one of your favorite video games. Do a little research into a good language for making that happen, then just make it.\n\nIf you want to do low-level programming, such as interfacing with an operating system, C++ will be more useful.

Almost any language can solve almost any problem though, and you can ask which of two languages to use and get 20 different answers, and all of them will have merit.",

If it fails, then you go and investigate why and you’ll almost certainly learn something valuable. If it succeeds, compare its code to yours and pay attention to every minute difference. Edit your original code and see what that fixes it; alter the generated code and see what changes; follow the logic and make sure you have an actual understanding of what’s going on. Learning is an active experience. You can’t just sit there and passively absorb understanding by witnessing something. \n\nAt the end of the day, you still have to work to reap any substantial benefits from using AI as a learning tool.

And it doesn't get easier. I *think*, but I'm not sure, that we get faster at it.\n\nMy steps.\n\n1. Reproduce the problem, if possible. Get to the point where you can make the problem happen every time. If possible. Understand the inputs and other things that cause the failure.  \n\n   There are some bugs that are intermittent. Those are the worst. You can learn about [race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) someday, but not today.\n\n   If it's your thing write a test case which generates the bug.\n\n2. Try to figure out exactly which line of code caused the bug. If you get a traceback or other error message, it can tell you this. The top line of the traceback (bottom line in Python, why, Guido, why, did you do this backwards?) probably shows you the source file and line number where the problem occurred.\n\n3. Eyeball the code and the error message. Read the error message three times carefully; it often tells you exactly what is wrong in a language you don't quite understand.\n\n4. Learn to use a debugger to step through your code line by line. Start stepping (set a breakpoint) a few lines before the suspect line and do step step step. \n\n5. Try putting in a fix to the problem.\n\n6. Repeat these steps.\n\n7. If you get frustrated after doing all this, take a break. Get a good night's sleep. Sometimes the answers to my bugs have come to me in dreams. Seriously.\n\nMost importantly:\n\n**Always remember that debugging is harder than programming. Don't use all your cleverness programming something, because you'll never be able to debug it.**\n\nYou got this. Welcome to our great trade.",

Did the program crash or is it still running? — it will very likely range from a little bit tedious to extremely tedious the first couple of times you pay this much attention to an error message, but relatively quickly you’ll build a mental model of all this and you’ll be able to skim error messages quickly and come up with a full hypothesis of what’s wrong and how to fix it. You’ll start to understand things like how the tracebacks are presented in your programming language, sometimes the most relevant details are at the top, sometimes they’re at the bottom — and plenty of other useful little details\n\nUse the actual debugger for your programming environment, and get comfortable with it, ideally through some IDE/text-editor integration. Yes print line debugging is great and useful but it totally pales in comparison to a full blown debugger that lets you set breakpoints and jump through the code function by function, line by line, or breakpoint by breakpoint… Combining that with the skills/intuition that come from reading error messages will be extremely valuable for you and save you an absolutely unreasonable amount of time throughout a software career compared to not having those skills.",

Run right into the challenges, and with all the hard work you put in, you’ll come out solving the problem. \n\nAlso, we all learn at different speeds, and that’s very ok. You’ll get it, just work through the challenges.",

It is their job to guide students and people who want to start their studies in given university.\n\nBut going purely by a guess then better pick software engineering. It should cover more than just a development. Because real life software development is not only writing code but more than that. Software engineering curriculum should be more relevant.

Non-IT people (HR, managers and such) are investing more into AI tools because they think that the AI is better than a human developer. And they are not hiring juniors that much. As a software developer I say, the current AI is performing perhaps worse than some junior developers. Yes, it can generate code but it requires a constant overseeing. Or it will generate nonsense that a)does not compile, b)deletes existing functionality, c)introduces bugs, d)does not cover all the required use cases.\n\nWhen the bubble will pop then there will be again more openings for juniors.

Depending on how exactly you define this problem, those are between 1000!/900! to 1000\\^100 sequences, which is about 2\\^1000. There must be one number (seed) for every possible sequence. So that seed would have to be up to 1000 bits long, so around 125 bytes (octets). This is about 10x longer than the \"10-15 characters\" that you were hoping for, more if you were hoping for ASCII characters.\n\n\nIn general: there is no free lunch for compression. All compression techniques rely on the data having some pattern that can be described more compactly than just using the raw data.\n\n\nFurther reading:\n\n\n* Shannon entropy is a concept for describing how much information is in a piece of data. This measures how \"surprising\" the data is. Compressed data cannot be shorter than the Shannon entropy in bits. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory\n* Kolmogorov complexity describes the theoretically most compact representation of data, i.e. how long a program would be that reproduces the data. In your model, the seeds would correspond to programs that generatea sequence. The seeds cannot be shorter than the sequence's Kolmogorov complexity. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity\n* The Pigeonhole Principle is a useful technique for thinking through these kinds of problems. Here, I used this principle to notice that the size of the seed (pigeon holes) must be at least as large as the number of distinct sequences (pigeons) I want to generate. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle",

( if there are no Household tasks left )\n\nSometimes i really get into something and i spend every hour on learning/coding/reading and other weeks only a few. \nI try to setup my tasks i want to do in the morning, on low energy weeks i try to at least repeat some of the things i learned in the last few weeks so it does not get lost.\n\nBut my main take away is don’t force it as studying that needs to be done but as something fun you are doing. \nMost of the times i’m proud of what i learned and feel the energy to go on. Use what you learned, automate something, build a useful little app that makes your life easier.  \n\nIn this moment i’m learning python, but i really hated the dependencies and setting up the venvs and the testers and testing. So i went a little deeper to really understand that part and automated it. So now if i start a new project i run a makefile and it sets up the venv, main dependencies, linters, and a basic unit test. So i can start a new project or tutorial without worrying. While i learned a lot about dose parts. Next up ( i’m a devops engineer ) is setup the same thing for a basic CI/CD to eventually get my python code up into docker on my local homelab. These things i spend about 20/25% of my time on, i learn something for my job, i learn more about python and in the meanwhile i make my own life easier.\n\nMain get away is, enjoy the process! Have fun! Build things you like or miss. Then you can do a lot without burnout. Burnout does not really happen when it’s fun, it mostly comes from forcing your self to do things X amount of time while not enjoying it.",

And then you have a new problem: figuring out why your solution is wrong.\n\nThis isn't a problem. It's just how programming works. If you are easily frustrated by this, then the solution is either to just keep learning and practicing and doing problems until it doesn't bother you as much, or else find a new hobby with fewer built-in frustrations.\n\nRegular practice is key. There are lots of good problem sets out there. For Python, I'm a fan of the Exercism tracks, although they can be a little unfriendly for very new programmers.",

Like when you play tic-tac-toe, you both see the actual board with Xs and Os, and you imagine how the board will look once you place your next mark.\n\nThat is also how software works, there is some sort of output, if not explicitly graphical or visual, at least observable in some way, and there is an invisible internal representation, that you can't experience, but that the program \"knows\" and uses to decide its next move, or determine who won. \n\nAnd in both games and programs there's input that manipulates the internal model - often with very different results, depending on the previous state of that model.\n\nAnd of course, games have rules - often you follow an actual algorithm when playing a game, or at least you have some fixed pattern of steps to perform, and there is, if not an algorithm, then a fairly strict way of determining a winner or loser, or if the game should continue.\n\nAnd most important of all for learning - there is a lot of repetition in games, both as a player and a developer you are iterating a lot, gradually improving, and always trying various combinations. So often you work a lot more with a game than any other program you are creating, you actually enjoy playing your own game, and try to beat it - whereas with a CRUD system for Student administration or a Car Rental, you'll just build one feature and get quickly on with the next one as soon as it seems to work sufficiently.\n\nSo there are a lot of similarities between playing games, creating games, and building programs.\n\nAnd they are often fun to create and use!",

It serves no purpose and makes the code less readable. One would want to break something into separate lines when in one line it becomes too long. Or things like Builders. Instead of what you did, write \"System.out.println(....\" in one line. The same way how you wrote \"keyboard.next() in one line not in two lines.\n\n2. Give meaningful names to your variables. What is a? What is b?\n\n3. Read about methods. Your main method is too long. You can take out the quitting part and separate mathematical operation parts into separate methods and then use these in your main method.\n\n4. Move the definition of your variables after the quitting block. Because there is no point to define these variables when you never set a value to them with your quitting. Here it has no effect but in larger programs defining variables you don't use wastes system memory. Also, in your case there is no need to define a variable and set a value to it, separately. You can do just \"double a = keyboard.nextDouble();\" And the same goes for other variables as well.\n\n5. Don't add comments unless necessary. Your code should be self-descriptive. I suggest to read about Clean Code standards. Add comments when the code itself can't explain the existence of itself: why the code is there, why it does what it does, etc.",

The second part is sometimes not something that you can see.\n\nGuys I work with heavily rely on AI. Here is what I have noticed since I have to review their code. They understand the code it generates. But they don't understand or aren't aware of the problems the AI is trying to solve. So when it implements a solution,  it looks correct, it technically does what it said it does, but it's often not actually correct...even when it looks like the code is working. \n\n- AI will happily reinvent the wheel. Not only that,  it will reinvent a slightly incorrect wheel and each wheel will be slightly different, even though it's supposed to be the same wheel. \n\n- The best way to have no bugs in your application is to delete all your code. AI will happily delete your code. We did a review where a guy was having problems with authentication. He just kept feeding the errors into AI. What did AI do? It deleted the entire Authentication system in the front-end and hardcodwd an API key in it's place. Problem solved 😂😂😂. \n\n- I am constantly finding race conditions in the code these guys submit. Why? Because they aren't aware of the implications of the code they are submitting.\n\nNow I work with another guy who does know what he's doing. He has AI write a lot of the code. But he is constantly correcting AI. Telling it that what it produced is garbage. He can make AI iterate to a correct solution a lot of the time. Other times, it's just quicker to write it yourself because the AI just doesn't get.\n\nWhen I was learning, I recognized that I didn't know what I didn't know. Knowing thst this class problems even exists in the first place is 99% of the battle. What separates experienced developers from junior developers is knowledge of what types of problems exist. \n\n\n\nNow as far as learning, I relied a lot on YouTube tutorials, books, Google, stackoverflow etc to learn concepts and how to make something.  In my case, there was a project that flipped the switch for me. I went from not knowing how to do anything other than stupid little college programs to \"holy shit...it makes sense now\". That was a project that I actually made for a group and they actually used it. And in using it, they ran into all kinds of problems. Encountering those problems and thinking about why they are occurring and then solving them...that's what really started my learning. Most of my solutions came to me during long showers 😂😂😂.  Once you start to understand those problems, you start to realize that there's even problems. And that opens up a whole new world. You can get out of Tutorial hell and know what actually research.",

        "body": "Well, when you have solved the performance bottlenecks of the network and the database, then you just need a programming language that isn't slower than those two. I guess that anything developed in the past 40-50 years should be fast enough.\n\nRegarding scalability - what do you mean? Scaling the number of users, the number of requests, the frequency of requests, the number of services involved in each request? Scalability isn't just a word you can slap on the entire application, you need to be more specific. Also, it has more to do with the chosen architecture than the programming language - every language can scale to billions of objects without issues.\n\nWhat should the AI do? And why is that part of the REST API? There is usually no AI in REST, on the contrary, REST is (mostly) supposed to always return the same responses to the same requests - something AI doesn't really do.\n\nAnd finally - what do you actually mean by \"build my own REST API\"?   \nEvery single time you create an application that accepts HTTP requests, you kind of \"build your own REST API\" - it is literally just accepting requests and returning responses. Are you perhaps confusing an actual application with the interface to talk to it?",

You get good scalability with this approach: nodejs's Cluster functionality lets you run multiple long-lived server processes in parallel.\n\nIt also offers robust database connection pooling, which helps with getting good performance under heavy concurrency.\n\nBy the way, you need to choose a language, a server stack, a database, and a web framework, not just a language, for a project like this. \n\nI suggest Typescript, nodejs, Linux, PostgreSQL, and either Express or Fastify.  If you really want to scale up to black-friday volume, take a look at the HAPI framework. I worked with a guy who supported high-volume production with that at Walmart.com, and he spoke well of it.\n\nMy suggestions. Other people obviously have other suggestions.",

You also develop the skill of being able to parse through documentation, so its the approach many people take. If you are totally new to programming, what I have been doing is first identifying what I want to gain from said language, (for me it was Golang, I want to build software, develop \"engineers\" mindset, and get hired). \n\nThe one thing I have learned overall about programming, is that fundamentally it is the skill of problem solving. I have used python before and when I solve problems, I don't even see the language anymore, I see the problem. I have 3-4 different resources I am using for go specifically. Learn go with tests, learn go the hard way, and Exercism. Each resource fills in gaps for the other. Exercism helps you develop the problem solving skill that is fundamental to programming, Learn go the hard way is a total beginners book on programming with go. Learn go with tests is a more intermediate book I go through after I finish the same topic in both exercism and LGtHW. Its allowed me to immerse myself and not just \"learn go\", but develop the problem solving and engineers mindset. \n\nAll this to say, find what works for you. If it is a text based courses and books, then great, if it is a video course, then great, if it is building something, then great. Just experiment around with a 3 different resources max and see what works for you the best.",

A stream is some data coming from a source which may or may not have an end, whereas a a queue is just a FIFO mechanism for processing data. Consider an example outside of programming:\n\n- A “stream of people“ would describe many people passing through some point at some rate without necessarily defining a start, end, or quantity\n- A “queue of people” would describe a line for people to wait in a FIFO fashion. There may not even be any people in the queue at some point in time\n- A stream of people may be entering a building to go wait in a queue, to go wait in one of many queues, or do something else entirely\n- A long and fast moving queue might be described as a stream",

You don't need C++ to make a paint program.\n\nLet me break it down for you:\n\n- Pick a programming language.\n- Figure out how to make interactive programs and draw your own graphics (canvas in JS, Pygame in Python).\n- Figure out how to draw a pixel on the screen.\n- Figure out how to get the position of the mouse, and whether a mouse button is pressed.\n- Draw a pixel under the mouse when the mouse button is pressed.\n\nYou now have a very simple drawing program.\n\nYou can add UI elements for changing colors, clearing the canvas, drawing lines instead of pixels, different brush patterns, etc.\n\nSaving and loading may be a bit...complicated.  You will probably end up using a library to convert pixels into a PNG file.  If you struggle, you can always come back here with a more specific question (\"I'm writing a drawing program as a webpage in JavaScript.  The user puts pixels on a canvas with the mouse.  How do I convert those pixels on the canvas to a PNG file for the user to download?\").\n\nIt's up to you how far you go into the details of graphics drawing.  For example, whether you use the line-drawing function provided by your graphics library, or you [convert a line to pixels yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm).\n\nC++ can be helpful if you want high-resolution, high-performance drawing code for fancy effects, or you want to interface with existing C++ libraries.

You start by copying mostof it ir modifying what's already there. With time you become more proficient and build up a mental repertoire of patterns that are frequently used. With time you will come to the point at which you will be given a task and immediately think of patterns you've used previously. when given a task you break it down into smaller problems like copying files, sending data over a serial connection, receiving, logging to a file or plotting data. You don't have to reinvent the wheel. most of these singular tasks are solved in a similar way most of the time and you only have to tweak or modify according to the current circumstances of the project. So just start small, continue reading a lot of code by others but most importantly stick with writing a lot of code yourself. This is what cements that mental repertoire.",

Go vack to writing again. Got stuck? Repeat the process. Do it again in an hour or the next day.\n\n\nAs you're doing that, try to take time and understand *why* things are laid out that way. Edit things to see them break and understand why it broke, and try to build up a mental image of what's going on under the hood. Reverse engineer the algorithm. \n\n\n.\n\n\nI really like drawing out psuedocode and pictures/diagrams to simplify this thinking. \n\n\nIt's a lot harder for me to code, say, binary search by simply memorizing the code structure given to me vs drawing out some numbers in an array and what the process I need to follow to get my solution looks like. The former is rote memorization. The latter is understanding the algorithm in a human way. \n\n\nI use a bit of both to solidify it in my head. \n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nYou'll likely not be able to undesirable the algorithm well and build a mental model of what's going at first. This might happen for every single example you see.\n\n\nThat's ok. \n\n\nHave AI (or an assistant? Peers?) walk you through the code, line by line, and help you understand what's going on. Tell it to give analogies to help you build up that mental model. Watch a few videos on the topic if needed. \n\n\nThen recreate that mental model either explaining it out loud to an invisible class or by writing it out in a picture, diagram, or some other form of psuedocode. \n\n\n.\n\n\nThese mental models turn abstract and distinct ideas into things that build off of each other, helping you not only memorize the solutions, but help ease the learning of new solutions. \n\n\n.\n\n\nI'm going through a DSA course that's about 9 hours long. It sort of speeds through topics. \n\n\nI think I've clocked several times that amount going through it? That's because I'm regularly doing the above. \n\n\nI think that's because these topics he's talking about actually take a much longer time to actually learn properly, but despite it being aimed towards beginners, it's assumed I'm already at the point where these ideas are easily understood. \n\n\nThe curse of knowledge if you will. Which is fine, AI fills in the small gaps of knowledge and I can always research a topic if it gets too confusing. ",

Sure, you can have the URL but without being authenticated, you'll get 401 error.\n\n3. Authorization. Fine, you figure out how to get authenticated. You make a new user. You are using its JWT token. But you are not added to relevant access groups. Maybe you can access your guest / new user related endpoints but nothing else. You might find an admin endpoint but as you lack access rights, you'll get 403 error.\n\n4. Rate limiting. You get this funny idea that you start scanning the host or start brute forcing or something. Your requests per second will be used up and you'll be either banned or timed out for time being.\n\n5. Hosting it behind some weird port. You'd expect a website to sit behind 80, 8080 or 443 port. What if I put it behind 49157? You typing in the URL without correct port will default to 80 and you will get either 404 error or some default placeholder webpage or something. My real service sits behind 49157.\n\n6. Region blocking/whitelisting. Let's say our client gets scam calls and emails from India. He has no business there. Then we can a)blacklist the whole India from accessing the service and Indians will get 404 or b)whitelist only these countries where our client makes his business. Many US services are blocking traffic from the EU because they do not want to comply with European cookie policy. Yes. you might say \"But VPN. I will use my xxxVPN account to appear from Uganda instead!\". Well, a list of IP addresses can and will be associated with certain VPN services. These can be also blocked.\n\n7. VPN blocking. One can use deep packet inspection tools to block people using VPN even when the traffic is encrypted.\n\n8. Honeypots. One can set up a fake environment. Go ahead and scan it and hack it and try to do whatever you want with it. Either you gain nothing with it or you'll leave traces about you behind. Honeypots are there to attract script kiddies and such.\n\n9. Throttling. Alternative to point 4. Instead of getting blocked or timed out your requests will slow down to an unusable level.\n\n10. Security services like Cloudflare. One can leave all the protection to such services. They will deal then with attack detection and mitigation and such.",

The API layer should also have some rate limiting/throttling to prevent spam or abuse. \n\nI do again want to stress that this doesn’t limit someone to only making requests from the extension, someone could just as easily make HTTP requests and include the auth token and pretend they’re using the extension. The point of the authentication layer is that every request is now tied to a user which prevents bots from just spam requesting and lets you ban abusive accounts. \n\nYou should also likely have some form of IP blacklisting to ban suspicious IPs, for your case where this is just a chrome extension it makes sense to also preemptively ban the IP blocks used by the major cloud providers, regular users won’t be using those and it’ll ban bots that are running on servers hosted by them.",

But you can revisit those same problems later using the lens of topology, and make some of it easier and some of it harder.\n\nAdditionally, functional programming typically comes with some very strong guarantees on mutability and which operations are dependent on each other, stronger than can be made in *arbitrary* non-FP contexts. This enables a different class of compiler optimizations. But of course, immutability has many of its own performance downfalls, so it’s incredibly application specific.\n\nTL;DR: functional programming is useful because it’s another tool in your toolbelt for solving very hard problems.",

What people are going to hire you to do is solve a specific problem, and it's up to you to figure out how to do that.\n\nHonestly, you'll have better luck learning something technical that doesn't necessarily require any coding at all - like learn to set up a Wordpress site, or a Shopify site. There are millions of small business owners that need a website and don't even know how to use a no-code drag-and-drop website builder. You could learn to do that in as little as a few weeks.\n\nPart of the trick is learning about various options and steering clients to the right one. Someone with a blog with several different authors would be a good fit for Wordpress. Someone selling handmade jewelry might be good for Shopify. A small number of clients really do need a custom website built from scratch with a React frontend - but most probably don't need that.\n\nIf you want to go that route, though, more than half your time will be spent running a business: marketing, advertising, talking to potential clients who never pay, chasing down payment, and even things like doing taxes and paperwork. Don't get into freelancing if you're not okay with that being half of your job.",

        "body": "SQL is a common language used by lots of different relational databases.\n\nAs a beginner, it doesn't matter that much which SQL database you choose. However, as you get into more advanced stuff, each database is different and has its own dialect of SQL you'll need to master.\n\nMicrosoft SQL Server is one option. If you had to pick another popular one I'd recommend considering PostgreSQL. Note that Microsoft SQL server has free versions but for commercial use it has license fees, while Postgres is open-source so it's completely free, no strings attached. And that doesn't mean it's worse - Postgres is actually quite a bit more scalable and used for some of the largest databases in the world.\n\nI'm not sure you downloaded the right thing. Go here:\n\n[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)\n\nPick \"SQL Server 2022 Express\", that should be ideal for getting started.\n\nFind a tutorial on how to set up SQL Server Express and create your first database. That will be specific to SQL Server.\n\nOnce your database is set up and you know how to type a query, you can now switch to just about any SQL textbook or tutorial, and all of the basics will work the same as any other SQL database.\n\nAlternatively, pick your course first and then choose the database they recommend.",

Instead, the business layer should check for the discount and, if there isn't one, tell the button \"please gray yourself\". The button doesn't know why it's being grayed out and doesn't care. The business layer doesn't know if the site is being displayed on a phone app or on your PC browser because *it* doesn't care.

Your studies WILL continue while working. \n\nIt is okay to ask questions. But then first make effort on your own, read documentation, read completed Jira tasks, read the code, google stuff. When stuff does not work then be ready to tell what you tried, what did not work, and where do you think the problem is or where the problem for sure is NOT.\n\nb)You applied to a job position that does not match with your skills and knowledge. Getting a degree or a diploma does not mean that every job is for you. I have been in the industry for quite many years. But it does not mean that I could pick any job. Even not every entry level job is for me because the tech stack is completely something else than what I studied. For example I can't write stuff in C++ or in C# because I never studied it. I will be able to read it and perhaps try something with trial and error, but I would not be suitable even to work as a junior C++ developer. But if the job would be for a senior Java developer then that would be suitable for me as I know Java.\n\nIn that case you should either learn on the go to survive your current position or face the reality and pick a suitable company.\n\nc)You cheated through your IT studies or were lazy. Having a degree or a diploma does not automatically guarantee that one is suitable for the job. \n\nIn that case better leave the job and learn until you get to the expected level that your diploma or a degree should represent.\n\nSo, based on a), b), and c) you can decide how to proceed. Either it is fine to not know stuff and you should ask others, or you might be either in a wrong company or even should not have applied to a job, yet.",

I'm seeing that you're systematically doing things instead of just \"given this, give me this\".\n\nI'm just worried that your first instinct is to ask AI about the error instead of going through the code first or using the error logs. If you use AI last, that's fine. But it is very important for you to not use AI as much as possible as early as possible as it sounds like you're just learning Java for college.\n\nI suggest that you review the fundamentals again. You can even use AI to create a guideline for you. Just double check its output for accuracy. Then you learn how to debug. Then once you get the fundamentals down, you can go with more complex lessons like OOP, Java-specific things, etc.  You'll know you understand it enough when you start paying more attention to what AI outputs, and you go \"wait, why is it done this way instead of this?\".\n\nAlso I haven't mentioned it yet, but people would agree that another method to learn faster is to find a mentor or ask in Reddit or Discord communities. I don't really know any Discord communities, but I know Java enough, so feel free to ask me questions in the DMs. I'm good to help whenever I'm available.",

Debugging code is where you actually start to build your diagnostic muscles.\n\nAny programmer will have tales of woe of the time they spent hours, if not days, hunting down something as trivial as a badly declared variable.  However, that suffering will have made them better programmers and probably taught them innumerable things they didn't realize at the time.\n\n> I ask AI what I can do too make the program better.\n\nWhile an LLM can barf out code that does stuff, it achieves this feat by stealing all available code from programmers it can find.  Fixing code is something an AI does far less well.  They will, of course, offer suggestions with complete confidence; which is kind of worse.\n\nComputer generated code has always sucked.  Now it's more clever about it, but a human can still put the bots to shame.\n\nA \"better program\" is also rather subjective.  Do you want clearer, faster, or smaller, all of which tend to fight against each other.  It should be what you think is better.  The more you program, the more of an idea you'll have of what your \"better\" is.  The AI's idea of better should not be yours.",

Have you seen the problem or a similar one before? How kind were the interviewers for that particular loop? How desperately do they need a role filled?\n\nHowever, I reject that there was ever a problem with testing how someone does under the pressure of being reviewed by another. In practice, that's what professional development is all the time. Pair programming, collaborative problem solving, and explaining your reasoning to people who are both technical and non-technical. If you freeze up during an interviewer because the interviewer is seeing the code you write as you write it, that's not a problem in the interview process. It's working as intended. Could interviewers do a better job of putting their candidates at ease? Absolutely, but we shouldn't write that skill set off as 'not relevant'.\n\nIt's been a while since I've conducted an interview. But given the recent advancements I'd be inclined to allow my candidates to use coding assistants. A good interviewer was never testing if you solved the problem in the perfect way. They were testing your reasoning and communication skills. And the coding assistant doesn't change that in any way. If you can use the AI in a way that is simply beyond asking it to solve the problem for you, show me that you're capable of reviewing and understanding the code it produces, then communicating that solution to me clearly and engaging in a thoughtful discussion about the solution you'll get a pass in my interview.",

First, find out how to read from the keyboard - usually you'd then get a variable representing which key was pressed.\n2. Then you need to determine what should happen for each key - no matter what you decide, it is probably going to be rules that only you know, so you have to find some way of telling the program what the rules are. But begin by writing them out on paper for yourself. e.g. \"A\" should add 1 each time, \"S\" should add 10, \"D\" should subtract 1, and so on.\n3. Begin by writing a program that only understands two of the rules, like \"A\" and \"S\" or whatever makes sense to you. Probably something like a set of if-statements.\n4. When you have that basic program working, it is time to expand with all the rules - but writing 102 if-statements are going to be annoying! Hopefully you can see some sort of pattern, like if key 'x' is pressed, add value 'n' to the number ...\n5. Maybe you can use a data structure like a `dict` in Python to pair up the key 'x' and value 'n' values, and then find the pressed key in that `dict`, and add the matching number. This will take a bit of research into dicts, but it will be time well spent!",

When you refer to the font file using a relative URL like `url(\"assets/fonts/avenir-pro-fonts/avenir-pro-light/avenirprolight.eot\")`, then the actual URL that the browser will fetch is `/assets/css/assets/fonts/avenir-pro-fonts/avenir-pro-light/avenirprolight.eot` which isn't what you want.\n\nAlso bear in mind that the browser never sees your actual file structure.

But if they lack the mental horsepower and abstraction skills to take what they've learned and add to that knowledge easily, they're still beginners.\n\nAnyways, you can keep a checklist of things you want to learn if you want, but it doesn't really show you anything about your progress towards becoming a decent programmer. That's a far less concrete thing, and has more to do with how your mental development has gone and less to do with the specific things you know.",

In return, instead of containing China, the same countries that were working with the US are now entering into agreements with China and each other.\n\nThe US stock market has been so important and risen so high thanks to the US's economic dominance. As it fades I'm expecting to see a similar fade that we saw as the UK dismantled the remnants of its colonial empire in the post war era, and as Japan's population inverted and its economy stagnated in the 90s and 00's after being an incredibly fast-rising force in the 70s, and 80s.\n\nLook to that for our future, and extrapolate to what that implies for all businesses. We'll probably end up a regional power like we were back in the early 1900s.\n\nSo yeah, long term I'm expecting leaner times as the endless growth that fueled our on-average 8% YOY growth levels off.\n\nSave your money y'all.",

A few of them were obvious showstoppers which meant they hadn’t touched the code at all for five of those “day for day slip!” weeks. It was schedule drama to cover their own issues. \n\nThey did this nine times in a row before they found one bug I hadn’t already fixed and created a tagged release for. Every one before that was known bug, upgrade to 2.0.4 or later to get the fix. I think we ended up with a 1:11 ratio. By then the API was fixed and the test coverage was high so it was mostly performance or security fixes. \n\nEventually everyone in my division caught on to what a clown car they were. Lots of eye contact and eye rolling during project status conference calls",

        "body": "Yep, this is one thing I think a looooooot of execs either underestimate or don't even think about when they decide on a layoff.\n\nWhen I was laid off in early 2023, half the engineering department was let go, so from 16 people down to 8. Had a final meeting with my boss the day before my last day, and he told me they were told it was for two reasons:\n\n1) Rising interest rates were cutting into the bottom line and they were concerned about runway (they had at least several years at the burn rate at the time).\n\n2) They lost their CTO, VP, and Director for the engineering side of things, and the rest of the executive board didn't want to handle a team of 16 engineers directly, so to make things easier they decided cutting the team in half made sense.\n\nIn the few months after the layoff, half of the remaining engineers left for other opportunities, taking the org down to just 4 engineers. Apparently this led to some panic with the execs, and they finally did what I and others wondered why they didn't just do in the first place: they promoted they very capable and well liked lead engineer to VP, giving them their delegation point.\n\nOne of the staff engineers who remained (who I worked with at my job before that one) said they were considering seeing if folks who were laid off might be interested in returning, and flat out asked me, \"If we offered to bring you back, would you?\" Told him I'd really have to think about it, but given the reasons for why the layoff happened I would have a hard time being willing to trust the company wouldn't do it again. He understood and that was the end of that conversation. Sucked too because if I would have been able to just slide back into my job there, as it was before, it would have been a $20k pay bump compared to the job I'd started a few weeks before that conversation took place.\n\nLayoffs lead to further attrition, and it's usually the most capable folks in the org who have avenues they can explore to leave. My manager, for example, gave notice a week after the layoff to go be the founding engineer of another company a buddy of his had started, and had been bugging him to join.\n\nThe entire reason I was at that job was the place I worked before laid off 20% of the company in early 2022, and the attrition afterwards was big. I survived that layoff, the first one I ever survived, but it sucked watching folks I absolutely enjoyed working with leave. Many of them ended up at one or two other companies, and I ended up at one of those companies when one of them suggested they reach out for me to expand engineering. Frustrated with the promotion process and not liking the new landscape of things, being able to interview for two hours (system design and leadership rounds to assess level, no coding) for a $25k pay bump was too tempting.\n\nThere are mental aspects to these things that linger, for everyone regardless of whether they were the ones let go or if they got to stay. I'm not saying layoffs should never happen or are never necessary, but for all the ones I've been through they definitely felt too reactionary and didn't consider the aftershock among those who remained.",

        "body": "You’re not alone in this. I’ve seen a ton of strong engineers go through the same slump lately. The market’s weird right now, and FAANG pedigree doesn’t guarantee callbacks anymore. The good news is you’re still getting final rounds, which means your resume and overall profile are solid. The gap isn’t killing you yet… interview performance probably is.\n\nIf the feedback keeps pointing to system design, that’s where I’d focus. Not the high-level whiteboard stuff, but the gritty parts… tradeoffs, scaling details, and naming specific AWS or database components. It’s less about knowing every service and more about talking through why you’d make certain choices. I’d run 1–2 mock interviews a week with someone who will push you hard on low-level details.\n\nAlso, don’t underestimate the smaller companies. They ghost a lot, yeah, but they also move fast when they’re serious. Sometimes you need to get creative… reach out to engineering managers or founders directly, not just apply through the portal. A short, confident note with a relevant project link can stand out more than another polished resume.\n\nLastly, keep something going that keeps your mind active… consulting, contract work, or even mentoring. It doesn’t have to pay well; it just fills the story for when someone asks what you’ve been doing since the layoff.\n\nYou’re not done… you’re just stuck in the long middle part that everyone forgets to talk about. Keep practicing interviews and treating each one like a live-fire exercise. That’s usually what breaks the drought.",

The OP mentioned spending $300 on a resume rewrite, which is fine if it worked, but there are much more affordable tools with good templates that help you build and organize everything easily, even sending your resume to many recruiters at once.

If you are making stuff up about doing things on the weekend, it’s going to be hard to feel out who shares similar interests. It’s kind of awkward after college to be like ‘You seem chill, wanna kick it sometime?’. It’s way easier to be like ‘I heard you were interested in doing X, I’ve been wanting to check it out’ and then it opens the door to invite them to do something together.

They speak the ancient words: “Here’s the compensation range upfront.”\n\nThose who have encountered this mythical being report strange sensations: curiosity, trust, even mild excitement. Some say they felt seen, as if their GitHub repos and blog posts had finally found purpose.\n\nBut beware: if you speak of them too loudly, they vanish, replaced by fifty new messages about “an amazing Web3 opportunity” that pays “competitive salary (DOE).”\n\nMost dismiss the story as myth. Yet, deep down, every developer checking their inbox still dares to hope - maybe, just maybe, today will be the day the legend returns.",

The thought was if I'm already working crazy hours, I might as well get paid more. Then my old utility field started blowing up due to electrification of everything and I received multiple offers on linkedIn for 40-50% pay bumps (after a 2 year stint not working while going back to school). Left my CS program with about a year left due to class timings and now I have a great work life balance, much higher pay, fully remote and I can use the programming skills I developed to automate a lot of my current work load. Ended up working out well for me. \n\nFor those that are curious, the utility industry is a good place to be right now.

The problem was that the intended way of using a library scaffolding tool was to properly design a schema, but nobody did that and instead used a escape hatch feature of the scaffolding tool to blindly autogenerate a naive API, and the implementation caused all sorts of problems for the \\~300 services that used these bad libraries. And to make things worse, this was a \"cancerous\" type of technical debt, aka the number of bad libraries kept growing over time because people kept using the scaffolding tool the wrong way to create more and more bad libraries.\n\nFixing it was a colossal effort, involving a lot of automation to do the migration heavy lifting and also a lot of manual code changes and manual testing, impacting a ton of teams.

Like pull up some messy production data and ask them to write a query to find something specific. Then watch how they think through edge cases, ask clarifying questions, handle nulls and duplicates. For Python, give them a small script you actually use - maybe something that parses logs or transforms data between formats. See if they can extend it or fix a bug you introduce. The best candidates will ask about the business context, not just dive into coding.\n\nAlso consider splitting the time - 15 minutes on a practical coding exercise, then 15 minutes discussing their approach to debugging, testing, code reviews. Ask about a time their code broke in production and how they handled it. Or show them a piece of your actual codebase and see if they can understand what it does. These conversations tell you way more about whether they'll succeed than watching them reverse a linked list. I've hired people who bombed leetcode but were incredible at understanding business problems and writing maintainable code that other humans could actually work with.",

Actual job performance can vary on multitudes of factors, like motivation, how does the job help them accomplish their professional goals, etc.  \nAlso, 30 minutes is a short time to make a decision on someone who you might be working with for potentially years.  \nI split my interviews in 4 parts:\n1: Introduction about me, what my team is looking for and why they've been selected for an interview, their background and most recent projects they've worked on and what was their role. This could be 20-30 minutes.  \n2: Behavioral side, to assess if they can handle the business side, how easy/difficult would it be to work alongside, etc. -15 minutes  \n3: Technical Assessment: Prepare questions based on their resume to assess if they understand what they've mentioned. If someone says, I did X in my previous job. Can you explain how you did X? - 15 minutes  \n4: Questions from Candidates: The quality of the questions help assess how likely they want this job and understand what's required of them them to be successful-15 minutes(Can be longer if the questions needs to be answered)   \nPro Tip: An ideal candidate fits 80-85% of your criteria and has room to grow. If they meet 100% of the requirements, they're more likely to outgrow the job position quickly and move somewhere else.",

It's usually pretty obvious within a minute or two if the person actually has the level of python expeirence they claim (again you'd be surprised at how many people say they have several years of experience as a senior python engineer then it takes them 5 minutes to remember how to define a function or whatever) and then you can spend the rest of the time gauging their communication skills etc.\n\nWe actually measure internally what % of candidates pass the initial 30 min tech screen and then fail later rounds of tech screens and have experimented with lots of questions, the fizzbuzz-style one had the best outcomes.",

If you’re struggling, let your manager/senior know rather than failing silently. There is nothing wrong with struggling. But there is something wrong if you cry in quiet and put your team and deliverables into risk. If you let them know, they can also communicate with whoever is necessary and take action earlier. This way, if you deliver stuff, perfect move on to the next thing. If you struggle and let them know, you will get the help you needed and everyone will still be happy because they know they can trust you.\n\nAnd second part is learn to be independent and you need to carry some of the burden the team have. Your existence should not be a burden for someone else but rather help them to carry it. Few examples of this could be, actively review pull requests. Don’t wait someone else to tell you to fix something if you see a problem. Write documentation if you know something.

        "body": "60 hours a week is a solid chunk of time to become good at anything, which equates to about 3120 hours yearly.\n\nNow here's the kicker, you either like your job or you don't.\n\nIf you do, then you need to apply 20 extra hours to working more (if you're salary, if not then up to you),\n\nor if you don't like your job then apply that 20 extra hours on another subject.\n\n  \nIf you choose not to apply that time to your job then you're looking at roughly 1000 hours a year, which is what you need to \"master\" or \"grab the hammer\" I call it.  Some guys spend 20 years in C++ optimization and still find new things out today, so they are \"masters\" or \"able to drive nails in one hit\".  That's truly how I look at it, can you walk into an environment and within 10 minutes narrow down a root cause.  If you can't find something that quick then you haven't spent at least 1000 hours studying.\n\nIf you choose to apply those skills to your job then you also need to make sure you aren't a slave to it, then people can control you and make your life a living hell.  If anyone questions why you're there so late/early, or you login for a lot of time, then you can gently slip in that it's part of your \"professional education\".  Literally use those words.\n\nIf you're Indian or Asian (in those countries) then I would be careful with what you give your boss, they could become abusive.  If it's an American employer then feel free to work for free.  Why? because you're not working for free, you're making yourself look better (job security) and you're progressing your skillset.\n\n  \nThe Key:\n\nDo not think that your devotion to the company will result in that job security or professional progression.  You're using them for education while paying your bills.  Companies will chew you up and spit you out so be careful with how you practice things at work.\n\n  \nThe Middleground:\n\nStudy outside of your job things that will make you useful then either grab tickets you know you can do, or communicate that you want to try this because you've been working on it alone.  Why not just self-study and keep it private? Well a homelab isn't going to teach you how to upgrade pods and update images in a production environment, you can mock something like it, but when your boss is breathing down your neck and crap is running down your leg then you'll be glad you worked in a real env.\n\n  \nThe Takeaway:\n\nTake advantage of having a job and a place where you can see things break live, that's where the money is made, not when everything is running well.\n\nIf you are truly just a curious individual then forget everything I said and protect 20 hours a week to explore whatever you want.  Having a job means you can buy GPUs, electronics, hardware, etc. maybe not the best but something for you to work with.  No one skill will make you permanently secured in your job, no one job will make you automatically rehireable, but constantly learning new things and \"getting a hold of the hammer\", will keep you happily employed.\n\n  \nMe? well I'm unemployed because well...I don't know really...actually I suck at Leetcode and haven't used NodeJs a lot.  However, if you have a job then you're in good standing.",

Companies still struggle finding good hires that know a specific problem space so they would usually go for a new grad with a specific understanding in their problem space than a 3-5 YOE that knows nothing about it.

If you can build an agent to handle these things automatically for you, you might transform this boring work to something more interesting.",

I have software that runs on unmanned planes (the non-bomby kind) and simulators (think more like video games for battle planning). I didn't work at a place that worked on actual weapons systems.\n\nReally my problem with anything government-related is the sheer waste involved. Many contractors just burn money and resources and time.\n\n> Robotics: Having robots that do laundry/dishes/run errands for sounds awesome, but I feel it will just end up taking away entry level jobs from people.\n\nAutomation has been happening for many, many years. We just haven't focused on it as much but this is one of those \"what is the price of progress?\" questions. At its most ideal we do it to free people up to do better things or be productive in other ways, but I think we (collectively) tend to cast a very dark shadow on it because it's easier to blame something rather than take it as a reason to improve other things.\n\n> Aerospace: Space is cool as fuck but Elon and Bezos are certifiably insane.\n\nThey are the poster manchildren of modern aerospace, but there are many 'boring' companies involved in aerospace stuff (Lockheed, Boeing, Airbus, GE, etc.). Though then you're also probably getting government contracts in there as well.",

        "body": "Hey, I’ve been through similar experiences and have a few opinions to share.\n\n1. You’ll improve code quality on the job. The alternative is to look at more code (open source) but I don’t recommend that unless you’re really passionate about it. Otherwise, it might add more stress. So, just try to criticize and improve your code base at work. Practice articulating what looks good and what looks bad, and why. Experiment with new ideas and you’ll learn faster. There are many signals to look out for in a codebase: does any part of your dev flow slow you down when building new features, are any parts confusing if a new dev were to work on it, do you have to update multiple places in code for a simple feature, etc. If you have few complaints then maybe your structure is solid after all. If you do identify issues, chances are that it’s something someone else ran into and found a solution for, so it’s always worth searching for how others approach things.\n\n2. The only way is to study and to practice. There are tons of online resources. One that I’ve used is GreatFrontEnd, but try googling or searching this sub to find some structured learning resources. Also, ChatGPT is a great tool to ask dumb questions and get good feedback. Chat is also a great tool to ask your exact question : “how do I rebuild my fundamentals in a structured way.”\n\n3. Similar answer: study and practice, using online resources. I’ll bet you know a lot more than you give yourself credit for, but maybe don’t have the language to articulate ideas. Again, you can treat AI tools as a dev buddy: before developing a feature, create your rough design idea and ask Chat for feedback. (Typically this would be done with colleagues, but if you don’t have other devs as resources, AI is a solid tool imo.)\n\n4. I recommend stopping your weed consumption until you feel less anxious about your career. If you can’t cut it out completely, I recommend reserving it for a specific time and in smaller doses, like at night after all responsibilities are done for the day and you’re ready to wind down for bed. This is a nice middle ground because quitting cold turkey can lead to relapse and a negative spiral. Reserving it for night time only is a guilt-free window for you. This way, you’re using weed as a reward rather than a coping mechanism. Just make sure you have a solid and consistent waking schedule. :)\n\n5. This is more life advice than just career advice: we’re human beings with finite time in this life. You’ll never have time for everything so a good skill to learn is time management. With this career revamp you’re working on, write out everything that’s on your mind, and then choose the ones of highest importance (it’s subjective and only you can decide that). For each item that you’ve prioritized and deemed important enough to focus on, break it down into smaller chunks. Rinse and repeat until you have less overwhelming and more actionable tasks. And most importantly, do the tasks! If they’re small enough to complete, it helps you psychologically build momentum. If tasks seem daunting it’s usually because they feel more ambiguous and that’s when our minds resort to coping strategies (like smoking weed or scrolling on your phone). In these cases it’s okay to dive in and try things out until it feels less ambiguous, and from there you can continue the process of identifying and breaking things down into a todo list (aka backlog).\n\nOne last thing, I’d recommend looking into therapy as an additional resource. I know that it can be expensive and might feel useless, but here’s my take on it: it’s not some sort of silver bullet solution to all your problems. If you can consider “cutting down on weed and strengthening my SWE foundation” as a long-term project, then therapy is a great resource to use along the way. It’s similar to what you did here, you posted how you were feeling and some advice and strategies were recommended. But with consistent therapy, each session is like a check-in: here’s what we talked about last time, here’s what I tried, and here’s where I struggled. It’s a continuous, iterative development process, much like how we build good software products!\n\nGood luck, you’ve got this!",

The simplest, hardest, and most effective place to start is to quit weed entirely and start running, or anything you can tolerate that gets your heart rate up. Eat candy, drink some beer, watch TV, do whatever helps to avoid actually smoking weed. If you have a good support network, lean on them.

If you believe you are experiencing WLB (Keep it to yourself and please do not broadcast your great manager to bad managers) and treat it as just a temporary hallucination that you are experiencing that will fade away soon to those not in the know.\n\nNow with that in mind there are some really great managers in the company that actually do try, keyword being try to establish a real work life balance within reason.  Unless this is being pushed from the L8 and L10 levels it will be very hard to sustain long term by an L7 as they all eventually fold under the executive pressure cooker as they try to make it to L8 themselves.  Only then can they and do they have real power to enforce WLB in their org.\n\nFor yourself you will need to set hard boundaries and never become a yes person for too long or you will be crushed due to taking on more work than you can actually do.

Sometimes be careful what you wish for.

If you are going to risk it, do it for a job that will pay you life changing money in a way. 10% for me isnt life changing especially in this career. \n\nPut it like this, if you make 80k a year 88k isnt that much of a difference. If you make 150k a year, 165k isnt that much of a difference. It's extra money to play with or invest but again, is it enough for you to risk maybe the next few years being hectic and stressful?

The traditional way to go about a job search is to double down on your strengths so that you look competitive in comparison with your immediate peers.\n\nThere's something to be said about adjacent skillsets as an augmentation of your core skills, but \"from admin stuff to IT\" seems a bit too far off. Ideally, you'd target skillsets that complement what you're already good at in some way that bridges gaps in requirements from job postings in your area of expertise.",

The whole functional programming paradigm, ES6, components, props, how renders work, Redux - all of it felt like trying to drink from a fire hose. I had anxiety and panic attacks over it. So I want you to know: this transition is genuinely hard, and you're not failing because you're finding it hard.\n\n\nThat perfectionism/ADHD piece your therapist mentioned is huge though. Modern frontend development, especially in complex codebases, IS a constant stream of \"wtf is happening\" moments. Even seniors get lost in deeply nested components with no documentation. The difference is they've built up tolerance for not knowing and can sit in that discomfort longer.\n\n\nAlso, you lost your mentor. That's massive. You went from having someone who understood the codebase to basically being on your own in a system with minimal documentation.\n\n\nThe isolation is probably making everything worse too. Even if you go to the office and those people don't understand your specific codebase - they've been through what you're going through. We all have, even if we don't show it or are too proud to admit it. You could try working from coffee shops sometimes too, just to break up being alone all day.\nFor me, it took 1-2 months of really intense, focused work before things clicked. But what forced me to lock in was when the stakes got really real. That kind of pressure made me focus in a way nothing else does, but it's also not sustainable or healthy long-term.\n\n\nYour manager's job is to help you thrive - you could try being really open with them about needing more structured support after your mentor left. Pair programming helped me a ton - you get to ask questions in real time and it actually makes both people more productive. If you ask your manager or even just another dev to pair with you on some tickets, most people would probably be down. And when you're stuck solo, timebox it - give yourself 30 minutes to struggle, then ask.\n\n\nYou're 9 months in. That's still early. But you also need to be honest with yourself about whether this specific situation is set up for you to succeed.",

There’s limited real desire and opportunity to get to those levels.\n\nTo be a “true” senior you need to be leading the team and product in all technical aspects, training others, and being “the man” on the team. That requires a lot of dedication, and frankly, down right hours on the keys at the desk that most people aren’t willing to put in.\n\nMost teams will end up with their senior engineers being the longest tenured engineer on the team or someone rotated over from another team who was either a rising “true” senior engineer or more likely: just one of the longer tenured engineers who is backfilling another person’s position. Most engineers with a senior title are mid level engineers who haven’t left.\n\nTo be a “true” staff engineer, you’re doing everything a senior did, but expand that across team’s through your entire department. Now take the hours you invested in your original team to be a senior, and multiply it by number of teams (roughly). That’s way too many hours for most people to want to invest to reach this level. Even after you make it to this level, your desire to stay here might wain and while your titled a staff engineer because you were performing at that role, a few years later you’re essentially a senior again because you don’t want to keep investing the hours.\n\nI quoted “real” everywhere because titles mean different things at different companies and the lower the max TC a  company offers: typically the lower the bar is for a higher title. So I wanted the focus to be on what the general-ish expectation is at each level.",

I have been called a high performer and even told that I was the SWE that they compared others to in the company.  The company was a private non-tech company in non-tech city.\n\nThe bar was pretty low for entry as we didn't compete for talent hat could get jobs at actual tech companies.  I may have been a \"high performer\" at this company, but realistically I was still a pretty shit SWE with 15 YOE when compared to SWEs at actual tech companies.\n\n> had disagreements with management that ended up costing me my job. \n\nDepending on what the disagreements are management may be in the right.  I lost a job because of \"disagreements\", but it basically came down to I called the out on their shit.  There as a lot of lip service to burnout and shit like that, but nothing every changed because the \"project is too important\".\n\nThe project is so important that we were 15 months late getting FDA approval on the medical devices and still got a company party celebrating the victory.  Never mind there was 0 effort to figure out why were were late as to no repeat mistakes.  It was probably the right decision to just let me go.   \n\nFunny thing was, after the left me go over the next 10 months 5 out of 7 Senior SWEs left along with 2 other midlevel SWEs. \n\n> I am already struggling to get responses since losing my job. I know I need to be prepared to be job searching for 6 months, but other people I talk to that have experience seem to have no problem having recruiters reach out or getting responses/interviews.\n\nIt's a tough market out there and everybody is different.  Maybe you are not marketing your value well on your resume or applying to the wrong jobs.  If you are only looking at top tech companies then you have to expect competition for people working at other top tech companies.\n\nI have also been looking for a new job over the last couple of years and this year I got very few calls to interview from my applications.  I worked on safety critical medical devices for 15 years and have lead teams over that time in addition to being an IC.   I'm basically an embedded application SWE working with mostly c and c++ which is not really what the industry wants.\n\nIt's not even an issue of only wanting remote work as I am more than happy to go into the office, but sadly I cannot just relocate anywhere due to family reasons.  That doesn't mean no relocation, but the city needs to be a place the whole family is in on or people are going to have a bad time.\n\n>So far, I have gotten nothing but 2 rejections (no interview), and 2 ATS rejections from LinkedIn easy apply jobs. I'm not just using easy apply, but maybe something is wrong with my resume?\n\nThat's nothing you have barely started interviewing.\n\n>I'm not just using easy apply, but maybe something is wrong with my resume? \n\nPost your resume in the resume review thread or on resume review subreddits to get feedback.  Things like use STAR and show impact is a common comment.\n\n>Is the job market just that toast right now, even for people that have a little bit of work experience? \n\nCompanies are hiring, but the supply of candidates is large and hiring managers are being selective.  They feel the need a close to perfect fit because if you are not it then somebody else probably is.   \n\n>Is it because its the end of the year and about to be holiday vacation time?\n\nProbably part if it as hiring slows down around the holidays and picks up in the new year.",

There were 3-5 engineers most of the time. No dedicated QA, no pipeline or deployment process. We'd take our app to install on the client's infrastructure on a flash drive. And I'd feel silly and hilarious to wear a suit.\n\nThe place was laid back, very informal. We would always go out to lunch together. Occasionally working until late at night during deadline crunch we would share a beer in the office. I learned and grew a lot. Got promoted a couple of times while there. They would sometimes fail to pay our salaries on time, always on the cusp of failure. But I was having fun and it fit my life as a 24yo. I would absolutely hate that place today.\n\nThe second job I'm going to mention is my current one. Healthcare industry related. Chill, remote friendly. Very few meetings. I get to work on my tickets at odd hours, so I can be present for my family. But there is some good engineering happening and opportunity to stay sharp. I've worked at other chill places where after a year or two I felt like I'd have to be very creative to write a single bullet point about that job.",

His first question was always \"how do we prevent this from happening again?\" Not \"why did you mess up?\" That psychological safety was everything.\n\n\nHere's the thing though - the work itself was an absolute shit show. The technology was this custom mess that practically functioned as its own language. Hard to understand, impossible to debug, nightmare to optimize. The product team was perpetually confused, and we were constantly building the wrong thing.\n\n\nBut my team? We were in it together.

Happy hours multiple times a week, great people and made many friends while working hard and learning a lot.\n\nNew favorite is my current job. Tons of perks and events, also in a great part of the city, 15 minute bike commute or 15 minutes by train. Lots of money and bonuses going around, free snacks and meals, smart people, up to date tech, good tools, documentation, and support. We routinely get hockey/basketball/concert tickets in a suite, and people really value the work we do because it makes a positive impact for people. \n\nIt's three days a week in office, but the office is so nice and the bike ride into work is enjoyable so I don't mind going in for a few days. I've even gone in when I didn't have to because the building is so nice. I've made some friends and referred a friend to work with me. It's been a good time.\n\nLast job sucked and I got laid off with 30% of the company. I was able to get severance and had a new job with months of severance left. Their loss.",

NYC is not a cheap place to live and being located here doesn't offer much of an advantage in the job market over \"willing to relocate\". Try to have a job in hand before you move out here. But absolutely do include NYC in your search because there are absolutely roles for all levels of experience here.",

Although some interview questions lend themselves to specific architectures, we don't necessarily ask you to design systems with anything in particular, you're supposed to put your best foot forward and design a system that makes sense given the requirements.\n\nPrep guides love to tell you to list FRs and NFRs and put an api gateway in the middle of the fucking diagram etc etc, but you'd be surprised at how frequently people don't actually know what they're talking about beyond the initial keyword vomit. Getting caught bullshitting is an easy way to get disqualified.\n\nI usually ask people to sketch out the system end to end, and then dive deep on some area. Frontend folks sometimes treat the entire backend as a black box, and we focus on frontend things, up to API layer. But not always. There are plenty that can speak backend too, to varying degrees.\n\nOften it depends on the specific requirements for the job. Some teams want a strong frontend expert, others want someone who's more full stack. General bar for us is \"we want a software engineer, not a react dev\". Mind you, also, this is for high pay roles. Other companies with lower pay bands often have easier bars, especially for frontend, whose interviewers tend to not be as strong in full stack, end-to-end system design themselves (not throwing shade at anyone, just my observation from having spent a lot of time in this space).",

Computed properties are so nice to use, fetching and maintaining reactive data is a breeze.\n\nNow, we all now the job market is in the toilet. My current job uses Vue, but we've had so many layoffs that the teams are now severely understaffed and replaced by people who have no idea. The job has become unbearable.\n\nI've been looking for other jobs. Not only is the job market terrible, but I've seen comments about FE roles decreasing around 10% YoY, mostly thanks to AI. The few FE jobs that are out there require React, almost no one is looking or considering a developer with a Vue background.\n\nI do not like React. And have no energy to transition to Fullstack in my free time. But it seems like I have no choice than to bite the bullet and adapt, or remain unemployed once my job axes me as well.\n\nAny words of comfort or advice would be greatly appreciated.",

You’d be surprised, from the 5 different companies I’ve worked at, the majority used Vue. It’s definitely out there. \n\nOn my end, I actually started going to school again to finish my degree and I plan to pivot more to full-stack work.

You have none of the things that elevate you from writing code to professional software development.\n\n>Should I prioritize coding quality, user adoption, revenue, or project vision?\n\nIf you had revenue worth to speak of, why would you be looking for a job?\n\nCoding quality matters - but without it, you will not have users, or lose the ones that you have quickly. If you write terrible code and still manage to retain users, that's still something. Project vision is almost entirely worthless. I make good money working on a silly little CRUD app. I would love it if my company took it further and developed some sort of vision - but we have users, we are profitable and I can pay my bills. Even if we had a vision, it would still be worthless if we didn't actually manage to build it.\n\n>Would getting a certain number of high quality daily users make a difference… I ask because I personally see the value in targeted ads to doctors plus the data I would have from their use( it’s all HIPAA compliant).\n\nIf all of that works, why would you be looking for a job? (There are many good and acceptable answers here, but I would want to hear them.)\n\n>Is there value constructing real world application or is the quality of the code the main focus?\n\nNobody will be looking at your code.\n\n>Are there entry level jobs for project management or anything else that may see potential from my projects if I had a good number of daily active users?\n\nI suppose there are qualities other than programming that you would need to manage a software project with users - but then, we are no longer discussing a portfolio full of programming projects, are we?",

If I were to do a personal project, I would build something that I want to build that addresses something I care about - and if other people found it interesting and used it, great, but I would 100% ignore any requests to build stuff that I don't care about, or are too difficult, etc.\n\nThat's what a lot of personal projects are like, and the problem is that most jobs just do not work that way - you don't get to choose the path of most fun and least resistance. \n\nNow, mind you - those personal projects are still good in their own way because they allow you to showcase your more pure technical skill. But from an overall \"how will this person do at this job\", they miss a big chunk of it.\n\nWhen I see someone who built something that was clearly based on a user request with real-world, annoying ass constraints? That's when I'm really interested. \n\nI think an app built for doctors kinda fits that, because that's not a group that is going to use something for unimportant stuff. So if you're going to get users, you're going to have to be able to handle annoying shit that most people don't want to deal with (e.g., HIPPA compliance).",

I'm trying to utilize each angle I have. \n\nI would be looking for a job because, well, why not? I am going to keep on working on this full-time but I can send out applications at the same time.",

I don't want to pigeonhole myself too much such that it becomes too niche, so I can try to keep at the general IT stuff we do and slowly lean into niche-but-not-too-niche specializations (like Linux or network management) as it comes along, and continue my education with my CS degree and company-funded certifications.\n\nWe don't have specific teams or departments, we just have technicians who happen to have more experience dealing with X issues compared to Y issues, so those related tickets typically get sent to that person, but we all still generally deal with the same stuff across the board.",

Learn Python and Postman at least. I think those will be useful for the foreseeable future. Knowing Java and Jmeter, at least last time I checked, was *really good* in some niche situations if you needed to validate data being put into a SQL database. Like, one of the best tools I've ever found for specifically that, which is weird since it's nominally a load testing tool. It's was also surprisingly easy to write your own plugins. That was a few years ago now, though, so I don't know if anything better has come along in the mean time.\n\n\nKnowing a bit about how http/networking works behind the scenes is also a good idea if you do any appreciable rest or network testing. If you're going to be working with that sort of thing at all you really don't want it to be just a magic black box to you. I don't see networking going anywhere either, since the cloud is a thing. I interviewed a guy for QA one time and while I was talking to him I realized that he had a fantastic amount of knowledge about networking and network protocols. I suggested hiring him based on that and told him later that he was underselling himself on his resume because no one else I'd ever interviewed had ever demonstrated the level of networking know-how that we were just casually chatting about.",

I have lot of extra time to travel, explore hobbies, side business enjoy more than actual work trying build out, spend time with friends/family, errands/chores, etc. I got an offer last year in 150k range  and more up too date tech stack/practices but I would lose my remote work, prob be working 40 hours, and be more stressful env and to me the extra income was not worth benefits would lose time and location freedom.",

Create 2-3 variations of your resume targeting different subfields that you can realistically get into. Apply to everything within a 2 hour driving radius because you can at least attend on-site interviews.\n\nThere are some legit remote jobs, but the \"best chance\" positions are on company job boards; not on LinkedIn and Indeed. So you'll have to aggregate a bunch of sites, continuously check, pray, and wait until spring/summer (prime hiring season).",

If a product doesn’t do well but the engineering team did a good job, they will likely be fine, but the pm likely gets fired.  On the other side if a product gets crazy successful, the PM is probably going to advance faster.",
