And I'm likely to get downvoted for a practical non-theory answer, I know.\n\nBUT...\n\nData engineering and software engineering are two different disciplines, so you can only draw parallels so far. \n\nAnd within data engineering, there's a huge difference between (1) a pipeline that supports a piece of software used by millions, or on which lives (any number, small or large) might depend, and (2) a pipeline that just ensures Sally from accounts payable can see the latest invoices in her report, which she only looks at once a month anyway, and occasionally forgets to look without anything bad happening.\n\nThe same difference exists within software engineering, between that million-user piece of software and a script running on a server in a medium sized business to do something useful but not business critical, and that hasn't had a code change in 4 years. Those two things won't (or at least shouldn't) have the same amount of testing effort even if the same software engineer did both. \n\nDitto for the two data pipelines. Ultimately, testing of any sort takes time that could be spent on other things, so for a business, it needs to provide more value than it costs, or you shouldn't do it. I see people forgetting this sometimes. Nobody should do testing purely dogmatically, except perhaps for FOSS projects, and any kind of libraries, which are a very different story. \n\nAnother angle is that user-facing software typically has lots of code branches, conditionally-executed code, and complex object interactions. Data software _might_ have that too (in which case it has the same potential for testing), but it might be very simple and linear. If running a pipeline executes every line of code in the project - isn't running it an adequate test for a reasonable swathe of test conditions?",

I thought you were saying that when using duckdb you had to attach to the Postgres, then write the metadata query, then use that info to write your main data query. So what I was saying was that you just attach duckdb to the Postgres db and then you can start writing queries in duckdb as if the Postgres db actually contained the data.\n\nBut yes even that might be too much for less tech savvy users. Plus other db formats that are able to read parquet files could implement the ducklake format more natively so that they are both the repository and the query planner.

This usually when a DE is needed for delivering this data.\n\nComing to the engineering part. You are a DE who needs to bring that data in. You need to design the workflow, test it, deploy it, expose the data and of course maintain it. This is more or less what a typical DE does. \nNow, depending on the business, the volume of data, the stack etc data engineering might be from code less till fully open source. During the early days, a business will usually go for a managed service to set up the data platform. If the volume increases they usually switch to open source solutions(spark on emr, airflow, hive metastore, etc) for cost cutting reasons. As you understand there are cases where data engineering might involve more than data related tasks such us managing infra, setting up permissions/vpc/etc, modeling, database administration, unit testing, scripting etc. Do these tasks fall under the DE's responsibilities? Big discussion so not sure. Is it common for DE's to do these? Yes (I'd like to say it is something common but not sure either). There have been cases where I did some swe tasks like api in js.\n\nThe tasks themselves tend to be \"boring\" compared to swe since they are less \"creative\" and more \"engineering\". You are trying to build something robust and resilient so you have as less maintenance as possible. It's more puzzle solving than creating.",

I personally am a huge fan of their data lineage tool. Unlike other data platforms creating a pipeline or a DAG can be done in a few mins. They have thought through all these concepts way ahead and in my opinion their platform is way ahead of other solutions. Foundry had this concept of table format way before Iceberg or delta got popular. \n\nOne take away I have is if your organization needs a data platform that needs traditional data warehousing alot Foundry sucks in that area. This is a great solution for Extraction and Transformation but if your organization depends on datasets mostly for creating charts and dashboards with strict SLAs. Foundry can only be used as compute layer and then load this data back into snowflake or other data warehouses.",

The individual tasks get separate permissions to access their specific instances. This is in line with the least privilege principle often recommended for defining permissions.\n\nGiving the orchestrator too much permissions is exposing you to a lot of risk. There are some newer approaches like the ETL logic is defined in the orchestrator but the flow/task itself runs in a specific pre-defined compute which seems like a better balance. So if you do want to put it all in the orchestrator make sure you leverage such an approach.",

So the code is my source of truth.\n\nIf you are managing temporary grants manually, the only thing I could think of at the moment would be to either use a special role whenever you grant temporary privileges or tag the queries with a query tag. This way you at least have some sort of a log of temporary granted privileges and only need a process that revokes these privileges after a certain time as a cleanup process. (i.e. take all queries with the query tag, after a month or so revoke the privilege instead of granting).",

If the data that all these requests are for is general purpose data then I’d recommend just creating a role for general purpose and granting giving that. \n\nAn alternative to this is creating a role specifically for timed access and then create a snowflake scheduled task to remove users from that role after they’ve had it for x amount of time. \n\nAnother way to potentially manage access changes is with GitHub. GitHub feels a little hacky and more work than either of the two above. \n\nAnother way is to connect access requests with a jira (or something similar) ticket and the ticket parameters map to specific snowflake roles. You could pair this with a scheduled task to remove access if you want timed access or leave this parameter blank for perpetual access.",

New teams get their standard setup, databases/whs/roles and some pipeline to deploy stuff. When other teams want access to some data of another team, we have request forms that ask for approval (email) from the data owner, and upon approval automatically assigns the appropriate roles. \n\nBoth the platform managed and data owner managed are also stored in Snowflake as metadata.

        "body": "Great question, thanks for asking and giving me a chance to explain a bit more :)\n\nJust to clarify up front: Heimdall isn’t trying to replace Airflow (or Dagster). It’s meant to complement those tools, especially in big data environments. We actually use both -- Airflow and Heimdall -- and each plays a different role in our system.\n\nIn our setup:\n\n* Airflow handles scheduling -- the \"when\" something should run (\"run this job daily, but only after X completes\").\n* Heimdall handles orchestration -- the \"what\", \"where\", and \"how\" something runs (\"run this Spark job with version X on cluster Y, with these configs\").\n\nSo why build Heimdall for orchestration instead of just using Airflow for everything?\n\nA few reasons:\n\n**1. Consistency:**  \nWe want a single, unified interface between all tools and data systems (Spark, Trino, Clickhouse, etc.). Heimdall abstracts away infra details -- our users just submit workloads the same way every time (from user's p-o-v, the way they submit SparkSQL and Trino query and get results is exactly the same). We can manage things like version upgrades, logging, error tracking, etc., in one place. Similar to what Netflix’s Genie does -- it creates a clean boundary between clients (humans and systems) and infrastructure.\n\n**2. Security:**  \nEngineers can run and test jobs locally -- even against prod data -- without needing shared credentials (we integrate with many systems, zero creds for those on laptops). They just use their own identity, and Heimdall enforces everything (RBAC, logging, etc.) in one place. Airflow submits jobs *through* Heimdall, so we get a centralized entry point to everything.\n\n**3. Simplification:**  \nBy offloading orchestration to Heimdall, our Airflow operators got *really* simple -- each is maybe 10-20 lines of code, no matter how complex the job is. This helps us avoid the usual “infra logic leaking into pipeline code” problem. Heimdall gives us reusable building blocks that keep our DAGs clean.\n\nThere are other reasons too, but those are the big ones. Happy to go deeper into any of them if it’s useful.\n\nAnd just to be clear -- we still really like Airflow. :) It’s become much more lightweight for us now that it only handles scheduling. We’re even looking at turning Heimdall-based operators into lightweight sensors, so we can run thousands of DAGs on a small Airflow box.",

Most people haven’t worked at small shops and it shows. \n\nIn small shops, you are dealing with tight budget constraints, unrealistic expectations from management, and short deadlines for everything, but these shops are rampant with opportunity to learn. If you’re willing to learn, you can leverage this opportunity into your next professional step. \n\nYou mentioned you are working for some sports team. I think the easiest way to approach this project is to post on this subreddit, and the businessintelligence subreddit asking if anyone is willing to mentor you on building out this project, and make sure to mention what sport industry you are in. I know for me, i love american football and would not mind contributing to help a team at whatever level on their analytical journey for free. Now, don’t expect free work, but you can expect some guidance from people that do this for a living.\n\nYou have a ton to learn on your own. Find some mentors. They’ll be able to cut your work in half if you put in the work.",

You can do this cheaply in Azure or AWS (or any cloud provider). I recommend sticking with Azure if that’s where your organization already has its IT centre of gravity. Otherwise you’ll pay money transferring data between the two providers. \n\nBut if you reply with some additional detail about your requirements, I can help you out more.

I currently have \"copied\" the tables from our products as the lowest layer in our DWH and am then connecting them to several \"datamart\" tables that get used for dashboard/analytics, and in the future ML. Is this enough, even when scaling in the hundreds of dags? Do you use \"intermediate\" layers? And if so which ones?",

You would be surprised to hear the number of times when different teams disagreed on the definition of a subscription or what a logged in user is. After you have the definitions locked down you can set up a classic 3 layer structure: raw, cleaned/merged and marts. Depending on your situation you might not need the middle layer, but i found that it helps to standardise the data and denormalise it where necessary.",

You’re nervous and you get stuck in your head on what you prepared for, not what’s actually happening. The way I have dealt with this is to make notes about these types of situations and think through how I would have liked to handle it differently next time. I actually review this list of past flubs every time I interview and my own mistakes have made me better over time. \n\nIn this case obviously it might have been better for you to be able to just take a step back and see you had simple problems in front of you. Or, if you felt uncertain, to say “I see a simple solution to this question or I could offer a more sophisticated approach, do you have a preference for how I tackle it?” But the point is no one answer is going to help you here because the next round of interviews the opposite situation could arise.

        "body": "In Databricks specifically you can create [workflows](https://www.databricks.com/product/data-engineering/workflows) that specify what to run and what the dependencies are, and what to do on failures. That's obviously a bit different since you specify it separately, so I suppose the lineage is 'manual' in that case.\n\nThe workflow tooling has some advantages. You can specify which clusters to use for which steps, so you can keep a cluster live throughout the process for faster job startups, or switch clusters if some steps need specialised settings or need to be larger.\n\nObviously you don't have that with just Spark, but essentially any orchestrating job runner could work.\n\nYou can mix DBT in with python functions for python models. Those can specify their model dependencies within the function, and other sql models can reference the python module. I believe there are some more hoops to jump through in specifying the model in yaml and needing to set up your spark session to be passed in, so it might take some work to figure that out.\n\nThen things like Airflow, Dagster, or more classic things like Ctrl-M can be set up to orchestrate things, or in Azure ADF can do it if it isn't too large. I believe they all have a similar limitation that you can't just ask for \"things leading to this\" or \"things following this\" or both, you just have a set pipeline to run.\n\nYou can also do a very basic one yourself. If you have a function that runs some data process you can create decorators to specify dependencies, then as long as you `import` the module with those decorated functions you'll have a full dependency tree and can automatically execute what you need. You could find all dependencies leading into some data process function, so they are all refreshed, or run a data process function and update everything that follows from it. The functions to map all that out, but it is a pretty general dependencies problem so an LLM will likely have something to get you started.",

The everything must be code approach works great at scale, but smaller teams often benefit from reliable, maintained connectors that handle data extraction while keeping the business logic in reviewable code where it belongs.\n\nFor example, Windsor.ai offers a solution that connects data sources to destinations like Snowflake, BigQuery, or your BI tools. It provides the connector breadth that teams often seek from tools like NiFi, but with API driven architecture that can integrate into data stacks.",

First, it sounds like you have good/smart people even if they aren’t familiar with modern platforms and technologies (public cloud, etc.). Someone mentioned “data mesh” and that came to mind to me as well. Specifically, the principles around ”data as a product” and “self-service” as these are largely about organizational empowerment and alignment more so than technology choices.\n\nIt sounds like the teams need some guidance on how to organize and get work done. I recommend looking into the following.. the teams and company may be doing some of this already but it’s hard to tell from a short narrative. Each of the topics below embody principles of modern data teams.\n\n1. Agile\n2. DataOps (the modern data value chain and how to build data capabilities and the operations around them)\n3. Data as a product - creating things that matter and generate value for the business. The tech is not the point.\n\nIf you want to go deeper on organizational design ideas for technology teams, I recommend the book “Team Topologies.” What you read in the book is helpful and insightful but it’s not a blueprint - in my opinion - to simply go and follow. Instead, take what the book teaches, overlay it with your company, teams, and culture, and determine what your own organizational next steps should be.\n\nHope this helps give you some ideas on where to start.",

Do not enrich with fields specific to one domain or subprocess because now you add the overhead of having to know which fields have to be filtered out for downstream consumption. If for example your sign up date is an attribute that is relevant to the whole enterprise it would be a good candidate for a customer field. If it describes a specific sign up for a newsletter that is relevant to marketing it might be better suited to keep those sign ups separate. Maybe create a signup table that references the customer id so it can be reused across different business processes and is easily understood.\n\nIn the end it is more about the approach itself. A few fields here or there wont break your architecture but once you have super wide tables because people keep adding columns to defined tables the madness starts. Thats where normalization comes in handy.",

Think of the french speaking region of Belgium being in the same marketing region of France while being in a different financial region).\n\nBesides that you also have ownership issues. Who controls this dimension and is responsible for its data? What if they decide to change the region of a customer, will that break dependencies from other areas of business?\n\nSo I agree with her. Keep only things that are relevant and have unified meaning across the business on the silver layer.

This greatly reduces cost of cloud computing, but still allows you to take advantage of certain cloud native tooling, such as Power BI connection to database without gateway middleware. There are also some advantages on the data security side of things. I would not be surprised to see more companies approach data infrastructure this way in the future, as we see cloud computing cost skyrocketing, and a mass emigration from the cloud.\n\nOther than allowing for half the data infrastructure on prem and the other half in the cloud, I can’t see why anyone would implement this approach on a strictly cloud based environment. Generally, OLAP based systems are faster and more efficient at data transformations than OLTP, so you might not be getting any cost advantages. You are also managing yet another pipeline, and likely need another DBT project implemented with incremental models. This approach also reduces visibility and traceability of your pipelines, and complicates CI/CD. \n\nThere are plenty of reasons NOT to do this. I would not recommend this approach unless you have some convincing reason to do so.",

Normally, the hierarchy would be defined in the OPC UA server, which would provide a template for you to use. So, the first option is to manually define the node mapping with the full path, second and probably best option, use tags for grouping with the bracketed notation config. This is still something that I want to try out.\n\n2. This is a continuous process but should be similar for batching processes. You would monitor the same process tags at the end of the day. You can add additional tags to the data to add batch specific info - maybe using a processor plugin like starlark or even a Python plugin in InfluxDB. \n\n3. The PLC uses OPC UA by default and also offers a Pub/Sub connection. This is a standard industrial protocol so used it as is.",

Sounds like your upload speed may be pretty slow as an organization if you're thinking about compressing before moving to the S3. Questions I would have:\n\n- How much time are you actually saving between uploading raw files vs time compressing and then uploading? Are you really saving time between running a compression, uploading then having spark load compressed files?\n\n- Are these daily files appended into your target tables or are you doing upserts? \n\n- What's the likelihood of needing to reload your tables from scratch? \n\n- Is the data easily partitioned outside of the daily extract? \n\nGenerally, I recommend trying to keep the files as I receive them but there are reasons to do slight modifications. Reason being storage is cheap, compute is not. That first time you have to reload from your raw storage, even after just a couple of weeks of daily storage, you're probably ahead of the game in terms of cost running spark against gzip files. Again assuming you're using some kind of pay as you go system.\n\nPersonally, for something like this I'd probably split the difference and convert the csv to parquet with snappy compression. That should give you a sizeable storage savings while still giving you performant reads if you need them down the line. Again a lot of this depends on what you have available to you, converting to parquet, depending on the data, will likely be more time consuming than just gziping the data but your reads should improve. Honestly, I'd benchmark all 3 and then evaluate them against what changes you expect in that source system for an extracts and how quick it will happen.",

This means you can't get the decompressed data any faster than a single node decompressing it.\n\nIf you're doing dynamic schema it also has to do two passes over some portion of the data. So it will read a certain amount to figure the schema, then start back over again once it has the schema it has come up with.\n\n> (Option) Add a step to decompress the files before we read them\n\nThis is probably pointless, spark is doing this for you on-the-fly. The only reason to do so would be because you are reading the source multiple times. Even then, the extra file size and resulting network transfers will offset some of the gain, and you'd have to pay the 'cost' of fully processing the data at least once just to get to that point. If you did anything like this, you would have spark just take the original CSV data and save it to compressed parquet, so that later stages can work off of that for faster re-runs or recovery from a node failure.\n\n---\n\nThere are some other things you can do, but anything effective will involve having the source do something different, because they're the ones producing the files.\n\nUploading uncompressed will be faster for you to process it, since spark can split the read across all of its executors. If you have a lot of cores in your cluster this could be a significant speedup. The tradeoff is that storage costs will be ~3x higher, and it will take ~3x longer for the provider to upload the data.\n\nA potentially easy change for the provider is to upload multiple gzipped files. Since it is a CSV, if they don't have newline characters inside the data (it really should be replaced with an escape sequence), then they can split the file by line count and then gzip each file. You still get the compression, and when running the ingestion job you can give spark a glob (or list) to read multiple files as a single dataframe. That will let you split up the decompression work. Note that this is not about splitting *after* the compression, as that will cut off csv lines in the middle -- you want to split the raw CSV by line count *then* gzip each of those files.\n\nAnother *possibly* easy change is to swap the compression algorithm to bz2. Iirc this one includes the ability to jump to blocks automatically, so spark can properly split the decompression.\n\nThe best way might be to see if they can grab the [DuckDB CLI](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/cli/overview.html) -- it is a single standalone executable, so you wouldn't need any special installation scripts or anything, and as a CLI they just need to run a duckdb command instead of gzip. You can send [commands as arguments](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/cli/arguments.html#passing-a-sequence-of-arguments) for the CLI, so you could make a command that will read the original CSV file then write it to parquet (with compression applied by default). The command would look like `duckdb -s \"COPY (SELECT * FROM read_csv('your_input_file.csv')) TO 'your_output_file.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);\"`. If you read into the DuckDB docs you can also see how to specify the CSV schema so all the typing can be done correctly at the outset, which is handy for you because parquet will have actual types for its columns, which in addition to being compressed and splittable, will make the ingestion job faster.",

As an intern you're not expected to know what you're doing, you're expected to learn.\n\nAnd if the questions are truly dumb, ask your favorite LLM. I am always presenting my idea for how to tackle a project to Chat GPT and asking if it is sound and in line with best practices, and if there are any other approaches I haven't considered or things I missed. This is *extremely* helpful when working in areas you don't (yet) know well, and a reasonable sanity check when you do know them well. LLMs do this kind of stuff better than they do code.\n\nBroadly speaking, on any team, success means having the humility to make the rational choice as regards achieving the best result - in this case meaning build an effective workflow with robust automations. And humility means, among other things, asking questions when that would result in you writing better code or making more progress on something. Good mentors know this and love answering questions. It's much better to look like you're an effective worker than to look like you 100% know what you're doing.",

If you don't and instead use reverse engineering techniques to find and interact with other internal points like internal methods, services, or data tables, the library publisher may change these at any point without notice and you may have unexpected emergency fixes.\n\nNote that something being an api is about the stability and change notification promises not about a particular format, spec, or connection method. An api is often a set of service layer or business layer web services using rest/json or soap formatting, but it certainly does not have to be. There are UI layer apis, which are usually js, iframe, or css interaction points. There are apis that are simply methods you call when you add someone else's code to your project. There are plugin apis where you code an extension that implements a published interface and register it using a published json or xml config file. There are data layer apis which are usually sets of tables, views, and stored procs you are to use when extending a product's data model.\n\nIt's not all about web services and not every web service is an api.",

        "body": "I'll provide a contrasting point of view since most people are trying to convince you there's nothing special about C++. I believe C++ is very problematic for newer programmers because a huge list of reasons. The general dismissive advice is to just program in the \"safe\" areas of C++, but there is no way for a beginner to know where that is.\n\nThere are basic problems right off the bat for a beginner.\n\n1. No real package management system. If you want to use libraries in C++, you'll often need to download someone's .hpp and .cpp file and figure out how to compile that into your program and use it. That directly leads into\n\n2. Compilation. No other modern language has a system as complicated as C++, you are going to struggle with your program finding your headers, things are going to compile and not link the right libraries, these words don't even make sense to beginner programmers in other languages. But of course C++ programmers have tried to solve this and that causes problem number\n\n3. Build systems, C++ has 3 popular build systems, and they don't necessarily work well with each other. You got make, cmake, autoconf and just regular writing the compiler arguments yourself. These systems are extremely complex, introduce a whole new language to learn, and are often impossible to debug. People will tell you that a newbie doesn't need to know about any of this, well they do if they want to be doing anything substantial using existing code instead of implementing every single thing themselves.\n\nSo all of that is before you get a program running, so once we've figure out how to compile code, what happens when we write code and try to learn stuff from online?\n\n4. C++ is extremely fragmented. C++ has gone through multiple incarnations, from C with Classes to C++11 to more recent versions. The way you write C++ code differs dramatically between pre and post C++11. By default the majority of the code you write based on basic examples will be considered incorrect. For example, you'd think you can generate random numbers using `rand()`. You'd be dead wrong, C++ developers do NOT suggest using `rand()` to generate random numbers, it's not guaranteed to generate a uniform distribution or numbers that are sufficiently random. People will even tell you off if you use iostream, the basic recommended way to handle input/output in every tutorial, because C++ code is supposed to be fast, and iostreams are considered slow. Basically C++ does something wrong in some initial implementation, and has to maintain that for backwards compatibility forever, so they implement a whole new different correct way to do it, but a newbie has no way to tell if they are looking at outdated and bad code or new code.\n\n5. Standards vs Compilers. Suppose you are super keen and keep up to date with new language features. You see that C++23 has some cool new feature you want to try in your own code. Well too bad, it probably hasn't been implemented yet. The standards committee are independent from the people that write the compilers. So the committee declares that the new version of the language has this new feature, and it's someone else's job to actually implement that feature into the compiler so it can actually be used in code. This is done bit by bit, so your compiler will support some C++23 features and not others. Hell, some features are in the spec and NEVER get supported. So if you're a keen beginner and see people present cool new features and code patterns you want to try, bad luck, try again in 5 years and pray that compilers have caught up.\n\n6. C++ data structures are heavily memory focused. This isn't the memory management that people usually talk about. These are the standard vector and collection types that manage the memory for you like in other languages. Except in almost every case, you interact with these objects via iterators, which dips down a level of abstraction and makes you think about memory anyway. So where in another language you might run `sort(s)`, in C++ you run `std::sort(s.begin(), s.end());`. That seems ok, until you start using references and pointers, and `sort` shifts the values in memory and you end up not pointing to what you thought you were pointing to. That's just a rookie mistake, but most algorithms do things in-place in memory and it's an easy mistake to make. On top of that you get pointer invalidation, where sometimes the automatic memory management just takes your data somewhere else and all your previously declared pointers are now pointing at nothing. The simplest way to accidentally do this is when you are using `push_back()`, when the allocated vector fills up it'll relocate somewhere else.\n\nI could go on. But the overall point is that\n\n1. Compilation and library management in C++ introduces significant complications to beginners that simply do not exist in other highly used languages.\n\n2. C++ has many conflicting ways of doing something, and there does not exist a single agreed upon set of teaching material for beginners to learn best practices.\n\n3. C++ has MANY hidden pitfalls that will cause beginners to write broken programs. Almost by default any code you write intuitively will be considered wrong in some way. The simple `for (int i = 0; i++; i < s.size()) { s[i]; }` should be written as `for (const auto& v : s) { v; }`, note the additional syntax and operators that might be unclear to beginners. Also you were meant to use `size_t` instead of `int` for the first loop, but that's almost never presented in basic teaching material.\n\nC++ has more complicated language constructs than other languages, worse developer support, has no single high-quality resource for learning, and online resources are litered with bad practice that beginners have no ability to distinguish.",

This isn't even true. The only situation where this might be a thing is where you're copying around data needlessly, but using references in C++(just like Python does by default) is an idiomatic language feature. \n\nBarring those cases, C++ code can be like 100 times faster than Python, unless you use Numpy arrays or something(which is written in C, so hardly counts as Python code).\n\n>I also understand that there's a huge responsibility in managing memory safely. \n\nYeah, except if you use smart pointers, C++ even has automatic memory management. People who say memory management in it is this super hard and difficult thing probably never heard about C++11. \n\n  \nThe language's complexity is greatly overblown, of course, but there is some merit to it.

        "body": "For clarity : My answer is based on my own experience in this field, but I have formatted the response with AI for clear reading, AI will never generate knowledge like this.\n\nHey, wishing you a bright future—read to the end! No way is programming dead, trust me. The idea that AI will wipe out coders is a myth. Tools like GitHub Copilot are like having a brainy assistant—they make you faster, not replace you. Coders who skip AI might lag since it cuts problem-solving from weeks to hours. You’ll learn quicker, debug faster, and tackle big stuff, but AI needs your creativity to work. Coding’s been around forever (before you were born!) and isn’t going anywhere—it just evolves. Use AI to level up, and you’re golden. It’s totally worth jumping into in 2025. The industry needs solid coders who solve real problems. Stay curious, keep learning, and you’ll stand out, no matter how many others code.\n\nLearning paths depend on you. Self-taught is awesome but tough—you need discipline to avoid scams or getting lost. A mentor, even paid, can save you tons of time by guiding you right. Tons of top devs are self-taught, so it’s doable with grit. Bootcamps are great for fast, practical skills—3-6 months and you’re job-ready if you pick one with mentorship and job help. Check Course Report for legit ones to dodge duds. A CS degree gives deep theory for stuff like AI or systems coding and looks great to employers, but it’s pricey and takes years. You don’t always need it for jobs like web dev But remember that if you don't learn the deep theoretical stuff like systems design, algorithms, data structures, computer architectures and operating systems, and only the final technology like web development, you will reach a stage where you will not develop, and you will not move up the career ladder until you have comprehensive knowledge and experience in all aspects, not just simple technological skills like html, css, etc. Whatever path, you’ll need to self-learn, so try Coursera’s “Learn How to Learn” to master studying. Tech’s got endless free resources—use them! I’d start self-taught to test the waters, then maybe a bootcamp or degree if you’re hooked. Just know bootcamps focus on jobs and might skimp on theory like algorithms, which you’ll need.\n\nPlease do not be tempted by crash courses, all of them aim to teach you how to use the programming language only or just a basic understanding, and do not teach you deep programming concepts, the least professional course may take more than 50 hours of learning, and time is not a condition on the professionalism of the course, but for example, you will not find an in-depth algorithms course of 10 hours ...\n\nFirst, see if coding’s your thing with Harvard’s CS50 on edX—it’s free and a fun intro to programming with bits of C, Python, and JavaScript. It’s not a full course but a taste of what coding’s about. You’ll know if it clicks and get a sense of next steps. After CS50, don’t jump straight to a track like web dev—focus on building core programming skills, like algorithms, data structures and solve a lot of problems on websites like hackerrank,leetcode,codeforces, and so on... . These are the foundation of coding and crucial for any field. You can learn them while exploring a track (like web or AI) or before picking one—it’s up to you. Python’s a great first language—easy, versatile for web, AI, or data, and super in-demand. But it’s not about the language; it’s about getting loops, functions, and logic, which apply everywhere. Think of coding like swinging a hammer: easy to learn, hard to master. Start with computational thinking to grasp how computers work before diving into languages.  \nTo gain a solid foundation in your level, I suggest reading books that will develop your way of thinking. It can be read while you are studying CS50. There is a great book called Computational Thinking: A Beginner's Guide to Problem Solving and Programming by Karl Beecher. I really like it and still read it from time to time, even though I am experienced but it's really a great book.\n\nExpect bumps—coding’s all about solving problems. Don’t quit when you’re stuck; take a break, hit Google or Stack Overflow, or use AI to explain (but don’t let it solve coding challenges—that’s cheating and you learn nothing). Everyone learns differently—some pay for courses to stay motivated, others grind free stuff. Stay consistent, even 2 hours a day. You’ve got this! Finish CS50, then focus on algorithms, data structures, databases , operating systems, programming with C++ and OOP, and any programming fundamentals that didn't covered in CS50(because 8 weeks not enough to know what you should learn ) (try free resources like FreeCodeCamp or books like “grokking algorithms”). Hit us up for next steps.\n\nWhat you did was the right move, you took the initiative to ask, keep doing that when you have questions, always ask the experts and don't rely on the answers of laymen or non-specialists, not even AI, AI can help you along the way if you know what you're doing, but it may not be appropriate at all times.\n\nAnd not all paid courses are good and not all free courses are bad, I can give you advices for hours, but unfortunately that is not the way you will develop, you have a path that you must discover for yourself, what I discovered is what you will discover, but you will discover it in your own way and with your own understanding, so I said it directly to you ... You may not always be convinced, so I'm not going to give you all the advice as much as I'm going to give you what works for you at your current stage.\n\nAnd remember that not everything is clear at the beginning, meaning that I cannot give you everything from the beginning until you are an expert in the field, but this depends on you and your research, reading books and learning, I only guide you to the beginning of the road. Good luck!\n\nupdate : CS50 (also called CS50x which is the most popular course of the CS50 series) may be difficult for some students, but in some countries computer principles are taught in schools, if you don't have knowledge about it, you can watch the content of the CS50T course first and learn more about computer principles and how to use Windows and what is hardware and software.",

I know the hard part sometimes can be picking a project and feeling internally motivated to do it, so here’s a suggestion. Pick a topic and act like you’re taking a course on it. If you need to, just latch onto the first project you see on the subject that way the choosing part of the project doesn’t prevent you from the *doing* part of the project. Worst case scenario, try to recreate a project you saw on YouTube or something. Even if you break things, that’s better than nothing. Ask your classmates, professors, or even Reddit for help when you’re stuck. The key here is that you just need to DO it. Don’t be afraid to do it wrong or accidentally make your machine catch on fire.\n\nEdit: I would like to add that you should always start small. Programming a microcontroller? In my classes, we always started with a program called “stop-go”; when the microcontroller turns on, there’s a red LED on. When you press a button, the red LED turns off and a green LED turns on. Programming an application? Okay, maybe figure out how to make a window for a GUI. It doesn’t have to do anything other than be a program. Make pong or Notepad. Reinvent that wheel.",

You don't yet know how complicated something outside of that zone might be, how far away it is, and how much else you need to learn before.\n\nSo - to sort of answer your question:\n\n>So how does one bridge the gap from being a programmer who can only create a terminal CRUD to becoming a programmer that understands how to build something like a compiler?\n\nBy gradually making projects that are harder and harder, always make sure that you know how to build *most* of it, but that there's some aspects you don't yet know how to do.

Then you either build a new project, or expand on the one you already have, and learn yet more things!\n\nThe same way you'd \"bridge the gap\" from fixing a puncture on your bicycle, to being a formula one car mechanic - by learning more and more and more - and at some point taking a dedicated class, course or job in exactly that, but there's usually no straight line!",

What that really means is *you’re not standing out yet* — and maybe you’re not putting in enough work. If this is enough to discourage you, then maybe you don’t actually love or care about this enough to go all in.\n\nThink about actors — look at what age most of them got their big break versus how long they had been grinding. If you're ready to give up now, then yeah, quit — because the pressure this industry will put on you will be way worse than this.\n\nYour first dev job won’t be easy. It won’t be smooth sailing. You still have to learn how to communicate well, adapt quickly, and solve real-world problems. I used to volunteer, I used to code for free just to get experience and feedback from senior devs — some who worked at Amazon, Google, and Netflix.\n\nI’ve led teams while volunteering, participated in hackathons, and mentored people — taught them how to lead and grow. On my *days off* from working a warehouse job, I would go into coding Discord servers and help people debug their issues.\n\nI tried college — it didn’t work out because of life circumstances. Everything I know is self-taught. I couldn’t afford bootcamps, so I found free ones. I hunted down Udemy courses on sale or found ways to get them free.\n\nThere are **plenty** of ways to make money coding. Go find one. I used to be homeless, and I was still learning, still listening to lectures and podcasts, still grinding.\n\nMy first contract? Made me $300 and $7/month. My second? I built software for a company, but the staff all quit before it got deployed. I still got paid. Now? I’ve got a pending contract with a startup and I'm building a demo for someone else.\n\nI’ve been doing this for about five years now. I’ve worked with people in Canada, Africa — folks who don’t even have consistent electricity or stable internet, and they still made it work.\n\nSo I’m saying this:  \nIf you *really* want it, then you have to *work* for it. You have to grind.  \nNot for weeks. Not for months.  \n**For years.**\n\nAre you willing to do that? Shiii I was diong this homeless.

Sometimes it not about being good its about communicating and getting the job done because poeple don't understand what they are looking at in terms of code they look at results . So asking for permission....",

If you want to make it, you need to get better accreditation or a portfolio - that'll mean working on more complicated projects and learning far more skills than you currently have. \n\nThat isn't to say that you can't do it, but the market is far more competitive than people outside of tech realise. Setting up a small website sounds incredibly complicated to someone with no programming skills, but it's a fairly entry level task to a hobbyist. Practically any professional can do that.\n\nYou'll need to expand your projects, look at proper certification, learn how that software is built, packaged and deployed, how all of the above can be automated, and learn how to implement different design patterns and technologies, and when to use each of them.\n\nIt's all doable, but it's a lot more work than setting up a few websites.",

Saying they are 'ready for the workplace' is the same as saying 'my first year comp-sci 101 class got me ready for the workplace'. I'm not saying that these aren't good places to start, they really are, but they need to be used as the baseline for a least a year of extra learning or hardcore personal portfolio creation.\n\nNot to be harsh here, but you got advertised to by Udemy and they gave you expectations that were way too high. I think next steps to get a job are A: go to some form of higher education. B: work your ass off doing personal projects.\n\nThat being said, this market is extremely saturated at the moment and if you got sold comp-sci solely as an easy industry to get into, maybe think hard about if you really enjoy doing it.\n\n  \nIm currently a hot-property azure dev, and the absolute nightmare it is to find jobs (in the UK) for people with 5-10 years' experience tells me that the junior market is way worse than it was 5 years ago, its not impossible, but its hard and unless you are some savant-level coder (I'm definitely not one of those) its mostly luck based.",

That's exactly what I did and I don't have any certificates, college education, etc. I basically found a small web developer shop that did websites for local businesses and offered to work part-time on a contract basis and cut my teeth on developing POS and/or internet ordering systems for them, and then leveraged the experience I got working with payment processing to get a job as a junior engineer at an actual payment processor. From there, I have had no trouble finding work as a software engineer.\n\nMaybe it is harder these days - maybe there are even people lining up to do the free or low-cost work to build up a portfolio. Other posters here make it sound like it's a moonshot. Is it harder than when I got started? Probably. Is it fair? No. But what are your other options? Either try, or give up.\n\nWhat I will say is that the best thing you can do is find a smaller business willing to take a chance on you, find a problem they have, and solve it with software. There are still plenty of opportunities like that.",

As a simple example, in C and C++, there is a preprocessor step, and there is nothing like that in Python. It is not a \"huge\" concept in and of itself, but it does take some getting used to, and to learn how it can be used effectively, and when to use and not use it, for example.\n\nAnother peculiarity of C++ is that when doing OOP, member functions are not virtual by default.  You must \"opt in\" to make a function virtual. In almost all other languages (including Python), methods (that is, functions placed onto a class) are always virtual. And because they are always virtual, you might not even yet know what the difference is between a function being \"virtual\" or \"non-virtual\", for example. But you will learn this when you learn C++.\n\nC++ also has function overloading, which Python does not have.\n\nC++ has templates (generic functions), which Python does not have.\n\nPython also has some stuff that C++ does not have, or which is hard to do in C++. For example, \"generators\" in Python are pretty useful. Maybe you can do something similar in C++ but it will not be so convenient. Python and most dynamic languages have an \"eval\" facility which lets you evaluate code \"on the fly\" but this kind of thing does not exist in C++. Again, it can be done but you will have to implement it yourself (e.g. by calling out to a compiler to compile code, or else embedding your own small compiler along with your executable).",

Moreover, if you try to switch from a high-level (abstraction-oriented) language such as Python to a low-level (system-oriented) language such as Rust or C++, you will have to learn a lot of additional theoretical material such as memory management and data mutation safety rules. All in all, you might want to first decide what you want to write code for, e.g., games, and then pick the right programming language to learn to match your purpose. E.g., C++ is good for game engines, but iOS UI apps actually require Swift or Objective-C.",

There are a lot of design patterns and conventions to follow when doing OOP and it’s impossible to make sense of all of them until you start building something and encounter the problems they are trying to solve first hand. I totally coasted through my object oriented design class in college and then all those topics we discussed suddenly came flooding back to me the first time I tried to build a personal project of considerable size.\n\nAs a side note, this may be controversial but I’ve found that explaining design patterns and best practices is one thing AI chatbots are quite good at. They will never give you a definitive yes or no answer, which is probably for the best, but if you ask it a question like “what are the pros and cons of making an object field public when it doesn’t need to be” it often gives pretty insightful responses with some reasons you may not have thought of before as a beginner.",

Use a framework that gives some guidance on you into how you should organize your classes, and try to think more inline with MVC rather than OOP.\n\nWhen it comes to more abstract things that need more custom implementation (think a highly complex interface layer that's meant to manage multiple other systems / services), things get more situational. You're likely not going to come up with a good design your first time around, unless you solved a similar problem before and can pull from that for inspiration.\n\nBeyond that, you shouldn't try to be \"good\" in OOP. Again, it's too broad and different people have different ideas of what's good. Most people look at \"FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition\" (look it up if you haven't) and see an overcomplicated mess, but some genuinely see it as a decent example of what software should look like.\n\nIf you have no experience with MVC, I would start there. It's a very common architecture in web development, but it can be applied to many different types of applications.",

You want people to be responsible for things - delegating the responsibility of ensuring things get done and that they are correct. Ai in 5 years most likely will not be able to replace a person at determining the correctness of some code. \n\nThe best path forward is to keep an eye on the tools. Learn on your own but also try the tools since that may be expected at your first job. Also good to identify where ai makes mistakes. The best way to not worry is to observe that for yourself. If you ai doesn't make mistakes then you are a god among vibe coders and your future is safe either way.\n\nI would recommend windsurf. The best option might change over time, but currently for windsurf you can purchase their lowest tier subscription and get unlimited use from their base model. If any kind of expense is a problem, then use a normal code editor and ask a free ai service for code, like perplexity or Google or Bing. I used windsurf to build a reddit scrubbing tool and it struggled a lot with building the rate limiting code. Without my knowledge, if that was a project someone built for a customer, it would be fine for a few seconds until it burst past the call limit per second and got the tool rate limited or blocked.

At 15, you're not even close to starting your career, let alone getting the ball rolling enough to rely on your experience / tenure to help you settle down.\n\nFirst thing to mention (even outside of AI) is that this entire field goes through ups and down. Software development is not immune to economic downswings unless you luck out (there are some jobs out there that are more \"essential\", but not most), and we're in one right now. The current job market, plus all the AI advancements in the news, has everyone worrying about AI, but it's a scapegoat to larger issues over-hiring from Covid, interest rates, and tax laws (Section 174 being a big one).\n\nAnd in regards to AI, if software development gets to a point where a non-technical person can use AI like a \"cheap high-quality on-demand agency\", nearly every job is getting replaced. Put \"will doctors\" into Google search, the first result is likely \"will doctors be replaced by AI\".\n\nBeing concerned about AI ***right now*** is pretty ridiculous. I've not seen any major instances of \"AI replacing developers\". There have been some decent showcases of AI reducing workloads (AirBnB did some interesting work in regards to testing migration), but even those are pretty limited. In general, it helped cut out some of the mundanity with repetitive boilerplate code, and helped people who have never written code to get things started, but that's about it.\n\nBeing concerned about AI in 20 years is perfectly reasonable though. We've seen major advancements over just the last two years, but we still are not completely sure if there's a \"ceiling\" that might cap what AI can do, or if those advancements will continue to accelerate.\n\nOverall, if you're passionate about something, especially at such a young age, it's worth investing some time into that passion. No one knows what the world is going to look like in 5 years, let alone 20. People who are really passionate about what they do, and put in the time and effort to make smart decisions, tend to make things work.\n\nEdit: grammar",

I had to physically move my phone to another room during coding time because willpower doesn't work with dopamine addiction.\n\n\n\nStarted small with just making my bed every morning, then added 25-min coding sessions.

None of this involves actually writing code, more so understanding the problem and breaking it down to a manageable level.  It's okay if you only understand a bit here and there over the course of several days or even weeks. I get easily distracted as well so I'll just pick at the code.  For example, reading a function then walking away and thinking about how it works and fits into the entire file while I'm washing dishes or something.  I keep doing this until my natural curiosity and hyper focus takes over and I ride that until I'm tired.\n\nI'll also watch tech videos or listen to tech related books/podcasts.  Not directly productive, but passive learning is better than nothing and it helps my mind stay occupied with tech.\n\nSometimes going down learning rabbit holes of adjacent stuff can help break up the monotony of whatever task.  Like learning more about networking, business, or a different stack/language may help with the bigger picture even if it doesn't help with your programming right now today.\n\nDoing something is always better than doing nothing even if it's not directly the task at hand or if you don't work on it that long.",

When you dominate the syntax you start to develop a skill to write the code without thinking in the semantics but in what can be possible output. \n\nIt’s a process that takes time because we in normal days solving a problem we use the real logic but in programming you have the abstraction to representing real situations in a programming language. \n\nIf you think in closing a door, you imagine the door fiscally and the knob, but in an algorithm you could think in the coordinate of the knob or if the door is open or close or even if there is a door, so after you have this clear in you mind so you translate each action in code. This is a process to take time to become automatic, similar to drive a manual transmission, the first times you really think a lot when changing the velocity, but after you don’t think on that at all. \n\nFurthermore, if you don’t know something exists (a solution) how can you know about it. I mean, my point is I am very ignorant about some music if I never listen before, but the first time you hear it you can know if you like. Solving problems is like that, you don’t know the solution and even where to start, but with practice and learning how others approach the problem you will develop this sense of recognising patterns. \n\nA way to deal with this more in practice is learning how to debug and learning debugging tools, so you can see the step by step of the code and the output. \n\nTake a look at (python/C tutor)[https://pythontutor.com/c.html#mode=edit] try it and solve some algorithms there.",

I started with that as well as C. This kicked my ass thoroughly, but I managed to join a closed source project for an old MMO game emulator. There was another one that was the competitor around 2003 that was open source. We had decided to merge but they made an interesting choice during the merger. This strange language called C#. This was a very early version of it. But I couldn't believe how cool and approachable it made things. I personally loved it. Others hated it and said nothing serious could ever be built with it. But me being new to this, I loved the idea of removing so much complexity behind things like memory management, it was like magic. You could get so much done by doing less. This decision fractured the team. The C++ diehards refused to work with it and eventually left to continue the C++ version, I stayed on the C# version. Fast forward some years, the C# version was pumping out more and more features while the C++ version couldn't keep up. Eventually the C++ version of this project died out, but the C# project is still alive today (sort of, it's gone stagnant since about 2018 or so). But it's incredible to see how far C# has come over the years. It's what I use in my current job (the little bit of coding an architect does anyway). \n\nI think it's important to know how languages like C/C++ work as they provide a better understanding of what's going on under the hood. But I also think it's better for someone new to start with something more approachable like Java & C#. That's good you decided to delve into it after learning Java. It's all good stuff to know, but certainly not a requirement. If anything, can make you really appreciate everything these higher level languages are doing for you.",

Understanding operational concerns and business processes related things is always helpful and keeps you from being too ecentric.\n\nWhether or not certificates matter is controversial. Certification for the sake of certification is often a trend where the value added decreases significantly.\n\nA lot of IT certifications are very trivial and vague at the same time. I did the basic Microsoft IT Azure certs when I saw the opportunity and it felt very much like advertising for Microsoft product lines and a lot of vague words.",

It is not that you \"must\" learn DSA to know how to write programs, but it will probably enrich your knowledge base, enhance your problem-solving skills, and give you an understanding of the performance implications of different data structures and algorithms.\n\n\nHaving a \"side project\" is orthogonal to learning about different programming concepts. Having your own project allows you to challenge your assumptions of how things work, put into practice what you have learned (and learn even more from your own mistakes).\n\n\nYou may check the FAQ (in the sidebar); it has, for example, a section on different exercises and project ideas that can be helpful.",

There are easier ways to do that.\n\nThe answer still is personal projects. Data structures and containers are much better to learn when considering your project's requirements and tailoring them to fit it, than memorizing different types of data structures and containers while having no clue about how and when they would actually be best to use over the alternatives. And conclusions you reach on your own you will memorize and internalize much better than conclusions you reach because a book told you that that's how it works, which might or might not even be correct.",

Now I can print “Hello, World!” with confidence :)\n\nI eventually plan to go back at the end when I finish the whole tutorial/lesson/class on what I’m watching (like 4-8hrs of said programming language) to refactor and make all the lessons and mini projects code to be more efficient. And that’s in hopes of refreshing concepts as I clean the code getting some hands on experience, even if not crazy complex.\n\nAn example: at the end of my current YouTube class/lesson, or maybe in the middle when topic is touched, I plan to somehow create an array or some data structure to be able to rotate my lessons/miniprojects to run and output instead of hard coding each function I want to run. If that makes sense. So I’d implement concepts I learn with my own notes.",

Your having trouble with something explain it (you might find the answer while you talk through it), show each approach you went through and if you have to go back and change something earlier in the project hilight it and make a note on that entry incase you go back to check it.

Well, you can start small, I would assume that tictactoe is too simple for you as well, what about something in between, like Pacman? You can add a lot of interesting depth to that game. \n\nSome part of it is visual, which usually helps make it a little more interesting and captivating. But there's also stuff like Ghost behavior, which can be solved in a lot of ways. You can do it with more traditional search algorithms, you can make deterministic tabled graphs to use for look up. They both need to flee and pursue Pacman, the 4 ghosts all act differently, so figuring out how to add that nuance in, once you find the solution you want to use could be an interesting little thing to tweak around with.",

There are like a million CSS frameworks and other front end technologies that exist, I think not a ton of people really spend time tinkering with this stuff directly as a career. Similarly, you can have a UI without being a front end expert, just keep it very basic, like just use a template and be done.\n\n3. You can just have projects with no UI, this is extremely common. In fact, a project should really just solve one little tiny problem if possible, and if someone else wants to make a separate project that wraps your project with a UI then fine.\n\n4. Not that this probably matters for you, but there is a subtle difference (front end devs can correct me if I'm wrong) between front end software dev versus UI/UX design. You can design for functionality (and performance etc.) on the front end without really worrying about the design itself. You can conversely design a UI without getting into the functionality or even writing any code.",

That’s a real sign you’ve found something you’re genuinely passionate about. A lot of great devs started the same way - just getting lost in code.\n\nSince you're learning C#, that’s a strong start. It’s used in tons of real-world applications - especially in enterprise software, game dev with Unity, and even backend web stuff (with .NET). So don’t think it’s a “just-for-school\" language - it’s got legs in the industry.\n\nIf you're eyeing cybersecurity and want to branch out smartly, here's a quick breakdown of useful languages based on where you might go:\n\nFor Cybersecurity:\n\nPython – absolute must. It's everywhere in cybersec (automation, scripting, tooling, etc.), super beginner-friendly, and has a massive library ecosystem.\n\nBash/Shell Scripting – essential if you're going to be dealing with Linux servers or writing security automation scripts.\n\nC/C++ – if you ever want to understand exploits, memory management, or reverse engineering.\n\nFor General Dev / Building Stuff:\n\nJavaScript + HTML/CSS – if you ever want to touch frontend or build tools with a GUI.\n\nGo – gaining traction in cloud & network tooling, really nice for fast and secure backend systems.\n\nSince you're enjoying it already, I'd say:\n\nStick with C# and get comfy building small projects.\n\nStart Python next - you’ll love how fast you can get stuff working.\n\nMaybe check out TryHackMe or Hack The Box once you’re comfortable with the basics - great intro to hands-on cybersec.\n\nAlso, shameless plug, but I’ve been using this app called BootSelf lately. It gives you an AI mentor that helps explain code and quiz you with flashcards. Pretty helpful if you're learning solo and want to stay on track. There's a free version if you're curious.\n\nYou’re on a great path - you don’t need to have it all figured out right now. Just keep following your curiosity, and you’ll build the skill stack naturally.\n\nGood luck, and keep building 👊",

How do you decide what technologies to learn? What techniques do you use to learn technologies faster?\n\n\nEveryone will have different ways to tackle these problems.\n\n\nA lot of people will tell you to come up with a project that interests you. If you have an interesting problem you will find time to work on it. If you have an interesting project you will learn technologies that make the project better. If you have an interesting project you will learn the new technology faster than just trying to read about it.\n\n\nThere are other ways to answer those questions. You should try many things and figure out what works best for you.",

That's because figuring out *what* to learn and in what order often isn't entirely obvious, sometimes I just have to waste time learning something I'll never use in order to figure that out.\n\nBut when l've decided, I start with a mix of reading independent blog posts, analyzing usage statistics and browsing Reddit. I look for what seems exciting or relevant to the kind of software I might want to build.\n\nFor example, I wanted a personal website, which led me to Eleventy. I tried to dive in, read some docs, and attempt small things, until I realized that I was really struggling to get what I wanted. I then looked for a tutorial that builds a complete project, so I could get a notion for what it could look like. When doing tutorials, I try to actively change minor things, add small features, or try to integrate it with something else. I like doing this because it forces me to understand why it works and make it my own.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree with project-based learning. I also like to say that you should embrace failure and be quick to abandon learning projects if they're not serving their purpose (i.e., you're not learning or enjoying the process). The goal is learning, not necessarily something you'll put on your portfolio.",

For learning systems, check out courses/materials online. I recommend Nand2Tetris, it’s a wonderful resource. \n\nThere’s no reason you can’t learn C and learn systems at the same time, but it helps to have some familiarity with how C works before diving into a really complex systems project like an OS kernel",

I was hired into a team and at a time where all the others in my cohort had masters degrees and seemed so much more experienced than I was. And it's possible that they were, I didn't realize that it didn't actually matter that much. I was showing up, passionate about doing a good job, and learning every day.\n\nI have a distinct memory of talking to a mentor about it. A meeting had just ended and I asked him to hang back in the conference room with me. I mentioned those feelings, that I wasn't as good as the other junior developers. I'd hoped my mentor would have some sage advice for me, recommendations on learning materials to catch up, or even just a pep talk. Instead, he told me to never let anyone hear me say that again. Because people will believe it if they hear it. And it sort of crushed me, because **I believed it.**\n\nLater on, that same mentor was let go from the company. In my final chat with him he shared that he'd had a lot of personal things going on in his life. The reality is that he was struggling too, all that time. And his way of handling it had been to put up that front. That's why I thought he was the person who would be able to help me. Because he presented like he had it figured out. When really, he was falling behind just like the rest of us. He felt lost. His mental state was impacting his work, etc. And worst of all, he didn't have a healthy mindset of how to address it.\n\nYears later, I was one of the most senior people working on a product. I had a manager who was new in role and together we built out a team of mostly college hires to stand up and then operate a new set of services. Every one of those developers we hired were brilliant. I always felt like they were so far ahead of where I was when I started and found each of them to be so impressive. But sure enough, in the months and then years that followed our building that team out... those new junior developers would each take me aside on their own to express how they were struggling with feelings in inadequacy. Literally, every single one.\n\nIronically, it was those junior developers who helped me to overcome my imposters syndrome. Not the experienced mentor like I'd imagined. It was when I realized how **we all feel behind,** that I managed to wrangle my own feelings. What you're feeling now is completely normal. Its okay to be vulnerable. To share if you feel lost, or don't understand something that everyone else seems to. You are on the long road to becoming an expert. Give yourself grace.",

And pretty much everyone I've seen who thinks they have it, doesn't actually have it either.\n\nThey're merely recent graduates who've hit the point on the Dunning-Kruger curve where they're correctly realizing how little they know about CS, and feeling overwhelmed. Their feelings of inadequacy are completely justified because they **are** literally beginners, and now they're understanding that completing a 3 year degree doesn't mean they know everything.\n\nOr they're too young to understand that the top 1% of any field are outliers, and everyone else is just a regular human who makes mistakes and doesn't know everything. Basically they haven't yet mentally grown out of the phase where they think parental figures are magical perfect beings, they've just replaced their actual parents with like, a senior colleague, or some YouTuber. But hey, better that pirate software guy than fucking Peterson or Tate right? Then their idol either quits or fucks up, and after a short existential crisis they realize they were just normal people after all, boom no more \"Imposter Syndrome\".\n\nOr they've grown up with social media, where your understanding of the world is warped by selection bias. User X is an expert in A, user Y is an expert in B, user Z is an expert in C, they conflate it into some amalgamation of everyone knows everything. Then they get a job in the real world and find out individual people are good at maybe a few things, but really fucking stupid at everything else.\n\nTL;DR as far as I can tell 99% of \"Imposter Syndrome\" is just young people lacking cognitive development and real world experience to understand they have every right to feel less capable. They literally are. That's why we pay them less. If you're asking questions on this sub, chances are you fall into at least the first category, if not the others as well.",

This is why, in general, doing is far more important than reading.\n\n>How did you go from understanding the theory to actually applying it?\n\nThat's backwards. You understand the theory by applying it. Work on a project, encounter problems, fix the problems.\n\n>Any good projects or tutorials you’d recommend for practicing?\n\nAny project that you personally care about and are motivated by. And it's far more useful if you work on it yourself instead of just copying it from some book or video. \n\n>Or even just personal experiences — what helped it all *click* for you?\n\nFirst, figure out the properties of your problem, and then find a solution that best fits those properties. Try thinking about the future, like \"what if I wanted this to work for both 32-bit and 64-bit floats?\" or \"what if I wanted to change the database I use without having to change any other part of my program\" and the solutions guide you to SOLID principles naturally. \n\nI think that it's important to always have a reason for everything you do. Don't follow the SOLID principles because someone told you that it would be good to do. Understand what problems they help you solve or avoid. If you don't understand, then don't use them. Eventually, you might encounter a debugging session that frustrates you, and you might then realize that the use of SOLID would have avoided you the headache.

Well, those patterns never really resonated with me and using Java helped solidify to me that OOP cannot be the simplest way to organize things in a maintainable way.\n\nIn my career I’ve seen a lot of patterns, and the one that really clicked for me was pure functional programming. Working with a language that doesn’t have mutable objects, null values, or even a semblance of classes was such a revelation: nearly all the problems the golden rules try to mitigate come from mutability and complex hierarchical state. Pure functions always return the same result, given the same arguments, which makes testing them incredibly easy and fun. And if the language has nothing but pure functions, then all applications built with it are incredibly easy and fun to test.\n\nMy point is, it’s okay if some aspects of programming don’t click. Maybe they will later on, when you’ve seen how following it avoided issues or cutting corners lead to issues. Maybe you’ll come across another way of looking at things (like FP for me) that finally makes sense and helps put everything else in a new perspective.\n\nJust build things you want to build, that’s the only way programming is going to start making sense. Try following the rules and try breaking them. Come up with your own solutions and once done, analyze if what you did actually followed a common pattern, just in a roundabout way. If not, was it better than the common pattern? Why did it work, would it scale to a larger codebase or a project with 10 developers?",

Dependency injection means some external body knows all about the internals of an object and injects other objects into that object as needed.\n\nNow the OOD model still works if you think IoC as some kind of God object that has control of the construction of every object in the system. Because IoC is a God these objects literally pop into existence.\n\nOnce you understand this, it makes a lot more sense.

A consulting company usually wouldn't care how you accomplish a task as long as it works. A product based software company will usually demand more as they have invested a lot of effort and resources in that product.\n\n> Now, I have found out that, that I'm really dumb. I had been using web servers for an year in JS and only recently I figured out the entire architecture when I had to build an HTTP server from scratch in C. It has been a huge challenge and still is.\n\nA common pitfall many new devs fall into. Do you really need to understand everything about everything? Don't get me wrong, I want to differentiate between you wanting to know how HTTP server works architecture wise and you feeling like you have to know how HTTP server works. One serves to broaden and enhance your skills while the other only serves to impede you.\n\n> If I learn how to apply a concept without first trying to understand it completely, is this a good strategy?\n\nIt depends on what you are trying to understand. Do you want to know if it is possible to do a task using a particular concept? Sure, you can implement messaging between two clients using BLE(Bluetooth Low Energy) by following a YT video. Do you want know the limits of what you can do with BLE? You then go and read the RFC for BLE, learn about it's specs, versions etc.\n\nTL;DR:- Both approaches are fine, it all depends on what you want. Want to get something done and don't really care for implementation details, go for application over mastery. Want to know what is possible and what isn't? Go for mastery over application.",

As you become a better programmer, you should be able to \"run code in your head\", envision how it will work, and how it achieves your goal.\n\nIf something isn't working right, that means there's a gap in your mental model — something in the code that you are understanding differently than how it actually is. You should seek to close that gap by understanding *why* it works differently than you expected, so that you can pinpoint the exact wrong assumption or belief that you had.\n\nDisclaimer — obviously, you can't know every piece of knowledge about every tool — you need to decide what is \"out-of-scope\" for you. As a programmer, at least your entire chosen programming language should be in scope for you.\n\nFor example, I work in TypeScript, so for any issue that I run in to in my TypeScript code, I make sure to fully dig into it so that I can improve my mental model for next time. However, if my code encounters an issue when deploying to a Linux server, I may decide that I don't have an interest in Linux servers at the moment, so I might spend less time digging deeply to understand everything there is to know, or I may ask my co-worker who may be more experienced in Linux.",

Annoyingly, XCode only runs on MacOS too so if you don’t have a Mac you’re out of luck.\n\nLots of cross platform apps these days like discord start out as web apps since so many people know web development, and use a framework like React Native or Electron to transform those apps into things that run on all sorts of other platforms, so you could start out by learning some basic web scripting in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Depends on what YOU want. Skillset or More Money from levelling up what your job requires.\n\n\nIf you have the same interest as the thing you work, that's the cherry in top. If not, you can work something else. Maybe strengthen your unity skills, one good indie game can make you hell lot of money. You can try freelancing and other things.\n\n\nAlso, as you said that your are finding new things everytime you learn something, don't get overwhelmed. I've been a unity game dev for 7 years and everytime I open Unity documentation almost always I find something new. Coding is such a thing that would not fully end even if you die. It's natural to get overwhelmed and fell lost but don't,my friend, it's a long journey.\n\n\nAlso please don't try to learn everything at the same time, like you metioned java, 5 other things, first master one thing and then move on the other.\n\n\n3. You can use AI to either make you an intellectual or completely destroy your brain, depends on how you use it. ONLY use it when you are stuck on a problem or a bug for a few 20 minutes. AI doesn't destroy anyone, they let AI destroy them, it has been the best thing that happened to me because I used it responsibly.\n\n\nThis was my answer, believe me , thing will get better, you WILL overcome the doubts you have, just believe in yourself,good luck and ALL OF THE BEST BROTHER, YOU CAN DO IT.",

I can't speak to how it compares to other codebases but for someone who has only worked on small projects for classes, it's pretty daunting. Plus, while I have basic familiarity with Java, I don't know C# at all.\n\nI looked at a bunch of other mods for the game and decompiled the source code to get some starting points, but it wasn't long before I ran into roadblocks that no amount of Googling would have ever resolved. Normally, I'd probably have just given up. Being able to make tangible progress has been hugely helpful in keeping motivation up and frustration down, and I feel like I've learned a ton about C#, Unity games and even certain OOP concepts I wasn't super familiar with.\n\nBeing able to say, \"Okay, here's how this other mod did Y, can you give me some ideas on how to implement similar idea X?\" Or, \"I understand what this piece of code accomplishes, but why is it structured like this?\"\n\nYou have to be willing to challenge the AI's ideas sometimes, too. Like, a specific weird issue I was having with this mod the AI suggested a very \"brute force\" solution that probably would have worked, but I was 99% sure was not the correct or \"ideal\" way to do it. So I would say, \"No I'm pretty sure you're wrong. I can see a bunch of methods in this source file that may be applicable to our situation, maybe we can find an alternate path?\" And then we found a better solution together. The AI didn't solve the problem for me, it just saved me the frustration of having to parse thousands of lines of unfamiliar code in the hope that I was on the right track.\n\nIt definitely leads me astray sometimes, it hallucinates methods pretty regularly but *conceptually* it's implementation plans are usually pointed in the right direction. I treat it like a pair programmer, not a code monkey, and I can say with complete confidence that I have a better understanding of coding because of it.",

That solid foundation will make it much easier to pick up new technologies down the road. From what you've shared, I'd say focus on either Python or Java for now. Both are powerful, widely used, and have a lot more to offer than most people realize at first.\n\nOnce you're confident in one language, you'll be in a better position to understand how and when to use other tools specially in project-specific contexts.\n\nYou'll hit plenty of bumps down the road, so no need to get frustrated this early on. :)",

Sitting down and actually breaking down each element, what do I want, what do I need, who will be doing x and who does y? What “date” should I be using and why?\n\nLearning how to define the success factors and set realistic goals is vital in coding. As I’m going through it I’ll jot down possible approaches and methods I might need going forward. I don’t need to fully code them now but I need to make sure I have everything tight for when things get complicated later. \n\nYou won’t be designing every system you work on from the ground up but you will need to be able to read and identify what the other coders were doing, what were they thinking when they made this method or class and where does it go? You won’t be able to feed full applications into an AI to read them out to you when you’re on a team. \n\nI also put a lot of work in before I started college and got advanced entry into Y2. At Christmas I was miles ahead of most in the class and took the foot of the gas looking at other languages instead. Come April I realised I’d slipped too much and had work my balls off to catch up. Yes I had a basic understanding of what we did but I couldn’t use it effectively. \n\nThe best example was SQL. I could read SQL, I knew where the query was going how things joined but I struggled trying to fix it together myself. I used AI while making my database connections and had to constantly look back to do them from scratch myself. Eventually I just stopped using the AI designed methods as this is something I need to be able to do. \n\nWe had interviews presenting our final projects at the end of the year and they asked “You have well designed methods for database queries in the first 4-5 frames but you don’t use them later in the project. Why?”  I explained that while I would be using those methods from the helper files in real world conditions, I wasn’t happy with my understanding of them. I couldn’t do them from memory and kept making errors, so I decided to drill them in by typing them out each time. \n\nThey loved that answer. It showed I was able to use helper files and methods to keep code clear and concise making the project easy to read, but I also knew how to make and adjust the process to perform custom tasks. They asked me to isolate certain conditions and how I would pick out individual combinations and I was able to do it on the spot because I knew the system and understood how it worked. Some of the others struggled with that as AI had done all the thinking for them. \n\nWhen it came to exams I flew through the test because I A) understood how I would do it. B) was able to identify what they were looking for and how to trace back to it. And C) I made the mistakes and worked my way through them so when they happened there I knew what I was looking at. \n\nTLDR:\n\nDon’t use AI to design everything. Yes it’ll spit out loads of lovely code that works for this window of the project but it won’t improve your skills or work when you only have this small section on larger projects. \n\nKeep pushing in college, you might be ahead right now but that’ll slip real quick it you get lazy",

Then, if you want to incorporate some OOP principles, you could create a more complex program that involves abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and/or polymorphism.\n\n\n\nIf you need ideas for projects, you can google \"<language name here> beginner projects.\" You're bound to find one that catches your eye. And if you ever get stuck on something, just google \"how to X in Y,\" where X is some task (e.g. use a switch statement), and Y is the programming language you are working with.\n\n\n\nTLDR: courses are beneficial, but they are even more helpful when supplemented with practical work and experimentation.",

You just need to learn to live with it and take the challenges step by step.\n\nIn programming, you will never stop learning and will always be fighting an uphill battle as there is always way more that you don't know than what you do know. There is always a huge mountain ahead of you. Yet, if you take it like you climb a mountain by looking at the path, the steps ahead of you instead of looking at the seemingly unreachable summit, everything becomes much more manageable.\n\nAlso, too many people in programming are *afraid*. Afraid of not living up to the(ir) expectations. Afraid to break things. Afraid for completely irrelevant reasons.\n\nThere is nothing to be afraid of in programming. Unless you do some incredibly stupid things (like deleting random files, or formatting your computer) nothing serious can happen. The worst case is that you need to restart the computer, so what?\n\nYou need to shift your mentality about failures: with every failure, with every error, with every thing that doesn't work like you expected, you have learnt something. You have learnt how not to do things. This is equally important to knowing how to do things.\n\nIf you mess up something, you'll remember. If everything runs smoothly without battling from the start, you're not remembering, nor learning.",

With the artificial intelligence competition increasing day by day, I honestly don't know if most people will even have jobs in the future though. It's scary, even if people try to ignore the impact of ai and tell me otherwise. I don't know what to do either. I am confused too.\nI wish you a lot of success and happiness in life!!🧿😁",

A rockstar SWE living in bumfuck nowhere Montana might be making a very \"normal\" salary at a normal company, and a dumbass SWE living in the Bay Area might've weaseled their way into a top-paying SV startup. And we *certainly* don't make \"2x or 3x\" what ***most*** other white collar fields make. Maybe if by \"most\" you include working in fast food, but definitely not white collar.\n* For one, this isn't an inherent trait of a SWE career. It *never* has been. There are lots of fully onsite companies, even top tech companies. But it's also not unique to SWE. It's a trait *of a company*, not of a role. At every hybrid/remote company I've worked at, ***everyone*** is hybrid/remote and is afforded that same amount of flexibility. Marketing, sales, legal, IT, etc.\n* It's genuinely interesting to you and me! But to a lot of people out there what you just described is more boring than watching paint dry. Different strokes for different folks.\n* Variety also exists in many other careers... You know those prestigious companies you're talking about? And the exciting startups you're talking about? Guess what they both also hire? Non-SWE's.\n* Now you're just saying \"White Collar careers are the best careers by far\". This has nothing to do with SWE.\n* If you work for a large, well-known company it's just as likely (I'd argue significantly *more* likely) that you'll be working on some boring internal tool that has 20 internal users. Scale is also not inherent of this career. \"I work for Google\", \"Cool, what do you do there?\", \"Oh.. uhh... I manage a dashboard that lets a small team of internal users track internal budgets between departments\".\n\nIt's a great career, don't get me wrong. But all of what you're describing isn't inherent of a SWE career, nor is it unique to a SWE career. There are billions of people. When you use words like \"best\", you're forgetting that the overwhelming majority of humans out there don't care at all about the things you care about.\n\n*Your* \"best\" career is someone else's living nightmare. Someone else's \"best\" career that makes them love waking up in the morning (someone who *enjoys* a manual labor job and like working outside, in extreme conditions for example), might be ***your*** living nightmare.\n\nIf you enjoy SWE, pursue it. There's really no point in trying to argue it's the objectively \"best\" field. Let people do what people want to do with their lives.",

The demand, i.e. desire, for R&D hasn't gone away- it's arguably only getting more intense than ever in strategic technologies what with all the \"but china\"-isms. But the cost of financing R&D has ballooned between the hike in interest rates (keeping zombie companies on debt fueled life support, incentivizing borrowing to spend on growth, i.e. R&D) and loss of immediate tax breaks. (ammortization is the same in the long term- but getting the full break that year is the difference between 20% cost reduction and 4%. If not for the previous years of instant \"refunds\", they'd have stacked 4 years of ammortizations and have the same effect right now.)\n\n**The loss of the tax advantage for R&D and the hike in interest rates would have suppressed wages, but not diminished the demand for employees.** What we're seeing is collusion between major tech employers to time their layoffs with the DOGE cuts to create a glut of desperate, highly senior, non-pay motivated talent in the market. The longer they can perpetuate it, the more desperate those people will get, and it creates a hermit crab conga line of companies firing their less senior staff hired when times were good to bring in more senior staff who've finally gotten desperate enough to accept lower pay.\n\nThere is an argument to be made that because other companies are laying off tech staff and the abundance of tech graduates is creating an environment where wages are so severely depressed that it becomes in the interest of companies to also layoff their staff to rehire cheaper replacements *without direct collusion*, but **when that sort of behavior occurs in the banking sector or stock market, there are regulations in place to prevent the situation from becoming a feedback loop that tanks the institutions.** \n\n**This cycle of mass layoffs will repeat every time companies think they can get lower wages, more experience or both from a new hire over their current staff until the US gets serious about passing labor protection laws.**",

When you're growing, you need to hire a lot of people to take bit bets on many projects. You have to pay more and making interviewing less frictionful if you're hiring a lot of people. If you're focusing on profitability, cost cutting by reducing labor is a huge lever.\n2. Tax issues like Section 174 also have an effect. For big tech companies, it doesn't matter as much since these companies are very profitable and have strong cashflow. They're already paying a lot of corporate income taxes in most cases anyways. For startups and not yet profitable, growth companies, this makes it more financially challenging to operate. It also pushes them toward profitability and cost cutting, but this may not be viable for more growth-oriented business models.",

Said friend's work would be passed onto the non-Indian team members and then those team members would get blamed when the extra work wouldn't get done on time.

I just haven't passed the technical screening. \n\nThe first one was just bad luck. I had the interview during a vacation and had to do the technical screening after I came back from vacation and was very jetlagged. I passed 4 /5 which and they said it close but not enough to move to the next round. Second one was my fault for not asking how the test would be structured. I was studying SQL + python when I only should have studied python. Failed the assessment due to a few concepts that I've never needed to use and could look up in like 30 seconds. But I didn't know off the top of my head.\n\nOh well. Lesson learned and I will be more prepared in the future.",

That was the whole point of the layoffs. If all these big tech companies lay off employees at the same time, the hiring pool is suddenly filled with lots of talented employees. All of these employees need jobs and are competing with each other. In order to get employed again, some of these employees will take big pay cuts. So the companies are able to hire new staff at the same or similar level of talent for a reduced cost.\n\nThat obviously won't work forever. And once the economy improves some of these employees will jump ship. But it's what these companies have decided to do in the short term.",

Larger companies like FAANG have attempted to address this through vesting. You don’t get fully paid unless you’re there for 4 years. On year 4 you’re getting paid for your first year of work. Leaving is like losing 4 years of half of your pay. \n\nIn Europe wages are lower in part because people are far less likely to jump ship due to pay so they can just low ball everyone from the get go.

Somehow I settled on law and began planning a career move.\n\n\nBut very quickly I realised it was the wrong choice. The law students I met seemed highly competitive and political, much more than any programmer I'd ever met, and there was a vague desperation to them. I read frank accounts of how numbing the work was and the crises of many lawyers who hit 40 and realise they're wasting their lives.\n\n\nI didn't leave technology in the end, I embraced it. I was looking for a career to fill holes in my self-image and try to counter my gnawing self-hatred. No job will do that. And I began to appreciate how creative I could be as a programmer once I accepted that I will never be perfect at it.\n\n\nOver the years I've become very thankful for this choice. Programming is what gets me up in the morning, there is nothing else like it for me. I will always be learning and it will never get boring.",

A mediocre performance on a very supportive team will likely be better than a stellar performance on a highly dysfunctional team. \n\nI think you should as a minimum try to find: \n\n* A manager who's been with a team for multiple halves\n* At least one IC6+ who works around you (if not associated with your work), also multiple halves on the team\n* Ideally, clear scope and some sort of vision for the team. \n\nThere's a lot of subjective opinions, but I think these are generally agreeable things that are worth prioritizing. It's relatively common to have weak support (either by a manager carousel or lack of E6+ sponsors) that can block your promo - ask me how I know lol. \n\nMore subjectively, I think it's worth finding a team that you trust in their feedback (there are some people who are 10x more critical than average), and if you care about timelines, a staggering of levels (if there's like 8 E3s, it might take longer for your promotion to come through). \n\nAs an aside - I think performance will be much more about stakeholders talking about how great you are / other people in PSC, and objective metrics are somewhat secondary, esp for E3->E4.",

They might not want to/cant give you opportunities to check off those requirements.\n\nImpact is also important. Theres an idea in big tech where you need to make impact, which means “what can i do to make something easier for another engineer”. Its not always “i have to work on the newest feature”(although ig is alway making then removing features lol), it could be related to fixing something for On-Call, etc. You just need to optimize some part of the job to “make life easier”.\n\nThe only thing you need is to adapt and meet these requirement, but the hard part is if your team is going to even let you/give you the opportunity.

I was a bit worried when starting the search due to the doomer posts on this sub, but it honestly hasn’t been that bad. I admit I’m in a decent position due to a well-known but not FAANG company on my resume (as a previous role, not current role), name brand school, and yoe. \n\nI dropped to about 50 jobs on LinkedIn and other job boards, heard back from 8+ decent companies (like companies you might recognize, not just no name startups). Hit rate is much better for recruiters who reached out to me via LinkedIn or email. I honestly had to stop responding back after the first week of showing “open to job opportunities” on LinkedIn because of the overwhelming amount of messages for various startup roles, mostly AI. Went through the process for about 20 companies so far, rejected by 15, with the rest still ongoing but probably not able to finish before the offer deadline.\n\nBehavioral questions and hiring manager rounds I think are a cakewalk, just prepare your stories ahead of time. Hardest part is grinding leetcode questions to shake the rust off implementing DFS, binary search, etc. Feels like school again. System Design is okay. Can be challenging sometimes, but I feel like it’s easier to fall back on work experience with this and supplement with some studying. As opposed to coding questions which doesn’t have as much overlap with real work, and it feels like you just need to study solutions to a lot of different questions and practice.\n\nI don’t doubt that the market is grim out there for new grads or early in career folks, and certainly worse than a few years ago for senior folks. But at least from my limited pov, it’s still okay. When I get rejected, it’s still mostly because I fucked up a coding question. And there's definitely no shortage of AI startups trying to hire senior engineers.",

In practice, it means that the law says an employer has to post a job ad for a role that had already been filled and ramped up a year+ earlier.\n\nThe undertone of these kinds of exposes seem to be that some cohorts are more \"deserving of the opportunity conferred by the law\", but arguably the immigration lawyers involved are actually going by the spirit of the law (even if it may technically be malicious compliance) when they ask the H-1B worker to provide job descriptions with excruciatingly high level of detail to construct these job posts. It is already hard enough to get candidates to match nice-to-haves in a regular job post, so who else can check every checkmark in a huge and highly specific list other than the person that is already doing the function, and with zero ramp up time, to boot? Or so the rationale goes.\n\nOne could argue that labor market assessment ought to be done upfront, and it actually is in some countries, notably the LMIA in Canada, but as Canadians might attest, that's not necessarily successful in practice either.\n\nPersonally I'm pretty cynical about political reform in general. \"Don't ask what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country\", as Kennedy famously said, if nothing else because the political machine doesn't really have your personal interest at heart in the first place.",

There were all these rules about how the robot could move and pick items that make no sense for an Amazon warehouse, but make perfect sense if you’re familiar with Boggle, but the interviewer never mentioned Boggle. It was clear that someone had an interview problem in mind and then had to awkwardly crowbar it into something Amazon related. ",

It's going to take a bit of time to read, to process the noise, to think of a solution and it takes time to write the code for question 1 and by the time you finished writing the code for q1, you are met with a bug. Then by the time you solved the bug, you now only have 10-20 minutes left to work on question 2. There is no time left to work on q2, especially when both qs are leetcode hard. Not sure if that's very reflective of the industry, at least in the internship I did, it wasn't like \"you must solve this in X minutes, otherwise we are all doomed\".\n\nThe other thing I don't like about leetcode questions being used for assessments is that we can't use debugging tools. I use my IDE to debug my code, to understand where my logic is wrong, to better understand my thought process and to fix them accordingly. This is also what happens in the industry but I can't use them. And so I am left staring into the screen trying to understand what I am doing wrong, I am trying to guess where I fked up. Sometimes print statements are not helpful because you don't know where you are going wrong and it's not effective/efficient. It all takes time.\n\nIt's like they are looking for robots/AI who can process everything in seconds and write up a solution in minutes. It's like they are not looking for humans.\n\nTo solve these questions, you need to have tons and tons of of leetcode practice. It's why I tell everyone to start DSAs asap, and to start leetcoding asap. It's the only way to match a robot/AI when it comes to big tech leetcode questions.",

If something isn't literally on fire, you probably don't need to drop everything else to do it today. Normally you agree on milestones and delivery deadlines upfront, or at least in advance.\n\nSecond is deconstructing delivery timelines based on whether it's due to technical complexity or due to scheduling. The former presumably means you've done some due diligence before estimating, and you should be able to articulate what the time consuming parts are with some degree of granularity, and their respective estimates. The latter is about what prior commitments you already have, and you have to decide how negotiable it is to make changes. Maybe you can deliver things faster by dropping/negotiating other things that have lower priorities or charging premium to work overtime or hiring a subcontractor, maybe not. If you can't, then be transparent about having other commitments. In other words, urgency is a feature, and you can charge money for it.\n\nIf it's a question of perception, you could try to explain via analogies, e.g. in law movies everything happens very quickly, often within the same day, whereas in reality, they drag on for months/years because in the real world things just take time.

What's so difficult about it?\" are asking those questions because what they *really* want to know is When will it be complete? So your response to these questions should be a date you'll have that feature complete. Once you give a deadline, you'll get many fewer of these questions and if you do, just refer them to the aforementioned date.\n\nThe other part of this is just that non-technical people just don't know how hard things are. They've been taught, through drag-and-drop website builders and, sadly, AI-marketing, that things are easy. A new form should take an hour to add, right?? It can also be helpful to explain, as part of the communication providing them with the estimated timeline, what goes into the feature you're building. If they ask for a button to send a report to their email, for example, you can explain that part of your work means preventing security issues, handling permissions, formatting the report, testing it, making sure the email doesn't go to spam, etc etc.\n\nAs for the full-time job part, if they knew you had a full time job when they contracted with you, you can remind them of that, but I honestly think that's unnecessary to include. Just focus on giving them the timeline and they'll back off. It's not coming from a place of malice for them; they're just feeling in the dark probably.",

Even in second to last year of engineering degree you start getting ambiguous problems instead of spoon-fed briefs. As a senior I’ve had to compose specifications starting with two sentences in a contract and compile information spread out across dozens of documents and people, and go through multiple rounds of feedback and corrections with the client.\n\nIt’s incredibly jarring to then join stand up and have a junior complain that they’re blocked and spent the day doing nothing because their ticket doesn’t have 100% of the information needed to finish it, and they didn’t bother to even ask or try and find it themselves. It’s not just juniors that do this but they’ve tended to be the worst offenders and it’s a fast track to losing respect at any level",

(made no money from them).\n\nHaving said.. that I got an Amazon interview and Google interview that I failed because I “prepared” myself with 3 days of leetcode before the interviews.\n\nI believe the guys I graduated with had a similar path. Very few got into fang (5/100 students probably) and most of us got jobs at local  relatively no name companies.\n\nI think my experience shows the importance of the networking opportunities you can find in school plus the importance of personal projects and I believe this still stands today. The peers that got into fangg were well above the average folk, they put the hours on leetcode, were passionate about coding and had good networking skills.",

In my area, I’ve noticed that whenever there’s big layoffs from big tech there’s suddenly a change in job postings looking for unicorn applicants from big tech with salary lower than what you’d expect coming from one of those big companies.\n\nMy advice: Look for jobs that don’t carry a title like “software engineer” but are at companies with software engineers. I technically work a “data” job but most of what I do is building internal tools and dashboards for business analysts and data analysts. \n\nI’m one of a few here at my company that have a CS background and I became a lead within about 6 months after being hired as a “Senior Developer”. I’m paid well because I’m the one who tests if new software or applications will help the team improve in some capacity. \n\nIt’s generally easier to get a job doing something technical at a company for a couple years and then pivot over to software engineer in the same company than it would be to get hired directly as a software engineer. In some cases you even get to skip the whole ten interview plus projects pipeline a bunch of companies are trying to do now.",

You may also have to do something similar in a salaried position, but it's usually mostly for PTO tracking purposes unless you are doing agency/consulting work for multiple clients or business verticals.\n\nMost places in the US are expecting at least 40 hours of time a week.

These are generally around 10am-4pm local time, but you're often expected to work at least 9am-5pm/6pm daily. Many places will also expect you to set up chat/email on your phone so you can reply to random messages managers send when they're anxiety working on the weekends, feel free to ***not*** do that though, setting boundaries early is a good thing.",

You want to get to know your co-workers because you want to be able to work with senior/principal engineers. The jrs who have a good upper level engineer on their side are usually the ones who succeed. It's hard to create the connection online because everybody is so busy and if they arent they arent trying to have DM chats with their co-workers. \n\nAlso you never have that transition so it is very easy to work 10+ hours without realizing it. Becuase yo uarent sure if others have left or not and sometimes doing an extra 30 minutes because you can and are waiting for something to finish building is easy to do with your laptop in the other room. \n\nAgain all this is job and team dependent. I will let you know that one thing that is never really said when you are in college is that many of these jobs are not really 9-5. Salary means you work to get the job done wheher it took you 20 hours or 60. Sometimes it's even a game you have to do.

How are they staying within the country?\n\nSome of them end up leaving. There are ways to stay, but for a lot of those people they need a legitimate job that pays legitimate money, and if they can't get that, then they end up having to leave because of not only immigration status but also finances.\n\n>Also, could this hiring freeze combined with the layoffs be intentional to make the foreigners leave the country without overstaying illegally on an expired visa? Basically slowing down hiring for 90 days until the foreigners on visa have to self deport?\n\nHiring freezes and layoffs are company-driven decisions. Those companies have no incentive to drive foreign workers out of the country - that would just make the cost of labor for them go up. Most companies want foreign workers to be available.\n\nSo this makes no sense. Companies are doing layoffs because layoffs = higher profits, and that has always been true.\n\n>If people on those visas do an unpaid internship, for example, can they stay in the country until they find a real paying job, even if it takes more than 90 days to find the job since they're not unemployed technically while doing an unpaid internship?\n\nYes. As long as it's a valid unpaid internship - i.e., an internship that is consistent with their field of study/profession. Like, on OPT you can't go get an unpaid job as a janitor and have it count. But you can, for example, work as an unpaid researcher for your former grad program (I've seen this done several times).\n\nAgain, the problem with that strategy is that you need to then have the finances to float you until you do find a job, which isn't something everyone can do. And in a lot of cases, if you get to that stage, a lot of people end up preferring to just go back to their home country and not have to deal with that situation.",

The tech stack, the team, what your role will consist of, what the expecations of you will be, what an average day of a SWE looks like, what kinds of major projects are coming in the future, etc should *not be a surprise*. These are all things you should be asking about in the reverse interview.\n\nNext time you job hop, make it a point to reverse interview. Otherwise you're literally just rolling the dice that you'll end up at another place that you thought would be doing X, but is actualy doing Y. You need to be the one rejecting companies you don't want to work for.\n\nThat being said, I don't think your situation is that bad. Firstly, *you got a job*. In 2023, as a new grad. That's a win, regardless of the stack you're using.\n\nAlso, especially this early in your career, companies won't necessarily require an exact 1-1 match of their tech stack expectations. You know Java. That's big. You can learn Spring on the side, or even on the job, it's not that hard. Just because you haven't worked professionally with Spring doesn't mean you're unqualified for Java/Spring positions.\n\nAnecdotally, I've switched stacks completely many times. Companies aren't DQ'ing me because I have no experience in their stack. They know I can learn on the job, and my resume paints that picture. One company I was talking to used Java/Micronaut, which was a completely new concept for me. That interested me, I had some great conversations about it with my interviewers, its pros/cons compared to Spring, etc. I got an offer. My confidence, and my interest in learning the new tech, made up for lack of experience in a core technology that company used. You can do the same, swapping out Spring/Micronaut with GWT/Spring.\n\nAll that said, right now you're disqualifying youself without even trying. You've made this whole post freaking out about starting to find jobs... *but you haven't started lookign for a job*. You have no idea how it's going to go for you. Make sure your resume is on point, get rid of the negative thinking and start oozing confidence because you're an intelligent SWE that can pick new things up easily. Companies will see that. My confidence, warranted or not, is what gets me my jobs offers.",

Be comfortable with saying \"okay, I don't know how that works properly... for now\". For now, just take a deep breath, every senior you respect has been where you are today. \n     \nHere are some tips to make your life easier:\n\n1. Keep your world small. The route you already did with your mentor is the GOLD right now. You have 2 possible small ways you can expand your world. A) implement the rest of the routes for the project that you are working on right now, B) implement the same route across other projects.  -  It is probably easier to implement the other routes.     \n2. When working on this type of thing, you will be slow initially, it might take you 2 weeks to get through 2 routes initially, but by the last week of the summer you might complete a route per day. In order to move quickly, you are going to have to move slowly and intentionally. Things like Gradle / DI / those other internal tools and random config files on first blush don't sound super relevant to the task at hand, only learn how to use it if it is going to progress your goal. If you are going to *not* learn it on purpose, write it down and square it away for later.     \n3. Ask for feedback often, your mentor may be able to tell you what route would be the next simplest to tackle.    \n4. Don't be afraid to look at pull requests where any specific route was implemented. Often times, complete feature pull requests give you a really good idea of just how \"Small\" your world can be when you want it to, if you find some good ones.     \n5. If you are stuck on a particular thing for more than an hour, ask - just ask, ask your mentor or something else, \"Hey <name>, do you have 5 minutes to explain something to me? I am trying to understand why when I remove the mock here this other test unexpectedly breaks - I Think you mentioned this during our call <initially | yesterday | on thursday>, but I think I just need a quick refresher - would super appreciate it!\"\n     \nJust take it a day at a time, recognise that feeling like you don't know stuff is normal, panicking will not help you and it will detract from your ability to learn. You are also wrong about one thing, the ability to \"remember\" context is not key for success at larger companies, the actual key is realising what context does and does not matter. No one on your team knows everything, they're just capable of figuring out what bits are important enough to learn *today* to progress them towards whatever goal they're working on.      \n      \nLate July is a also a fairly reasonable goal for the task you were given, without knowing the specifics of the codebase. You'll be fine, just keep your head down, stick to it, and remember, keep your world small!",

Make a new database with the UI and do CRUD operations. Can get up to speed in 1 day. Oracle isn't nearly as common as it used to be and MySQL is the cheapskate version of Oracle.

Recruiters were always cool with me only knowing 1 of the 3 since the others are easy to learn at that point. Using on the job goes a long way, else get an entry level cert that you see listed in a few job applications. The only cert that not a scam for this reason but it is crazy expensive. Thus your employer pays. Probably need a book or course and the exam has extra cheating detection.\n* **Learn one of Docker or Kubernetes**. You can learn both but there's some overlap. Pick what you see more in job descriptions. I guess Kubernetes and that's what I've seen more as well.\n* Microservices, yeah this is on the job experience. You can't teach yourself, or you can, but it won't matter to a recruiter.\n* Less important: Compliment Java with another language. Could be Python, Kotlin, Go aka Golang or TypeScript/JavaScript with your choice of React or Angular. Actually is important but if not used on the job, it ranks here.\n* Less important: Use Jetty with Spring Boot, preferably now on the job for local testing.

Bonus: Mock a database with JUnit + Mockito or PowerMock or whatever. You should know JUnit.",

But that doesn't change the fact that if it's an expectation, then from your employer's perspective you're not meeting expectations.\n\nAnother side of this in addition to employer expectations is your own professional boundaries. Did you clearly communicate your working hours? When contacted after hours did you make it clear that it was *after hours* for you and that you'd get back to them first thing in the morning?\n\nEspecially in a distributed world where people may be in different timezones, and where a lot of people are setting their own hours, some people just don't realize if it's after hours for someone else. That may be insensitive to not consider that before firing off messages... but it's not uncommon.\n\nEven on teams with a good WLB though, after hours messages happe from time to time, for various reasons. Sometimes it's urgent issues, sometimes someone just fired off a message without realizing it was after hours, sometimes someone was just sending a message before they forgot and aren't expecting a response until the nxt day. I don't guarantee to be reachablea fter 5pm, but f I get a Slack/Teams message after 5 I normally just pop in a quick response: \"What's the urgency on this?

Were you having 1/1's with your manager talking about what was going well and what wasn't? Your manager not renewing your contract should not have been a surprise.

It's a choice.\n\nAs an intern, your goal is to learn (which you're doing) and get a foot in the door.\n\nAs an employer, they're looking for talent that might come back. \n\nIf the relationship doesn't work for one party, then it doesn't proceed.  Simple as that.  But before you join the \"fuck that toxic company\" chorus, keep a couple things in mind.  The firm doesn't care about you -- that is totally true.  But it might be different for individuals.  This is a natural opportunity to network with them.  People move, so stay in touch, make a good impression, and show them what you can do.  People respond to positive people, so try to keep that going.\n\nNow to the caveat.  In my experience (in the US), interns are usually non-exempt.  So I don't expect them to go past their paid hours.  If you have a boss that doesn't understand that, that's not good.  But ultimately, it's your choice.  Anyway, it's all decided now, so just try to stay positive with colleagues in your time left.",

They might not have the budget to hire you full time and are just making up a reason to get HR off their back about making a decision when they'd rather keep their budget for other things.",

If that's how you feel about them, then you need to give them that feedback during the internship so they can address it.\n\n>Also, we have a new boss (boss of my boss) and this guy totally skips my direct boss to text me always outside working hours (once it was 6 pm, another at 7 and the most recent was a message this Friday at 9pm) which I always reply at 8am in the morning, and he never replies until he just texts me days after after working hours once again, am I wrong here?\n\nThere are two answers here: the practical one and the ideological one.\n\nThe practical one: \"Hey big boss, is this something urgent you need done right now - and if so, by when? If not, is it ok if I get back to you tomorrow at 8am?\". You just *have* to ask. I've been doing this for 12 years and got a new VP 2 years ago and the first time he asked me to do something at 5pm on a weekday I immediately assume he meant that instant (because I've had bosses like that in the past), but I asked \"hey, do you need this right now?\" and he immediately went \"oh god no, no - do not work on this right now. This is a tomorrow thing - I just wanted to get that in front of you because I won't have time to chat about it tomorrow\".\n\nBut i've had VPs that would have expected an answer that moment. And then you have to decide whether you want the job (which means you should do it), or whether you think this is BS and don't care to work for a company like that (in which case you don't).\n\nAnd that's the ideological answer: if you don't want to work for a company that expects you to be on call without being officially on call (i.e., getting paid more for it), then you shouldn't just go along with that stuff.",

That doesn't mean that there are no open doors for you, but it's going to limit you. Particularly if you ever think you might want to work in another country, your visa may hinge entirely on having a CS degree.\n\nWhen changing careers to software engineering, I went and did exactly what you are considering and got a Masters in CS. I have never even once had regrets, and many of the opportunities I've had wouldn't have been possible without it. If you have the time, and can afford the expense (I received a partial scholarship), I cannot recommend it enough.\n\nAdditionally, considering the current job market, it is so competitive for new grads right now that I don't think companies are taking risks on giving someone their first CS job with no work history and no degree. At this particular moment in time, I think it would be incredibly difficult to get your first job in the industry unless you already have personal connections to do so (getting the first job without a degree and proving yourself is the biggest hurdle) or are prepared to work for absolutely abysmal pay or conditions (which may have lifelong career repercussions -- people will probably know exactly how your previous employer paid you and treated you, and it can be a struggle for your wages to catch up even as you move to better and better companies). Getting the degree also gives time for the current job market to possibly improve, though I don't know I'd put money on it getting better so that's neither here nor there.",

It's not a great data source (uncontrolled factors like Indeed itself and changing in recruiting market), but it's a large signal that the overall field is not in a great place!\n\nThe other signal: [https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe\\_sbc.pdf](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe_sbc.pdf) is that unemployment for CS grads is higher than all 25-29 year olds, in a statistically significant way. (5.6% vs 2.9%) That's nearly double, so it is worse.\n\nAll that said, it's going to be very hard to determine which graduates without a job would have otherwise gotten one at a different time. This has always been a competitive field with people complaining they can't break in, but the situation is statistically worse today than a few years ago.\n\nbest of luck!",

They just need to hire a good applicant who can do the job, and they absolutely need to avoid lemons. So, maybe the best applicant went to a regional campus, and you'd miss them by only looking at kids who went to the state's flagship school; but on average, the kids that went to the flagship school will probably be good enough, and just like that 1,000 resumes became 100 resumes.\n\nNote that I am *not* saying this is ideal, equitable, etc. But unless or until the market turns around, it seems inevitable.",

Access to the latter category of jobs will increasingly be gated on pedigree: where you went to school, who you interned with, where you previously worked. Jumping tracks will be difficult to near impossible without some sort of inflection (like getting a graduate degree from a top institution). \n\nThis is already how it works in other fields like law and finance. In finance there is retail finance and high finance. In law there’s big law raking in big bonuses and local firms that aren’t.

When I got my new job they were offering me a good bump from my last job (about a 30% raise). When I told my GF (we live together) she looks at me and says \"OMG we will be able to buy so much for our house\".I dont want her to sound like she is money craved, it's more like she is a spend-mentality where i am save mentality. My mindset is I will live the same regardless of how much money I make (to a certain degree) and just save the rest and hoepfully retire younger. When I heard about the 30% raise my first thought was \"ok I can set about 10% of that to pay off some stuff from when I was unemployed, then when that's down invest that 10%, maybe with another 10% i will put in my savings/invest funds and then the last 10% will be for anything for us\". When she said that I was taken a bcak. My GF is someone who will pay and buy for her own things so I have never felt like she has cared about it. She'll buy me clothes even when I dont ask for it. She makes good money too. She has good money saved but when it comes for future money she hasnt really prepared well for it. She is definetely more of a spender than a buyer. \n\nTo your point about people not wanting to go down. I gave her some tips to help her save more and told her to put maybe a couple hundred bucks per paycheck. She did it and for over a month she was crying about how little her paycheck was now looking. Again this is a girl who makes 6 figures. I think she is around 105k and in a no-income state her take home is probably around 70k.",

I'll have to shift focus away from X in order to do that though, so X won't get done\".\n\nI have 40 hours in a week. My manager/PM is in charge of deciding how I use those 40 hours, they get to choose my priorities, so if they want me to address something immediately, I will. But *I'm* in charge of setting expectations, and enforcing my professional boundaries of a 40 hour work week. So the question goes back to them, they can trade one priority for another. They don't get to tell me \"Everything's gotta get done\", that's just a sign of poor management if they try. Luckily for management though, a lot of SWE's are scared to establish professional boundaries, so they just decide to quietly do everything and inflate their hours beyond 40, which is not sustainable.\n\nWhen unknowns pop up in tickets that I've estimated, I very clearly communicate those things as early as possible. \"X, Y,and Z came up while doing this ticket. We can either make a 2nd ticket to tackle next sprint and close this one out partially complete, or we can include that increased scope as a part of this ticket and it'll carry over\".\n\nIt's all about how you respond. Obviously having completely clean sprints would be great, but that's rarely how things go. When things come up, tickets carry over. It's pretty normal.",

This varied by team, but sometimes someone would act as a point person for the sprint from other teams. I don't recall if this was the same person every sprint, or if two different people played the roles.\n\nPerhaps your manager would be open to tracking the additional work that way. It might also be helpful to track how much time is being spent either not fixing things the right way or poor planning. Some of what you're describing sounds like requirements might be inaccurate, which adds to these issues popping up. \n\nThere could also be an increased culture of testing. There used to be a practice back in the day that whoever broke the build was the new buildmaster until the next person. Or, you can rotate the role. It may give people more appreciation of what they are committing (realistically, there are some people who will never care). But if you go with a per-sprint role, maybe that can be a pointed ticket/story to cover that work. \n\nSounds like your manager might not like those ideas because they just want to push features, but it's worth at least having the discussion. It's real work, and it may help the team find ways to be more efficient in the long-term. \n\nAnother huge advantage of these rotations is spreading knowledge across the team. What happens if you're on vacation, or you're not longer on the team? This helps protect against that. It will also hopefully expand peoples' skillsets. It will help everyone and the team as a whole.",

So that discrepancy - like, $400-$500K - *that* is really tough to offset.\n\nBut if you're just sacrificing $25K a year, $75K total? That probably is worth getting a PhD.\n\nNow, [as some have commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l3ueaa/comment/mw3rrha/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) if you get your PhD in something ultra-specific, you might actually be limiting your career growth and potential. *But you don't have to*.\n\nA lot of people do their PhD in a relatively broad area of CS, or an area of CS that has applications acrosss industries and areas, and in that world you don't get the same negative impact of specialization.\n\nSo to me, that is important - if you go to do a PhD with a focus on going back to a corporate/industry job instead of staying in academia, then make sure you shape your PhD (research, publications, etc.) to match that. Don't let the incentives of your academic-minded colleagues and advisors (i.e., publications) to take precedence over your priorities (i.e., developing proof of skills that are valuable in the workplace).",

They'll be looking at your academic background, research projects, letters of recommendation, statement of purpose, fit with the program, GRE (if required), and stuff like that. \n\nI took a look at your philosophy of mind writing. It's... not good. You'll need to stop using chatGPT to help you write stuff. Even if you think it's your own voice and ideas, having an LLM rewrite your stuff will invariably introduce semantic shift as well as ideas that aren't your own. Using an LLM to help you write like this at all will instantly torpedo any academic aspirations you have. You're going to need to learn how to express your thoughts on your own. \n\nChatting with LLMs can make you feel like you're learning a lot and that you're making deep insights, but that's the sycophantic nature of chatbots. But it's actually very shallow because it doesn't understand anything. It's just good at generating sentences and paragraphs that looks good on the surface. It might seem deep to someone who's deep in the Dunning-Kreuger well, but it's mostly just superficial repetition to an expert.  \n\nYou didn't engage any other thinkers at all, didn't connect anything you're saying to any published work, and there's just zero rigor. Be careful \"self-studying\" philosophy in this way. It's not preparing you for an academic program in philosophy. This is the equivalent of someone self-studying about CSS and learning how to change colors and themes on a webpage, and thinking that they've made some insightful leaps in the theory of computer science. \n\nSo just be careful with that. If you want to learn how to do philosophy, you need to deeply engage with a large catalogue of serious literature. LLMs, pop writing on Buddhism, and Sam Harris won't cut it past a 100 level undergrad philosophy class.",

I think being in an academic setting and engaging with real professors and classmates would allow me to step past the stage I’m at currently which I agree is not very good. I do believe in my capability of growing to write more academically as I have a strong argument against simulation theory that I have talked to both cs professors and philosophers professors about and got good feedback. I bought all the relevant existing literature(Dennet, Bolstram, Chalmers) so I can reference and engage with literature.

The fact that interviewers kept pushing about certifications despite your detailed technical explanations shows they're following a checklist rather than assessing your actual capabilities.\n\nGetting multiple certifications in a short timeframe isn't a red flag when you already have the underlying experience - it just shows you're adapting to market demands. The reality is that in today's job market, especially in Europe where compliance and formal qualifications carry more weight, having those pieces of paper can open doors that your experience alone might not. It's frustrating and somewhat backwards, but playing the game strategically by getting certified in technologies you already know well is a smart move that demonstrates both your existing skills and your commitment to formal validation.\n\nI'm actually part of the team behind [interview assistant](http://interviews.chat), and we built it specifically to help people navigate these kinds of tricky interview situations where you need to articulate the value of your experience alongside formal credentials.",

The best thing they have going for them is a supposed blameless culture, but this often manifests as a lack of ownership/responsibility for actions. \n\nIn the past I was at a company that grew from 50 to over 1,000 and they were basically the opposite. Fast, not much process, pragmatic staffing. We planned more flexibly, often week by week, and later monthly as we grew. Culture was very open and encouraged cross functional behavior and leadership. The only thing I didn’t like here (besides stress that built over years) was the subtle blame games that happened behind your back. \n\nSo like I said, complete opposites.
