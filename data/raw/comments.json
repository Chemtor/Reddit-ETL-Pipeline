You're correct that this stack is overengineered for *a simple case* of anomaly detection.\n\n>Could you have achieved the same outcome with far fewer dependencies/failure points?\n\nAbsolutely. A very simple, yet very error-prone, stack could be: direct DB writes + Postgres + pg\\_cron/cron + dashboard.\n\n>What could you scale to with a far simpler stack?\n\nThat simple stack can handle tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of events per minute. The real problem is not just the raw throughput, but the architectural fragility. This is tightly coupled and brittle, and has other issues apart from scalability:\n\n* Adding another consumer requires us to change the existing architecture/code\n* DB failure causes data loss and downstream reporting failures\n* Schedulers like pg\\_cron/cron lack automatic retries and timeouts\n\n>Would this stack you have built be required for the typical workloads you'd be working with in a real system?\n\nYes. These patterns are fundamental to high-volume data platforms. I've chosen each component to solve specific problems that emerge with high data volumes, complex workflow orchestration, and advanced processing requirements, though not all of them may be required in every case.\n\nThank you for your feedback.

Take every opportunity to learn. Take online courses and build things. I became a DE by taking a bunch of courses, presenting a business case that transitioning to DE software could save us money, and building it. Now I use it to solve every problem I can to build my skills. I even did the courses on the clock to meet my company's yearly training time goal.\n\nYou mentioned contractors, you may not have a senior employee, but those contractors know more than you. Hire them to do the things you don't know how to do, and then have them teach you. Include it in the SOW as \"knowledge transfer\" or \"support time\". This is literally how I learned a bunch of Azure products. Now the next time that task comes up, you know how to do it, and you don't have to hire the contractor.\n\nLastly, get a project manager. Make the case that you can't be in meetings AND be building stuff, and that having a PM will save you on contractor costs by letting you build more things yourself.\n\nLeverage your company for your personal growth, it's a win-win.",

It seems to me that Spark features in \"big\" (for a varying definition of \"big\") projects and platforms a lot. Polars seems to feature in smaller projects and platforms a lot. Postgres seems to feature in older, more RDBMS-driven architectures a lot too. But this isn't a stack, just \"some things I've seen\".\n\nI am not experienced enough to *really* say, but I can propose a \"hot-take\" theory of why this is. I am not myself very confident in this, again. But the argument goes like this:\n\nA standard stack in our industry will not be possible without a standard stack in web/backend. Fundamentally, data is a byproduct of a company's main business at first. A company may become \"data mature\" or \"data driven\" by converting this byproduct into a core loop of the business, in fact even its moat, but no one starts a company with \"data driven\". When you're starting a company, you can build software that will become your moat, but you can't \"build data\". In effect, I think by the time a company starts even thinking about data engineers, it is already stuck with some existing and effectively immutable architectural components, and our systems must use tooling that plays nice with those. So until these upstream components become standardized (e.g. the SQL/noSQL war in OLTP land finishes definitively, REST is fully replaced by gRPC, etc) - our systems won't.",

Staging is for validating new changes prior to prod deployment, and is only used when we have a pipeline change on the way. We compare partitions generated from prod and staging, get sign off, and deploy. If something is critically wrong we can rollback, and backfill is usually an option if really needed.\n\nIn general, it helps having a model where your most upstream tables are permissive with regards to fields (e.g. avoiding white listing or overly strict schema assertions) and involve minimal/no transformations. Then any downstream changes can always be deployed and rerun against these without data loss, only cost is compute. ",

It's just that most data projects don't need this scaling and would benefit more from the speed and strong guarantees of an OLTP, as understood by Duck Lake.",

It’s possible that the offshore resources will be entirely replaced with AI coding. It’s also possible that companies will demand generalized data professionals (kimball, analytical engineering, master data management, etc) and then those generalized people will just instruct AI to build solutions in the technology of the year. If this starts to become the trend, then you’ll no longer need to keep up with mastering what language or platform is the yearly favorite and focus more on implementing value - how to ensure AI assisted code generation is working successfully at your company. This would be a very interesting and disruptive time to be a data professional! (If it happens)\n\n\n——————————-\n\n\nOne of the things I’m keeping my eye on is whether companies start switching develops each time management attends a conference and decides to change their stack. To be clear - I’m not seeing it now - but here’s the scenario I’m looking out for. \n\n\n1) outsource DE to India. \n2) hire X dev’s with current stack\n3) management changes mind on stack\n4) replace current India team with new India team who know new stack\n5) repeat yearly, each time manager attends conference\n\nThis catches my attention because of 1) the current trend of tools changing quickly, 2) the enormous availability of cheap labor offshore. \n\nKeep in mind, if managers want to do this, they will have no issue finding offshore bodies to fill roles.\n\nSo - as an onshore senior/lead Im happy I’m deep into a business domain (subject matter expert) and would be needed for more then my coding skills. \n\nIf you are worried about this scenario you might start by asking how you can fit into this paradigm. If a company won’t hire you because you are not a 10 year expert on an acronym that was invented 2 months ago - then can you fit into a leadership/guidance position to enable “hot swappable” developers? I point back to the other comment in this thread - do you know Kimball? Do you know business processes, business data, and how to mature raw data into actionable insights which can reduce cost and increase revenue? If the answer is yes, you will likely be ok. If the answer is if no - I just know SSIS and I really can’t do anything unless my team lead holds my hand - then I would set some goals for career development.",

Textbooks make it look like data flows neatly in three layers, but in reality companies are mixing warehouses, lakes, lakehouses, streaming pipelines, and SaaS connectors all at once. No wonder it feels messy.\n\nWhat helped me was shifting from thinking in “tiers” to thinking in **functions**:\n\n* Ingest (how data arrives, batch vs stream)\n* Store (raw, curated, analytics-ready)\n* Transform (cleaning, joins, enrichment)\n* Serve (BI dashboards, ML models, APIs)\n\nOnce you see that every modern tool just fits into one of those buckets, the picture gets clearer. A lakehouse is just storage plus some transform and serve. A streaming platform is just ingest plus a bit of transform. The tools evolve, but the functional flow is the same.\n\nThat Exasol guide you shared is good for grounding, and pairing it with hands-on projects (like building a mini pipeline with Fivetran → Snowflake → dbt → Looker) really locks it in.",

You will learn a lot of the tools on the job if you dedicate the effort and time to it.\n\nSQL knowledge will get you by on a large portion of the job but for the specific things they're calling out like legacy ML code is likely going to be in Python or another language. You can definitely learn to code in those but reviewing, refactoring, and optimizing takes a lot of on the job experience to do well. \n\nI suggest really diving into understanding the broader concepts behind modern data engineering and working on some projects in Python at the very least.

If Flink was as bad as  in your case suggests no serious company would consider it.\n\nSince you use it for stream processing you very likely partition the input using keyBy(). Make sure that cardinality of the key value is finite as state is kept by key. E.g. if you keyBy eventID which is uuid, job state will grow indefinitely.\nAlternatively setup a timer to cleanup the state manually.\nIf you use FlinkQSL it's rather easy to miss such things as you need to think in terms of unbound streams rather than in terms of db tables.\n\nRegarding rewriting your stream processing job in Go (or any other language). Writing stream processing job is not that difficult. Writing stream processing job that is fault tolerant, can scale beyond single machine, supports SQL to write logic, makes checkpoints, holds state for longer than your Kafka retention period, guarantees exactly-once processing etc etc etc is more of a challenge. Think twice\n\nWhy do you think Flink exists if everyone could just write their stream jobs? But maybe your organization does not have the challanges Flink supposed to address. Then Flink could indeed be an overkill.",

I managed a team doing the platform work in this case, and we did build some great stuff: a linter that would block PRs if the SQL was messy, really useful costing analysis comparing actuals to planned budget, etc, etc.  But it was a brutal fight to attempt to prevent the entire solution from collapsing under the weight of tech debt.  It would have been far easier to have actual engineers build the data pipelines.\n   * In most of the data engineering teams I'm on we also build the platform anyway: all the reusable code, libraries, extra tooling for deploying models, quality-control checks on the data, etc, etc.",

As a result, this memtable currently does not work for RocksDB. To work for RocksDB, I need to make the active block also sorted, then I need a skiplist for that, and then the memtable design is actually a RocksDB in memory, which is worth a try, and I will try it later.",

It would also be great for him in case something goes wrong with a new update then he can roll a package back to the previous working version.\n\n\nOverall I get your point and it’s valid and I know I get sucked up in the python vs ssis argument because that’s what started everything and I’ve felt that my dba outright didn’t listen to some of my concerns because I wasn’t doing things his way.  But yes you are right, the process and practices are more important than the tool",

        "body": "Better observability and pipeline monitoring. Often pipelines fail and there isn’t any notifications on the ssis end to let me know.  Recently I was told that he does allow me to use an smtp server to notify myself of failures. This is true and I only have one counter to it right now and that he doesn’t use the emails for the the packages he has  built in the past that my team relies on so often I am stuck trouble with stakeholders emailing me because he doesn’t let me know that something went wrong on his end. This brings my next point.\n\nBetter data practices. You could say that I could do this with SSIS and I could if I had the opportunity to but it’s not my environment and the dba will not let me try anything different in his environment. I want to standardize things like ci/cd and proper data pipeline monitoring as well as documentation.  From my point of view it seems easier to do so with a tool that aligns better with my skill set and the skill set of my team if I cannot change anything in SSIS environment. I mentioned in another comment that the dba didn’t go for implementing ci/cd in his environment.\n\nShorter product delivery times. This isn’t really because of ssis vs python. I could make an arguement like that but I know that that is subjective.  This is more about man power and ease of deployment.  There are more coders in my agency than gui developers and the business units are required to build their own data pipelines (dba words because he said that he doesn’t have enough staff who know ssis to support the business units. He only got two new people in the last few months and they aren’t trained.) from my point of view leaning into a coding based orchestration tool or a coding solution in general will alllow the business units to really build their own data pipelines efficiently and then IT and the dba can just manage production which is what he seems to want anyway. I guess I’m saying this will play to changing skillset of employees and allow the organization to develop faster as a whole instead of business units feeling frustrated by a slow IT.\n\n\nTechnical debt.  This one is tricky because I can see both the IT setup as technical debt and mine. My team is technically acting like a shadow IT in some ways and that always resulting in technical debt. However the dba is on an outdated SSIS. By that I mean he still uses msdb and hasn’t upgraded to ssisdb which would at least allow for basic version control.  Additionally as I said, he doesn’t really have anyone who knows ssis well on his team and therefore if he leaves one day my organization is in a pickle.  He can say similar for what I want to do but I am documenting everything I’m doing so there is at least that. Also I am training and have already trained people on my entire environment in case I leave. I do know that this point is probably the most debate point that I am making however. Overall I’m saying that if we move to a more modern setup that fits better with the skillset of those in and outside of the agency (outside matters since they are required to build their own data pipeline) then I think we can eventually get off ssis completely and overall have a more manageable system that more people are familiar with.\n\nI typed this up very quickly so it may not be the most clear response.",

Assuming the magnitudes here are roughly typical. You could write script to identify peaks and valleys by magnitude and then flag the start/end as the valley in-between peaks or the peak and surroundimg X ms as the window, depending on how much dead space is between and what is more representative. I would do this based on magnitude of all 6 metrics, as x/y/z will peak at slightly different times.

Google also offers GCP and AWS has Redshift (not recommended).  One other you might want to look at is Motherduck, which is quite a bit cheaper than some of the others.   You could also go the postgres route as those are fairly cheap on a number of clouds, but aren't optimized for analytics workloads though they are usable for smaller scale warehouses.\n\nThe database is the core, but then you need to figure out how to ingest the data from your source platforms to the warehouse and transform the data into table structures that support your reporting needs.  Again, there are a multitude of patterns and tools available.  A lot of companies with basic installs are using Fivetran or Airbyte to ingest the data and dbt to transform it.  Personally I wouldn't pay for those, but it simplifies the setup where teams are small or inexperienced.  \n\nThe real hit though is going to be contracting someone to build it.  It's absolutely not something you want to figure out on your own as someone that just writes some SQL and python.  Mistakes can cause issues with usability, create rework and even higher costs depending on your stack.  And to add to the fun, there are a lot of bad consulting firms out there that don't know WTF they are doing, so taking the lowest bid isn't necessarily going to get you to where you want to be.\n\nGood luck!",

But when you want them, they're very useful indeed. \n\nTo begin with, without multi-table transactions, to try to emulate them, you end up implementing compensating transactions:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/compensating-transaction\n\nWhich are difficult to get right, are eventually consistent (meaning, in the interim the inconsistent state is visible, and no guarantee on how fast your comlensating transaction will succeed, and generally just are a pain. They don't add value or spark joy. \n\nThere are also other features that are a lot easier to add to an engine once you have full ACID support. \n\nFor example, zero copy cloning a table - the copies can be modified independently, without data duplication for the shared parts:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/tutorial-clone-table-portal\n\nOr having a transactionally consistent snapshot across tables, instead of trying to use Delta time travel to achieve it:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/warehouse-snapshot\n\nIsolation wise, we get true snapshot isolation within the engine - queries via the Warehouse either see changes in no tables or all. The individual logs aren't written perfectly simultaneously though, so Delta log consumers benefit from that less, but still some - can see some parts of a multi-table committed transactions sooner maybe, but is guaranteed it's part of a committed transaction, not potentially part of an emulated multi table transaction that failed and will have a compensating transaction trying to cover it up sometime later.\n\nPerformance, we can potentially batch up multiple transactions into a Delta log entry. We have a nice fast transaction log, instead of relatively slow block blob storage operations being required on every individual commit.\n\nLocking, iirc, mostly the same - could maybe support pessimistic locking though, which iirc Delta can't. But paper probably says for sure.",

But it's difficult to capture which parts of the Polaris engine we kept in a soundbite, and we've talked more about the result than the lineage I think. \n\nLet me start putting that to rights :) \n\nHere's the original Polaris paper for OP's benefit:\nhttps://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.14778/3415478.3415545\n\nWe kept the Polaris distributed query processing - it's a key part of Fabric Warehouse. But in Synapse SQL Serverless, it also had responsibility for the distributed aspects of query optimization (somewhat similar to the \"Chrysalis\" split query optimization Synapse SQL Dedicated had before that). \nThat's completely overhauled in Fabric Warehouse in favor of Unified Query Optimization:\nhttps://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626246.3653369\n\nWe also took Batchmode query execution as seen in Synapse SQL Dedicated, SQL Server, etc. But it's even faster. \n\nOn top of that we have several significant additional big improvements coming down the pipeline. I'm pretty sure several of them will get papers eventually, but don't know anything concrete on that front off the top of my head. At least one of the improvements heavily involves the Polaris engine ;)",

But, it's a massive investment, and 3 years in we're still working on adding components that our manager estimated we'd have done in the first 6 months.\n\nIf you don't need that, its good, but get documentation of your code, your sql tables, try and centralise into a single semantic model if you can (short of data warehousing).  But the one thing that we keep running into with people creating their own dashboards is that they change the queries, they're no longer performant, take forever, use more resources, and they're reloading and recalculating the same details x 10 different queries in a power bi dashboard x 10 dashboards.\n\nSo, consolidation - if you can at least run the data out to a table, and then have any dashboards read from that table, then you'll be saving yourself.\n\nTry to source control your dashboards.\n\nIf you're using PBI online, if you can use things like datasets, that centralise the data, go for it.\n\nStored Procedures may give you more centralised control, semantic models are more or less exactly what you're creating in PowerBI anyway (source -> dim/fact tables + relationships + measures).\n\nCreating a centralised semantic model/warehouse that has all of your tables and data in one place, that you write your code and measures and everything once will definitely allow you to reuse it multiple times and is a big win.",

I’m coming from a DBA/SSIS/sql-heavy background though, and those approaching from a more software engineering background will likely recommend different approaches based on their favorite tech stack and their CI/CD and version control preferences.\n\nI’m not a big fan of text-to-sql or promptql-style approaches mainly because I feel like that’s something that should be more for data exploration and presented to the end user rather than a way to streamline your reporting pipeline - all my opinion though, I just don’t like that added layer of abstraction from data when I’m thinking about robust data processes.",

Under the hood, NumPy typically uses C-level memory management (`malloc`/`free` or aligned variants) from the system runtime, though it also supports custom allocators.\n\nIn contrast, I expect stampdb to have lower overhead since it uses a straightforward C++ `std::vector` for memory management. By default, `std::vector` relies on the C++ allocator API, which eventually ends up at `malloc`/`free` as well. Our current plan is to provide only the thinnest wrapper around the C++ core.

The programming fundamentals you've built over 4 years transfer well to data engineering - you understand APIs, software architecture, and debugging which are core skills. Many data engineering tools have .NET support or similar paradigms to what you're used to. The main gaps you'll need to fill are around data pipeline orchestration (Airflow, Prefect), cloud platforms (AWS/Azure/GCP), and getting comfortable with SQL + maybe Python or Scala. Your API integration experience is actually really relevant since data engineers spend a lot of time building ETL pipelines that pull from various sources. Companies definitely value programming experience over pure data background - it's often easier to teach someone with solid dev skills about data concepts than to teach a data person how to write maintainable, scalable code. I'd suggest building a few portfolio projects that show end-to-end data pipelines and you should be competitive for junior/mid-level data engineering roles pretty quickly.",

They have a lot of short-term (6 months to 1 year) missions with TJMs between 500 and 750€ (in top tier companies).  \nI know for sure that they work with TotalEnergies and, despite the fact that they look, most of the times, for experience with geosismic data, during the interview this is often seen as secondary. What comes out is that the experience with moving data from one sink to another is much more important (and also a little bit of PM).  \n  \nIf I were you, I would also add Streaming to the portfolio and that will be it. Experience with near-real time analytics is quite rare and very in demand in big companies (mainly for IoT applications). Once you have done your first mission, you will be aware of the \"rouages\" and more capable of correcting the \"cap\".\n\nA+",

This was about 2-3 years ago, and I haven't kept up with their product to see if there's a good lightweight solution to this.\n\nIf not, I'd be inclined to at least consider a solution that involves a job that does a few things:\n\n   * copies spreadsheet to csv on s3/snowflake *landingpad*\n   * applies a jsonschema validation to the data.  In the event that there's any issues it would have a set of contacts to send a summary of the issues found to.  As you can imagine the more frequent this happens the better, ideally every 5 minutes or so, so that someone will get an alert as soon as they've entered bad data.\n   * then copies the validated data into an appropriate raw bucket/raw database area where it can then go through a typical data pipeline for transformation.\n\nThe above can be done in a variety of ways, but is fairly straight-forward.",

Can be on a staging layer, in PBI or as simple as a few lines of Python or PowerQuery into a unified file\n\nIf not, you'll need to do it manually. Basically you pull in all the data into a central file or table as above and you manually identify duplicates. Then you give them an \"master\" ID. The next day you do the same and manually process the new records, etc. Can be done in excel with Vlookup + copy paste, using simple code into CSV output, in PowerQuery, ...\n\nNow if you want to share this data between applications, you should seriously consider changing the way this data is stored in the first place. You don't really need an MDM but reather some serious business process reviews: who is responsible for making a new \"contact\" or \"invoice\" ? Which tool generates those? How are they shared to other departments?",

Our data stewards use excel to maintain various reference tables and it’s a pretty nice and easy to use interface for them. Ultimately, they are just editing SQL tables which ETL can ingest and move into the data warehouse for use in business logic. The system is nice for a DBA / DE to administer, and has a snap in for excel, permissions are in Active Directory. There’s a few gotchas but overall a great solution if you want to mature from spreadsheets to database tables but need to ensure non-developers can maintain them easily - and you need to stay cheap/off the shelf.",

I can’t even tell you how many times I have been consulting, and I saw folks trying to do what you are.  The only real way is to run the data into a real analytics engine like Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.  Then materialize the result back to a different index.

Document it all clearly (but also as succinctly as possible). Have a good \"Executive Summary\" at the top and assume most important people won't read past the first 2 paragraphs. Try to have a nice diagram up there if it can simply make sense (maybe 4 users pointing to a pile of 25 tables etc).\n\n2. Take it to your stakeholders and tell your story. Make them aware of what they/you own the care and feeding of. Don't just phrase it as bad! It's likely this complexity actually an impressive job of non devs building a surprisingly effective and complicated system to help empower them to do their jobs.\n\n3. Come to a \"What do we do?\" conclusion with stakeholders. That's a two part \"Who?\" and \"What?\". `Who` could be you, outside consultants, a new hire, or the users themselves. `What` might range from \"Accept the corruption risk and keep rolling\" to bring in a completely new tool and move the users to it. \n\n4. Execute, or not =)\n\nOne extra warning, the current Access DB probably gives those users a tremendous amount of flexibility to do their job. Most robust solutions (like moving to a MySQL DB) will NOT, and they're likely to hate it. They might hate it b/c they're whiny babies, or they might hate it b/c it's legitimately hamstringing their ability to adapt and do good work (which hurts the business and makes their job suck). This is another big part of why I hate these migrations, it's almost impossible to satisfy everyone, b/c OTOH the current Access system is often inherently unsafe by most IT standards. \n\nIn terms of tech, from a quick google two possibilities to consider are Airtable or just Google Sheets, but that's just me googling for 5 mins.

You can sit PuppyGraph on top of your existing relational databases (even MongoDB too), and query your existing data as a graph (using Gremlin or Cypher), without ETL into a separate graphdb. So same copy of data, you can query it in both SQL and graph. Our main product is the graph compute engine, but we did also created a visualization layer requested by our users. We open sourced it.

For what you're talking about, the app side of it is pretty straightforward (conceptually). It just needs to be able to check for flood alerts and deliver those alerts to users based on their location data.\n\nThe very hard and expensive part is all the infrastructure you need to track and collect that data. You refer to that as the \"other half\" of the problem but it's probably more like 99% of the problem. Ideally the Malysian weather service would provide flood alert warnings, like the [NWS does](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) (used to do?) in the US. I can't read the website for the [Malaysian weather service](https://www.met.gov.my/), but you should start there to see what information they currently track and provide to the public. It could be that they have an API similar to the NWS that provides alerts.\n\nAll that being said, I was a little curious why an app like you describe doesn't exist yet. And it does look like there are already [apps and warning systems in place](https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2024/10/07/dont-panic-all-the-steps-apps-numbers-you-need-for-malaysias-flood-season/152650). Are you sure that this an issue that needs a new app to solve it? Maybe it's just an issue of people not being aware of their options. You might be able to accomplish more by helping people download and learn to use existing apps and resources.\n\nETA: removed overuses of \"already\"",

There are more public data under various subdomains under [water.gov.my](http://water.gov.my), but it's not really surfaced out to public.\n\nYou can get some MetMalaysia forecast data freely through https://api.met.gov.my/.\n\nYou can use this data, especially the water level, show alerts in you app (or notification) when it passed the warning level.\n\nAs for your technical question, you actually will need more of backend + frontend. Backend means a server getting all these data from the various public sources and processing them. Frontend means your mobile app + website. Your website and mobile app will show the data from your backend.\n\nI'm saying backend, because you may need aggregate the data first, then process them into the form your frontend can use. \n\nYou may skip the backend, and do everything in your mobile app, but there's no guarantee that the format and access of the data would not change. Not to mention, you mobile code will be so bloated.\n\nAs for your question of native or cross-platform. If you need advanced platform specific functions, you will need native. If you don't, cross platform is fine. Do note that simple device function such as camera, GPS, storage are considered basic, and easily supported in most cross-platform framework. Anyway, example of cross-platform framework are Flutter, KMP, and React-Native. Of which, I'm familiar with Flutter, and would recommend Flutter.\n\nSo, you want to make publish an iOS app? This is a hard requirement from Apple, you will need a MacOS hardware to produce the installer file. You can either rent a MacOS during the app compilation or get one yourself. You would also need 99 USD per year. \n\nFor flood detection, you need to monitor water level and rainfall predominantly. If you want flood detection in wast coast, you will need to monitor wind field as well. \n\nThis is possible. How long it would take, depends on your complexity. Simple app that get data from JPS and MetMalaysia API and show them in your app, probably 3 months. Not including getting the developer account, the Google/Apple process. You want flood detection, you will need a backend to process all this data, and for machine-learning forecast on your own. It will take probably a year?\n\nHere's are some other nation example. [https://signature.bmkg.go.id/](https://signature.bmkg.go.id/) (seems to be offline right now). https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/flood.\n\nI do know several private companies that is working with government on a current project that address most of your concerns, as well as to match the service provided by the example above. To extremely summarise it, it monitors rainfall, produce instantaneous flood map (through ML and pre-forecasted based on rainfall condition), and more importantly the impacts. So you can see which road/bridge will be flooded, and how deep the flood it is. At a 1 km x 1 km resolution. Most of these information should be public domain once the system has been deployed, with certain information available only to government departments.\n\nAnyway. You will need basic Computer Science for coding the frontend and backend. You will need some Meteorology (of which no universities in Malaysia specifically teach it), to understand basic weather and climate knowledge. If you want to delve into forecast, you will need to understand Dynamic Meteorology. You will need System Administration if you want to deploy your backend yourself, instead of going through paid services. You will also need learn several programming language, depending on your choice of frontend and backend.\n\nIf you want authoritative knowledge of Malaysia weather and climate, you can read https://www.umpress.com.my/index.php?route=product/product&product\\_id=1059.\n\nAnyway, there's one thing you need to understand why Malaysia forecast is not that great compared to other country:\n\n1. This is a country in tropical belt. The hardest type of region in the world to get accurate forecast. Compared to USA, UK or Japan forecast, those are easily done. Even UK forecast experts says Malaysia forecast is much more challenging officially (after some Malaysia minister question MetMalaysia experts and tries getting input from oversea experts).\n2. Believe it or not, our climate and weather can be affected by winds all the way in Siberia Russia, MJO in Indian Ocean, ENSO in Pacific ocean. So many things needs can affect Malaysia weather. In comparison, UK and US mainly only needs to monitor polar region, and jet stream.\n3. Under ocean phenomenon like Thermohaline Circulation should have some effect on Malaysia weather, but I have not look into that specifically.\n4. Most weather modelling software were developed by upper latitude northern hemisphere countries, which means they don;t really focus on the physics of tropical region like Malaysia.",

One option is to use a wildlife camera that simply runs off of a battery you can change every couple of months. You can time it to take pictures every x minutes, and send them through a mobile data network or something to the server. Once there, simple computer vision solutions can be run (and I don’t mean deep learning, just normal image manipulation and OpenCV or the like) to detect where the water is on the image. If it crosses the place or percentage of the image, you can issue a warning theough the app. The key here is placing the camera somewhere it sees the water and the bank at the same time and is not blocked by vegetation, maybe on some pole or the wall of a house. Also important to cover the lens from rain so that the pics are not just wet blobs. If you want, you can also place some reference point on the bank and measure its visible portion’s length on every image.\n\nIf you’d like to chat about the data collection and processing aspect of things, drop me a DM.",

I always recommend starting away from the computer, and simply **sketch out what you are going to do**. It can be diagrams, it can be pseudocode, or it can simply be a bullet-list of what the program should do, like this made-up example inspired by your problem:\n\n* start the game\n   * reset score, health and positions\n* game loop:\n   * if spawn-timer = 0, spawn enemy, restart timer\n   * move enemies\n   * move player\n   * check collisions\n      * if player hits enemy: inc points\n   * if player-health < 0, exit loop\n* game over\n   * display score\n   * display: try again button -> restartGame -> arrow up to start the game\n\nsomething like that - that you gradually build up while adding features.\n\nThen when you want to add a new feature, you experiment a bit with where it should be, put it where it initially makes sense, and then \"run\" through the steps of the program on paper where you talk aloud: *\"Then the game restarts, and that triggers the rewarded ad, but then everything is reset and the game loop starts ... hmm ...\"* and you try to put it somewhere else.\n\nThis doesn't take hours of planning or analysis, but simply a few minutes of \"playing the game in your mind\" and checking if it makes sense - and it helps a lot to have a simple script like this on paper, and someone to talk to - they don't have to answer, it can be a child, a pet or a **rubberduck**, just talk aloud! You'll be surprised what you hear yourself say, and hopefully quickly realize how wrong you were!\n\nAs you do this more and more, you'll sometime be able to do the entire thing in your mind, without writing or talking, but I've found that it is important to start being as external as possible.",

Understanding C++ is an imaginary concept that big C++ uses to sell C++ developers.\n\nAlso, discrete math is probably the most important math subject to understand for a general developer, understand as much as you can and it will help you down the road.",

        "body": "I will go in the exact opposite direction if some comments here: This is a tough question to answer, because it doesn't really matter. I mean, languages are cool and all, but learning a new programming language really is not that hard, once you already know how to program. You can learn any language similar to the ones you already know in a week. \n\nThe more important question is: What kind of project structure, architecture and patterns do you learn. If you are going for \"applications and tools\", that can also mean many things. GUI or no, Desktop or mobile, which target audience does it have, what should it do? \n\nIf you want to be the most versatile, able to learn \"anything(TM)\" that might come up in a few weeks time, I would suggest having experience in at least one project / language out of all of the following categories (and each project must have a minimum complexity to \"count\"): \n\n  \n\\- 1 web based frontend. Can be pure html/css/minimal JS, or be fully based on a JS framework. maybe a homepage for a simple business, without a shop, like a bakery or a hair salon. \n\n\\- 1 non-web based frontend. A C# GUI in windows, a Java App on Android, a Swift UI on iOS or a QT-App in any language you want, it doesn't matter much. Probably a complexity between a calculator and a calendar would be good. Games work, but are normally structured differently, do I would advise against using a game engine unless you want to stick with gaming. \n\n\\- 1 complex application, written in a low level language, optimized for speed. A raytracer is the classical option, because it has good visual feedback, but a compiler, OS parts or a real time embedded component can all work. Suitable languages are C, C++ and rust. A compiler has the additional benefit of teaching you more about programming languages in general.\n\n\\- 1-2 APIs. It is great if you have both written a REST (or similar) API, accessible through the web (in theory, you don't need to deploy) as well as a library, that exposes a C-standard API for use from other programs. They are pretty similar in conception, but quite a bit different in practice, and understanding how both of these actually work, can be hugely helpful, even if you are only using them, and never have to build them again! \n\nYou should 100% have experience in one Object Oriented language. The best options are Java and C#. OOP (or some half hearted attempt at OOP) is still the standard in most industries. \n\nAdditionally, you should be comfortable in a language, suitable for scripting. Python and JavaScript, but also Bash are all options with different advantages. You need to know at least one. \n\nI think everyone can learn something from trying something completely different, so you should have done one project in a completely functional language. Haskell is my favourite, but F# and Clojure are also options. You will have to re-learn to think about programming, which is exactly the point of the exercise, not to use this exact language again in production. (Which you absolutely can, just mot people prefer not to)",

This is extremely old hardware, but everything it teaches is relevant today. This is the literal genesis of modern computer graphics, built by the father of the graphics chip itself, Jay Miner. He's the dude behind the atari 2600, basically our entire concept of computer graphics comes from him and this was his baby. You want to learn how to do graphics programming, start here. And yes, I'm being 100% serious, and yes, this is binary bits and bytes stuff. That is \\*still\\* important.

CS education isn't technical school -- it taught you how to figure out how to develop solutions, how to learn new skills as a project demands, it almost certainly did NOT teach every single skill you'd ever use on the job. You will learn as you go, that is just the nature of the field. The knowledge snowballs, yes, but getting a new project, having no idea how to complete it, and having the skill to research and teach yourself is THE most important skill you can take away from formal CS education.\n\nAI is a research accerator and a peer programmer in your pocket. My employer recently started expecting us to start using AI like we've been using IDEs -- a core tool to speed and supercharge our development. So start/continue using AI as your coding partner and a research aid. Don't vibe code - hell no - but anything you'd search the internet to know, ask AI first, then dig a little deeper, fact check it - its the faster version of digging through stack overflow and stack exchange and reddit to cross reference the collective knowledge, right? And have AI write code, do a peer review, build on what it writes, feed it back in - go back and forth with it, like you would peer programming. Use it to bounce ideas around and fill the gaps in your knowledge. If you rock up to an interview with the skill of knowing how to utilize AI effectively in your development, then you WILL be the most attractive candidate, because, honestly, a lot of experienced devs are behind the curve figuring it out and we're feeling the heat from our employers with all their crazy high hopes for AI.\n\nIf you like web dev, there are still plenty of jobs out there, even if the job landscape has thinned out and changed in the last 5-10 years. But also be open to try anything - I NEVER thought I'd end up a web dev, I didn't do well in those courses in school so I thought it was the LAST thing I'd ever do, but I'm SO GLAD I gave it a chance and I ended up liking it so much more than I'd ever thought I would.\n\nAlso, I got lucky: I was a year and a half out of school and struggling to get an interview for junior roles and was kicking myself for not trying to get an internship the minute I graduated. Some internships will accept you shortly after graduation, but most won't accept you more than a year out. But when I reached out to a connection about a junior role at their company, their company countered by offering me an internship which turned into a full-time offer and I've been there nearly 3 years now. \n\nSo 1) If you want workplace experience after graduation, definitely don't give up on internships (plural, even if you finish one, don't assume its gotta be one and done); post-grad internships are out there and experience is experience and employers love demanding 2-3y of experience from new grads and junior devs for some crazy reason. 2) Build your connections, reach out to your connections, never stop making them even after you land a job; they don't stress that enough in school, hell it probably should be it's own course its that important.",

Both fields are filled with remote positions and have entry level or no experience needed, so won’t matter you coming from food industry. If you considering IT as a path then you more than likely have the basic tech common sense (which to us is common sense but majority of ppl lack willingness to even try troubleshooting). \n\nAnd best advice I got that made the biggest impact, find a recruiter. Legit it makes a difference.  You’ll tell them what you want and will take and they’ll come back with job after job. They get a percentage of any position they land you (typically you’ll be a contractor and can then decide to apply directly after getting foot in the door but a lot of ppl prefer the freedom of not being tied to a company). They are highly motivated to find you something. \n\nI highly recommend doing remote or hybrid. The savings in travel, in food and the additional time you get can go towards literally ANYTHING else in life that we already get too little of. Friends, starting a business, gym. \n\nIt’s crazy what we have become accustomed to, 8 hour workdays minimum, 1-2 hours travel depending on where you live, traffic. Not including the OT we all love for the pay. \n\nKeep on keepin on, you got this",

BUT you aren't gonna be applying now and no one can tell the future, most self taught devs that aren't a part of a local group type thing/serious accountability group take about 2-3 years to get to a \"job ready\" knowledge base from my experience over the past 5ish years running my local group.\n\nWith college being out of the question for you this is gonna be a long journey so I would ask myself \"why do I wanna get in this\".  The ppl that come into my group and do it for the money/remote/travel the world traditionally don't make it and really the remote stuff is shrinking up A LOT.  But if you have legit reasons and even if they are the aforementioned ones Odin Project is still a great start to see if you really really wanna push through\n\nThis is what we do at my group.  Watch a 1-4 hr html/css course, then watch a 2-6 js for beginners course on yt.  Then just start building things (this works for us cuz we meet every week so they have us and the other ppl in the group who are super driven)\n\nNOW this does get a little harder if it's just you or you don't have a group like that but the key take away is you need to start actually building things as soon as possible, because you ARE going to suck and that's fine we all did, but that's when you learn.\n\nI have seen ppl with comp sci college degrees that can't build anything cuz they haven't yet.

So here would be the steps:\n\n- Tell the AI of your choice to write some small application. You want it small to ensure you can fight it all by yourself, but make sure the AI doesn’t actually just knock it out of the park in one shot; if so, try again until you get something sufficiently buggy.\n\n- Debug the code. You might think that this needs to be fancy, but I cannot stress enough how basic this is. It can literally be just notes to yourself with a date explaining your thoughts. I wager it could say things like: “So, the AI said it wrote X using Y method. Whaaaaaat is happening - I better check the documentation for Y. That is *not* how it looks, the documentation from Y imports completely different methods….” Etc\n\n- Document the whole process, by which I mean the prompt used, the AIs response, the code it gave, and your debugging notes.",

Interest rates are still high, tech companies are still downsizing their staff and those laid off are applying for entry-level jobs that are supposed to go to new graduates (despite the former supposidly having \"experience\") and all this further saturated the entry-level when there are fewer job openings due to a crappy economy right now, it's just a mess!\n\nIf you really want to learn programming and build software (like genuine interest, not purely for monetary sake with hopes of getting a job anytime soon), but you can't go to college for whatever reason, then of course go for it (tons of free resources, including Odin), but you'll also want to learn CS fundamentals if you really want to become a software developer and still maintain relevant skills and knowledge, and not just some codemonkey that just does \"whatever's hot\" at the moment (which, let's be honest, will be irrelevant rather quickly).

Every line you write or fix or debug is a little closer to competency.\n\nEDIT: Specifically for your concern about knowing syntax, you won't remember how to perfectly write the syntax for everything you learn. That's just not realistic. Syntax for things that you use frequently will stick with you and syntax for things you use infrequently will not.

Had you done that, you would have found countless posts telling you to start with small and simple projects and grow in all directions. A ToDo List app may be too ambitious for your skill level - not programming wise, but design wise.\n\nYou need to learn the design and planning processes that go from idea via specification, detailing, breaking down, solving individual parts to final implementation in a programming language.\n\nYou most likely directly started at the computer and naturally were dumbfounded and got stuck. You tried to write a novel without even having a detailed plan of what you want to write - common \"writer's block\".\n\nSit down with pencil and paper and flesh out your ideas before programming. Write down what your program should do, what parts it should consist of, what features it should have. Then, think about each individual feature. Determine what you need for that particular feature, make a detailed plan/roadmap.\n\nThis specifying, breaking down, analyzing, solving process is the really important part of programming, not the implementation in code, that's the actually easy part (and the part that to a certain degree can already be covered by AI).\n\nAs with every similar post, some book recommendations: \n\n+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul\n+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas\n+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman\n+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles Petzold\n\nAll these books focus more on the process that leads to the implementation in code than on the code itself - hence, the used languages are fairly unimportant.\n\nAlso, consult the **Frequently Asked Questions** in the *sidebar* here for a cornucopia of project ideas on many different levels.",

Do you make it completely in python or are you making it with a database ? Do you want it to run in the terminal or be a proper app with an UI ?\n\nI find making the things and looking up what I need when I'm faced with a problem has helped me much more than aimless tutorial watching, I have also found remaking my old projects with new knowledge to be really entertaining and good for motivation and a to do list might be perfect for that. You can challenge yourself to do it at different levels to learn everything that comes with it, something like :\n\n- level 1 : using python lists and methods like append and remove, use print and input to make the whole thing work in the terminal (can do a simple menu like 'if input()==\"1\" : list.append(input(\"What do you want to add?\")) elif input()==\"2\"...')\n\n- level 2 : using OOP to create each task as an object, you can set up your classes to have some more info like a date, the person the task is for or notes, make your methods yourself \n\n- level 3 : using a database to store the tasks, you can use sqlite3 for a local one that's going to be in a file or if you're up to it you can make a proper server to run your SQL in.\n\nFor bonus points you can make it into an app with an UI, I quite like QT at a beginner friendly level, it comes with PySide6 and has an app called \"designer\" you can use to create the UI graphically rather than writing it completely in code.\n\nThe more you do, the more you learn. Try finding interesting ways to practice with the things you learn and finding things you can partially do but need just a bit more learning to do and work towards that. Good luck learning",

Like both C and C++, Rust enjoys full native code performance since it doesn't require a runtime and focuses strongly on zero-cost abstractions whenever theoretically proven possible and safe, and is also a true systems programming language, meaning you can write bare-metal code that talks directly to hardware like embedded applications, firmwares, virtual machine hypervisors, and operating system kernels entirely with it, and I'm talking from personal experience here, not just parroting someone else's opinion.\n\n Rust is still a bit niche since it's a relatively new language with 1.0 only having been reached 10 years ago, and the learning curve is quite steep if the goal is wrapping your head around its revolutionary memory safety paradigm, but its popularity cannot be contested, as it has consistently ranked first in the StackOverflow developer language preference surveys ever since reaching its 1.0 milestone. It's also the only other language allowed and actually being pushed as a viable alternative to C in the Linux kernel, and pretty much all big tech from Microsoft to NVIDIA is pushing it, with the only exception being Apple which have their own safe native language strongly influenced by the original Rust author's language design, whom Apple themselves consulted with while designing Swift. Even features available in Rust that were originally not implemented in Swift are now being brought to the latter because Apple's alternative design decisions focusing on developer accessibility ended up proving somewhat problematic. Finally and unlike the C family, Rust actually has pretty good tooling as well as a package manager called Cargo.",

As in developing the skills of a programmer while still remaining in the same profession or tangential profession. *Learning basic to advanced programming skills is still worthwhile even if you cannot get into a software development career.*\n\nThe reason why I'm harping on this is that OPs like this are encouraged to leave their entire career and career's worth of experience, and go to 0 and then train all the way back up. \n\n> I live in Milan.

Regardless of using programming to help with art (e.g. building a research tool, building pricing calculators, building appraisals, using APIs etc. in your direct line of work), you got the entire field of computer graphics where your previous art experience can be relevant, alongside [computer art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_art), or even go into web development and use your art skills to help in designing the website.\n\nThis also helps build your motivation because you are focused on programming as a skill, and not setting yourself up with a lofty goal of \"MUST be good enough for career otherwise doomed\", AND lets you leverage your previous career experiences AND help in the immediate term AND gives you ample fuel to find projects to *directly help you now* AND you can leverage all of these skills in finding clients you can work with or friends that you can help. \n\nPeople love discounting their previous experiences. Someone that has worked point of sales systems as a cashier for a few years is going to know far more about point of sales systems, and leverage said experience into coding it. And employers recognize this too.",

Installation guides, both for beginners and for \"Python veterans\". They are short enough, so I can skim them both quickly. \n\n2. both tutorials. I will probably follow along with the \"Quick Start\", because it's short and will let me see some concepts hands on to start with, and I will skim the longer tutorial, as I personally already know how SQL works, and how an ORM works. If I were new to either of those concepts, I would work through it completely. \n\n3. I skip the migration notes, because... duh. \n\n4. Now we come to the complexity: In the section \"Reference and How to\" I would stop reading \"everything\", instead I would skim the chapter titles and try to remember, which information is available. Later, when I go ahead and actually map my first classes, I will open \"Mapping Python Classes\" and \"Relationship Configuration\", and then, when I go to test it, I would probably read more configuration stuff, so that I can be sure I didn't miss any important config options. \n\n5. I will skim the relevant Dialect Documentation, PostgresQL in my case. The most important things to note will probably be highlighted, and if I skimeed it, I will be able to go back later when there's an issue and be able to know, where to find the relevant information. \n\nEverything else I would just search in the docs, as it comes up. Such as error messages, or how to do a specific kind of relationship. \n\nJust reading and skimming what I outlined above will probably take 1-2 hours. Reading the entire documentation would take days, and I would forget nearly everything. The important part is not to know what to do outright, but where to find the information you need! You also need to understand the core concepts, of what a library is trying to do, and how it's doing it! All the small details, while important in the moment, will just take up space in your head and not really get you anywhere on their own.",

        "body": "First, you need to determine the width. The key to this is to look at the center line\n\n    4321234\n\nEach number is listed twice except 1, so you can use the formula `2n - 1` to indicate the width. In this case, `n` refers to the largest number (or the initial number picked).\n\nThe pattern is basically in two parts. There's the stuff reaching the middle line\n\n    4444444\n    4333334\n    4322234\n    4321234\n\nThen, there's the rest of it.\n\n    4322234\n    4333334\n    4444444\n\n### What's the pattern?\n\nYou'll notice the numbers are basically seven 4's on the first line, five 3's on the next line, three 2's, and finally one 1 at the end. So the pattern is: 7, 5, 3, 1.\n\nThe idea is you print the numbers doing down, like \n\n   43\n\nThen when you reach 2, you print 2 three times, \n\n   43222\n\nThen, you do 3 4 at the end (going back up).\n\n   4322234\n\n\n### Coding logic\n\nSo, let's see how we can do that one line. Let's put it in a function\n\n    void printLine(int size, int patternLength, int currNumber)\n\n        // Step 1. Count down\n        for (int i = size; i > currNumber; i--) {\n           printf(\"%d\", i);\n        }  \n \n        // Step 2. Print repeated numbers\n        for (int i = 0; i < patternLength; i++) {\n           printf(\"%d\", currNumber);\n        }\n        // Step 3. Count up (you do this)\n\n        // Final newline\n        printf(\"\\n\");\n    }\n\nSo, then you have the main function\n\n    int main() {\n        // Assume the user enters in a size and it's stored in size\n       int size = readSizeFromUser();\n       int patternLength = 2 * size - 1;\n       int currNumber = size;\n       // Print the pattern up to the midpoint\n       for (int i = size; i >= 1; i--) {\n           printLine(size, patternLength, currNumber);\n           patternLength -= 2; // Next number is printed this many times\n           currNumber--; // The next number is decreased from the current\n       }\n       // Another loop to go from 2 to size to do 2nd half\n    }\n\nI've left a lot of code out for you to think about, but hopefully, you get the idea.",

Usually this will result in the easiest-to-test and most-likely-to-be-correct solution.\n\nIf you can't figure out the general rule, take a piece of the problem which is solvable and then work backwards from there. For example, for n = 3, the middle line is this:\n\n    32123\n\nFirst write a loop that outputs just this line, for any n. That's part of the problem. Then work backwards to make it work similarly for the other lines (so that the line before middle is 32223, and so on). Doing it this way is fine too, but there are more opportunities to mess things up or to get edge cases wrong.\n\nFor the given problem this is not really a problem, though, since \"exhaustive testing\" is pretty straightforward. You can run your entire solution on all values of n = 1 through n = 9 inclusive and make sure that the output is according to the specification. For most real problems, exhaustive testing is impossible or impractical.",

Can you entirely avoid branching aside from the necessary loops by writing a value every time? How can you generalize your condition to give you a number to write instead of a boolean? This will prevent a large void in the middle.\n\nSomething that might make it more efficient: how can you restructure the loops such that the number to be written at each position can be directly inferred from only the iterator values at that position, so aside from the code configuring the loops, nothing else needs to be aware of how large the square is? If you try to make n only exist in the loop headers, I think you will find a more elegant solution without a big mess of addition and subtraction of i, j, n, and 1 going on inside every iteration.

We can convert ranges by subtracting n from all members. From there, it's just whichever coordinate that's farther from the center what takes precedence. \n\nFrom that, we can derive a function like this: \n\n    printBullseye(int n){\n        for(int i = 0; i < 2*n-1; i++){\n            for(int j = 0; j < 2*n-1; j++){\n                int iDif = abs(n-1-i);\n                int jDif = abs(n-1-j);\n                int distance = iDif > jDif ? iDif : jDif;\n                printf(\"%d\", distance+1);\n            }\n            printf(\"\\n\");\n        }\n    }\n\nEDIT: I realized while driving to work that I should've converted the range by changing the for-loop start positions instead of cluttering the function with more math.

Nowadays this topic is often called \"serialization\" i.e. turning some abstract data representation into a serial stream of data, and back again.\n\nJust as one example, look at how the [\"Protocol Buffers\"](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/encoding/) binary encoding format works. It defines a general-purpose way to describe \"messages\" in terms of their fields, and each field's type determines how it is encoded, in such a way that you can always tell where one field ends and another begins.\n\nIt uses the same \"length prefix\" approach that you'll see in a lot of other formats, but it also uses a variable-length encoding trick for integers, which means that small integers take up less space than large ones. This applies to the data itself, but also to the type/length metadata.\n\nReusing an off-the-shelf encoding format like Protobuf will save you a lot of tedious manual work.\n\nOr if your goal is just to obscure the data from casual viewing with a text editor, you can just do something even simpler and compress your JSON representation using something like gzip. Maybe add an extra custom header so various tools don't automatically recognize it as compressed data.",

There is nothing special about a txt file that makes it different. In fact *all files* are merely a sequence of bytes. Opening a file with a particular header marking it as txt tells whatever is opening it “hey, this data is in such and such format like UTF-8. Read bytes of this length and display this data as characters.  A dat or bin file just *doesnt* say “hey, read me as text”, but is still just an array of binary. You actually usually can simply open these in text editors to view broken gibberish if you’d like.\n\nAnyhow; if you’d like to store data in txt, there are countless tutorials; it’s often taught as an intro method when first learning file handling anyhow. Decide on a schema, the easiest probably being each piece of data on its own line, since reading txt files line by line is simple.",

As you are trying to create your own format you'll have to make something up yourself. There are catalogues of already taken magic numbers online.\n\nThen goes header. On offsets from the beginning of the file specified by the format specification there are several numbers telling information about the file: time of creation, modification, size, etc. For example, if you specified that bytes from 16th to 24th will mean time of last modification, you take amount of milliseconds since UNIX timestamp (start of 1970), transform it into a 64-bit integer and write into these bytes.\n\nOne way to add arbitrary data to your file is to add the list of offsets. Say on predefined position of 32th to 40th byte you write the offset to the first bit of an array of entries in your binary file. Computer follows this offset, where you write, in sequence, offset to next array if it exists (or 0 if it doesn't), amount of offsets to various elements in this array, and then list offsets, each is a 64-bit number. Now the reader can read and save them. By following these offsets, it may find your data. Data entry may look like an integer specifying length of a string or array and then bytes of this data.",

You feel that way because you know you could probably be doing the same thing if you wanted to. You're supposed to be a little stretched thin in college, its kind of the point. The way you grow a bunch will be working really hard and at the edges of your limits. You can have that discipline as well, it just means that starting today you put in at least a little bit extra work.\n\nEven if its just 30 mins a day extra at first, you will find that if you just show up, you'll probably do more in the end. As soon as you start telling yourself, \"Oh, I'll just do that tomorrow...\" You have already given up on yourself. Don't wait for tomorrow to do things you want to do.\n\nOnly you can really know your limits. Whether you think you are actually maxing out or not, is something you have to decide yourself.",

I have dinner with the family and then will spend an hour or so playing video games with the kids but they know when Dad is in the office it better be an emergency. They get it and respect it. The same needs to go with your parents and siblings. Obviously you are living under their roof so you need to follow your parents rules. It's not too much to ask for you to help out around the house. But I would have a heart to heart and tell them that the only way your going to succeed is with their support and that support comes at a cost when it comes to family activities.",

You don't need to build something that solves a real world problem. But just build something! Make Snake, or Pong. Or make a small API that allows you to perform CRUD operations for jokes or fun facts. \n\nEach small project you work on expands your knowledge. And then the next project becomes a tiny bit easier. \n\nBut IMO, the most important thing you can do, is try and understand every line of code you write. Don't just copy and paste a solution and move onto the next problem. Don't try and remember how something works. Rather, learn why it works the way it does. Understand the functions, the syntax, common patterns that are used and why. Don't move onto the next problem until you fully understand the one you are working on.",

You can know what a hammer and a screwdriver and a saw do, you understand what they do, but until you use them in practice you don’t realise how they actually come together to create furniture.\n\nI recommend you look up competitive programming sites (that’s the best name I have for them, though in my experience they aren’t actually competitive like a game or a competition). Particularly [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). It’s how I myself started coding, with python same as you. It has a bunch of problems arranged by difficulty going from 8-kyu (easiest) to 1-kyu(hardest) iirc. You can start doing some of the 8 kyu ones and progress as you see fit. You have as long as you want to solve them, and once you do you can see other’s solutions.\n\nDO NOT USE AI, or be very careful in its use. Always always always understand the code you’re using. And especially for these types of projects, I’d say don’t use ANY code generated by ai, it kinda defeats the purpose. You can use it as a googling aid “how do I get the length of an array, but not as an actual coding assistant “give me a loop that finds the highest value”.\n\nAlso, when you see code by others, don’t think you learned whatever you saw because you understood it. That don’t mean shit if you can’t recall it when you need to. Seeing the solution to the problem is obvious, and easy to understand. But if the next time you find that problem you can’t remember or recreate the solution, you’re still fucked. Until you can generate the code/algorithm yourself from scratch, you don’t know it.\n\nGood luck out there.",

BUT, if your goal is to just learn *any* type of assembly, then I think the funnest way to learn assembly is by making a game boy game 🤓\n\nHere’s my pitch: you can get a simple game up and running fast, the documentation is beautifully written and there are good tutorials online. \n\nStart here: https://gbdev.io/gb-asm-tutorial/\n\nEdit: will probably not help you with OS dev.

Modern x64 is a fully fledged high level language at this point, with types and error detection, complex bit manipulation algorithms that execute in one clock cycle, double the gflops per core than last decade GPUs, cycle counters and cache orchestration, all of them are available in userland and 90% of these instructions are never used, no matter the language, flags or compiler\n\nCoding in assembly is only worth the hassle when you use the ISA extensions, since compilers are 10 years behind what intel has been pushing.\n\nMacros and self standardization is the key to work with 2000+ lines of assembly code without losing your mind. I don't recommend using intrinsics, they produce a lot of garbage code and obscure certain useful details of the instructions. I find MASM + MSVC 2022 + win32 to be the easiest way to make visual applications for windows. Once you get the gist of it, you'll find out that everything inside a computer is assembly. If you like something cool inside a program, you can just disassemble it and copy the code to MSVC to see how it's done. Everything suddenly becomes open source.\n\nSearching the web for help is futile when it comes to new extensions in ASM, the best source of information is the intel SDM and some agner guides. I starte my journey with Creel's videos. They are amazing, all of them. \n\n[https://youtu.be/rxsBghsrvpI?si=24bxlEVBEENobRFF](https://youtu.be/rxsBghsrvpI?si=24bxlEVBEENobRFF)",

Especially if you're willing to work jobs that other devs then their nose at ie public service, independent companies, or non profits.\n\nYour professors suggestion doesn't even make a lot of sense. A lot of mobile apps are actually Web apps in disguise. Take a look at all the really terrible storefronts you can choose from like Amazon, Temu, Shien, etc. Theyre probably all using the same APIs as the websites do.\n\nI wouldn't say you're too far behind your peers most junior devs know very little about the stack they're starting with because frankly it's ridiculous to memorize and have experience with the hundreds if not thousands of options available. Personal projects is a great way to familiarize yourself with stacks you haven't used before.\n\nFor your project: You should probably listen to your professors, you want a good grade and good recommendations. I wouldn't change the idea I would change the execution. You can, for example, use something like React Native to use Web technology (HTML, css, and js) to make a mobile app for IoS and Android.",

Do not do that. Your teacher is not qualified to be teaching you. Unfortunately, you are where you are. \n\nWhat you \\*should\\* be asking is, what did you spend all that time on instead?

The question is, is this now your best option? If you tell me you have spent the last 3 years sitting on your ass and playing video games, maybe any kind of switch is going to take time, if however you told me you have been busy with other hobbies and interests, I would honestly and seriously tell you to choose one of those to turn into a profession if you can. \n\nSoftware development isn't going anywhere, but the gold rush is \\*over\\*.

It might limit how many jobs some companies would have but it won't take every job.\n\n3) Just about, maybe a tiny bit riskier especially since there's so many people that do it. Electrical is a very safe area in general since it's not as popular and so many areas need it. \n\n4) Frankly, just learn how to learn.

Ofc that will help with assignments and allowing you to feel comfortable with coding but not required. I do recommend you learn a little with whatever language your school uses the most in order to be ahead of the curve.

While college programs don't usually require that you have any previous experience, it will be a big advantage for you to have already gotten some experience on your own time, especially if you're already familiar with the programming languages that specific college uses in its first few courses.\n\nIt is definitely possible to get really good at coding in five years. Going right into freelancing from that point is harder, though, because colleges don't really give you the set of skills you need to be a professional. Being a junior programmer on a team and learning about stuff like code reviewing and navigating large codebases and source control and development methodologies is sort of a separate education from the college degree.\n\nI'm not at all scared of AI taking the software jobs. I think it's a useful tool, but I don't imagine it replacing the need for programmers any time in the next few decades. On the other hand, plenty of people I respect disagree with me. AI is probably equally a threat to lots of jobs, including programming but also art, engineering, and medicine. I wouldn't worry too much about programming specifically.\n\nMy advice: figure out what programming language your intended university uses for its introductory classes. Learn that language. Find a big pile of beginner coding problems and regularly practice. Try and do something fun with programming that ties to some interest of yours. Make a game. Make a guitar tuner. Make a thing that calculates football statistics. Whatever you find interesting.",

        "body": "Hey :) I am currently writing my Master Thesis in Cybersecurity at a University in Germany. I started out with two years of informatics lecture in my school which ended 3 years before I graduated Gymnasium (I think similar to high school). I can tell you that I did manage to get my Bachelors degree (but not with high grades) and my Masters degree did work out much better.   \nI can tell you, that you will learn coding well enough if it is similar to my experience in Germany. But as you go on I felt that theory is taught over practical things and I felt little prepared to enter the job marked. What I would suggest more than focusing on learning everything there is to know in theory, get a job on the side and learn there. \n\nI feel the need to tell you that if given the chance of doing it again I would not study CS anymore I would start out working and earning certificates on the side, but that is my personal experience.  \nIf you want to learn some techniques of CS and if you have the spare money to earn some degrees, I would recommend Hack the Box (students pay less per month) and Portswigger/BurpSuite. They are really beginner-friendly.\n\nRegarding AI, I think if you get some courses in CS focusing on AI you would get a head start, as many currently employed and finishing students did not get the possibility to take these. But there are also different specialties in CS that only few people want to specialize in. Most of the students in my experience are not really good at the mathematical part (e.g. cryptography), I have an interest in law in the side of being a CS major and worked for some time in a field which focused on the area where these two specialties meet. There are not a lot of law students who have an interest in computer and not a lot of CS students have an interest in law. If you want to be special find an area which most of your peers do not like and get good at it :)\n\nIf you have any further questions feel free to message me :)",

Depending on the quality of the classes at your institution that will require more or less outside effort on your part but that’s going to be the case no matter what you study.\n\nThis may just be my opinion but I wouldn’t worry about whether or not AI will impact your job. It will, that’s pretty much a given at this point. Now that you know that, you have 5 years to get familiar with the ways you will interface with AI tools so that you can make sure your skills stay relevant. Keeping your skills up to date is  a requirement of most jobs, certainly most tech adjacent jobs, so you just know one space you’ll need to focus on well in advance. \n\nThese are valid questions but I don’t think any of them are actually unique to computer science and you should probably be asking the same questions about anything you’re considering as a career.",

Please don't let this sub scare you off.\n\nWhen we are talking about a young 15 year old, it is worth putting the complaints on this sub about job prospects in perspective. That perspective being that while the number of jobs and unemployed people did halve in 2022 and then not bounce back up, leading to a job crisis. It actually has little to no impact about the long term existence of the field of computer science and IT.\n\nYou can look at stats like [https://www.trueup.io/job-trend](https://www.trueup.io/job-trend) if you are interested, but as a kid, I honestly wouldn't worry about that. The only take-away you should be learning from this is just maybe be prepared for a more chaotic job market with ups and downs.\n\nWhat matters more for software being worth or not to invest in as a child is just if the field is large enough. Which it certainly is. Out of all fields you can study at university, after nursing and engineering, computer science literally has THE largest job market of all other degrees, even after being halved in a single year. [https://kbaglobal.com/blog/employable-degrees-in-australia/](https://kbaglobal.com/blog/employable-degrees-in-australia/) If you are young, smart and already passionate about computer science... you will go far in this career and the skills you learn will have plenty of possible uses and jobs.",

A repetição e aplicação prática vão solidificar seu conhecimento melhor do que qualquer tentativa de decorar.\n\nPor fim, lembre-se que a jornada da programação é longa, com altos e baixos — e o medo, a dúvida e a insegurança fazem parte dela.

        "body": "The short answer is that being good at this is entirely what being a \"senior developer\" is about. It's a very broad and deep skillset that you develop through experience. You can eventually develop this experience on your own, but it's not going to happen fast. I made a lot of stupid design decisions when I was a junior dev.\n\nIf it's important for your startup to be building good software in the short term, then your startup needs to hire senior developers, both to make good decisions and to mentor juniors.\n\nSo it's not even remotely possible to do your questions justice in the span of a Reddit comment, but I'll try anyway:\n\n> How do I design the DB schema to be effective for a large number of users and such that my in-app operations are fast? I have learned about normalization and indexes but I still don't come up with elegant solutions like AI does honestly.\n\nUnderstand *how* queries and indexes work: how the data is structured internally (e.g. as a B-tree) and what the DB engine is doing when you write a query, especially when it involves joining multiple tables. Have this knowledge in mind every single time you write a query. Inspect the DB's query planner output (e.g. using `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) to confirm your assumptions.\n\n> How do I monitor apps cheaply/easily to see what’s hogging resources? My company has been using New relic but it just seems too complicated and has too much going on and seems overkill.\n\nThere are a gazillion tools for this, including basic ones like the Unix `top` command. I don't have experience with New Relic but I've used Datadog (flexible, but very expensive) and much simpler self-hosted tools like Prometheus.\n\nThe important thing is to measure, and then drill down into those measurements to figure out what to measure next. If your app \"feels slow\", add lots of timers to measure which parts are slowest. Try to reproduce the problem locally and use whatever local profiling tools are available in your language. If one user request \"fans out\" and depends on lots of different subrequests, then the 99th-percentile latency of those subrequests matters more than the average.\n\n> How do you actually test your app? It feels like such a pain and I do it manually for every project going through typical user flows and fixing stuff on the fly.\n\nTest automation is critical if you care about software quality. Write test cases alongside your code. For core logic, you can use unit tests, along with test coverage tools to help make sure you don't have obvious gaps in testing. For UI, the testing strategy depends on what framework you're using.\n\n> How do I check if my apps are secure and a motivated individual can't exploit it?\n\nUnderstand the general kinds of mistakes that lead to security flaws. There are lots and lots of these -- buffer overflows, escaping mistakes, confused deputy attacks, time-of-check-to-time-of-use, and so on. Be knowledgeable enough to recognize these, and disciplined enough to guard against them. Get other skilled developers to *carefully* review your code.\n\n> Am I making the right tradeoffs or over-engineering (e.g. Ex: should I use BullMQ or will node-cron suffice for my app that runs a CRON job to fetch a lot of data by calling a vendor's APIs?)?\n\nImpossible to answer in the abstract. A system is \"overengineered\" if it has more complexity than necessary to accomplish its goals. So you need to do a detailed analysis of your actual requirements, and the actual behavior of the complex option vs. the simple one.\n\n> Should the solution be a monolith or a bunch of microservices?\n\nThere are a lot of opinions about this but I'll just quote from [\"The Grug Brained Developer\"](https://grugbrain.dev/):\n\n\"grug wonder why big brain take hardest problem, factoring system correctly, and introduce network call too\"\n\n\"seem very confusing to grug\"",

Is there desire to  grow and take this public or is the intent to sell it off to a larger concern. That at least tells you if there is enough money or resources in your future to make real changes in your areas of concern. \n\nTo find your hot spots (frequently called or slow bottle-neck code)  products like DynaTrace and App Dynamics are helpful. There are many vulnerability scanning tools like Veracode, Black Duck etc. As for database optimizations that depends on your platform but lots of tools will suggest indexes to help performance and eliminate table scans. \nHang in there. If your company is trying to grow, their focus is likely on adding customers through new  features and much of what you are worried about will be pushed to the back as \"technical debt\" until your platform actually crashes, or gets hacked out of operating and held for ransom.",

I think you're hitting on a fundamental issue which is that software development is an extremely unregulated and undisciplined field. There are a lot of people who don't pay attention to any of the questions you're asking about, and still manage to have careers just cranking out sub-par code. (Especially nowadays when it's easy to just rubber-stamp the output of an LLM.) And on the other hand, if you push yourself, there is no upper limit to how much you can learn, or how much care you can put into your work.\n\nBut there's not really an objective, accepted standard for you to measure your skills by. There's just the outcome of your projects, and the judgment of your peers.\n\nThe good news is that there are a lot of extremely smart people in the field who have published a lot of text and video content that you can learn from. You don't necessarily have to take everything they say as gospel. Pay attention to the things they say that resonate with you, and use them as jumping-off points for your own explorations.\n\nJust as an example, you can find a lot of interesting talks from the now-defunct Strange Loop conference. Check out [\"Simple Made Easy\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4) by Rich Hickey (designer of Clojure) and [\"The Mess We're In\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4) by Joe Armstrong (designer of Erlang). Or if you care about security, look for interesting talks from DEFCON or CCC. Pick a random topic that interest you, and if it turns out to be way over your head, the stuff they talk about will at least give you more topics to research.\n\nAlso, check out software-related social media such as Hacker News or Lobste.rs (if you can trust yourself not to use them for procrastination). Don't get me wrong, those sites have a lot of bad opinions and irrelevant content. But they can serve as a good way to stay in tune with the zeitgeist of what other tech-savvy people are thinking about.\n\nEDIT: Oh yeah, and you'll probably find more useful advice over in /r/ExperiencedDevs than in this subreddit. To be honest, I think your questions are so broad that you wouldn't necessarily get comprehensive answers there either. But you can browse through previous discussion threads to see the kinds of advice that senior devs give.",

I think that’s because yeah…, repeating exercises is boring af. BUT repetition is also what makes things stick. Think of music, which in fact is also a language in its own context. You hear a song enough and you can recognize it. \n\nWe communicate with symbols and logic. You gotta learn what the symbols mean in the specific context and then how to use them to express what you want. \n\nSo a breakdown of an example you gave in another comment. \n-Program in C (language/format)\n-Seconds to minutes (formula)\n\nEven if you don’t know that 60s = 1 min by memory, you can find the formula and write it down. The C language will have a way to write the function, the variables and handle any printing or user interaction. That’s the part you gotta know or find out about the language beforehand (like rules or properties). The coding skill comes from being able to write down that broken logic into the computer code. So you gotta be familiar with the language and how it works. \n\nBut in general terms you can do things for everything. Problems will sometimes have a full sentence to just say something is equal (the same) to another thing. You can usually simplify it into formulas or terms like: 3 bananas + 3 apples = 6 fruit. Instead of thinking “how pretty we can say something” in the language we’re thinking “how fast can we make a computer understand it”. I can say “I would like 6 of that delicious fruit, please good sir.” or I can say “6 fruit”. In logical terms they mean the same. “I would like” implies addition for me, which would different to “Here you go, some fruit…” which would mean a loss for me. \n\nI hope that gives some perspective of the fundamentals of logic and operational thinking.",

Any *actual* animation that a user makes will have some finite length, even though there's no predefined upper limit on how big that can be.\n\nAny standard data structure such as a list, dictionary, etc. will allow you to put as many entries in it as you want.

But you're likely to run out of memory long before you hit that limit. And nobody is likely to be creating animations with 2 billion frames.)\n\n>  See, I would really love to poke around in the code of a pre-existing animation program to see how they did it, but once again, when I try to search about the code of an animation program google doesn't listen to me.\n\nThe specific programs you asked about are closed-source and proprietary, so the source code isn't published anywhere.

It doesn't have to be a unique idea, or a million-dollar business, or even particularly useful. Writing a complete program, and actually putting in the work to make all of the details work the way you want them to, is irreplaceable experience. Start small, and when you find yourself not being challenged enough, move on to something bigger.\n\nThere are a million pages you can find online with simple project ideas, so just pick something that appeals to you. If you like networks, write an HTTP server from scratch with raw sockets. If you like games, build something simple and turn-based with a minimal UI, such as Tetris or Scrabble or chess. If you like productivity apps, build a clone of Google Calendar or a simple photo album organizer. You get the idea.",

Then I talked with a fellow student and friend who’s really motivated. He’s built a lot of automation projects (like web scraping) in his free time, and he even makes money from them, which I thought was really cool.\n\nHe gave me one important piece of advice: don’t choose a project you think is useless. If your only motivation is money, it won’t be enough to push you through the difficulties of a tough project, especially since there’s no guarantee it will actually make money. Instead, pick a project that’s useful to you personally. That way, even if you don’t gain anything beyond the learning experience, you’ll at least have built a tool that helps you in your own life, which is already a great benefit.\n\nSo, I asked myself: is there anything in my life that I could automate? The answer to that question will be the project idea I’ll work on.\n\nOf course, I know there are countless other directions you can take with programming projects, not just automation.

        "body": "> What’s the best way to approach learning so that I can really understand Python and reduce my dependence on AI? Should I just keep practicing and trust that it will click over time?\n\nThis question gets asked over and over again, and the answer is the same: practicing **with** AI will not help much if you want to get better at coding **without** AI.\n\nThis especially applies to the skill of taking a complex problem and breaking it down to simpler subproblems. This is what programming is really about, and everything else (like the syntax of different programming languages) is trivial in comparison. And if you're always letting AI spoon-feed you by telling you what bullet-pointed subproblems to solve, you're never practicing that skill, so it will never improve.\n\nIf you're unsure whether you could rebuild your projects from scratch without AI, then why not just try it, and see where you run into difficulties?\n\nIf you get stuck, try reading documentation, or even taking existing examples and seeing what happens when you modify them. If you insist on using AI tools, then don't ask them to write code for you, or even come up with a design. Ask them to suggest learning resources (e.g. documentation websites) or project ideas.\n\nIf you're still repeatedly getting stuck trying to rebuild your projects from scratch, then it's a sign that your skills really are underdeveloped. So go back and do the same thing, designing and coding from scratch, on a simpler/easier problem. Repeat as necessary.\n\nFinally, practice your research skills. When there's something you want to learn about, practice searching online for it, reading what other people have said about it, and thinking up your own follow-up queries. Don't just let a chatbot tell you what it thinks is the right answer.",

I don't know what the context is here -- and anything involving working with raw data is well above the level of this sub -- but the gist is probably this:\n\nYou have an HTML file, which contains a table presenting some text, two cells per row. The *tr* is the element for a row, the *td* the element for a [cell](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/td). Each of these cells has a class called \"datavalue,\" and from that HTML file, you could write a script that grabs everything out of any cell with the \"datavalue\" class, so you end up with a text string of \"003F00502040003F00502040\".... (I assume that there are also rows with 00, 04 , etc.)\n\nThe screenshot is a [hex editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_editor) of some kind -- I don't know which one but they basically all do the same thing: they open a file and let you directly see and edit the raw data. Right now you don't have the actual raw data, though, you have the text \"003F00502040003F00502040\" etc., so you'd have to convert that to the equivalent data file. (Don't worry about the specifics of that, there are probably built-in functions for it in whatever language you're using.)\n\nThen in the hex editor you can view what the bytes of the file are, where they are in the file, and what characters they would be if it was supposed to be readable text. This data is almost definitely not supposed to be text, but without more context I don't know what it's supposed to be. (i.e., the 00 3F and 00 50 are probably supposed to be 63 and 80, but I don't know exactly what the 63 and 80 are being used for.)\n\nAgain, all of this is very much above the level of this sub.",

So after first reading the word `\"Going\"`, then the next time you try to read an integer, the next word will be `\"to\"`, which can't be parsed as an integer, so it'll fail.

I'm also usually a huge believer in throwing oneself into the deep end and just figuring it out, that's how I learn.\n\nBut... I don't think that it suits every kind of person. To be able to learn effectively through such a method you need to have a certain willingness and ability to just explore and try things when you get stuck.

For one, in an actual dev environment that's approximately how pedantic the tests are (although usually you'll have access to the tests which helps with matching strings). For another, most of their projects are reimplementing other projects that are in use and define a communication protocol. So, learning to read and be exact with those protocols is actually really important so that the programs that interface using the protocol are compatible.\n\nAs to your point about whether to recommend it, sure I agree it's not right for everyone, but I personally feel the tests are quite reasonable.

Not that I particularly recommend Node.js, it works, but languages like Rust and especially Go are among the best choices for a fast, efficient, and reliable backend. I’ve written backends in both Rust and Go, and they’ve been by far the most fun and comfortable to work with.\n\nMy opinion: Learn TypeScript (surprise) instead of JavaScript. TS is just a superset of JS, but it offers much more mature tooling support, early error detection, and *obviously* it is statically typed (mostly, unless you use `any`). It is basically the successor to JS and is well supported in all modern frontend frameworks. Some developers even prefer it over JS. After that, you might want to explore low-level languages if you want to expand your skills further. C is always a good start and is fairly simple unless you dive into very complex stuff. Since you are 16 (or just very young in general), you might actually be the perfect target audience for Rust. It has attracted many young developers and provides excellent resources for getting started. I never had an easier time learning a language than I did with Rust.\n\n**Tl;dr:** TS/JS (they are not that different) → (optionally) low-level languages such as C or Rust.",

        "body": "I've had this happen twice in the last week with two different companies. I'm a staff engineer with 8 YoE, interviewing for Senior React Native roles. Got some interview prep from one company telling me to prepare to be able to write a debounce from memory, and to brush up on asynchronous data fetching, manipulation of strings and arrays. Felt we were quite clearly going to do some sort of data fetching, list rendering and filtering. Nope, full blown JS fundamentals challenge around building a Wordle game in 45 minutes, obviously no AI allowed. Bumbled my way through the whole thing trying to remember the best way to map over stuff and comparing index's for matches and partial matches. Didn't even get close to finishing. Was surprised they did that challenge despite looking for a RN dev as it’s a different vertical than what they are looking for.\n\nSecond company interview didn't send any prep, passed the second round which was a live 1 hour coding test in RN, third round was a discussion on architecture with some white-boarding. Passed it until they pulled a gotcha right at the end with 15 minutes to go. Gave me another coding test on JS fundementals, which I passed, not satisfied they deleted that one and gave me another with 5 minutes to go that I couldn't finish in the allotted time. They haven't even bothered to get back to me.\n\nI question the people who decided the processes to be honest, I don't think they know what they're looking for. The whole process feels broken because they don't know how to handle the whole AI aspect of things.",

The overzealous vibe coder trope.\n\nWhat that underlying question is looking for is not to shit talk AI and be dismissive of it, nor is it to circle-jerk over AI and how it's revolutionized your life. It wants a more measured answer that talks about the pros/cons of AI, where it's useful, where it's not, and demonstrating understanding that it needs to be used with caution no matter where it's used.\n\nWe all get that it's not good at complex tasks. We all get that it sucks at being able to understand business logic to do anything useful. We all get it sucks when it needs to work in a large codebase across multiple files.\n\nBut it has some pros you didn't seem to mention at all.... the biggest one, which is what I use it for regularly, is as a faster Stack Overflow. Back in the day, when I was getting some error I wasn't sure why I was getting, I'd go Google that error. Then I'd sift through Stack Overflow questions until I find one that's close enough related to what I was doing that it can push me in the right direction, and usually hit my head against a wall until things finally work.\n\nNowadays when I get an error, I type into Copilot \"Why am I getting \\[pasted error\\]?\". Copilot looks at my code, scours the internet/docs to find answers that are directly relevant to my code, and can give me relevant answers way faster than I could get on my own. It's of course not always right on the first try, but with a follow up prompt or 2 I almost always end up with an easy fix with very little effort from me. This is like 90% of what I use AI for, and it's absolutely been a massive benefit.\n\nI also like it for very mundane tasks that are conceptually simple, but are time consuming. Coming up with unit tests is one. AI can easily read code paths, and shit out enough tests to get good coverage. It's usually pretty bad at *implementing* the unit tests, but I can take over from there, it did the boring part for me.\n\nAI's also great at just asking general questions. Why read through AWS's terrible docs when I can ask a single prompt, and get a right answer most of the time.\n\nI'm on your side that I think AI's pretty bad at doing most code generation tasks beyond very simple or very isolated stuff.... but you're being overly dismissive if you can't think of any ways it can make your life easier.",

For technical skills someone typically is assigned to help mentor and onboard and teach you/docs to read etc. Having to mentor someones social skills is a lot more awkward and I doubt anyone wants to explicitly be told they need to do that. So a lot is on the individual if they know they need to grow that area and practice it themselves\n\nAnd then with technical skills there’s a lot of room to make mistakes and failsafes to catch you. With QA/canary/code review/rollbacks etc and even if a mistake makes it to prod typically it’s fine and a learning experience. Whereas in a social setting first impressions are very important.

        "body": "I mean literally every post on Reddit tells you this lol.\n\nAnyway, I was always a weird nerd, hung around nerds, shy non-popular guys etc. But because I was always great at sport and athletic I would hang around jocks and even gangsters so I learned how to get along with alot of different people.\n\nThis is a big question so there's nowhere to start really but for Reddit I will say this, biggest killers for the guys here are the following: Introverted, self awareness and over-valuing intelligence. I can explain lol.\n\n1. Introverted: People use this as a self-built cage rather than just a label. It shouldn't even be a label the way this word has a mental hold on people on Reddit. Firstly, yes you can be naturally inclined toward introversion or extraversion, but there's caveats. Being introverted or extroverted doesn't neccessarily mean bad at social interaction versus good. I've seen plenty of extraverts who fucking suck at social situations and introverts who are great, they just prefer to be alone more often. You can be good at social skills and continue to carry your special little introvert label if you want, it's just going to be a little harder than if you were an extravert ***simply because you're getting in less reps.*** An extrovert will try and fail more = more chance for success. Also, you can switch between being introverted or extroverted, this isn't WoW where you can't cast a spell because you chose the paladin class. You're allowed to try being extroverted for a week, year, decade if you want.\n\nLike OP said it will feel weird at first, but ask any guy who got ripped from being fat if he felt like a natural in the gym the first day he picked up a weight. Nope, he worked through the pain and embarassment and got the reward. The good thing about social skills is that it doesn't even take that long, nor do you have to always be the social guy.. you can just learn the skills and keep it in your back pocket until you need it.\n\n2. Self awareness: Reddit copes alot by thinking that extraverts in engineering are just \"smooth talkers\" wrong. Smooth talking is a skill that comes with social skills, but it's not the whole pie. Some social people over-use smooth talking and get found out real quick and exposed, luckily here on Reddit we're all extremely intelligent and know what's best for the world so that won't be our issue... right?\n\nThere's a negative connotation in engineering for having good social skills and confidence. I get laughed at by my friends for having \"good english\" and \"talking shit\".. like that's something to be embarassed about? In reality, I have great language skills to explain things to people of all levels, and I can basically nail down concepts into managable pieces for customers to understand without confusing them with jargon.. that's a skill that requires intelligence, humility and understanding concepts. Engineering isn't just about calculating numbers really fast, or memorising a fourier transform, we're here to sell products and create ideas. You NEED to be able to communicate those ideas or else the math and physics is lost in the void. What's the point of being able to create nuclear power if the government is scared of it and thus bans it because you can't explain to them why it's neccessary. \n\n3. over-valuing intelligence: In the sense that people here like to min/max intel stats, that's great. More intelligence is always good, but again that's not a license for you to suck at conveying your ideas or to treat people like shit. Yes conceptually a team of really high intel nerds will be good for a company, but in reality we live in a market where we need to promote ideas and actually be able to understand from person to person. You can't do that by being very intelligent but a dick or can't explain your ideas to people in simple terms.",

I definitely prefer FTE.\n\nDiff strokes, however:\n* i generally try to befriend my coworkers, and so generally 'team building' isn't something that i see as a something that is a chore, more like i don't even tthink about it\n* Benefits via staffing agency SUUUUUUUK. You may not notice this much if you are young, single, and generally in good health, but its HUUGE when you have kids. I have twins.\n* the employee 'type' doesn't change how I engage w/ my coworkers - i'm a bit of a jokester and always try to lighten the mood, make work fun - to me that makes sense just cause, in theory i'm sitting next to you 8 hrs a day, i better like clocking in. But a lot of folks prefer keeping work & personal separate, that's totally fine too.\n* with regards to layoffs, generally in my exp contractors are 'first to go' of the engineers - not first to go like let go, they just don't renew your contract. A much bigger/critical layoff usually they cut ties with the staffing agency completely, i've seen.\n* for me it's all about stability, longevity, benefits. my contract ends just before december but i only recently started and i'm trying to bust my ass to get an extension / converted\n* not being eligible for some of the better FTE perks, sucks. Its like, I work just as much as any other person on the team, it'd be nice if i can be included in certain things \n\nThere's some things i like - like being held to 40 hrs a week, any overtime needs approval and you actually can get paid for it. generally that means i'm off the hook for pagerduty. Net 7 (getting paid every week) is nice too",

I have always preferred FTE in the past because you get the good salary, there is no waiting to see if you get extended, the benefits will be better, you get PTO, and paid holidays.  And who knows, you might even get a bonus, and a promotion.   Who knows!\n\nI seemed to fall into temporary contract work when FTE positions were not available.   I never minded doing some contract work.   I didn't worry about office politics like the OP said.   In some cases, I got holiday pay and even bonuses from some contracting companies.   But what I didn't like was short term extensions.   I worked for one client who did first 6 months, then another 6 months, and then it was 3 months, and then 3 months.   I had to leave.    I told my manager, who was a great person BTW, that I simply can't keep extending for 3 months.   As soon as you start the 3 months, you need to start looking again halfway through ... if you;re going to extend me, at least make it for some length of time, but I know she didn't control the money, so that was that.\n\nNowadays, I've been getting laid off a lot, the FTE roles don't seem to last very long themselves.  Yeah, you might get some extra benefits from FTE, but longevity isn't one of them.     I definitely have friends who have been contracting at one client for years and years, they have been around longer than most FTE employees.  They just keep getting extended, and they know the work, and it's not hard.    \n\nSo, pros and cons for each ..........",

The ones that don't move to a very stable, easy job like government work or an \"elder\" big tech company like Cisco.\n\nIt's rare for anyone to be doing the job hopping, leetcode lifestyle beyond their peak earning years in my experience. That is a young person's game, not the game of someone who no longer puts their career as the most important tentpole in their lives above friends/family/fulfillment/stability. Also, the industry by the time you are that age could be a totally different landscape (like it was for them).\n\nIn general though, I find almost nobody sticks with the same career path their whole lives. It's a far better trait to be adaptable and smart in this world we currently live in than pigeonhole yourself into a specific career. School makes you think you go to school and always stick with the same path. It never really turns out that way. Most do at least lateral shifts if not major ones.",

It ABSOLUTELY CAN mean that in SOME work environments, but I have found tech is generally more forgiving than most.\n\nMost of the autistic people that I personally know are not combative, or pointedly rude, or generally frustrating to be around. You don’t have to have a maxed out charisma stat, you need to not be miserable for your coworkers to interact with. I have ADHD for example and I interrupt my coworkers all the time but they live with me.\n\nADHD is a poor proxy for understanding what it’s like to live with autism, so please do not take this as me attempting to be reductionist toward legitimate struggles, but one thing I have found helpful is to stop assuming my condition is the barrier I’m facing. It might CONTRIBUTE to the barrier, but plenty of people before and after me have had ADHD undiagnosed their entire lives and they never even knew. I’m glad mental health is so well-known these days, but these conditions are not new and plenty before us have succeeded. Being a bit quiet, or loud, or odd, or by-the-book, or socially inexperienced are not traits limited to people with autism or ADHD. And all of us can improve.\n\nI had crippling social anxiety starting my first job and now I’m getting promoted and my boss explicitly mentioned I’m extremely well-liked in the office. People like my empathy more than they give a damn about my ADHD. Gen Z in general struggles with social skills because we were locked in a room during COVID for core developmental years.\n\nDon’t panic, you’ll be fine.\n\nedit: and watch The Residence on Netflix if you haven’t. If you pride yourself in your technical skills and know you are autistic then it could be a nice reminder that autism makes some people better at their jobs. Your brain works differently than most and that can be quite handy.",

Like, you know, fortune striking them at just the right moments.\n\nTake Steve Jobs as an example. People often point out that he was poor, which is true, but he also got some extraordinary breaks that almost nobody gets. He met Wozniak, who happened to be a genius at building computers, at exactly the right time. Woz let Jobs run with the business side, they launched their first product, it took off immediately, and suddenly Jobs was financially independent. Apple went on an upward spiral so fast he never really saw any serious failure early in his life. That kind of alignment is rare.\n\nIf you’re coming from very humble beginnings, you usually need multiple strokes of luck like that to become extremely successful. Getting to moderate success or financial independence is possible with hard work, but the billionaire-level outcomes are much harder without serious tailwinds.\n\nFinance and tech both show this in different ways. Finance is even more network-heavy. Running a fund is all about raising money, and raising money is basically a game of connections. Technology is also about contacts in the Valley when it comes to big fundraising rounds, but the barrier to entry can be lower.\n\nSo if you’re poor, you can still make it, but you’ll need a lot of luck. Even if you claw your way up, the climb is steeper. No contacts, no capital, and no safety net mean it will take much longer to reach the same level as someone who started with connections.",

        "body": "Its social media. Humans within a social circle (that now encompasses the world) likes to show-off and brag. However, based on what you wrote, you and many others have been both mislead and duped by these influencers. Many influencers show off a lavish life style funded by millions of dollars in debt. They aren't rich by any means. Only faking it.\n\n>I’ve noticed that in tech communities especially software engineering, there’s a lot of emphasis on talking about compensation packages, benefits, and perks. You see it everywhere from “Day in the Life” YouTube videos where someone shows off their free lunches, nap pods, and flexible schedules, to posts comparing salaries across companies.\n\nTech encompasses a wide range of compensation, benefits and perks. What you see on social media is the top 10% of all tech. It would look completely different - perhaps even bleak, if someone actually showed the day in the life of a median (50th percentile) or worst (100th percentile) job.\n\nThey certainly don't have free lunches, nap pods, and may be even lucky if they get free coffee. They might be filling out time-sheets and staring down some of the worst-maintained technology with very strict deadlines and constraints for changes. Depending on the country, the median can range anywhere from $40K-80K. Does that sound super cushy to you?\n\n>Don’t get me wrong, I get why this happens. Tech jobs *can* be cushy, with relaxed work environments, decent pay, and nice benefits. That kind of lifestyle is attractive to students and career switchers. But sometimes it feels like people act as if tech is the *only* field with these kinds of perks, which isn’t true.\n\nDo you really get why this happens?\n\nBased off of your perspective you don't. The phenomenon is more broadly categorized as \"keeping up with the jones\" within the last century. Only with the internet it has allowed people to share their accomplishments across a larger audience that would not have been possible before.\n\nPreviously such people would only be able to reach as far as people similarly within their economic circle. People irrespectively have been comparing themselves to others within their social circle for millennia. The rich compared themselves with other rich. The poor compared themselves to other poor. The middle class compared themselves to other middle class. Its competition, its standard human nature that we haven't grown out of.\n\nThe internet and more specifically Social Media has given everyone a microphone to broadcast themselves.\n\n>There are plenty of non-tech office jobs that can be just as cushy and well-compensated, if not more so in some cases. For example:\n\nAny job can be cushy if you're in the right positions. But your perspective is off-keel and your barking up the wrong trees. Within ALL professions, there is the top, middle, and bottom. What you see on social media being \"cushy\" jobs is nothing more than a facade - including in the industries you mentioned. They are designed to spark envy.\n\nMany of these high paying jobs are not \"cushy\" in the slightest - at least if people are actually performing their job. These so-called benefits only exist to extract more work hours out of staff. You get subjected to the political machinations resulting from the Jack Welsh Rank-And-Yank (the Hunger Games).",

But there's a really deadly spiral that a fair amount of people get stuck in.\n\nThey land at a shit job where the things you're talking about are the norm, then they get burned out and desperate for a new job, and because of that desperation they fail to do their due diligence in the reverse interview and/or aren't picky enough with the new job, so they end up somewhere just as bad. Rinse and repeat, and your entire career is just shit job after shit job.\n\nIt's a hard cycle to break once you're in it, because you never ditch that feeling of desperation.\n\nLayoff/management changes aren't really unique to our industry. What is fairly unique to this industry is our painful interviews, which only makes it harder to get out of the deadly spiral once you're in it because you're both burnt out from your shit job, *and* the shit interview process. Double burnout.\n\n>How do I just find some peace in this field?\n\nSo the things you're talking about re: stress, unrealistic deadlines, mismanagement, shit culture, etc aren't *inherent* of this field. They're inherent of toxic companies. The trick is finding a company that isn't toxic. Just because a company has lower pay doesn't mean they'll be lower stress/not toxic. Just because a company has higher pay doesn't mean they'll be higher stress/toxic.\n\nThis requires you to get really get at reverse-interviewing to sus out companies like that, *and* to be able to have the patience to not humor offers from companies that sound like they'll have cultures like that. I've said \"No thanks\" to plenty of companies.\n\nI've worked at 4 companies since graduating, 2 more if you count my internships, and I'd only describe one of them as turning toxic. That one was *great* to work for for about 2 years, but they had a CTO change who slowly tried to turn up the heat on the devs, which resulted in me and most of the good devs jumping ship before it got really bad. The other 5 companies though? Great WLB/cultures. I left one because I wanted to move to the east coast (100% onsite days), some of my friends are *still there* 12 years into their career. I left another one cause I was sick of the industry it was in, but honestly this was probably a mistake. The 3rd was the one I said turned toxic after 2 years. The one I'm at now is still smooth sailing over a year in.\n\nGood companies are out there. You just have to find them.",

Let someone else do it.  Give yourself luxurious timelines and estimates and then just code for a while.  The code is fun - it's interesting - it's a never ending experiment in order and logic.   It's the best part of the job.  Don't worry about fixing the architecture or righting any ships - just do the fun bit.  Let others code be buggy - let the tests be a joke - let the libraries be undocumented and uncommented... and for all that's holy - don't worry about upgrading anything.   Just code for a while.  Methodically and quietly grind out some tasks and see how you feel.\n\nEventually my ambition has always gotten the best of me and i've had to escape those easy orbits - but others stay there and seem\nhappy to me.   Maybe that will work for you too - if not forever, then maybe for a time.",

They brought in a consultant who tried to talk down to me and make me back down. This guy looked me in the face and said “I don’t know if you’re worth $150K, $40k or what.” After one or two weeks of back and forth like that, I gave up and just started searching. About 2 weeks after I stopped talking about it, I think the CEO figured out I was probably not happy, and gave me their promised pay bump. I gave my two weeks a few days after. \n\nI learned two things from that experience, first you have a choice in what you spend your energy on. It can be fighting for a raise, or it can be find a healthier and better position. It’s up to you. Second, if you have to justify your value to someone else, and your salary is a measure of your value, then either you value your self too highly, or they don’t value you enough, either way, this always leads to a toxic environment and you should probably just bow out. \n\nNow, I don’t even really bring up salary points. I just tell my manager if I feel valued, and this is what I do for the company, and they get the message and talk to their manager about getting a raise because they value me.

Those have nearly all disappeared - so don't get your hopes up in landing a job at the few that remain. Remote is now tied to the local market rate for talent, and even takes a haircut for the \"convenience\" of being remote.\n\nBefore you do something irrational in an otherwise crappy job market, evaluate the \"total value\" of your setup which includes:\n\n1. Your total compensation (base, bonus, equity)\n2. Your company provided benefits.\n3. The convenience of being able to WFH (reduced transportation costs, time savings, reallocated travel time to fitness/health/wellbeing)\n4. The social benefits provided by your country (health care, pharmacare, etc)\n5. The purchasing power you have per euro/dollar spent\n\nIts very important that you actually measure the value of (#3-5) in order to compare the \"real compensation\" you earn. Most folks younger in their careers only measure #1, and #2 only comes nominally later when you have kids. As a result they are easier to manipulate when the industry is in a boom.\n\nYou should index your total compensation against the percentiles for your country. 73K euro could put you in the top 5%, 10% (many european countries), 15% (e.g. Canada), or 30% (e.g. US) of earners depending on the country you reside in. This will help you ground your expectations a little more.\n\nIts not wrong to demand more compensation for increased scope of responsibility and outcomes delivered. However, you want to weigh your situation before engaging in a confrontation with your company/CEO. If you already have a better offer lined up, then the risk versus reward of engaging in the confrontation is tipped in your favor. If you're in a low percentile earner in your country/region (e.g. 80-100%), then you may not have much to lose and more to gain.\n\nThere is a good time to engage in this kind of dialogue, and a bad time to do so. Good times are when there is lots of hiring, easy-to-find opportunities, and very few people available to replace you. At this very moment in 2025, it is a bad time to engage in wage negotiations without something like a Union backing you. Depending on the percentile compensation, there are many people willing to take up the task.",

It's clear you don't see yourself as a full stack developer which is fine but that does limit your options.\n\nMy ballpark guess is 70 percent of industry expects devs to be some loose form of full stack/blend of their specific industry. While the rest is like data science/AI/ML adjacent. However, there is a pretty small section of industry looking for people who are good at security/reverse engineering. I heard it's growing but it doesnt seem in vogue.\n\nI'd recommend leaning into trying to become a security engineer or reverse engineering research. It's very niche but so is your skillset. I personally cannot imagine being as good as assembly and gdb as you(I suck). Maybe play some CTFs and go from there to build credibility. NSA codebreakers challenge is coming up in a few weeks/fall. Sounds like youre more interested in these of topics anyways.",

So if you’re the same my advice there is to approach everything in a similar way, learn the underlying concepts (even if they’re “outdated”) before moving onto the more modern approaches. For instance, with frontend web, just start with plain HTML/CSS/JS, then start bringing in some libraries like JQuery (or maybe could skip this part), then move onto more modern frameworks like React, etc. And similarly when learning something like React, just start with that, then later start integrating other libraries into it (say for state management, etc.). \n\nWhat parts of git, CI/CD, unit testing, DBs, are you struggling with?\n\nAlso maybe some books on different architectural design topics might help with the OOP or general software design principles.",

Frameworks are abstractions of behavior. And like most of the not low level software, it's made up of low level software. So maybe read up on how to make a rest server from the ground up. Or how to use JS to create a simple framework. Granted that's if you want to go in that area.\n\nAlternative look for roles more focused on C/Unix, you can also start using AI tools to judge your code and see what they come up with. As much as we hate AI it can be used to learn what to learn. Ask what's expected of a Dev in a role you want, then make it give you a small project to practice the skills you are lacking. But keep in mind that you can't simply code for yourself, you gotta pretend someone will have to use your code sooner rather than later. 5 years ago getting feedback on thst without coworkers was hard, but now you can ask AI to help you figure out how to do something better.\n\nGit and CI/CDs are tools, learn them like such, an online class for git will teach you more than you need.\n\nTesting your own code should just become 2nd nature to you for low level, it's just code that verified other code is doing what you expect it to. Web framework tests have more in mind depending what you are testing, so I wouldn't touch that just yet.\n\nAs for OOP C code, have you tried looking at how some popular repos do it? Tbh certain languages have poor OOP implementations so it will always look ugly for them. And tbh some OOP code will be ugly regardless due to the complexity they can accumulate.\n\nDon't give up!

You now have the option to rollover your 401k funds into the solo 401k. This is opposed to doing a rollover to an IRA.\n\nWhy do this?\n\nWith a solo 401k you get two advantages:\n\n* Controlling the fund menu within a 401k. Meaning you can have access to favorable funds.\n* Keeping your money outside of pretax IRA space. This is important if you are doing the backdoor Roth IRA strategy where a positive pretax IRA balance will influence pro rata taxation on traditional IRA to Roth IRA conversions.\n\nThere is also a third advantage.\n\nA 401k has an annual limit for both employee and employer contributions. For 2025 employee contribution limit is $23.5k. Employer limit is $46.5k. So a total of $70k.\n\nThe employee limit is the aggregate of all 401ks under your name within the calendar year. The employer limit is **per 401k acccount**. In other words if you have access to two 401ks and actively working for both employers then you can, at maximum, have access to $23.5k + 2 \\* $46.5k = $116.5k space. This scales up with every 401k you have access to.\n\nSo with the solo 401k you can contribute 20% of your net self-employment income on the employer contribution side of things.\n\nYou just need a valid reason to open a solo 401k.

That will be your next job application!\n\nOr at least, given the 85 or so companies I have worked for or with, that's how it's had to be. Anyone showing ideas above their station, well, you know yourself now what you get.\n\nSecond, despite what most people would like to think, there is no top exec keeping an eye on you, ready to pluck you for stardom! I have only ever seen a company's butt tighten up like a snare drum when it comes to spending money on someone, i.e. promotion, training, etc. This whole idea of the company needs to value you or needs to encourage you, that's not the aim of the game for most companies.\n\nAnd to people who just want to say, \"I guess you worked for shitty companies\", 85 or so in so far, I've yet to see it any different. If yours is different, let me know how to apply! Even the nicest of places to work get fidgety when you tell them you've gone done achieved something big that's worth a lot more on the job market. That goes double if there's someone already in the position you're working towards.\n\nAny promotion means a move.

He knew nothing about anything, but he ruled with an iron fist, and it was his way or the highway. Between my manager and our 12 person team, of which she was easily the smartest and most experienced, know who the ONLY PERSON laid off was when the company did a 5% layoff?\n\nYou guessed it. Her only “crime” was that she often frequently disagreed with his opinions on how to manage the projects (which were years behind schedule now thanks to him). And the group manager had a meeting with everyone else the same day to say “I had no part in this.” Meanwhile, he had quickly become the laughing stock of the team. He would get off department calls, and the second he hung up, one of our managers would say, “oh good, he’s gone, now we can get some real work done.” So…\n\nFortunately for me, the business saw how little value he was bringing within 6 months after, and suddenly he was forced out in a matter of months once his old boss (and best friend) left him high and dry to pursue a higher position.\n\nI hate to admit it, but someone once told me, “50% of your career is what you know, and 50% is who you know.” I’d hate to think they are right, but I’ll\nbe damned if there isn’t a pole of evidence to support it.",

You need to not only finish your own work but also grow people and that’s pretty hard to do remotely. Maybe you are the exception… Have you done that successfully while leading junior dev’s growth remotely? you just confident because you’ve been an effective IC remotely? Those are two different things, tbh. Your manager’s concern is not unfounded. Especially since you’ve never been a manager before. Learning how to be a manager as a remote manager…good luck. I’ve had 3 remote managers at this point in my career and none of them grew me nearly as much as my co-located managers.\n\nAlso, managers are supposed to (imo) shield their reports from unnecessary office politics as much as possible. How would you do that if you aren’t even in the office to keep tabs on the said office politics? Your reports, especially the junior ones who don’t know how to manager up, may suffer alone and not know whom to turn to or how to deal with it.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind…it’s fine to stay an IC and prioritize family. Not every stage of your career has to be growth oriented. Please don’t become a manager for the sake of the next promotion - those usually end up the worst managers. Become a manager when you are ready to mentor and grow people. When you are thinking about starting a family, it’s ok to take a backseat and coast/autopilot a bit in your current job. You can always become a manager later. But your kid(s) only grow up once.",

I couldn't code out of uni.\n\nHowever, I genuinely believe, and learnt, that anyone with an average IQ can become a software engineer - my IQ is average. Sure, you may need to spend a bit longer practicing and going over things, but if I can do it - so can you.\n\nYou need to find out what works for you with regards to learning. I found out (after buying lots of them) that books dont work for me. What worked for me was practical problem solving and project building.\n\nI basically put an entire year (literally, I barely went out) into learning computing science theory and practical coding through projects and challenges. I built so many projects I lost count. I also constantly applied for jobs and was rejected in that year - at one point being told software engineering wasn't for me but I should consider Business Analytics.\n\nA year later, I landed my first coding job (in 2017) and since then have worked up to over 6 figure salary in my area (Europe). I earn aprox 20-30% more than the average person with my experience in my area.\n\nThis isnt to brag. This  is to tell you that if I - an average dude - can do it, so can you.",

        "body": "TL;DR: I wrote a goddamn novel so here's the brief. A lot of fresh graduates go through what you're going through. You're not alone, you are capable, and if nobody else has said it, I fully believe in you. Build cool stuff you want to build while you're applying to jobs. Apply to those jobs anyways, because most skills are taught on the job in the first 6 months.\n\nI never finished my degree, however, I did take a lot of college courses on computer science. I have to be honest, college really does not teach you much in terms of preparing you for working on the job. If you think about it, it makes sense, a lot of jobs require you to understand tooling, specific frameworks, working within a team building, large-scale applications, etc. \n\nThe issue is that frameworks change, if you spent a semester learning Spring, .NET, NEXT.JS, they could all have insane updates mid-semester that would require the professor to alter their coursework mid-semester. With that being said, this stuff is really hard to teach. The tech industry is constantly moving forward and evolving. \n\nBecause of this, a lot of degrees in computer science focus on theory, data structures and algorithms, maybe programming language fundamentals and, if you pick a specific focus, AI for example, GIS, or game design or whatever, you learn that niche.\n\nThat's why a lot of jobs don't require degrees and seldom hire Junior developers that have degrees. Especially in today's job market. People with degrees can prove that they made it through their coursework and they might have some capstone projects under their belt. But they can't code their way out of a wet paper bag, or they don't have a lot of real on-the-job experience. You shouldn't let that stop you though.\n\nYou should know that you are good at what you do, you have the degree. You've proven that you can do the work even if you just coasted. Just work on a bunch of personal projects, building stuff that interests you. It doesn't have to be big or glamorous, just stuff you enjoy. You will quickly gain a skill set that you would want to enter the job market for. It could be full stack development, mobile development, game development, front end, back end, big data, whatever. Right now, just focus on building cool shit. \n\nA lot of programmers leaving college are in the exact same boat you are in. They have a degree, they're kind of good at coding, and they understand theory, now what? I'll just say this as a trade secret, 90% of engineers that have a job, learned what they know now on the job. Unless you're applying to mid to senior level roles or doing contract work, most jobs teach you everything during \"ramp up\" which usually takes about 6 months. \n\nYou got this, man. Take it one day at a time and don't be discouraged if you get rejected constantly. The job market is tough right now but, I believe in you. Good luck.",

L1 and L2 are non-SWE roles and don't really come up in this forum. There are also levels beyond staff (senior staff, principal, distinguished, fellow).\n\nThere's different leveling structures across the industry like Amazon's SDE1/2/3 and Microsoft's 59-80, and there's companies with different title progressions (e.g. again Amazon, where there's no \"staff\", or IBM, where \"staff\" means mid level and comes before senior), so talking in terms of \"L5\" just makes it easier to talk about level equivalency across companies.\n\nEach level has rubrics for both hiring and promotions, largely based on amount of scope/impact, and these rubrics are similar across different companies for the respective levels.",

The reason why a lot of new grad roles start very (typically between 2-4) is that anything under might be an intern role or a role at the company that is just lower. And for which level you interview for, it depends on your previous experience. Assume L5 is senior, if you apply to this role most companies will assume you have been senior or you have showcased senior capabilities already. Some companies will up level you or down level you depending on their definition of the level. For example meta e3 is new grad and you actually can’t have experience (I think you need less than 1) , so above that you can be E4, if you have the experience you might be E5, if you have 3 yoe but you experience aligns highly with what they want and you perform well in interviews they might up level you to E5 (rare).\n\nAlso L6 is not necessarily best engineer or something. You can move up your career just having a lot of luck too (probably still a good worker). I know someone at my company who went from L3 equivalent to L6 equivalent in 1 year (internal job change, pm).\n\nYou move up by showing that you have already been performing at that level. Sometimes you can’t move up though due to budget and other office politic reasons.",

        "body": "  \nI've been on both sides of this. I started my career as an 'ambitious overachiever,' burned out hard, and then tried the 'maintain boundaries' approach. Here's what I learned.  \n**As an Ambitious Overachiever:**  \nFrom my personal experience, going above and beyond only **works if you're able to \"showcase\" your work.** That is, people in the company need to actively **see you as someone who goes \"above and beyond\"** in order for it to matter. You should also make sure to **document your achievements and positive feedback** received so you can later present them to management when discussing raises, promotions, and so on. I would also say, though this is also another personal experience thing, that **going above and beyond in every category is both ineffective and leads to burnout.** It's better to **have one project which you own/lead and excel** **at** at a time, and do the \"regular\" amount of work on your other projects.  In addition, it is important to build rapport. You don't have to be an extrovert per se, but **people should leave feeling positively after talking with you.** \n\nOn the downside, **career progression** at any one company inherently **depends on how much room there is for promotion** and the budget of your department. Plus, overperformance makes you advance faster but rarely do you ever skip progression tiers. You may be a truly stellar, outstanding, junior engineer, but you won't get promoted to senior engineer immediately. You'll likely just spend one year less in junior, one year less in mid, and so on. It also only partially protects you from layoffs--**you'll be the last junior engineer laid off**, but if they're **laying off all junior engineers you're still gonna get laid off.**\n\nSomething I learned the hard way is that no matter how much of a \"go above and beyond\" employee you are, **one period of poor performance**, even if do to extenuating circumstances, **can very quickly destroy your reputation** as an overperformer. If this happens, you should immediately look for a new job unless you really love your current workplace. I also found that **opportunities to truly excel can be difficult to find and sometimes even be gatekept.**\n\nIt is important to remember that much of **your excellent performance will evaporate** when searching for a new job **unless you're able to show public artifacts** which showcase it. Maybe references can do this too, but you need to tell the new employer to actually contact them. I got laid off without any public artifacts to show off, and it made job searching ***much harder.***\n\n**Do great work but maintain boundaries approach:**\n\nI took this approach after burning out, though that burnout was partly due to a toxic coworker.  \nI found it to be less stressful and often my outcomes became more consistent, which many employers value more than someone who does overall better work but in an inconsistent fashion. In general, it's only seen as a bad thing at (healthy) companies if it's the kinda role where overtime is inherently expected or a startup. How your work itself is recognized largely depends on your manager and how well they understand it. I'd say your manager's **subjective perception of your work matters far more than the actual work quality.**\n\n**Advancement** felt like it **depended** more **on the state the economy**. Good economy, relatively normal advancement rate. Bad economy, slower advancement rate and layoffs. \n\n**Summary/takeaway:**\n\nBrute-force 'tryharding' is rarely worth the investment and often leads to burnout. If there's a project you can take ownership over, do that and make sure to 'show it off' like a salesman.  Make sure to have evidence to support your skills for both internal promotions and getting jobs elsewhere. **Be an intelligent, strategic achiever who works to own and lead projects while building the skillset you want, rather than an overachiever for the company you work for.**",

The question should be more nuanced though- people (especially engineers) LOVE to microoptimize on a single variable when that isn't actually productive because our lives are multifaceted (e.g. either minmaxing saving money, or being a yolo spender). \nMy practical recommendations are 2 things\n1) oscillate based on priority. Some projects are important, high-vis, high-impact and will leapfrog your career more than the rest of your work combined. Spending a bit more effort here pays dividends. Similarly, if you're close to a promo you care about, it's worth doing a bit extra. Rest of the time, it's okay to just do enough.\n\n\n2) understand the rubric better. Unlike school where assignments are graded 0-100%, work is very ambiguous. Understand who controls your career trajectory (usually your direct manager and maybe skip level), and optimize for success. Find ways to proactively make your manager's job easier, and make your manager look good to their management. This will do the most. \n\n\nOne anecdote I've shared a few times: I grinded really hard when I joined this job, manager denied my promo again and again based on random nitpicks from career ladder doc. I eventually threw in the towel and said fuck it, that manager left, my new manager was chill and I kept sandbagging. I'd be responsive and helpful on shared projects, but I was also literally playing video games during the day (wfh). Despite all this, my new manager pretty soon put me up for promo successfully without me asking, and handwaved a bunch of career ladder \"requirements\". I did have to do a bit of extra work since manager asked me to draft my own promo doc (usually manager duty, but fair enough trade lol). It's all fuzzy and hand wavey end of day as long as those in charge approve ",

New residents and med students with kids in particular may be looking to nanny share to save some money. \n\nYour other option is to aggresively consolidate your day and hire in-home help for that time. For example, make your working hours 9AM-1PM (or whatever). Find a part time nanny who is willing to do 4 hours per day. Then tell work that your hours for meetings and other syncronous work have shifted into that mid-day block or to hours when your husband is home. \n\nBoth of these options, a nanny share or a part time nanny, will run you a similar cost to high quality infant daycare, but will keep your child from getting sick with all of the daycare sicknesses. It's also better for babies that small to be home. Group care is just not the best option for that age, so if you can avoid it, you should.

My wife had \\~3 months of maternity leave and I had 2 weeks of PTO that I used all up front when the babies were born. Ours were also underbaked (lol) at 37 weeks which is actually full term for twins. Our twins for the first \\~4 months were also EXTREMELY clingy and could not be put down. We we wearing them almost all hours of the day.\n\nOur original plan was to attempt to balance them between meetings and work - we thought this might be feasible since my meeting schedule is so light and my working hours are extremely flexible.\n\nTowards the end of my wife's maternity leave, we realized things were only getting harder with the twins. On days where I happen to have a few extra meetings and she does as well (nearly every day for her) we really didn't have a backup plan other than 2 screaming babies behind me on camera or me skipping meetings. \n\nSo in the final week before she went back to work, we hired a nanny who came to our house to watch the babies from 9-2. That offered us enough time to get things down and squeeze our meetings into this time window and then do any work we needed to follow up with later in the evening. Even this was not a very sustainable lifestyle as we found ourselves far too often working into the night when we were exhausted from taking care of twins most of the day. Our nanny didn't end up working out - she was unable to care for the babies as they needed a caretaker who had more energy (you can read my previous posts for more context here) so we ended up letting her go a few weeks ago and we are currently on week 3 of working while taking care of the twins. Let me tell you, it is extremely difficult. I take meetings in my airpods with screaming babies and then run out of the room to give my scrum update and then immediately after (2 min later) run back into the room to continue looking after them. I take meetings on walks. I cram as much work into their short nap windows as I possibly can. My wife and I both work late into the night to make it work. It is HARD. I would not wish it on anyone.\n\nMy wife just put in her 2 weeks notice and work and I just landed a new job that gives me a raise to cover enough of her loss in comp that we should be fine for her to just be full time SAHM for now.\n\nTLDR;\n\nMy situation is slightly different than yours - 2 WFH parents with 2 babies. But I think you also will find (especially with your heavy meeting load) that it's just not sustainable. You might make it work for a few weeks but inevitably you'll find that you can't dedicate enough effort to either work or your baby and likely both will suffer for it.\n\nMy advice would be to spend the time now (before you go back to work) finding people in your network/community/neighborhood who would be interested in nanny sharing and then find ways if possible to reduce spending in other areas of your life to free up some funds for this. It's not going to be easy. But it will likely be SO MUCH easier than trying to do everything yourself.\n\nDM me or I can put you in contact with my wife if you have any questions!",

Maybe do a trial run of trying to take care of your baby while also doing those type of tasks. Is it doable at all? I’ve found it to be really tricky but maybe you’ll have better luck. If you are able to make some progress here, you’ll be one step ahead if you decide the changes at your company aren’t something you want to deal with. Searching for a job while you have a job is better than searching when you need one.\n\nIf it isn’t doable, then I think daycare is the right call. From what I’ve heard, babies do adjust to daycare once they get into a routine, so I’m sure your little one will be ok!",

She attended three days per week and my husband WFH the other two days and took turns watching her. We worked evenings and weekends to make up for it. When she became mobile, we sent her to daycare four days per week.\n\nIt's hard to WFH with a baby. It can be done, but you're really doing both your job and your baby a disservice. Luckily we found an amazing daycare with teachers and staff we trust. Our daughter adjusted really easily - it even helped her establish a good schedule and nap in a crib! We truly consider daycare as part of our \"village.\"\n\nI hope you have an amazing remainder of maternity leave and soak up all those sweet snuggles.

While he did spend the first 3 months trying to convince us that moving from Intel/amd EC2 instances to risk v architecture was a good idea, he eventually found an infrastructure project that utilized his skills effectively. With some guidance, he managed to reduce feedback loop time for all staging code tests from 50 minutes down to 3 seconds, effectively making it possible for us to deploy fully tested code to production in hours, not days or weeks. \n\nWhile it may be hard for you to think of what the folks interviewing you might need, you should always identify projects that you would be great at.",

They won't bring in an embedded person to grill you, so don't worry about that.\n\nI'll say this though, I'm a manager, I hire people, and I do my damndest not to hire people that linger in this category:\n\n>I don’t TRULY know what’s going on from the ground up all the way to the application layer\n\nYour concern is valid. It's not that you have to have a deep understanding of every layer, top to bottom, but at least be able to sketch it out and know a little bit about what it does. It's totally normal if the parts \"far\" away from where you normally work you don't know so well. Nobody will care whether or not you can describe how CAN signaling works. You should probably at least be able to describe what it looks like when the CAN messages are delivered to you though.\n\nThis in particular is a red flag, so hopefully it's a joke:\n\n>“Tell me something about RTOS”\n\n>“Uhhhh…you have tasks and the scheduler schedules them….”\n\nYou've worked on this thing for 2 years and haven't put in the work to understand *any* part of it? An open ended question like this is really your time to shine, you get to steer the conversation. Be able to crush those kinds of questions.\n\nAnd to be clear here, you don't have to know everything about it by any stretch. But you should have at least a couple nuggets of hard-fought learning. Something you debugged or implemented where you had to go brush up a bit?\n\nYou're going to get questions about work you've done, and you want to be able to hit more or less these couple items in the response\n\n1. What problem you were trying to solve with the example you give?\n2. What did your changes build leverage from the layer below, how is the layer above going to use them?\n3. How does what you did work, to a decent level of detail?\n4. What tradeoffs are there to consider?\n5. How did you validate what you did?\n\nThink back to some tasks you've done and try to answer those questions about them. Try just writing the answers down, don't worry about how long it takes you.\n\nIf you're not able to do it, even after some time and thought, you need to start revisiting how you're trying to grow your skills as an engineer. Make sure you understand the context around stuff you are doing. Occasionally take something apart you don't understand, even if it works, just to learn it better.\n\nIf you're able to do it after taking a breath and pondering on it a bit, then you probably just need to work on your speaking skills and confidence a bit. Running through the jot it down exercise will help you there as well. If you have some willing friends, try just explaining stuff to them, and have them ask you questions about it.\n\nAnd hey, no need to despair, these are all things you can practice and improve. Most of us deal with some level of imposter syndrome too, you're not the first guy in this situation and you won't be the last. Put in the effort and you'll be just fine.\n\n  \nGood luck!",

These companies care way more about your ability to solve algorithmic problems, design systems, and write clean code than whether you can explain bit timing from memory. The embedded knowledge you do have actually gives you a solid foundation in systems thinking and low-level concepts that many general SWE candidates lack entirely.\n\nYou're probably overthinking this transition. Your embedded background demonstrates you can work with complex systems, debug tricky issues, and understand performance constraints - all valuable skills that translate well to general software development. Focus your prep time on the things that actually matter for these roles: data structures and algorithms, system design, and getting comfortable with the languages and frameworks they use. The fact that you can navigate codebases and solve problems is exactly what they're looking for, not your ability to recite protocol specifications.\n\nI'm on the team that built [AI for interviews](http://interviews.chat), and we've seen plenty of engineers successfully transition between specialties by focusing their interview prep on the core competencies that matter most for their target roles.",

        "body": "I came from defense company where i worked on a radar for 4 years. I then went into one of the companies you listed and worked in their cloud services for aobut 3 years. \n\nYour concerns are valid. \n\nI dont know how closely related my first job is to your job but here was my experience. \n\nAt defense, work life balance was a lot better. I didnt have to think about work after 5 pm. The tasks were good enough to keep me engaged but i didnt need to know anything crazy or expand my knowledge really. You could get by and not understand everything. So when you said the quote about not really understanding RTOS, i get that because i worked on things that at the time if you asked me to explain it, tbh i only knew the basic overview of it, not the ins and outs. One of my tasks was actually coding a lot of the receiver and transceiver code too lol. But i was a big overperformer even if i only did like 20 hours a week and chilled the rest. In defense, nobody really disagreed as everybody was just there to give their hours and go. We never really dealt with customers as our project wasnt fully completed. \n\nAfter 4 years i wanted to go for bigger and better and i got in the big tech company (again it's one of the ones you lsited). They wont give you an embedded engineer to ask you things but they may ask you a system design question and the question could be related to what you have experienced at your current job. So youd have to explain how the receive and transceiver work for example. When it comes to coding questions, i think praciticng leetcode and really understanding Data structures is good enough. I think the problem in the interview iwll come when they ask questions like \"tell me a time you disagreed with an older engineer/customer?\" or \"tell me a time you had to deal with an angry customer?\". Unfortunately in embedded stuff, that doesnt come up as much, especially in defense industry. I cant speak for you job but can you answer those questions?\" The vibe i get from your post is that you just do you and there isnt much pushback from either side. \n\nAlso, be careful chasing these big companies. Like i said i got into one of the cloud systems and for 3 years the work was hectic. I was doing 5x the work and it still wasnt enough for them. I got PIPd after two years and then fired half a year later. Personally the project was just a lot and they expected 60+ hour weeks but it was more like \"only do 40 \\*wink-wink\\*\". Seniors and principals were too stressed and overworked to helpout and get on calls to help jrs. Everything was a meeting. Standups would take 2 hours because they wanted to discuss something. As a mid-level i was expected to lead meetings and projects. The culture was just toxic and the thing is they can be like this because they know there's a million other people gunning for your job. During reviews you were compared to what your coworkers were doing not what was expected of you. so if you exceeded your own expectations, but all your coworkers are working 60+ hours and have 60+ hours of work to show while you only have 40 hours of work ot show, your manager will go \"why are you so behind?\" and telling them you stick to 40 hours isnt enough. Again this isnt all projects in big tech. Like i knew a guy who worked at AWS which is supposed to be the worse of all of them, but his project was very chill where he doesnt think aobut it after 5 pm. It's very project dependent. All im saying is dont just do it for the money and fame, really consider it. There's plenty of big companiees that dotn fall in that faang bucket that pay just as well. Remember our career pays very well regardless of industry. Even if you make 120k, you are making more than most careers. So dont sell your life for that 200k. Apply to these companies, but make sure it is a right fit for you. Also dont fall in love with the bonus/RSUs they will throw everything at the bonus/RSUs to get you in the door, those are not guaranteed. I didnt know this until i got there but RSUs have a long vesting period. At my last job, i didnt get it until my 1 year anniversary and even then i only got like 20% a year and it wouldnt completely vest until my 5th year.",

No, because search and ranking models are **mission critical** to most big tech companies’ core product.\n\nAre statistics and data science a bubble? Absolutely not.

Started at 75k and worked my way to about 90k (not a huge bump but defense doesnt pay that crazy). I decided to jump ship during the last hiring boom of covid. Ended up at a big tech company (one of the bigger ones) for 200k TC. I took it without even thinking. \n\nDefense - i loved my co-workers and was moving up the latter quickly. It was so chill and the work was fun and easy. I did 20 hours of work and chilled the rest of the week. I was my team's scrum master and developer and i didnt think about work after 5 pm and was a top performer. There werent any real deadlines and i could sit on a task for 2 months and nobody complained. \n\nBig tech - things got hectic quickly. I was working for their cloud service. What i didnt know is that cloud is where work life balance goes to die. At first i wanted to respet my balance and stuck to 40 hour weeks for the most part. Then it slowly got more and more hectic and since i was remote id idnt realize my coworkers were pulling 50-60 hour weeks sometimes mroe. so after a year i obviously was behind the rest and even if my work was to my standards, they compared me to my coworkers standards and i got less than average. I drank the kool aid for a year and worked like crazy. Matched the 50-60 hours but i realzied i just didnt lvoe the work but the economy was shit so i kept it going. After a year i got another bad review and a few months later fired. \n\nIm not saying dont take AWS, for the money it sounds amazing. You might have a way better experience than i did. I know someone who works for AWS, has 300k+ in TC and it's one of the easier AWS projects where people sign off at 5pm and dont think about work. They dont even have on-call.  You could land ion a project like that or you could land in a project that requires 80 hours from you in tough weeks. \n\nIm just saying sometimes the fame and fortune isnt what it lives up to be. You need to decide if you will be ok with the potential burnout. Also it's not always you will find a job with coworkers you like.",

You can make it better by fixing root causes, tuning alarms, and pushing back on what’s worth paging.\n\nWill you grind 60–80 hours a week? No. Major incidents can happen, but you can (and should) set boundaries. If you’re up half the night, escalate to your manager, hand off, and rest. That’s encouraged. I never had Slack/email on my phone if it was urgent, they paged. Otherwise, it waited.\n\nMake good use of your time, learn a ton, and enjoy the pay.

In vscode you can command click the stack trace lines in the terminal to go to that part of the code. Usually you can just click the line that is right before an external library call. But, you can also click into external library code stack lines and even edit it if you want to add print statements there.\n\nA few of the tough errors I see people get stuck on are circular imports. But, it's not hard to break those.\n\nA lot of people say to use debuggers. I usually find print statements quicker.\n\nI think it helps if you have a more experienced person that can explain the information you're missing when you get stuck.\n\nThere are some categories of errors I see people get stuck on, but that would be a lot to go over. if theres something in particular you struggle with I could maybe give advice.",

The most successful developers that I work with can understand this balance and walk the line.\n\nI own and lead the development of a trading system in the investment banking industry, and faults can easily cost hundreds of thousands or millions, yet I'm still shipping fast and not always perfect.\n\nThere's a balance to find, where I can understand the impact of different features and the way in which they might fail. I know where I can compromise on certain areas, to focus on the critical things, and deliver a product that enables the business to make money. If I have to make everything perfect before I can ship anything, my business can be losing huge amounts of money in lost opportunity. If I ship something faulty we can directly or indirectly lose money. I also know where I can push out a feature to a reduced and experienced audience to gather early and critical feedback to ensure we build the best possible thing.\n\nGetting a product released and in use is critical, so you can start getting realworld feedback on how it's performing and adjust development prioritises in response. If you take the skyscraper approach and don't deliver the final product for a long time, you don't start receiving real feedback until it might be too late or very hard to change course.",

Being expected to figure things out on your own in a small team is actually pretty common in consulting. A lot of firms put people on islands where they have to be the expert, even if they’re still learning. It’s not a bad thing but it also means you haven’t had the chance to see how larger dev teams work day to day. \n\nYour role ties with Cloud Engineer or Cloud + Automation Engineer fits well. If you want to move toward joining a dev team, you could focus more on backend development with Python frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, Django) and data tools, while still using your cloud knowledge to stand out. If you want to stay close to infrastructure, doubling down on Azure certifications and automation tools would make you stand out as a cloud engineer. If you’d rather move toward development, deepening your Python, databases, and API building skills will help.\n\nBefore you leave your job, build a clear learning plan, pick projects to show off your skills, and maybe even contribute to open source to give you the momentum you’re looking for. That way, when the market improves, you’ll be ready to land the kind of structured dev team role you’re aiming for.

This project is at a level of 3rd year undergrad student, but definitely not at a 9 YOE level.\n\nIf you're absolutely adamant about looking for a new job now, your best bet is not to bring up this project at all. Focus on your experience, and try to make that sound cool (9 years is hella impressive!). At that point, interviewers rarely care about personal projects. You'll have to learn about how best to present yourself, though.\n\nHowever, if you're not in a rush to find a new position, I'd recommend that you upskill. Try to think about as many interesting and complex features as possible that can be added to your project. The more complex it sounds, the more you'll learn from it. At the very least, learn some basic AI/LLM stuff and add it to your project. Also, your UI looks kinda bad. I get it that you're not a frontend person, but you can just use ChatGPT or whatever LLM of your choice to generate a beautiful UI for you. The first impression anyone gets about your website is from how it looks, so don't make them prejudiced against it by making it look bad.\n\nAs for the freelance - no idea, honestly, don't have any experience with that. However, that would also really depend on your sales skills, so evaluate those first.\n\nAnyways, good luck to you and all the best!",

A simple project can be explained in much more detail and still show value.\n\nWhat would you expect a 9 YOE developer to do? If I stood in front of a recruiter and tried to explain some super specialized project I worked on, I risk losing them. They might not understand it or get bored, even if it’s actually interesting. People who haven’t gone deep into a specific topic can easily dismiss it, like “You optimized a feature for 2 months? Should’ve done it right from the start!”\n\nI imagine a situation where a company is choosing between two candidates: one has a simple app that works and can be tested, the other talks about complex systems needing a special setup or ecosystem. Which sounds easier to evaluate?\n\nI get that adding AI/LLM features is seen as highly valuable these days because so many projects have some AI angle, whether needed or not. So yeah, more AI features is automatically cooler, I get it.\n\nI totally agree I need to get better at presenting myself and that the UI could definitely use improvement.\n\nI’m not in a rush to switch jobs, but somewhere I do need to start researching the market and my place in it.\n\n Thanks a lot for your honest reply.",

You just need to show you can build and ship projects, not just that you’ve taken classes. The app you’re working on is a great start. Keep working it, and add at least one or two more projects that show backend and frontend skills. A strong portfolio will make up for the lack of SWE internships.\n\nNetworking is another big piece. Stay active on LinkedIn, connect with alumni from your school who are in tech. Recruiters care more about what you can do than what your degree says. Certifications aren’t strictly necessary for SWE roles, but they can help in certain niches (like cloud for AWS or Azure certs can boost your resume if you want to show off infrastructure knowledge alongside coding). Take the job you have lined up and use it as stability while you keep building your portfolio and networking.",
