        "body": "Well, its important to remember that the Kimball and Inmon standards were developed in the 80s.  I think there’s three key trends that have happened in ensuing decades that explain the mess we’re in today:\n\nFirst and most obviously, computing has gotten exponentially more powerful. A big part of the reason people cared so much was because they literally had to. Nowadays, no one gives a crap, and if you’re a conspiracy theorist, you could even argue that medallion architecture is being perpetuated by cloud providers as a way to extract more money from their clients. \n\n**Quick edit based on some responses:** I’m definitely not saying there aren’t any positive aspects to medallion architecture and ELT supplanting ETL. But whether it’s *necessary* is a different question and one that, IMO, businesses should really think long and hard about rather than just defaulting to whatever the FAANG companies are doing or whatever the vendor’s recommendation is. Maybe I’m just old, but I can recall a time when the bronze layer lived in an FTP site (lol) and the Gold layer didn’t exist, and yet companies were still able to answer business questions and turn a profit. \n\nSecond, and somewhat related, technology just moves so fast that you’re migrating platforms every couple years, in some cases. There’s a sense that tech debt is unavoidable, and the Agile/MVP approach exacerbates this as well. So no one really cares as much about getting things right the first time, because you know you’ll have to rebuild it anyway. \n\nThird, while the concept of “data” has been democratized and de-mystified quite a bit in the ensuing four decades, the actual database part of it still has somewhat of a barrier to entry. So I think part of the issue is that “Can I get this in Excel to do my own analysis?” has become such a ubiquitous question that you can’t really say no to it, leading to a bunch of bespoke OBTs that aren’t documented particularly well, if at all. \n\nIMO modeling is still important, but it’s largely because of BI/Data Viz software adoption and not database constraints themselves anymore.",

Im being serious this is a \"pub\" kinda question that sadly I dont have collegues that share the same spark to discuss with.\n\nThis industry has evolved so fast that terms have been highly convoluted and become some what meaningless. \n\nWhen I began my career Kimball was king and the data mart with at least star schemas were the expected minimum. Largely because of the limits of what we had (relational databases with indexes). To get things to work you had to thoroughly understand the requirements, plan and model accordingly.\n\nCompute and Storage are cheaper than beer (sadly), with that has come with the more lazy approach in favour of quick (although unstable) returns. We follow agile, we don't like long winded projects and if your query doesn't work then just add more compute.\n\nWith this a generation has been bombarded with buzzword bingo. We have data lakes, lake houses, and other infrastructure terms. We also have data mesh, fabric and other strategic ideas that i always feel are more idealised than realistic. A person can only retain so much and indeed the core ideas of warehousing have disappeared. I asked someone if they would consider implementing surrogate keys, he asked me if I had made that up.\n\nIt does feel like we are re learning alot of the problems that we had in the 80s just in different guises. I feel that maybe were just old enough to notice the turn of the wheel. What was learned will be forgotten and re learned again.\n\nModelling will always be important, but modelling relies of having some key information.... like what do you actually want to achieve? What are you measuring.... I think most of this sub will admit.... actual requirements are always few and far between. Keeps us busy rebuilding stuff though lol.\n\nId love to see what the modern equivalent of erwin is?\n\nAnyway... your not alone...\n\nDo you know what would be cool.... a podcast going through the datewarehouse tool kit and data modelling!",

They don't want to talk about it because they don't have a solution to make it more productive.  So, instead of admitting that it's a hard problem and they mostly work on the easy problems, they instead just try not to talk about it.\n\nThey *should* talk about it - since it impacts performance, data quality, query functionality, usability, and operational and development complexity.   And practitioners should also talk about it for the same reason.  But this field has always been marketing-driven, and data modeling is difficult.  So, they don't talk about it like we did 25 years ago.\n\nBut that doesn't mean nobody is.  It definitely still matters when operating at scale, whether that's data volumes, performance and query response time or its the number of fields, feeds, and models.",

When I started my professional career in data, a 2-year Datawarehouse build-out project was the norm. We used to do rigorous requirements gathering (for months!), hire a multitude of skilled people to document the business processes, track down data sources and cover every inch of the enterprise reporting needs on paper. Then the laborious phase of ETL, physical data modeling, test runs, and QA will ensue. Finally some BI team would develop the static reports and before you know it, it’s already 2 years gone!\n\nNowadays, every single business comes pre-wired to collect and move streams of raw data all over the place. Costs of data storage have significantly dropped so dumping it all in into a cheap cloud storage is a no-brainer and it’s an acceptable approach. Storage and compute are now segregated so no upfront unutilized servers anymore. \n\nI guess the fundamental idea behind serving data analytics has switched from building robust, audited and reliable DW architectures to just-in-time data modeling for a quick turnaround to answer a certain business question ASAP. It also allows for incremental question-answering with the same just-in-time analytics approach instead of asking business stakeholders exactly what questions they’d need answered for next 10 years and expecting them to have an answer for you. \n\nI’d say it’s just a paradigm shift that has acceptable flaws with upside advantages that outweigh the said flaws (i.e. lack of emphasis on the traditional DW approaches we built our careers around in the past).\n\nEdit: also wanted to mention how the term “datawarehouse” has now been usurped by the vendors to mean “snowflake, redshift or GCP”. Not the Kimball or Innmon style datawarehouses we used to build. In fact, Bill Innmon (he’s in my LinkedIn network) wrote a very expressive LI post about this a year ago. Now I see even him kind of coming to terms with the fact that the old school DW as a industry and a domain is dead.",

With the advent of 'off the shelf' solutions like JDE, Peoplesoft, SAP...etc the need to design your own models fell off a cliff.  While a BI/DW model is designed differently, it was generally the people with existing OLTP model knowledge that went down this path as well.\n\n\\- As others have stated in this thread, 3NF or better modelling was a means to help squeeze the best performance out of hardware solutions.  This is not as much a concern now.\n\n  \n\\- The 'need for speed' (AGILE) has caused our industry to get lazy and not worry about design.  'Just get er done'....minimum viable product thinking which created tech debt that doesn't get addressed.

I have taken raw, messy streaming data and spoon fed these analysts with a clean model that all they have to do is write a couple joins and, like a few aggregates. 700+ storefront sites each tracking dozens of evens, to external schema, to redshift, moving through multiple transformation schemas. I left them, with a single query for their dashboard. And yet they struggle to do this and need my assistance. Fine, happy to help, but like, comparatively this is a joke. \n\nI think I wouldn’t mind this so much if I knew that I was paid significantly more than them, but it’s the opposite. I found out a while back that the analyst working on this project makes just about the same that I do. So my question is, do you ever feel under-appreciated and how do you deal with that? How would you suggest I bring up my concerns of imbalance with my manager?",

The follow-up questions are especially important because that's where the complexity will come out.\n\nYou'll need to back this up with good theory which can come from a few places\n\nFor textbooks I really like T-SQL fundementals by Itzik Ben-Gan. It's focused on SQL Server, but it covers a lot of generic SQL, and it has a really good explanation of the core concepts. Things like three-value predicate logic make a lot more sense with his explanations. I generally recommend people at least read the first chapter. I think you can find a free PDF somewhere but I just bought it on amazon (almost exactly 10 years ago!)\n\nWebsites like Leetcode CAN be good because of the ability to compare your answers to others, but it's important not to blindly trust that someone else's approach is better. If you see faster solutions, look up the techniques they are using and try to understand if it's actually an improvement or just or just a hack for that specific dataset.\n\nFor performance, Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann provides a lot of the theoretical foundation you'll need to understand how to think about queries, you'll need to supplement this with resources specific to the database you are working in.  \n\n\nFor snowflake I found some articles on [https://articles.analytics.today/](https://articles.analytics.today/) helpful.

On the stress spectrum, it’s also on the lower end. It’s also one where a lot of self-teaching is still a valid pathway forward.\n\nThere are other IT roles where the entire company is down and you’re stuck working days straight to fix it. Or security professionals, when the company is under attack 24 hours a day and everyone is looking at them to fix it and then blaming them for what happened.\n\nIn your case, I would say much of the stress is coming from layoffs, and a management that does not really understand AI and what it’s used for. Bad leadership looks at AI as a way to reduce headcount. Good leadership looks at it as a productivity tool. It should be helping to get more work done and a more streamlined, quality product.\n\nAlso, AI should not be replacing the templating and standards. That’s up to the lead to come up with and enforce.\n\nI do think AI is giving a lot of people some existential crisis issues. However, I think using it is going to be required for almost all roles. Personally, I treat just like any other tool, like a spreadsheet, or a calculator, or a web search. Not using it means I am gimping myself, so why would I fight it and try and use the old way? \n\nThe AI can’t think for itself. That’s where humans come in and will never be replaced. Someone still still needs to understand everything at the higher level, figure out what needs to be done, and glue it all together.\n\nIf it was me, I’d take a step back and take some breaths. Or take a few days off and don’t think about work. Seems like burnout and a perspective check is needed here.\n\nFinally, you mentioned you want to quit, but have you asked yourself, what are you going to replace the job with?",

This sort of behavior continues to degrade products, and Google is a great example of product degradation. Even Klarna restarted it's hiring because their jump in to AI that is still premature hurt their business operations. \n\nYou're just early in the game to realize this, but the fact is the hype will keep at it until AI matures and is productionized properly, or the next trending tech starts attracting investor capital.

It simplifies a lot of the tediousness of using DBT with Airflow (v2.9). It is easy to generate your DBT assets and those can be linked with your other dagster assets.\n\nThe main difference is the paradigm. Dagster does not have jobs/tasks at the forefront. Jobs are a process to group functional assets together i.e. you have 1 ingestion process and 3 DBT models to generate your analytics table and you can ran all of them at once, on schedule.   \n\n\nDagster uses data assets at the forefront, which are what the name suggests, your data as an asset. You do not think of the process of creating the data as you think of the final data product. \n\nI ike the lineage feature, which allows you to see how all your assets are interconnected. You can define a job with a schedule for any cut of your lineage graph.\n\nDagster is also more pythonic than Airflow. You use python's best practices when writing your processes.\n\nTesting is much simpler with the integrated 'dagster dev' command which quickly spins up a local instance for you to test your pipelines. \n\nCan write a lot more about the difference but I am at work now :-D.\n\nTo conclude, both are good tools (haven't tried Airflow v3+) but for different needs. Dagster is better for companies where data lineage is vital, whereas Airflow is better for automation of tasks.   \nData pipelines are good in both (however, in dagster it gets tedious to integrate a random pipeline with the rest of your asset lineage)",

I am not a big graphdb person so I don't know, but have built semantic models the other way and had mixed results with AI.\n\nIn the end though the challenge for me was more about semantics and synonyms than anything else.  In a business people say the same thing 10 different ways and it's often hard for the LLM to interpret what they mean, especially in the context of your business.  I found we needed synonyms not only for tables and columns but for values as well and sometimes the context that was relevant to the answer was who asked the question.  I could make it work if you ask it things in exactly the right way, but that's not the point of a conversational tool like an LLM.",

I would be very intentional about looking for roles that are tailored to candidates with non-traditional backgrounds (emphasis on *tailored to*, not *open to*) because you have the foundation to be competitive for those roles. I don't think winning the competition alone is going to help you without a strong portfolio of other projects, but it would make for good essay/statement of interest material to describe why you're looking for a career pivot.\n\nIn my experience, unless they've already made the job description with an existing candidate in mind, colleges and universities are good places to start. They aren't super fixated on production-level experience, usually have some super passionate people, and chill workloads. You could start by looking for jobs at local colleges or something like HigherEd Jobs. \n\nBest of luck!",

One task that extracts, one that loads and one that transforms. Of course this is highly dependent and it helps to be pragmatic. In some instances you'll need to break these patterns. For example when we need seperate retries, resources or parallelism.\n\nFor example:\n- Task one: triggers a lambda to extracts data from an API & stores in S3\n- Task two: lambda that fetches the file from S3 & loads it into a Snowflake table.\n- Task Three: Python operator within Airflow that triggers dbt run (could also have this in a lambda).\n\nThen on the topic of passing data between tasks. Using the above example, passing the s3 uri from task one to task two would be a great use of xcom. Here, we're mainly passing metadata (row counts, S3 keys, schema versions, URLs, run decisions).\n\nWe'll typically want to use object storage for larger payloads (CSVs, json, etc).",

All it takes is a single command to add a column to a table, it’s really not hard, especially with the small volumes you are working with. And there are tools like Alembic which someone’s already mentioned to help you version, test and deploy these sorts of changes easily and reliably.\n\nSo “my Data is going to change and evolve” is really not a good reason to use a document store like mongo.\n\nThe use case for a document store is really when your data is literally arbitrary. By this I mean that it will be completely different from one document to the next. And there’s no particular reason to expect any record to overlap with any other.\n\nEven if there is a subset of your data which really does fit this description, you can still allow for it in Postgres with the use of the jsonb column type which others have mentioned.\n\nBut from what you’ve described, your data probably is very similar and predictable from one record to the next. All the personnel are presumably going to have names and IDs and other common properties. In this context, you are giving up a lot by using a document store, such as the ability to reliably query the data, to enforce rules that maintain quality and integrity, and to optimise for certain use cases. These things will likely cause you pain down the track that is much worse than what you think you’re avoiding by not having to worry about schema evolution.",

The risk is you could become redundant. The opportunity is for you to grow and do more or different things with your time.\n\nFor your company, the calculus is different. For them, there is tremendous risk in depending on you. If you leave, fall sick, get bored with your job, they are up the creek. The more you resist bringing in a vendor, the higher their risk and the harder they will try to eventually backfill or replace you. There is also the question of output.

I've seen people called a Sr DE with 2 years of experience as a DE, Ive seen someone called a Lead DE because they moved from a Lead DBA role to their first DE role. I know a person in consulting who is just a DE and has been a DE or SWE for 15 years. He is far better at coding that I am, and makes more money, but doesn't have the same level of title as others with far less skills. \n\nMyself, I spent my first year writing code, building pipelines, fixing bugs and closing tickets. Then everything changed and I am now running teams of implementation partners to build out enterprise projects. Nowadays, the only coding I do is to review PRs. I draw up architecture, work cross functionally with other teams to solution things, and tell my teams what all needs to be done with some guidance on how to do it. Someone else at a different company would need to work 10 years before being trusted to do what I do now. My job title will change to Sr DE next year per my manager. And I'll have 2 years of DE experience at that point, and a year of that is barely technical. \n\nFor a standard 3rd year DE, if one even exists, I would start to expect a little more autonomy. Learn to make decisions. Start figuring out and proposing architecture. Start mentoring younger DEs and try to lead some small projects if you aren't already. By this point, you shouldn't need to be told what to do on a project, you should be able to identify what needs to be done, and work to implement it. A big thing is that you should probably at least start working with other teams on cross functional projects. Begin thinking about business value of various projects. \n\nI learned, albeit slowly, that maintaining collaborative relationships with other teams is vastly more valuable than transactional relationships. They are more complicated to manage, but it is the only approach I've seen work to actually get things done. Churning out tickets and bug fixes is a good way to inflate your performance numbers, but it rarely amounts to career growth or any of the stuff you work on actually being used by the business as a whole.",

Many folks on this sub will tell you that DE isn't an entry-level position, so you must have done something right to get your foot in the door.\n\nRegarding your question, it's smart to focus on the fundamentals. It’s easy to get lost in the sea of specific \"data engineering\" tools, but they all build on a few core IT concepts. My advice would be to focus on these areas for the next six months.\n\n1. The first thing I'd focus on is the programming basics. Since you're using Python, I would go deep on that. Don't just learn syntax, but really try to grasp the fundamentals so you can solve problems with it. Do a few mini-projects in pure Python to make the concepts stick. This will be your foundation for everything else.\n\n2. Next, you need to become very comfortable with SQL. It’s the language of data, and you'll be using it constantly. Understand what it is, get the basic syntax down, and then really practice with it. Microsoft has some great sample datasets like AdventureWorks that are perfect for learning things like joins and aggregations.\n\n3. While you're learning those, the third crucial piece is Git. It doesn't matter if your company uses GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket; the principles are the same. You absolutely need to understand the basic workflow of making a branch, committing your changes, and merging them. It's how all modern tech teams collaborate. As a bonus, look into what a simple CI/CD pipeline does, maybe with something like GitHub Actions.\n\n4. Finally, try to get a basic understanding of one cloud provider. It doesn’t matter which one—AWS, Azure, or GCP. I'd probably stick with AWS since it’s the most common right now. You don't need to be an expert, but learn the core concepts. Studying for one of the associate-level certifications is a great way to get a structured overview.\n\nIf you can get a good handle on these things by your sixth month, you'll have the solid IT foundation you need for this role. Only then would I start worrying about the more advanced, specific DE concepts. Everything will make much more sense once you have these basics down.",

Separately, you can research whatever systems your team is using and break down by categories:\n\n1. SQL: Learn how to write SQL queries (use documentation for whatever language you're using and look up videos for that specific langauge).\n2. Database structures: Whether you're using on premise servers or cloud services, look up documentation for those platforms and look at some videos to get an overview of how they store and process data.\n3. Pipelines and job scheduling: Learn about which service(s) are used to create data pipelines and schedule jobs and how they work.\n4. Version control: Learn about the codebase you're working in, what coding standards they have (rules for writing sql queries, DDL, DML, dags, etc....) and how to use github and your IDE (probably VScode).\n\nI would start by learning what's most relevant to your day to day work and then learn more about each area as you go. You will also need to understand what the modeling and data in your pipelines represent. Being able to explain data to the business is equally important to technical knowledge of how to store and manage data.",

Not JSONL, JSON. \n\nI used Claude to write a bunch of Rust to do streaming JSON parsing, then stream it out to parquet so I can process in bigquery. I would not have been able to write that code in Rust myself. I'm a very experienced software engineer, but I had written maybe 10 lines of Rust in my life. But with Claude's help its really very nice.\n\nThe key to getting good quality code out of Claude is not that different from getting good code out of people:\n- unit tests\n- automated linting\n- manually specify function type signatures where it matters\n- have Claude run the tests and the linter after every change, and then have it fix all the problems it finds.\n- actually read the resulting code, make sure it makes sense, and make Claude refactor where it gets messy.\n\nIn the end it worked great, and the code was very readable. \nThis was very exciting because using a conventional JSON parser in the conventional way was just not going to work at all.\n\nBut it was a little slow. I told Claude to optimize for performance. It came up with about 10 recommendations. I told it to implement the top 6 that I thought would make a big difference. It implemented those optimizations, made all the tests pass, and the resulting program was an order of magnitude faster.\n\nIt could easily have taken me a month to do all this by hand.",

My guess is spark looked at the code submitted and calculated that it's more efficient to run it with a smaller number of workers rather than scaling out (maybe because the data isnt huge so it's faster to do it all on one node?). Spark may be wrong about this since you're using gzip files so maybe try converting/saving to parquet first and then running your data processing on the parquet files and see what happens. Gzip typically takes more time to decompress so breaking the job into two parts (decompressing in part 1 and transforming data in part 2) could help triage the issue better. Do you see performance gains when using more nodes? \n\nUDFs typically aren't great for performance, what does the UDF do specifically? I've found the built in functions are pretty good at doing what you want if you're a little creative, plus they're going to be faster. Also if you're using >30 withColumn statements that could be slowing down performance a bit since i believe each one makes spark recalculate the logical plan, so you could try using withColumns instead.",

It supports both comma/semicolon/tab/etc separated files and files with fixed width columns.\n\nThe plugin can automatically detect the columns and datatypes, and after that you can do several thing with the data. Like sort, select/rearrange columns, count unique values, validate the data etc. The data validation can check for technical errors, like text value too long, incorrect datetime/decimal formats, date out of range, missing quotes, incorrect coded values etc.",

Sit down with key business people and find the most important questions they want answering.\n\nThen, find what data sources you'll need to answer those questions. In the beginning, this is typically financial reporting / sales related. How much money are we making, etc.\n\n2. Focus on delivering these core information sets at first, before doing ANYTHING more fancy. Give the business the ability to answer their super basic, but essential questions.\n\n3. Data stack:\n\nAzure is fine, but i'd personally reccomend AWS or GCP.\n\nSimilar with Databricks - it's fine and will work, but they specialise in data science, you're probably better off with BigQuery or Snowflake if the focus is analytics.\n\nI'd avoid PowerBI and use Tableau. Or, if you can afford it, Looker.\n\nOpen source tooling is great. I'd highly reccomend dbt for the data transformation layer. And airflow for orchestration.\n\nData ingestion, as you've mentioned, as a one person  team. managed pipelines are a good place to start: airbyte, fivetran or stitch. Just be conscious of costs here as they can rack up, versus custom implementations (using lambdas, ECS etc).\n\nFeel free to dm me any questions!",

You can maybe orchestrate some in Airflow but actually nope, on-prem is behind firewall with local connectivity and limited egress only, no inbound connection for security and it cannot be exposed to a cloud based Airflow instance due to security team demands.

There was an implementation Arrow2 which I found more ergonomic than Arrow-RS initially, which is now forked into Polars-Arrow and backs the Polars project in Rust. However, that merged work into Arrow-RS, and I hear the team invested time learning from the earlier mistakes.\n\nIn both cases, without going too far down the rabbit hole - both implementations use a Rust concept dynamic dispatch, which makes typing in the IDE disappear, and Rust type downcasting to be required, which personally, I find awkward to use. This also blocks some automatic compiler optimisations that can automatically inline more aggressively for a faster build. The result is once you get up to a top level library like Polars, there are many layers of objects between the object you are working with and the actual data backing it. \n\nOnce you are in Python, I found this really doesn't matter - it's like water into wine.\n\nHowever, in **Arrow-RS** (for numerical data) Rust looks like:\n\n1. **Raw allocation** (heap bytes)\n2. `Arc<Bytes>` (ref-counted ownership of allocation)\n3. `Buffer` (view over the bytes)\n4. `ArrayData` (ties buffers, length, datatype, nulls)\n5. `PrimitiveArray<T>` (typed wrapper, implements `Array`)\n6. `ArrayRef = Arc<dyn Array>` (trait object used in generic contexts)\n\nSo, you constantly need to downcast from ArrayRef just to get typed data, even though you built all the layers.\n\nIn **Minarrow**, you also have layers, but they are, in my opinion, more straightforward:\n\n1. **Vec64 / Buffer** \\- Plays like a normal Rust vector. You can use it like one\n2. **Typed Buffers**: IntegerArray, FloatArray, etc.\n3. **NumericArray:** Enum, with accessors, e.g., 'myarr.i64()'\n4. **Array**: Enum, with accessors e.g., 'myarr.num().i64()'\n\nThe result is they are composable - you opt-up to the level of abstraction you want and need, rather than being locked behind an opaque object. In Rust, this is particularly helpful, as when building libraries and functions, it means their signatures can be compatible with more use cases, but I'm digressing here.\n\nThe point is that it was enough that I went and rebuilt my own implementation, as I need it for other projects and didn't like wrestling with the system as the underlying data foundation. \n\nRegardless, Arrow is brilliant and it's incredible what the team has achieved.",

Well, what if this is a new cost element that's being carved out of an existing cost element?  If you ignore this fab_cost you're ignoring some of your cost - and your totals will no longer be accurate.\n\nSo, *guessing* about schema evolution is just sloppy work for most production systems.

Total data size <50 gb 🫠 Still working on sql server with minimal modernization and still rabidly resistant to change after seeing how easy it is in the likes of BQ/Databricks/Superset\n\nTurns out the IT execs had yearly “business trips” to Asia and other exotic places where their contractors employed over 200 people at top of market rates and indicated there were a lot of such personal benefits they would lose if things suddenly became easier.\n\nUntil much of worlds companies don’t directly make money from computer tech and the bare minimum is “good enough” , it doesn’t matter what cool interface you build, they’re just going to buy from the guys that pay for business class seats and 7 star team dinners.",

Depending on the setup this can be done using OPC-UA for most SCADA systems.  I've seen in Pharma before that most manufacturing has a gateway so you can pull off the gateway instead which aggregates several PLCs/machines to pull from a common point.  Most of that data is pushed to a pub/sub like Kafka or some other MQ. The schema for each step in most manufacturing processes is based on how the cards are programmed on the PLC. Since message queuing systems can handle schema evolution, you can usually combine this with a schema registry so you can see the steps and versions.  Now getting it into a structure built for OLAP is not the easiest.  There might be controls engineers that already have a common data model for reporting on just the OT.  This is needed to understand signals, etc.  They might also have a digital twin which represents a virtual system so you can begin modeling yourself. There are decent articles discussing OT/IT convergence but there is no silver bullet ( https://iot-analytics.com/it-ot-convergence-27-themes-define-future-of-industrial-integration/). If the schema isn't defined anywhere, there are tools like Apache Flink that can use schema inference, however you are still going to need to figure out the model so you know what step stage relates to what schema and how keys (columns) are related to each other.  It takes some work but again there is an automation and controls engineer that has to have that somewhere.",

It’s like the opposite of sales lol.\n\nThe software is often just a means to get the manufacturing equipment to work. The engineers in OT are more operational focused and have a different set of responsibilities. They are also very busy most of the time and want to get things working and keep them working. There is typically no laboratory setup where they can isolate data and services out for stuff like analytics.\n\nAlso, manufacturing is usually a low margin business, so there’s not a lot of spare change there for new initiatives which take time to show value.\n\nGood news is, overall I have been seeing lots of push over the past 5 years for more integration of OT with IT, as the link you provided shows. I think this started in security as OT has been a vulnerable gateway into IT, since it’s not been hardened from a security standpoint. Example, there’s a ton of pressure to not touch anything for simple stuff like firewall or patches when the greater risk is perceived as bringing a production line down.\n\nHopefully some of the success stories start getting more visibility over time and we can learn from examples of where value is created from integrating OT data where everyone can access it and use it to improve the company overall.\n\nOne tip is see if there are any relationships built in your group with the OT group. Usually I’ve found this less of a technology issue but more of a perception and priorities issue.",

Kstreams btw was based on samza, if your interested in the academics. The one thing that does distinguish it, is that it doesn't require a cluster, i.e. it's completely self contained. Which is cool, but it's not with out it's pay offs.\n\n\nSelf hosting the clustered stream processors is complex, but there is a lot of very good managed version out there, which drastically reduce the complexity. If you just want to test locally and get some exposure, flink has a in process cluster that autostart etc is very straightforward. Pretty much just f5 from your IDE.\n\n\nEdit: I use the java version of flink, but their python looks good based on the docs. However, I went down the same rabbit hole as you some time ago, and the reality is alot of these tools are java native, so python is a second class citizen. ",

We also took part in **MWC Barcelona in both 2023 and 2024,** and while it is a massive event, it offered solid technical content around AI, IoT and digital transformation with live demos and case studies.\n\nFor developer-focused tracks, **Berlin Buzzwords** is a good choice if you’re into data engineering and search technologies, and the **Data Innovation Summit in Stockholm** usually brings very practical case studies. Since you mentioned **apidays in London**, that one is definitely worth checking out too because it covers APIs and AI with a good balance of technical content and ecosystem discussions.",

Instead of only handling redaction at the dashboard/report level, I’m trying to enforce field-level visibility dynamically at runtime as data moves between pipeline stages (e.g., from an ingestion job → enrichment → analytics).\n\nFor example, I might want:\n\n* Stage 1 (raw ingestion) to see full PII\n* Stage 2 (transform) to only see masked or tokenized fields\n* Stage 3 (analytics or inference) to selectively rehydrate fields based on role or policy\n\nSo it’s a more granular form of policy-based access control during the transformation phase not just reporting. Quicksight-level controls are useful at the end of the pipeline, but I’m trying to catch privacy risks earlier in-flight, while still supporting rehydration for authorized consumers.\n\nHave you seen any approaches like this upstream of the BI layer?",

For some like Salesforce it's easy as they publish their model and your CRM team get to add custom fields. You can then pull a source entity such as Customer or Case into your data platform. Other tools like Siebel will have 5,000 tables of which 100 will contain domain data, each of those tables will have 100 of columns so the task here is the identify which tables and columns are relevant - depending on how the system is configured. The final example is Success Factors, here they expose data through reports and APIs. The internal schema is their IP and not shared, but you can find out from the API spec or report engine what you can extract. \n\nMy last 2 projects has kept data for ingestion close to the source with an initial seed load and then the delta loads.  After that we current have a raw data vault which is essentially facts and type 2 history tables. Then we have the business consumption layer which applies any business logic that allows the BI team to create their dashboard. \n\nIf I had asked you to do this then I would not want a generic schema for source but details of what I can get from the source system as raw maintaining their schema. Then its the best way to manage a staging environment that manages the history. \n\nIf you have a number of the source schema ready then it's best to clarify what your manager's expectations are. \n\nWhat is your environment ?",

Or can I just, lets say, write a json to represent the order and send it directly to the pipeline, keeping the production schema only with `customers` and `products` tables? Would that be too far from what actually happens in real scenarios? I'm afraid I may be oversimplifying things.\n\nI'm guessing that, in the \"real world\", an e-commerce needs to write the customer orders first in its production database to keep track of stuff similar to what I described in the last paragraph of my post. Should I take that into account for my project? If yes, for how long the data is kept in production? After an order is considered *closed*, can it be instantly deleted from the database to live only in the warehouse?",

Much more memory efficient, and the API is much nicer to work with. Read the Polars user guide, but maybe start this part first: https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/migration/pandas/\n\nPS: Don't depend on external software, if possible.

Ship fast where the blast radius is small, slow down where correctness matters.\n* Invest in tooling mastery. Know your editor, shell, OS, browser devtools, and typing. The compounding payback is huge.\n* If you cannot explain why something is hard, it is probably incidental complexity. Remove that first.\n* Fix bugs by establishing invariants one layer deeper instead of sprinkling checks in leaf code.\n* Use history to debug. Read the commits, narrow the regression window, and run git bisect when the shape fits.\n* Bias toward shipping to get real feedback. Use pragmatic shortcuts like asserts on invariants, deferring DTOs, and skipping trivial tests when risk is low.\n* Make debugging cheap. Seed data easily, add local tracing, keep a scratch REPL file, enable frontend debug toggles, dump full state with diffs, and add helpers to jump the UI into target states.\n* On a team, ask questions early. Do the five minute search first, then get unblocked fast.\n* Protect shipping cadence. Aim for quick deploys, low bug rates, fast cross-team handoffs, reusable patterns, and lean process. Cut the 10 percent of a feature that eats 50 percent of the time. \n* Treat slow shipping as a problem to root cause.\n* Learn to code review. a code review is an invitation for feedback and to get another pair of eyes on your work. To catch issues before it goes to QA.",

One of the best languages to learn pointers.  C-lang by 95.  \nHtml, while not a language a couple years later with css \nJava and Javascript.  Some xml later and c++.  Little later, obj-c, this was all prior to 2011 when I grew to hate it all.\n\nGuitar. Started in the summer of 88.  Piano not long after that.  Drums in the early 2000s.  It's still my favorite instrument.  Can do a bass but never had the finger strength.  Spent many years off and on teaching music.\n\n1st time at college in fall 96 started algebra 1 and 2, then moved up to trigonometry and geometry.  Never got to Calc summer of 98 and beyond was bad for many years.  Still absolutely adore physics and cosmology. On regret is never picking up chemistry\n\nLinguistics major now focusing on teaching english as a 2nd language or foreign language. Started Spanish in 2004 in Atlanta while working tree service \n\nPicked up Chinese in the fall and spring semester last year\n\nThe summer project was revamped for the entire 2018 cryengine for kingdom come deliverance.  Ripped out all inverse kinetics animation bullshit.  Reverse engineered the entire crisis 2 physics systems with ragdolls, recoil, and hut reactions.  Warhorse had ripped out a good 97 to 98% of the system. That is all xml and lua tagged into a full c++ engine.  Near total overhaul.  Nothing like the original game.\n\nI also enjoy modding other games on the nexus.  Full overhauls for several games now and a couple more deleted. \n\nSome of my hardest programming challenges I have solved in my brain whole I sleep.  Can literally see the code roll past, and when I get up in the morning shit gets to work pretty quick.\n\nAfter a while, you start to think in other languages\n\nI have had this happen with music, programming, and Chinese \n\nIt is awesome \n\nStill can't get hired in the gaming industry.  Tried for more than 20 years.  I ran a mud for 15 years.  Rewrote the entire thing.  Went from 90kb to 8mb to 6mb depending on what year it was. Had hard-core.  Skill based with 20 classes in by 2000. ended with a full random equipment generator and 1000+ skills spells and abilities and a full in game quest and quest reward system by 2003.  Oh, and a planet and elemental system.  And a complete random event system by 2005\n\nBut ya know to this day, because I don't have a degree \n  I don't have any experience getting into the industry .

So is reading introductory material that's nonspecific, verbose, and has no immediate connection to something you actually care about. What you can do is make the process more interactive, provide faster feedback, and tailor it to your attention span.\n\nInstead of thinking about \"all the cool stuff\", pick one item from the list. Just one, ideally the most exciting one. Then try to make that, and only that. It will probably be way too big and difficult, which is why you need experience building smaller things first. But you don't need these smaller things to be completely unrelated to your project, which is however what you'll get by following standard tutorials.\n\nNo one dreams of making \"hello world\", but even something incredibly complex can be turned into something simple by removing almost all of the details first. That way, what's left will be directly related to the eventual end result and you can see, in your mind, the next steps that will get you closer to the \"real thing\".\n\nEven if you never get there, the process is inherently motivating. You may find that you know exactly what to do, but not how exactly it could be done. That's good, because now you're intrinsically motivated to learn. You need to find out and understand what you don't in order to get further, and you'll automatically know what to ignore (because it doesn't help you go in this direction).\n\nIf you need specific examples, feel free to elaborate on your project ideas. But don't try to follow popular guidance if it isn't working. Most teachers, and the learning resources they create, are bad and won't work for a large proportion of students. There's no universal solution and no replacement for intrinsic motivation. If learning isn't fun on a regular basis, you'll struggle and not everyone can just \"power through\" until it \"gets fun\". That's not a failure, just a mismatch in strategy.\n\nThe good news is that the beginning is by far the most difficult part of learning programming. Once you've attained some level of mastery, motivation comes much easier since being good at something is inherently rewarding.",

        "body": "Programming languages are called \"languages\" kind of like an analogy to human languages, but it's not really a good analogy. With a human language, if you know it well, then you can really express ANY IDEA AT ALL with finesse and comprehensibility. But with programming languages it's not really that way at all. Although formally programming languages that are \"Turing complete\" can be used to express any program, in actual practice, some tasks/types of programs are definitely way easier in some languages than others. \n\nProgramming languages are tools, more like a hammer and a saw. You need to know how to use both of those, based on what task you are going to do. Also there are many types of hammer, many times of saw, just like there are many flavors of some programming languages that resemble each other. When you're first learning, you should learn to use an easy-to-use one, a safe one, etc. Later on, you can learn to use more powerful tools, more specialized tools.\n\nIt is the same in programming, except the tools change frequently and depend a lot on in what domain you are working.\n\nIn Web development for example you're likely to use a lot of JavaScript. In other domains JS is making headway with Node.js but to me it's still not used as much. The other languages you mentioned (PHP, SQL) are that way as well. Most people don't consider HTML a programming language because you can't write a loop, there's no real control flow, etc. It is possible to \"modularize\" HTML though, so there's that. Nowadays though it seems like most people prefer to generate HTML rather than to code it by hand.\n\nAlso SQL is a very specialized language used to query a database. For example, what would \"hello world\" look like in SQL? Can you make a command-line app in SQL? Maybe it's technically possible, but I would not want to maintain such code if you gave it to me. I would much rather maintain the Python version of such a tool.",

Calling another machine code program is as simple as asking the CPU to jump to the address of that program. Of course you need to know that address, but that's what the operating system helps with.\n\nBut the programs (or the compilers that compiled them) still has to agree on a \"calling convention\", like how are arguments transferred to functions. They can for instance be stored in specific registers in the CPU, and then the return value is expected to be in a certain register. Or maybe a single register stores a pointer to the list of arguments, and then the function itself has to extract them from that memory location.\n\nLook into \"calling conventions\" if you want to learn more, and maybe take a look at [https://godbolt.org/](https://godbolt.org/) and analyze how a C program gets converted to machine code - but be warned, it isn't simple :)",

This is a primary reason for CSV, XML, JSON, and other data formats. Most languages can read and write any file format, these days (that was less true 50 years ago.)\n\n\nIf a running program written in one language invokes a function written in another language, the caller has to set up the stack frame in the way that's expected by the function being called. Different languages have different calling conventions.\n\n\nAnd when information is transferred over a network, that has its own problems. Often it's done with a text based format like JSON, but Protobufs are designed for the purpose. In the olden days, Sun invented XDR (eXternal Data Representation) and SunRPC, which did much the same thing but a lot less efficiently.\n\n\nIn general we call this problem Serialization and Deserialization, and solutions to the problem have been introduced constantly for decades.",

Whatever underlying mechanism C uses to open a file, Python has that feature too.\n\nYes, it's possible to have a language that doesn't have any features to open a file which means you're stuck unless you want to figure how to do it which might require rewriting parts of the compiler (or interpreter) for the language.\n\nSomeone pointed out that Python can make foreign function calls to C. Python's weakness is that it's interpreted. Compared to languages like C, this makes it slow. You would think this would make Python and unlikely choice for doing math (which is computationally intensive), but because Python has this foreign function call specifically to C, then you can implement these numerical calculations in C, but let it be called like a standard Python library.\n\nBut it's because Python has that feature built in. It doesn't have (as far as I know) a foreign function interface to, say, Erlang or Java.\n\nIn general, languages don't have the capability to talk to each other directly.\n\nSomeone pointed out that there is the front end (the browser side) and a back end (the server side), and that this is a way that two languages communicate. This is done indirectly, at least, if you're talking about a web browser.\n\nA front end is going to send a HTTP request which is a protocol to send information to a server. The server responds with that protocol. This means whatever language that front end is written in (Javascript is most common) has to eventually send an HTTP request. The back end needs to decode that request and then run some code in whatever language (there are numerous backend languages) then translate that to a response back to the client end.\n\nTwo languages interact through HTTP, a protocol both sides understand. It's a little like someone who speaks Mandarin talking to someone who speaks Hindi by both speaking in English.\n\nOne reason this happens is the front and back end are on separate machines with separate memory, so this requires some connection, namely, the Internet, and some way to communicate across this connection (HTTP which runs on top of TCP/IP).\n\nWith Python calling a C function through a foreign language interface, then you're running code in the same memory space together. Again, it's a bit uncommon.\n\nYou could have two languages communicate via a socket, which can be done via the same file system or via the Internet. You could invent a protocol to do this, but it wouldn't involve one language making a direct call in the other language, unless that was built into the language itself.\n\nBeginners often think languages talking to one another is cool and that it happens all the time, but it's not the way most people think.",

You can compile an OS, and you can also compile a compiler, but you have to have an existing compiler to do this. So there's a *historical* question of where these compilers came from. And the basic answer is that if you were starting from absolutely nothing, you would have to work your way up from very simple compilers/assemblers, and use those to compile more complex ones.\n\nFor instance, you start out with a system that has no assembler at all. It only understands raw binary machine code, fed to it using some input method. This might be a paper tape reader, or a punched card reader, or toggle switches that let you manually enter data one bit/byte at a time.\n\nThen you write an assembler in machine code, and feed it to the computer. Now you can write programs in assembly code instead of machine code. Then you can write a C compiler in assembly language. And so on.\n\nOnce you have a C compiler, you can rewrite that compiler in C instead of assembly, so that it's easier to maintain. And then it can compile new versions of itself. This is called [\"self-hosting\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_%28compilers%29).\n\nBut remember, this is a *historical* account of how programming languages were \"bootstrapped\" over the last 70 years or so. Once you have a self-hosting compiler, you no longer need all of the previous layers of bootstrapping.",

It's what the CPU understands, by definition.\n\nGenerally the process goes something like this:\n\n1. You write source code: C, C++, Rust, Java, C#, Python, whatever.\n2. The frontend translates it into some machine oriented but still cross platform instruction set. It's usually called bytecode or intermediate representation or pcode or something like that.\n3. The backend eats the intermediate code and gives actual CPU instructions for your hardware.\n\nIntroductory programming classes love to obsess over whether a language is \"compiled\" or \"interpreted\" but there hasn't been a difference for decades, if there ever was. People just say it's \"interpreted\" if the whole 3 step process normally happens at runtime. It's all going to machine language through some intermediate regardless.\n\nA lot of code expects to be executed in the presence of an operating system which is kind of hard to depend on if you're writing the OS in the first place. So we may have to talk about \"free-standing\" versus \"hosted\" environments if we want to make our operating system, and yes, we're more likely to talk about that in the context of a language like C that's widely used both ways and even enshrines the difference in its specification.\n\nBut the real reason C and C++ (and increasingly Rust) are used for OS development is that they give you tight control over how you use memory, and there's a well established tradition of actually using that control to do things people don't typically expect to lean on other languages for. You can grab at arbitrary bytes of memory through pointers and do things that might be \"undefined\" i.e. specific to your hardware and your compiler. A lot of other languages expect that some kind of runtime environment is running under the hood, maybe including a garbage collector that cleans up memory for you, so it's more like the language tries to bring along all this infrastructure that you might want to implement yourself or do without.\n\nAlso you've got to keep in mind that there are many different levels of writing an OS. There's the kernel which can be complicated in its own right. Then there can be lots of drivers, utilities, shells, and built-in apps. A lot of the \"OS\" might be more or less just normal application code running in a hosted environment. That stuff can be written in anything, so a whole OS is not necessarily written in just one language. For example, Google did a huge project to try to start writing more of Android in Java, Kotlin, and Rust a while back, though there is still a lot of C and C++ in it. IIRC Android 13 was the first version to be less than 50% C and C++. (Edit: They were less than 50% in [new code](https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/memory-safe-languages-in-android-13.html?m=1) that version.)\n\nThe point is it's all machine code in the end. The only question is if the language is accustomed to letting you do practically everything the machine code will allow, or whether you would be fighting the language's built-in assumptions to implement the OS's most basic functionality for yourself.",

Computer hardware and software is largely designed as a big old stack of layers, and understanding roughly what they are will help you understand things tremendously.\n\nIn this case, the bit you are missing is that a computer program, once compiled, is already machine code. You write a program as a text file, the format of which is the C programming language. A special program, a C compiler, takes in this text file as input and outputs a file that contains the machine code that is equivalent to what you wrote.\n\nWhen you tell the operating system to run the program, it reads the file and puts the machine code section of it somewhere in memory, then points the CPU to that spot in memory and says \"run the machine code at this address.\" The computer hardware, which knows how to run machine code, takes it from there.\n\nThe operating system itself works the same way. You write the operating system as a C program. A C compiler compiles the operating system into machine code. That machine code gets shoved into the spot where the hardware expects the operating system to be (let's ignore how that works for the moment), and so when the computer starts, it finds some machine code and runs it.\n\nEven the C compiler works the same way! You write the compiler in C, then you turn it into machine code by running it through an existing C compiler, and now you have a nice new C compiler. You may ask \"well, where did the first C compiler come from, then?\" and that would be a great question.

This is not true for C++, but it's not that difficult to replace the portions of the language grammar that are linked to to the standard library (eg, the *new* keyword).\n\nIt is entirely possible to implement some of the C standard library functions in format that is suitable for use in kernel space.

Something down the line needs to be written in machine code so that the computer can understand everything else that we write in human code, right?\n\nThe C programming language was designed to allow the Unix operating system to be easily ported to many different machine architectures. Unix Version 7 was the first version of Unix that was easily portable. It was ported from PDP-11 to Motorola 68K, x86, VAX, and more. Approximately 98% of the operating system kernel was written in C, the remaining 2% was platform specific assembly.

B is a stripped down and modified version of BCPL.\n\nThe first C compiler was written in B. Eventually, it became self hosting such that a C compiler written in B could produce a C compiler which could compile itself, producing a C compiler written in C.\n\nThe first B compiler was written in TMG, and the first TMG compiler was hand assembled using the TMG compiler specification. In other words, that compiler was written in assembly, but it was written in such a way as if it had compiled itself.\n\n>Is there something beneath that? The BIOS?

It's usually specific to a particular motherboard and has the ultimate objective of finding and loading an operating system bootloader. BIOS has been depreciated in favor of UEFI. All modern operating systems generally shutdown firmware services and make little use of them, preferring their own drivers instead.\n\n>Or are these fundamental softwares written in high-level languages on an already functioning computer and then compiled down to machine code which gets installed on a new computer?\n\nC code that is compiled as a part of an operating system kernel and C code that is compiled as a part of a userspace application are no different. instructions are instructions.",

They exist to manage hardware and memory resources and provide them to running programs that they organize into processes and threads. A system call is when a hosted program asks the OS for something the OS has sole control over like access to the file system, a network peripheral, or the display. If you want to write an OS, part of what you’re doing is creating that management layer and providing entry points to ask for access.\n\nOn machine code. If you want to know what that really is, it’s a combination of an operation code and operands. The operation code is a number representing an operation like add or and or left shift or in complex instruction sets like x86 things like moving memory around. The operands can be the numbers of temp storage registers, a memory address, or a literal number. These enter a circular buffer of registers in the cpu and feed physical mux (input selector) components that route the operation to the appropriate physical hardware and open the correct operand supplier gates so it processes the right data. It’s more complicated than that. Look up stuff like branch predictors and the Tomasulo algorithm for examples of doing multiple things at the same time and simulating in order execution. But, machine code contains the literal control switch positions to run the cpu hardware for a given clock cycle or two. It’s the only thing the cpu actually understands.\n\nAlso, if you would like to viscerally experience self hosting compilers without much effort, there’s a Linux distribution called Gentoo which is irrationally interested in building everything from source. Setting it up takes days though a lot of that is waiting. You take a bootstrap configuration, build a customizable OS kernel for your exact hardware, and then experience using the supplied copy of the GCC c compiler to compile well everything in all its open source source file glory. Often you end up using the out of date copy of GCC to compile an updated version of GCC and GCLIB (and holy hell that takes all night sometimes). Now any rational person will tell you that there is absolutely no reason to build all this stuff from source yourself when the build command you’re using is the standard “gcc -o2 [whatever]” that built the compiled binary distributions, but if you’d like to see it, you can. Btw, I know this because I had a friend who told me that if I really wanted to learn Linux I’d do this. He was wrong about that.",

Companies are always looking for people who can build the core logic of an application.\n \nData Analysis/Data Science: This is a fantastic field for career switchers, especially if you have a background in an analytical or business-related field. The ability to use Python and SQL to clean, analyze, and visualize data for a business can be a huge asset. These roles often exist in non-tech companies that need to leverage their data.\n \nDevOps/Cloud Engineering: This area is rapidly growing. While it might seem daunting, there are many entry points and certifications (like those from AWS or Azure) that can make you very attractive to employers, even without a formal degree.\n \nPure Front-End Development: The remote market is flooded with junior front-end developers, making it extremely difficult to stand out unless you have a truly exceptional portfolio. While it's a great skill to have, it can be a tough field to get a foot in the door remotely.\n \nMobile Development: This field is also very competitive for remote junior roles. Many companies prefer to hire more experienced mobile developers or have them work on-site, as it can be a more collaborative and complex process.\n\nUltimately, the best advice is to focus on a field that genuinely interests you and then build a portfolio that solves real-world problems. That's what will make you stand out. The career changers I've seen succeed usually aren't the ones who followed the hype, but the ones who demonstrated a strong passion and a practical approach to their projects. I also tell that to people that consult me.",

That makes the mapping (or function, in the mathematical sense) from inputs to outputs much easier to formally describe and specify. It also makes it much easier to test.\n\nFor another, when a component has state, then its behavior depends on the order of operations that are performed on it. If you want to prove that a component will always behave a certain way, then you have to prove it for all possible orderings of operations. This tends to give you a combinatorial explosion of possibilities. It's not impossible to prove these sorts of properties, but it's something that you don't have to worry about if the component is stateless.\n\nUsually, an application *needs* to have state, in order to do what you want it to do. But by confining the state to the smallest possible \"region\" of the program, you make the both the stateful parts and the stateless parts easier to reason about, compared to how it would be if mutable state was woven throughout the program.\n\nJust as one specific example of this, programs that make heavy use of mutable global variables tend to be much harder to understand and maintain than those that pass parameters and return values around wherever they're needed.",

        "body": "These are great questions to be pondering, and your observations are good.\n\n1. Generally, substitution model vs machine model. If it's possible to just substitute values into a computation to get an answer, it's very easy (in theory) to see where something is wrong. Once you introduce the idea that time matters, e.g. a value can be different at different points in time depending on what point a machine (of some description) is at in the computation, it starts to get much harder to debug things. Now imagine a large program/system with millions of bits of state, changing frequently. If the code doesn't produce the desired behaviour for some combination of those states, you have a bug, and it can be very hard to track down.\n2. Following on from the above, in the context of OOP vs Functional paradigms, OOP is (most agree) about associating behaviour with data. Grouping state with the code that changes it, usually modelled after some real-world thing (but not necessarily). In this way it encourages statefulness and mutation of state. It attempts to balance this with encapsulation (usually enforced at compile time), so that only certain code can access certain state. But that code is called by other code, so the positive effect of this can be limited. Contrasted with functional, where we try to write as much of the program without depending on state, meaning functions become \"pure\" (no reliance on state, no side effects, etc.). We need side effects and state changes, it's what we sell to customers, but we can push them to the very edges of the program, and wall off code that handles the messy stuff, hopefully making the rest easier to reason about and less prone to bugs. Just like OOP there is a spectrum. You can dip your toes in, or go full on.\n\nEdit, just seen you added 3. Think I basically covered it though so I'll leave it there for now. Also, interestingly, some languages are now turning off statefulness by default and having you opt into it, e.g. Rust with mut to enable assignment (distinct from initialising the value)",

But that doesn't hold for the text editor - when you load a text to edit, you don't set the state of the entire application, only the \"data-model\" that it manipulates. All the rules, all the behaviour of the program would be the same as if any other text had been loaded, and thus not directly affecting the state. The state would be like if part of the text was selected, or a dialog window was opened, or a context-menu was active.\n\nStatefulness isn't necessarily considered bad - but the more states you have, the higher complexity you are dealing with, and the higher the risk for unexpected behaviour. If you have 32 variables that can all impact the operation of the application in different ways, you have 4 billion variations, and you can't possibly test every single one of them. So the less statefulness the better.\n\nOOP can encourage statefulness because it encourages objects to be able to manipulate themselves, and store their data, i.e. their state internally. An object \"remembers\" what happened to it the last time you called some method, and behaves differently the next time, depending on previous method-calls. Pure functions do not alter their behaviour depending on state - they always behave the exact same.\n\nStatelessness is preferred because that means that the application always behaves the exact same, and always in a predictable way, thus errors can't suddenly happen when a previous un-encountered state occurs. If new errors are found, they happen because of specific input, and it can be replicated and fixed. Whereas when errors happen in stateful applications, you might not be able to replicate the exact circumstances that caused the error.\n\nAt least that is what we hope and wish for - but of course states can't be completely eliminated, and errors and bugs still show up from time to time in any kind of application.",

State is the definition of an object in the OOP sense.\n\n1 and 3:  Stateless operations are trivially parallelizable and for practical purposes obviate the memory bus part of the architecture to focus on control flow and data transformation.\n\nLet us back up a little:  Fundamentally every program is a transformation of data.  At all scales, this is what a program is.  From the macro to the function level, a program / routine / subroutine/ function, has input, performs a transformation, and provides output.  The \"provides transformation and provides output\" is the key part.  This is true even in places where it's somewhat unexpected:  Gluing APIs together is largely taking the data from one API, performing a transformation, and then outputting it to a second API.\n\nThis is the underlying premise for microservices, for instance.  They perform a single small transformation on data and output it for the next consumer.\n\nNow, let's consider a matrix consisting of all stateful branches.  This is a little opaque to think about at first, so I'll give a concrete example:  In NetHack you can mix potions, or pour potions on items, drink them, etc, and essentially do any X to any item and any potion that you can do with *any other item*.  If you have a matrix where all items are represented as rows, and the behavior of an item interacting with another item is defined by a function entry in that matrix, then you can see that the number of interactions and state transformations of the data grows exponentially with each item (for n-items it's n\\^2 possible state transformations).\n\nIt is possible to show that all stateful operations in a program can be represented this way, and so the complexity of a program grows exponentially as the number of possible distinct state-branches it can take on a given stateful object grows.\n\nSome programs, and some styles of programming (especially game programming) typically lend themselves to managing and processing large amounts of state.  With a resulting large amount of bugs.  It is difficult and takes a lot of engineering work to parallelize that in a consistent and meaningful way, and there are multiple approaches to doing so (the most ubiquitous in my experience has literally been writing your own IPC layer... jfc I hate game devs).\n\nThe graphics pipeline can nominally be viewed as a (mostly) stateless series of programs.  Ignoring some advanced counterexamples, vertex and pixel shaders inherently take input, provide output, and never operate on state at all.  But this isn't quite completely stateless, because the graphics card / driver has a set of states that you have to set for those programs to operate the intended way.  It has *minimal* state, but is not entirely stateless.\n\nThat minimal state affecting control and inputs though minimizes the difficulty in parallelizing shader operations, and once configured globally the programs are trivially parallelizable.\n\nSo, statefulness is \"bad\" from a philosophy of programming perspective where an increase in state and the number of transformations on that state increases the complexity of a program quadratically and decreases the composability and functional-ness of the program.  OOP is by definition state and operations.\n\nBUT, the truth is that some programs require state, and/or are easier to reason about statefully.  And where the rubber meets the road, you do what you need to do to get the data tranformed correctly and within acceptable external tolerances.\n\nEd: I forgot to address the side-effects problem.  State implies functions have side effects to transform persistent state.  That's the entire point of functions on persistent state.  Side-effects can sometimes be very hard to see or understand, making it harder to reason about complex programs (duh) and breaking data/transformation locality.",

So I need to think about whether I want to write data to file or database, and figure out how to do that. And I want to take in some parameters for the playlist, but I can do that from  a config file of some sort for now. And I'll want to pick a set of tracks which match my params - can't be that hard.

        "body": "That doesn't make much sense, because there's no single cognitive ability that would allow one to program successfully without being able to understand enough to create your own solutions (however poor they may be at first).\n\nIf you're talking about actual deficiencies, like those in working memory (e.g., if one has ADHD it is often impaired) then that's a very real challenge, but not one you couldn't work around. I know excellent programmers who are technically learning-disabled, they just take more time and are slower but they can still somehow do if after they gained enough practice.\n\nI think it would be worth investigating what forms of representation for information you prefer in other contexts. Usually, a combination of material works better than any specific one, but there are large individual differences. If you're using code as a reference, that is entirely different than using code to understand a concept. In fact, there are (at least) four different types of resources that people may use while programming and they all serve different purposes:\n\n1. Introductory material/tutorials: Separates information into buckets, reducing cognitive load (pre-selection and focus of attention)\n2. \"How to do X\" guides and other instructions: Complete \"recipes\" for how to do something you don't know how to do exactly, like algorithms that can be mixed and matched, or adapted to your actual needs\n3. References: No explanation, just to remember things that aren't in your memory (syntax, functions, conditions, ...)\n4. In-depth guides and explanations: Used to form connections and help you understand related details, to gradually expand your knowledge graph\n\nSome common issues I've seen are people focusing extensively on one specific type of resource, picking the wrong type for a given situation, trying to understand every detail instead of finding other resources to compare, or trying to do everything at once instead of just one individual step.\n\nThe second big issue might be the complete lack of visualization. Humans are inherently visual creatures and our visual system is the most bandwidth-heavy of all, it's really fast and (within certain limits) excellent at relaying information to your brain that would be more difficult to get in the ol' noggin by any other means. You can draw stuff on paper, in apps like EcaliDraw, or use oldschool graphics programs like Paint. Diagrams like MermaidJS also work but are usually too much effort for everyday tasks. \n\nFor some people, explaining ideas in language may be helpful. This takes more time and doesn't work unless you know roughly what you want to do, but it can be a great aid in clarifying your ideas. Even if you later delete the text, you can try explaining what you are doing and what you want to do as if someone was reading it later. Or find a real person/rubber duck and talk out loud instead.\n\nFinally, there is a difference between \"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" learning. Many regular people seem to prefer the latter, where you start with a high-level idea go down further as needed. This has the benefit of reducing the cognitive load as you get to ignore all the low-level details, but this simplification can make true understanding much more difficult than necessary. It is commonly seen in math where the lecturer knows all the details and sometimes \"forgets\" to mention them or just glances over important topics, leaving students utterly confused. The reverse is also possible, and of course you can try to attack each problem from both angles. I suspect autistic people have an easier time with bottom-up approaches as the details are what allows them to really understand, while it may be overkill for someone else (but this is purely an anecdotal observation). You need to find your own preferred style and see what exactly makes it easiest for you to understand the actual problem, before you encode it into an executable program specification.\n\nPersonally, I found that \"low IQ\" or working memory deficiencies etc. may manifest in that one can't as easily (or rapidly) step through each part of a given problem in their mind, or might make more errors while doing so. But that still doesn't prevent you from doing it on paper or using any other medium, and you might find that someone who seems \"stupid\" is actually quite adept at visualizing graphically in their head instead, or they're great at teaching the material to others and thereby learn it themselves, etc.\n\nI would assume that people with severe cognitive disabilities who are \"brainess\", as you put it, have neither the capacity nor motivation to ask for programming help on Reddit. So my best guess would be a mismatch in approach or missing skillsets, not a lack of general problem-solving ability. Abstract problem solving is more difficult than doing it in context; you could try reframing the problem so it represents specific instances.",

The Black Box Method basically just involves creating placeholder functions for the more complicated operations, then coming back later to define the details of those functions. You start with the big picture, make sure it's behaving like you want, then work your way down to the finer details.\n\n\nFor example, let's say you need to build a program that can read a bunch of names from an input file and update some data files using the information from that file. It's something I've had to do at my job quite a few times now. Immediately, what are the two big things we know it needs to do?\n\n1. Read the input file\n2. Update the relevant data files\n\nSo you write whatever boilerplate you need to get going, then in your main() function, or wherever your program begins, you simply write two lines (I'm gonna be using Pythonic pseudocode from here on out):\n\n\n    def main():\n        parse_input_file()\n        update_data_files()\n\n\nAnd the key is that you don't have to define them just yet. I normally just have these placeholders display a message like \"Parsing input file...\" and \"Updating data files...\" to make things easy to debug. You can do a sanity check here and run your new program to make sure the messages are displaying in the correct order. This would be especially important to do if this is being integrated into a larger system. Make sure your program is actually running.\n\nAnyway, now you can start breaking down these functions individually. Let's focus on the input parsing. This is where we should start asking questions like, \"how do we know which file to read?\", \"what is the format of this input file?\", \"how should we store the data that we read?\". Immediately, we have some information to figure out and some decisions to make.\n\nFor the first question, let's assume that we want to prompt the user for the filename (as opposed to passing it in as a parameter to the program, like using argv in Python). For the second, let's assume that the input file is a plain text file that stores each data entry on a new line, and each line contains a username, first name, last name, and email address, delimited by commas. This type of information should be provided to you by your professor/manager/client/lead developer/someone else. The third question is more of a personal preference, and this is where your knowledge of data structures becomes important. You should base it on what's efficient and easy to maintain, but there are often many correct approaches, so do whatever makes the most sense to you. Let's keep things simple and store the data in an array of tuples for now.\n\nSo, thinking about this logically, in order to parse the input file, we need to:\n\n1. Prompt the user for a file (what should we do if it doesn't exist?)\n2. Read each line of that file, and for each line:\na. Split the line using a comma as the delimeter\nb. Clean up the data (if necessary) and build a tuple with it\nc. Append that tuple to the array\n\nYour program might look something like this now:\n\n\n    def parse_input_file():\n        parsed_data = []\n        input_file = prompt_input_file()\n        if exists(input_file)\n            for line in input_file.readlines():\n                data_tuple = build_tuple_from_line(line)\n                if data_tuple:  # make sure data exists\n                    parsed_data.append(data_tuple)\n        return parsed_data\n\n\nAnd now that we've decided to give this function a return value, we can go back and update the main function:\n\n\n    def main():\n        parsed_data = parse_input_file()\n        if parsed_data:  # make sure data exists\n            update_data_files(parsed_data)\n\n\nNote that we also defined two new placeholder functions. One of them is build_tuple_from_line() which takes as input the text from the line and outputs a tuple representing that data. If it fails to parse for whatever reason, we can return an empty tuple, and nothing will be added to the array. The other is prompt_input_file() which takes no inputs and outputs an object with a readlines() member. (There is also the exists() function, but I am assuming that one is imported.) Hopefully you have an idea now of how this might continue. You can start breaking down each function from here.\n\n\nNo matter what you're doing, you can always break it down into smaller steps. Focus on the core features and start with the parts you understand best. Leave the more complicated parts as abstract functions until you're ready to get into the weeds. You might find along the way that you took an inefficient approach, but it's almost always better just to get something that works to begin with, then you can always go back and optimize later. Like I know the approach I just laid out is very inefficient with memory. If you know that will be a concern, then this would be the perfect time to make adjustments before things get too complicated.\n\n\nThat got way longer than I anticipated, but hopefully it's somewhat helpful. I'm not an expert by any means, but I've seen some decent success as a programmer, and this is the approach that works best for me. Best of luck in your journey! Hope you become a kickass developer someday!",

        "body": "At the beginning I often struggled with translating e.g. homework tasks into code. I then read a beginner programming book which has used C#. The programming language isn't important as the first two chapters were the most relevant for me. The first chapter talked about why you want to learn to program, what possible fields of work are there.\n\nThe second one was about algorithmic thinking. In general most programming language  \nare built on 3 concepts:\n\n\\- Sequence (A sequence of actions that are executed in order of their appearance)\n\n\\- Branching (Actions are executed based on certain conditions)\n\n\\- Repetition (repeating an action until a condition is met. loops and recursion are different  \nforms of repetition)\n\nMost lectures only present you the synthax of e.g. an if-statement or of a loop in a certain language. But they don't tell you when to use these parts of the language. In the book they were talking about looking for keywords in the text or the requirements.\n\nFor example: If you see the word \"if\" in a text then it is a strong indicator for branching  \nas \"if\" implies there are at least two options to handle. \"As long as\" might be an indicator for a loop. If there are many separate actions mentioned one after each other it is a strong indicator for a sequence of actions that you have to perform to reach a certain goal. For each of the actions you could write one single program instruction or a function to group multiple connected instructions in one place.\n\nIn the book they give examples like opening a door where you execute an algorithm to achieve your goal. The sequence can't be changed as you can't enter the room without opening the door. In programming you have to think about which steps have to be performed first in order for your code to solve a problem.\n\npressDoorHandle()\n\nopenDoor()\n\nenterRoom()\n\ncloseDoor()\n\nOf course this is easy when you get university homework as most of the time they try to tell you as accurate as possible what you should do. If talking to a client you actually have to find out what the requirements even are.\n\nOf course this is programming on a micro-level as we are dealing with the specific steps but you can apply this also on higher levels of abstractions when you describe how a user e.g. interacts with a system like a website when he e.g. creates an account, deletes a post.\n\nWhen programming I often use pen and paper or I write comments (pseudo-code) like this:\n\n\\# For each pdf-document do:\n\n\\# Open pdf-document\n\n\\# Extract values with a regular expressions\n\n\\# write them into table\n\n\\# close document\n\nAfter writing the pseudo-code I add the real code below the comments. This way I can focus on solving the problem without having to delve into the specifics of the programming language that I use (this is something you can google easily).\n\nThere are more tips about thinking techniques for problem solving but I have to go do groceries now:)). Feel free to ask any questions. Good luck!\n\n  \nEDIT: Book recommendation: Thinking like a programmer by Spraul it's a book on problem solving techniques. It uses C++ but this isn't important. Use any language you want. It's more about understanding the concepts rather than the language.",

Learning takes time, so you must also learn to become process-oriented by finding ways to make that time rewarding as opposed to being goal-oriented and only caring about the final outcome, because the latter gives you very little in terms of experience which is what you should be taking out of your learning journey. Yes, researching how to build everything from scratch takes a very long time in the beginning, but as you gain experience, the need to do that will diminish, you will gain intuition, and over time you will build a strong knowledge foundation that will serve you much better in the long run than the brittle thing that you will build if you keep approaching learning with your current mindset. You don't need to go any deeper than the public instruction set native to your computer as below that one can hardly call it programming, but in the beginning you should really aim at forming a strong notion of how things really work all the way down there.\n\n> My question is: How do you usually learn about the tools, libraries, or techniques that already exist, so you don’t waste time building everything from scratch? Is there a strategy or habit for this, or is it just experience over time?\n\nI don't. In personal projects I just learn everything from scratch, and enjoy the whole process, because the point is to learn, not to finish the project, and the time spent learning isn't really wasted time. As a beginner to some technology there's also a very high chance that my first approach to solving the problem will likely be a mess so it won't be of much use, so that's never my goal. Lastly it's also very likely that, in the research process required to actually learn how things work, I will come across existing projects that already do it right, but instead of cheating my way by just taking advantage of the existing solution I go down the rabbit hole and try to wrap my head around the rationale of that solution, and don't consider the problem solved until I successfully tackle it myself.\n\nMy advice to you is to stop coming up with excuses to avoid learning when that's exactly what you should be doing. High-level development might feel rewarding to you because it gives you the impression that you are accomplishing a lot with very little, but in the end you are also only gaining a superficial experience, and without a solid foundation it's very easy for abstractions to create unexpected complex problems that you lack the intuition to solve on your own, so don't cheat your way out of the learning process. With large language machine learning models you have free access to teachers that can easily break down complex concepts for you and never get tired of answering your requests to explain things from different perspectives, which is a commodity that I didn't get to enjoy during most of my career, so definitely take advantage of that, not to write your code ant cheat your way out of problems, but to truly help you wrap your head around the solutions.",

Code that tries too hard to separate every little thing into a function is often much more taxing to read. It depends what you're writing. Long functions aren't intrinsically bad. Minor idealism.\n\nIn 7, avoiding unnecessary assignment is fine and can be very beneficial, but this is getting into the functional realm a bit. In other styles/paradigms, and in practice, assignments are often done for readability where there wouldn't otherwise be a need to create a local to hold temporary state for the computation. Again, depends how general you're looking to be with these rules. Same with 8. Lots of useful functions will never be deterministic. E.g. a function that timestamps something couldn't be considered good here. This works fine for canned computation but can break down in real software.\n\n9 also has lots of exceptions. There are many reasons you may want an infinite loop and you rely on them often without realising. Yes, you probably don't want to write one very often in general application dev. It's more important that infinite loops don't block event loops, UI threads, don't spin-lock (unless you intend) a core, and that when errors occur in code that runs as part of the loop, they're handled properly (e.g. recovery if possible/desired) or the process exits, or device is reset etc. Sometimes there is no useful work to do outside of a loop, the whole program is a big loop, etc.\n\nI'd add:\n\n\\- Function is necessary and worth the extra code. Compilers are pretty good at inlining but that doesn't help me reading the code. E.g. You rarely need to pull a single operation into a function (e.g. n << 1) or something. Just write it in place.\n\n\\- Function interface is fully documented. This includes types of inputs/outputs, and full details of any possible exceptions (and their types), behaviour on error, error codes etc., what behaviour is defined/undefined for given states. Reentrancy (if it isn't, e.g. stores state elsewhere!), thread safety (if it isn't). Locks it will take on resources etc...\n\n\\- Function output params are reasonably obvious too (not just input params).\n\n\\- Function code is all roughly the same level of abstraction. E.g. a syscall (or C library call for a syscall) in the middle of some UI object method that handles a button click would likely be unexpected...",

If you're working in object oriented, sometimes you need a void method that operates via side effects, and that's okay. Not everything makes sense to have an output. Knowing what they are, documenting what they are, testing what they do, that's what's important",

Although the main way to control for maintainability and correctness should actually be the testsuite.\n\nSure we can observe various attributes that functions tend to have in a maintainable and largely correct codebase. And I think you hit some good points, but for many of these points I would actually say there is a 80%/20% or 90%/10% rule, etc.  \nFor example, X% of functions should be deterministic and Y% should be non-deterministic. And X% of functions should always terminate and Y% should loop forever.\n\nFor example, when using the actor model, it is expected and useful to have exactly one forever-looping function (with exception of its shutdown mechanism) per actor. It would make sense to have all the other functions guaranteed to terminate. For other paradigms, the rules should be different.  \nIn async based projects for example, it makes sense to have rules when a function is allowed to be async. Many projects make all (or most) of their functions async by default, but that actually tends to introduce unneeded complexity. Limiting stuff like this requires a bit more thought when creating the system, but saves a lot of time on maintaining, debugging, and refactoring later.",

Depending on what you’re trying to do, the loop may be necessary.  \n\nAlso, half the point of OOP is that systems are dynamic, so having all inputs passed as parameters might be shooting oneself in the foot.  I would slightly amend that to say “minimal global parameters.”  Otherwise I agree, though.  I like being able to match what goes in with what goes out, not having to guess which method or global parameter caused an exception because, idk, wrong type or something.  I used to get so frustrated as a beginner with divide by zero exceptions and be like HOW???  WHERE?   It would often be something external, and cleaning up doesn’t hurt anything.  But you also sacrifice functionality.  I just don’t like documentation/commenting, but you can solve a lot of problems like nan exceptions when comments draw your attention to the workflow.  I honestly (besides commenting) don’t understand why I don’t have more exceptions than I do other than just building some good habits over time.\n\nAbsolutely agree on unnecessary side effects.  I do keep a lot of stdout printing at first so I can focus attention on the flow, but if it works, it works, and I delete all that stuff.  You need it for debugging.  IDE’s catch exceptions.  But just because something doesn’t return an error doesn’t mean it does what you want it to do.  But if it works, it works, and you don’t need a lot of side effects beyond that.\n\nOverall, this is a great list!  I’m gonna copy this and keep it handy.",

It all depends on whether you do OO programming.

You want logging, don't you? This approach to writing functions is more from a functional programming language view where functions should be side-effect free, but honestly, it's a pain to accomplish that.\n\nYou can strive for it, but many don't seem to care about side effects. The ones you hear more are avoiding the use of global variables (passing stuff through parameters).\n\nIt would be nice if certain languages could return tuples instead of single values. In C, you sometimes find result parameters which (to me) I find confusing (because they look like inputs when they are outputs).",

Its being able to reason about things. Break things down into manageable components. Id your entire idea is a simple manageable thing theres not much to break down.\n\n1. Set up linux on your pc/laptop.\n2. Set up neovim\n3. Add plugins to neovim to allow for things like LSP integration, autocomplete, formatting etc.\n4. Create a tcp server and tcp client in c++. You should be able to establish a connection between the two, enter data in the client, send the data to the server, read the data on the server, write it to standard output,send data back to the client, have the client read it the data and display it.\n\nJust 1 and 2 will improve you leaps and bounds.\n\n\nThis will genuinely improve you more than you will ever know. You might not even understand any of what I just wrote. But thats the point. Thats the fun. Thats what makes SWEs, SWES. Our ability to break things down into the smallest possible parts, research each part, and come up with some solution, probably a terrible one, and then have the drive/ambition/desire to research/experiment how to improve that code you just wrote, before you ultimately realise you will always need to improve the code. And thats the fun. The best SWEs ive met, dont have 1000 functioning apps that have generated billions of pounds. They've just gone extremely deep into onr specific thing. For me its network, hence why I suggest a tcp server/client. I also think its the best project because thats what I honestly have found separates more advanced devs; the ability to understand things at a fundamental level. When you're coding, you're essentially just reading and writing data. But how is that data read/written? The internet is such a massive change to the course of humanity, yet most devs dont know what a packet is. What a protocol really is. They know how to use ser up a front and backend but not what really is going on. This project will force you to have to learn fundamental things. Theres more fundamental thjngs than this but I think thats a good base to start with. As opposed to literally writing binary.\n\nSome might say this is too complex. And it is. But thats the point. Writing a calculator or something doesnt help. You know how a calculator works. All youre really doing then is just typing.

You go through the steps of installing Python which is good. You explained why you need to say `python -V` with a capital `V` because, frankly, a lowercase and uppercase V look similar. I think the only other part you could have added is to make sure there's a space after `python` and no space after the minus sign.\n\nThe text editor part feels rushed. For example, you choose to use PyCharm. There's an installation process for that as well, which you skipped. Then, how does one get PyCharm to run the right version of Python.\n\nYou gloss over *what* a text editor is. Why can't you use Word or Google Docs to write a program? You could say an IDE is a text editor plus a lot more, but we won't get into the details.\n\nThere is the idea of writing code, then running code, and while you do write and run code, it might make sense to explain the process more explicitly.\n\nThere are questions left unanswered or partly answered.\n\n* What is a programming language?\n* What is a program?\n* How do you write a program? (Explain what a text editor is and the first step is to edit your code)\n* What does it mean to run a program and how do you run a program?\n\nThe part that starts to get rushed (because you wanted to do this in \"10\" minutes) is the actual Python code itself.\n\nI feel the entire section could have been slowed down. As a former teacher, it went over concepts quickly. I know the basics *seem* easy, but they aren't that easy. Even simple stuff like \"what is a variable\". What does it mean to assign a variable? What is a conditional? What is a condition?\n\nOf course, at this pace, it would not be a ten minute video. This is the problem with teaching really introductory programming. You end up explaining stuff that seems really obvious to you, but you discover that those things are *not* obvious. They're so obvious that you don't even mention it because you can't imagine someone wouldn't get it.\n\nBut still, really well edited. For what you intended to do, it looks great. Whether it gets someone to learn enough Python in ten minutes, I'm not sure. I believe a few will get it, but most might be lost?",

That one skill, the ability to read and write code is a big chunk of what makes a good programmer.\n\nNow why students tend to struggle with this is because, firstly this is actually hard to do, so they tend to cheat and just do lots of copy and paste, telling themselves they are learning.\n\nBut there are no shortcuts. To get good at programming requires being good at reading and writing code and that can only be learned by typing in all the code by hand and then trying to understand what was typed. And this requires weeks if not months of repetition (i.e. write lots and lots of code).\n\nAnd you don't need to go looking for some magic project to code. Stick to the basics and learn to write for loops, if statements, control statements, functions and procedures, read user input, echo that input, read for file, write to a file, access a database, read from a socket, write to a socket, spawn a process, capture its output etc. etc.\n\nAnd even using AI should not be an issue, but if all you are doing is using the AI code directly you will not be learning anything. If you use AI take the code it writes and type all of that code in by hand, then study the code to understand what it is doing. No copy and paste, no shortcuts.\n\nUsing that process you will be learning to write code and learning to read code. Add to that reading a good book on your programming language and you'll be well on your way to becoming a good programmer.",

Research on your own and start somewhere. For your level and usecase it should be something cheap/free without the possibility of draining your life savings if you make a mistake. Look into a VPS and docker  \n\\- Scaling? A lot of the things in the cloud these days autoscale in their own ways. But don't worry about this at all atm. You won't build anything that needs serious scaling for a long time probably.  \n\\- Security? This one is kinda the odd one out. Security is a CORE part of any app, not just an afterthought. Another reason why you are not \"fairly proficient\". This needs to be understood and studied on a core level.  \n\\- Architecture? This can mean anything  \n\\- How to choose a tech stack? You are not really in a position to choose if all you know is Django. And thats also fine. Focus on Django for now. Switch up the db or some dependencies depending on your needs maybe.

Add something like accessing a database and learn how to deploy the database.  This is just an example of how to build out what started as a simple application.\n\nThe first time you do something, it may not be the best, but you will learn.

A great way to write programs is to solve problems you run into.\n\nFor instance, I work at a printer dealership. The software we use for tracking service tickets is 26 years old, takes several minutes to boot up, is insanely expensive, and is unintuitive and generally clunky. Maybe I'm audacious, but I became convinced I could do better. So now I'm writing a tool that does it better. It's been months and I'm nowhere near done, because I keep learning and refactoring and learning and refactoring... which is how I hit my stride.

Luckily you have some test-cases already for palindromes and non-palindromes, so you can test your procedure and probably fix many bugs already.\n\nIf you want to get really \"serious\" about testing, then you can even take a break and write a separate program (not required, of course), that generates long palindromes and long non palindromes, and can use that as input to \"stress test\" your final procedure. For such a problem this is probably overkill, but for building an \"industrial strength\" library or program where there are strict performance requirements this kind of thing is often done.\n\nIn any case don't forget to test edge cases, for example is the empty string a palindrome?

Most beginner programming problems are like this, I mean really everything is like this.\n\nSo like, the way you would check if “racecar” is a palindrome (it is) would basically be to look at the first letter and see if it matches the last letter.  And then see if the 2nd letter matches the 2nd to last letter (and of course when I say “letter”… I guess I should be saying character, if it should be able to handle anything that is technically a palindrome I guess), and then check the 3rd letter matches the 3rd to last letter and so on.\n\nIf EVERY comparison returns true, then the result is true (it is a palindrome).  If the you ever get a false at any point, you immediately return false, because that proves it isn’t a palindrome.\n\nYou could of course have to handle all the little details, and make sure invalid things never happen.  So like you have to set up the loops correctly to not get any out of bounds error on the string you’re working with.  And also you could notice things like how you only have to check half of the word, because you’re checking the first half against the back half.  So setting a loop to go through the entire word would needlessly double check everything.  But you have to make sure not to mess up and only check just under half the word, so you should do half the word plus one character (just to be safe).\n\nEtc.  But yea the part you need to practice the most is the first part.  Figuring out how to actually solve the problem (forgetting about programming completely.  Like literally just figure out how to determine if a word is a palindrome by yourself, or whatever the problem is), this is generally the hardest part.  And then figuring out how to translate this solution into code (this is generally the easiest part).  And then you have to deal with making sure you’ve handled all the edge cases and whatnot correctly (probably 2nd hardest part).",

All programs operate on information that exists in some form of storage, which the program instructions manipulate (read, write, modify, compare, ...) to implement solutions to the problem you're trying to solve.\n\nTherefore, understanding the data means you will understand the problem. That's a requirement to implement any solution. The actual programming work is almost irrelevant in the sense that you might as well do it on paper, or on a blackboard/whiteboard, etc. Only the implementation is language-dependent, but the problem itself isn't usually - unless it's an artificial problem introduced by limitations of the system, programming environment, libraries, tools, etc.\n\nUsing your palindrome example: What is the actual problem? Well, what is the data? Presumably, you're given a string of text. You assume it has some known encoding, probably ASCII (or Unicode), so that there is a specific number for each letter/code point. There's also the notion of a position because the words ABC and CBA are not identical. A position is just another number that represents where in the word the letter (represented by the first number) actually should appear.\n\nOK, so what is a palindrome? Well, it's a word (sequence of numbers + position) that just so happens to not change if you swap two letters that have the same \"distance\" from the beginning and end. But if positions are numbers and distances are required, can't you just use the absolute position for each letter (from *both* sides) and check that it's the same, for every letter? Sure, that is probably one solution - though it may not be what you need, or too difficult to do in a given programming language. Another approach is to just swap the entire word, and check that both versions are the same. This is simpler to understand but arguably less efficient.\n\nYou may have special cases, where the word has an odd number of letters. What now? Well, one basic way is to add conditionals, like \"if it's odd, do this. If even, do that\". Often it pays to think harder and realize, in this case, that it makes no difference - the same algorithm \"just works\" and so you need not complicate your solution. If the problem is too difficult, remove special cases. In code, you can write `assert` or similar or even just a `TODO` comment, then revisit that part later.\n\nA solution is different from its implementation in code. If you can't solve the problem that's an entirely different issue than not being able to implement the solution (\"write the code\"), or writing complicated/slow/insecure/incorrect code, for that matter. How do you solve problems? By transforming data, one step at a time.",

Pick the language of your choice\n3. Finish all exercises. At least try to make 75% progress. By the time you hit that, you should have built some mild muscle memory as well as some creativity and rigor. Believe me you're gonna need all that when you tackle the second step.\n\nSecond step: \"build your own X\"\n\nThe FREE way:\n\n1. Go to [Build your own X](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x)\n2. Pick an interesting stuff to build (e.g. Emulator > C > \"Writing a game boy emulator\")\n3. Follow and complete the introductory tutorial and try to expand with more features\n\nThe paid way:\n\n1. Create an account on [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io)\n2. Pick a challenge (e.g. \"Build an interpreter from scratch\")\n3. Pick a language (e.g. C)\n4. Follow the instructions\n\nIt's 30$ per month though, so you gotta be committed asf and make the most of it: don't just blindly complete the challenges or worse: slack off. Read docs, engage in the community, get your project reviewed by someone, make sure you thoroughly understand the tool you just built (beyond the source code that you write).\n\nThird step: personal projects\n\nSurely there are plenty of things you want to do... If nothing comes to your mind right now, then hopefully the 3-6 months you just spent on Exercism+codecrafters gave you lots of ideas. But either way, try to do something without guidance.\n\nAfter all that, try to maybe contribute your own bugfixes or features on a GitHub repo that you love. Maybe during your learning journey, you spotted a nice game engine project and you want to participate in its development. The entire world is yours to discover at this point!",

Even if we take a sport where you don't face the opponent directly, there is still a lot to learn besides building strength.\n\nI don't think people gradually grow from solving puzzles into building projects. It is a different mindset. It isn't a rocket science either. If OP google: \"how to learn building projects\", there will be many ways to handle it. Problems is that people were told that writing code will build that skill automatically.",

There are so many top quality tutorials on git/github that at utmost searching for 20 minutes and doing 2 hours of tutorials should enable you to do what is needed to get your repository and branch it. This is really basic stuff.\n\nIf your level is, as you say, so far behind, you cannot catch up in a matter of mere months.\n\nHonestly, I am baffled beyond all reason how you managed to miss just about everything and still get to the place where you are.",

The token douchebag classmate is not a credible outlet. Yeah, it’s scary as dog shit, and these professionals can sometimes respond to queries harshly, but it will A) show initiative and curry you favor if you *do end up in a tight spot because of a technical lacking*, and B) help you tighten up and figure out how you are going to survive and compete. And you gotta trust me on this one. Whatever you do, find a leader you trust to talk to.\n\nThen you can add in some sort of counseling or vent-based release protocol for handling the *feeling of not feeling worthy or competent* because that is a whole different introspective beast.\n\nIf and when you do have this talk, compartmentalize. Minimize the “I feel” statements. Focus on objective problems that you are having.\n\n\nI’m sure you’re aware of most of this, but take it from someone who has struggled immensely at multiple levels and has had substantial technical and research success in spite of that.\n\nTalk to your people. And when you’re done, make changes, and talk again.\n\nCheers",

It sounds like the course you're doing focuses on giving you solid fundamentals(although it is a bit weird that git/version control isn't a part of that), and you're supposed to build upon those fundamentals yourself. \nRealistically, just following a course and not doing any extra curricular learning yourself isn't good enough nowadays, if you want to get hired.\nThe good news is that you can change this. Ask yourself why you do programming? Is there a particular field you're drawn to? A passion you want to cultivate? Then prove it to yourself by actually studying and creating projects in that area in your spare time.\nIf you're not sure what you're passionate about, then at least try something and see what sticks.\nAs a personal example I never thought I would be interested in learning the really low level stuff until I came across a certain resource and then I just fell down a rabbit hole and allowed it to consume me.\nGood luck",

That is okay but you just need to play catch up. I suggest watching videos or following tutorials and actually practice using these tools like Git, Git Hub, Docker, etc as you mentioned but with a guide so you do not get lost. These seem hard but once you use them for a bit it gets easier. Even I struggle to understand new topics and tools but you got to push through and enjoy the grind.\n\nResources:\n\n1. After reading your post I feel this is the best resource as per the gaps in knowledge you state you want to fill. It looks like you want to get familiar with command line interfaces(CLI), Git and Git Hub(which are different things), and how node.js and Java Script programs work. I **highly recommend** [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard) course(free/asynchronous) to get familiar with all these tools(Git, Git Hub, Java Script, node.js, HTML, CSS, not docker though). It is centered on web dev but since you want to get familiar with those tools and programing languages it is a great place to start. They break it down into sections with step by step on how to set up, what it is for, how to use with personal project based learning, you can ask for help on their Discord, and they provide links to additional readings.\n   1. I was also confused about Git and Git Hub less than a year ago but using The Odin Project made me understand it a lot better and why it is so useful. BTW heres an extra resource to practice Git commands after you get familiar with using it: [https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en\\_US](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en_US)\n2. You can also look into [CS50 on edx](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home) to practice general programming skills. It is also free and asynchronous but it has less focus on tools and more on thinking and problem solving which will only help you. They are lecture style with additional shorter videos and problem sets to solve.\n3. I see you also are a bit interested in game dev, if so follow tutorials for games on the Godot engine or even Unity or Game Maker. Anything really and do not feel bad about doing so especially if you have never used it. Of course do not just copy and paste from the video and try to take make it your own. Brackey's could be a good start but there are other great You Tube videos for game dev.\n\nI am not an expert but I would say you do not have to know everything but you have to get familiar with general tools. Of course when you get put into a project or land a job you may have to learn a new tool but if you get a sense of the generally popular tools needed for a specific project that will help you adapt.\n\nAll in all do no give up just keep going, acknowledge your lack of experience but build upon what you know and do not know.",

Similar logic, but applied to the trip to post office instead of the meeting. This introduces looping as you work back from your 10:00 and loop through your errands leading up to it. Get to the point where you would need to have left half an hour ago? Some errand needs to be removed…then you need an algorithm to decide which one to do later, or to reschedule the meeting.

You take all the variables and conditions into account, at whatever level of detail is required to give an adequate solution. Maybe you are just meeting a friend for a walk in the park, and it’s ok to be a few minutes late, whereas for a job interview you must be on time, and add a few minutes buffer in case traffic delays you.\n\nIt is tedious. Very tedious. Encapsulation helps with this by focusing on the smallest set of details for the immediate problem at hand.\n\nDecompose problems into manageable encapsulations and build up from there.

The users were happy, the people who wrote that trash were not. I was never able to achieve 100x RTIs, which was disappointing. One needs to develop a design and methods instinct. The computer is a machine and you need to consider what you are making it do.\n\nAt the time, the technical computing group was charging served departments for machine cycles, there was complete reorg because that model was blown up. I was challenged by my boss/idiot that the users were not using my software suite, the cpu use was so little. I took him to my desk and beat up one of the memory resident apps and did a bunch of scrolling, sorting, editing etc and pointed to a little bug in the corner of the screen showing session use of a few milliseconds. The data was in permanent swap space, memory resident in permanent disk swap space. The screen apps were actually an interface to edit and manipulate data in address space. There were no database calls which are all subroutine calls. When a app was launched the app instantly had data in its address space. All supported by an optimized library of reentrant code. Many people running several apps were supported by a single instance of the code in memory. RAM was very expensive at that point in time. There were table driven applications generators with terminal screen forms and fields. When doing some complex products built on top of this, the full screen app could be used to examine the address space of the product being developed, an optimal debugging tool. Things like optimizing pen plotters and manufacturing numerically controlled devices, minimizing pen changes and tool transit paths. In the pen plotters, overlapping line vectors were collapsed to one. Vectors were grouped into several regions which reduced pen-up excursions. The problem is that during CAD design, a component would be given a bill of material number and the bill of material in the corner would be completed. During plotting, the plotter would retrace those motions in the order of the drawing development. A hole in a part would have two or more overlapping circles, from each surface that the hole went through. So there were such challenges. The software did such operations in the background, the users did not need to run anything. My background was MechEng.\n\nI examined each code component's compiler machine code output, optimizing register use in each subroutine, especially anything data intensive. Without using files for data, I had to produce my own data sorting, printing,  select etc. My equal key stable sorting was vastly faster than the OS sorting or SyncSort. The code included terminal drivers and supported a number of different models and brands of terminals within the one code base. Everything was coded in Fortran, however I was coding in other platforms and languages as needed.",

Always solve the problem on paper first.\n\nThis is slow and tedious and all sorts of difficult at first. Which is why it works.\n\nLater on, you can relax this restriction. But if you're able to solve a problem on paper, then you'll learn problem-solving. Programming consists of problem-solving (this step) and encoding the solution in code (the next one), among other things.\n\nCopying code does not teach you [problem solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving). It doesn't even teach you the encoding step, though it may help to refresh your memory. Therefore you will not be able to learn how to solve problems, which is at the heart of programming. You likely won't improve much because you haven't practiced the relevant skills.",

If you want to learn web development I recommend going down this route. Start to add things on a need to have basis and don’t blindly follow things because it’s the latest trend. Get the fundamentals down first and then explore. It’s a process to learn these things and I am sure you are in no rush to push out a “product”. Best of luck and don’t give up.

To keep knocking out frameworks, courses, whatever, without ever getting the confidence to dive in and start building. You probably have the requisite knowledge, training, and ability to go off-piste and stop just checking boxes to check them. \n\nI’m not saying don’t learn React or whatever thoroughly if it is applicable, but I am saying you are at the point where you may have more success if you start deciding for yourself what is applicable and what isn’t.

Our abstractions steadily climb higher and higher, moving further and further from the \"world just as it is\" with it's particles and whatnot.\n\nIn programming we talk machine code, binary patterns, on the lowest level, but again we ignore the details and use higher level languages, where creating a variable hides everything that really goes on.

But you guys have no formal school system so you only know how to count but no writing and no ***higher math***.  \n\nSo one day you discovered that it seems like each T-Rex has about 32 teeth.  He realized this because you have been keeping them in holes near the camp ground with each hole teeth from one T-Rex.  And since you do not write and do not add, every time you go out to trade with other tribes you simply dig up one whole put everything in your dino purse and go.  You know it is enough but not how many.  But now you know ***through repeating the same thing over and over*** that it is about 32 teeth.  \n\nSo a hole is 32 teeth and you reasoned a dino purse from a hole is 32 teeth, so you decided to count purses in the future and stop worrying about the teeth and the holes.  \n\nThat is abstraction:  teeth -> purses.",

Data related roles often have less competition than front end developer jobs, and they line up well with what you’ve done before. On the loop you described.. I need to do this > I don’t know > read docs > feel lost. That’s actually part of the process. The key is breaking projects into smaller steps. Instead of saying I need to build an app, say I’ll just connect to a database or I’ll write one small query. Finishing those small steps builds confidence, and over time, you’ll realize you’re moving forward more than you think.\n\n33 is not old at all in tech. When you go for internships, focus less on being perfect technically, and more on how you’ve dealt with problems, figured things out, and helped people in your past roles. That’s what managers like to see in interns. Internships are designed for people who are still learning. Companies don’t expect you to come in as an expert.\n\nSo I'd say apply anyway even if you feel underqualified. Build small projects that show your database skills. Keep practicing, but don’t get stuck waiting until you feel ready because you’ll never feel 100% ready. The confidence comes once you’re in the role and learning by doing.

There is ALWAYS more to learn. If you spent 100 years learning one thing, you'd die before you learned \"everything about it\".

Additionally, it shows you're able to pick the correct tool for the job, rather than just forcing a less-good language in.\n\nI'd be far more interested in hiring someone who knew JS/TS/C and a little bit of Rust/Golang, than the millions of people with JS/Python/PHP.\n\nAdditionally, for older languages, where there are less people using them, critical infrastructure still relies on them, with a smaller pool of applicants.

I think some of them point out large numbers of imports, but for things like sonar, they just have limits on them like \"no more than x imports\". I don't know of a tool that will actively fix them for you though. Some of these scanners have code duplication detection as well, that might be a good indicator of where you can combine things or reorganize.\n\nEDIT: after some quick googling, Ndepend and DGML apparently are good tools for scanning.\n\n\\>Some way to reduce redundancy where two variables do ALMOST the same thing\n\nNot sure I know what you mean here without an example.

Pattern matching *alone* makes me miss it when I use other languages. Interestingly, it's the most \"admired\" but only the 6th most \"desired\" language.\n\nAs nice as it is, it suffers from limited practicality - I rarely use it outside of toy projects at home, because practical software engineering leverages ecosystems and the Rust ecosystem is still immature. It can interop well enough, but in my experience doing interop with C/C++ and JavaScript (via WebAssembly) maintaining the interop boundary is more painful than just ditching the language entirely for the project.\n\nPython is an \"easy\" language to learn - you cover the important programming fundamentals of control flow and abstraction without having to muck around with compiler toolchains, type systems, static guards, etc..., which is awesome. Those are all important things to learn but pretty overwhelming up front.\n\nJS has two pretty massive advantages that make it popular in application development, both which come with its ties to web technology: (1) it works on *every single dang device*, and the installation process for web apps is \"click link, load page\" which is delightfully low-friction for devs and users, and (2) it comes with HTML+CSS, which are *incredible* tools for writing UIs.",

Websites make up a huge portion of what people do with computers so that alone gives it a major place. Asides for that you can use JavaScript as a server side language, and because of its role in frontend web dev people have increasingly used it to make the backend of websites also so they can do it all in one language. \n\n**Python** is the most commonly used language while dealing with AI, so it’s so surprised to me that with the AI boom of the last few years it’s being treated like that. It’s also an attractive language to new programmers because of its simple and clean syntax, and it’s long been used by data analysts for its ecosystem of data tools. \n\n**Rust** is well loved by its fans (myself included) because it has a lot of unique features which are really elegant once you learn to use them. If you’ve never used a language which treats errors as values using Rust’s Result type feels like a whole new way of thinking about effects in programming. Pattern matching on Enums feels so much more elegant than using a switch statement. For me at least it contains so many tools you can use to ensure that “invalid states are unrepresentable” at the type level, which feels so powerful and means that when you code actually compiles it does exactly what you want far more often than in other languages. It’s also just very cool to see a program you write in Rust run 50-100x faster than the same program in Python. \n\nWriting Rust can be painful, and it’s often very slow going, because actually getting it to compile is difficult. Rust is the perfect language for places where you need to be really confident in the correctness of your code and also have very high performance, but not if building things with any speed is the priority. \n\nBut if you already know Java/Kotlin those are both great languages, no reason not to just keep working on those since you already have a head start. Go is also another very popular language these days.",

By rule of thumb,  you'll then have to choose between native and cross platform. \n\n\nNative: either iOs or Android. In my honest and humble opinion,  Android (and jetpack compose in particular), is more pleasant and less nerve wreaking than iOs.\n\n\nCross platform: welcome to the jungle! Cross or multi platform developer is gaining in popularity,  mainly because management can save a buck. There's so many frameworks available out there, it's difficult to decide,  but here's my 2 cents:\n\n\n- no-no: Qt framework, Xamarin, Ionic, React Native. Developer experience and overall quality is plain bad.\n\n\n- maybe: Kotlin Multi Platform. It's in its early stages,  and rough around the edges, but I see huge potential. \n\n\n- best option: Flutter. For so many reasons, let me know if you want to know more.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, they all work in the same way: your code transpiles to cpp and h, and these are compiled vis cmake. Hence,  you may as well create your own. \n\n\nWorth mentioning: mobile development is not just \"the app\", but the release train as well:\n\n\n- github workflows\n- fastlane\n- google play, apple dev portal and store connect\n- certificates and permissions (see in app purchases, keypass auth, etc etc)\n\n\nLet me know if I can help you further. \n\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention something very important,  that will help you succeed as an engineer,  and not just a developer: architecture. Learn as much as possible about that. Most principles con be transferred to backend development,  and even lower level programming. \n\n\nRead other people's code. When you do it for work it's draining, but when it's not is like learning from the masters. I recently dissected Arduino CLI, for instance,  and I discovered a gem of clarity an structure. The world is full of open source code, just clone it and start reading ",

That's not as clear cut.\n\nJust store for each lesson the time it was completed at, and then for the \"next\" lesson you can just get the most recently completed with a single query and suggest the next one as long as it's still within the limits of how many there are.  If the queries are taking a while, you can consider denormalizing and having a table that is literally just the most recent completion (or the next lession to suggest) so that you can fetch it more quickly.\n\nYou may also want to consider event sourcing, it's probably more complex to learn/setup the first time, but you can then retroactively apply different display logic after the fact since the events are all available to reconstruct how the currrent state was reached.  HOWEVER, if it's your first app I would just go the standard CRUD way first and maybe consider trying to do event sourcing after to compare/contrast the strengths and weaknesses yourself.",

        "body": "Most of the other answers in this thread are wrong.\n\nSome people are saying that the addresses are different because forking creates a new address space. That doesn't explain the output because the new address space has new *physical* memory mappings for the same *virtual* address space, and the address you're printing is a virtual address. Userspace programs can't (easily) see physical addresses at all; they only see virtual addresses.\n\nSome people are saying this is due to address space randomization. That's wrong because ASLR doesn't change any of the virtual addresses in a forked process. (Doing that would require also updating every existing pointer to point to a different location, which would be super complicated.) The behavior shown in this example will be the same regardless of whether ASLR is on or off.\n\nThe answer is really simple: **the variables have different addresses because they're different variables**, even though they have the same name. They are defined in different scopes and their lifetimes don't overlap.\n\nYour code is exactly the same as if you had defined `a` and `b` in the \"if\" branch, and `c` and `d` in the \"else\" branch. In that case it wouldn't be surprising at all that `a` and `c` have different addresses.\n\nMore precisely, the variables are *allowed* to have different addresses. The C language compiler and the C language standard make no promises about the actual addresses that are used for different variables. (If you never use the `&` operator to look at a variable's address, it might never have an address at all -- it might be stored entirely in registers.) The actual results you get can depend on things like your compiler's optimization settings.\n\nIf you change your example to take the address of the *same* variable on both sides of a fork, you'll see that the memory addresses are identical: https://godbolt.org/z/xPvWanz1d\n\nBut even though the virtual addresses are the same, the fork causes them to point to different physical mappings. So changes in the parent won't affect the child, or vice versa. (It's slightly more tricky to make an example that demonstrates this, because it requires synchronizing the two processes so that one process tries to read memory *after* the other one writes it.)",

You are a beginner so its good to get experience with different tools or programing languages(obviously in the future you can specialize). Its good you have these interests and you should stick with them since that makes learning fun.\n\n1. Seeing as you like Python and want a good structured course, I would say start [CS50p on EDx](https://www.edx.org/learn/python/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-programming-with-python). It is free, asynchronous, and you get to practice Python by solving problem sets at your own pace. The class is run by Harvard(no need to apply) with a great professor and its basically the online version of the actual class. Its beginner friendly and I highly recommend this if you want to learn more about Python. I did this course before going to college and felt it aligned well with what I learned in my Python class(make sense since CS50 is also a college level class).\n\n2. Harvard has other course under \"CS50\" like one for AI, web dev, cyber security, etc that you can do after you get more familiar with coding. These are also free and you can check them out here: [https://www.edx.org/bio/david-j-malan](https://www.edx.org/bio/david-j-malan)\n\n3. You also say your like web dev so I definitely suggest checking out [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)(also free). This one more self learning you need to read about each topic on your own, but the content is curated(I am doing this and like the resources they provide so far). As for content the course goes over HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and in the advanced course more web dev tools like node.js or ruby(there are 2 advanced courses, choose a path you like).\n\n4. You can stick with the FreeCodeCamp course as well, that is a good course and you should keep doing it. As you said \"like it better as there is more involvement and actual coding\" this is great that you get to do more hands on stuff.\n\n5. W3 schools is alright, you are definitely right to think the problem is you are just reading but are not applying any of the things you learn. As many people have said you learn by doing aka projects even if they are small or simple. The important part is you thought about what to type out and learned something during the process.",

        "body": "# CS50p:\n\nYes good hands on problems to solve, though they are not projects this course still offers a good foundation to expand and cement your Python skills(epically since you are interested in machine learning). To explain, CS50p will cover these topics week by week for 10 weeks aka 10 online lectures:\n\n1. functions,\n2. variables,\n3. conditionals,\n4. loops,\n5. exceptions cases,\n6. using libraries,\n7. unit tests file I/O,\n8. regular expression,\n9. Object-Oriented Programming & classes,\n10. recursion.\n\nThis is more about applying little programming technique week by week. Each week has a few problems to solve using and expanding on the skills you learned up to that point. These of course are not full projects, but still very good practice to learn skills in a controlled and friendly environment. They test problem solving skills as well which never hurts.\n\n# The Odin Project:\n\nThis has excellent projects and to clarify The Odin Project is for front end and back end. It has an introduction course teaching HTML, CSS, and Java Script. Then you can choose to learn ruby or node.js or both and these advanced course are at least 5-8x longer than the introduction course so plenty to learn.\n\nThe structure is:\n\n* You basically read a few curated lessons and external resources\n* Make a project which is a website such as:\n   * Basic HTML page\n   * Landing page with styling\n   * Making web page games or interactive pages after learning Java Script\n   * Even more advanced pages after learning more tools\n* This cycle of reading and making projects repeats itself. They have a discord to help you if you get stuck, but the course is pretty detailed/clear. Essentially there are many chances to make projects and if you feel comfortable you can make your own outside of the course.\n\nThis is heavily project based as you are given a general goal when you reach a project assignment. Other than that you just make your own website following the general theme or requirements. This is also self graded but with web dev its pretty easy to see how well you did by viewing your website based on content, design, and functionality. You also get to learn about version control through Git and Git Hub. This is great since now you projects will be on a repository that you can make public or private as you wish. Furthermore you can actually see your website live and deploy it. For the beginner course they just make these websites hosted on Git Hub, but in the advanced course they show others ways of hosting and using more advanced tools.\n\nIf you have more questions feel free to ask!",

You first need to establish a solid foundation from which you can build up.\n\nWhat you're doing is like training running for 3 days and immediately trying to run a half marathon.\n\nIf you settle on the MOOC above, wait until you have progressed beyond part 5 until you go to sites like Codewars. I'd actually recommend using [Exercism](https://exercism.org) before CodeWars.\n\n> I find that I'm lacking in dissection skills\n\nThey are *trained* and *acquired* skills that take considerably longer than 3 days to build up.",

Your variables give you the location of the \\*start\\* of the data structure, but you have to be aware of how big they are, or where the \\*end\\* of the data structures are.\n\nThis is particularly important when dealing with arrays.  The line:  \n\n\n    char buffer[MAXSIZE];\n\nis telling the compiler, \"reserve a chunk of memory as big as sizeof(char) \\* MAXSIZE in the stack frame of this function\".  There is NO PROTECTION to make sure you stay inside your MAXSIZE-sized buffer; if you ask the compiler to do this:\n\n    buffer[MAXSIZE + 5] = 'x';\n\nit will happily do that.  which will, of course, go stomping on some other variable in your function's stack, or off into unallocated memory, or who knows what.  You are responsible for always being aware of where the end of your fixed size buffers are, and always checking your offsets (or pointers, if you go that way) to make sure you are still in bounds.  This is, of course, a pain, and much of the discipline of working with C is about finding easy to manage and easy to maintain ways of dealing with such data structures.\n\nI compiled your program and fed it a 5000-byte input, and it segfaulted immediately.

Even without AI, the job was getting easier due to better tooling and specialization of SaaSes. Ie a newer architecture takes significantly less manpower to maintain even at high scale compared to old architectures. \n\nI was a VP at a startup founded around 2013. Their first product took a team of 60 engineers to maintain. Our second product, built on a more modern stack, took 6 engineers and made as much revenue and processed more scale. This led to a limited refactor of the first product which removed the hardest to maintain parts, freeing up engineers to work on new things. \n\nI'm talking simple stuff - like using SQS, lambda functions, etc. \n\nAnyways I think companies are dialling in a new cost -> revenue ratio wrt to engineering resourcing. \n\nTwitter is one extreme (but not recommended) example of this, ie everything thought it would crash and burn and yeah, there were a few pains, but overall the service stayed up with a third of the engineers. \n\nGoogle/Meta have also done a ton of reorgs, and while some of those are layoffs, a lot of them is reshuffling people to new team and new bets because less people needed to work on each products. \n\nAnyways it's all first hand thoughts and super anecdotal. I just don't see why people would go back to hiring as much as they did with the salaries as they were. It was kind of silly and frankly most people I know in FAANG were coasting pretty hard.",

You can put baricades to people being fired but I've seen the real life consequences of that where you have people that do nothing and still cant be fired for ages which is not conducive to having high performing, efficient teams. Pay? There is a reason that other than guaranteeing minimum pay, continuing insurance on injury etc, sports unions have nothing to do with negotiating pay. The whole point of unions is that everyone gets paid \"fairly\" which usually means the same for given seniority. The groups where unions have made a significant difference in pay like nurses for instance, had extreme leverage (a lack of even remedially qualified replacements, and the requirement that duties are performed onsite). Unions just arent a great fit for tech jobs, especially with the increased ease of offshoring.",

Doing that successfully will already bring you close to the actually knowledgeable people in the team and management will start to notice that you actually understand/are engaging to understand the business instead of just technical parts of it. This is how you build your reputation and are considered a valuable resource.\n\n\nThen shift into first phase of your real agenda of automation on a drip. Don't make a big splash. Get the minimum creds to do the minimum automation. Make sure to make your boss look good in the process - ALWAYS. Ensure that you are the key person in the automated workflow. Now you are important enough that you are being included in the mid level or even senior level meetings. Stay the course for another year and keep showing results. By now you also have idea of the political camps and power structure. Be balanced politically but start to identify potential allies and adversaries.\n\n\nNow that you have managements ear, switch into the final phase. Get the big players on your side. Show them how much they get to gain by supporting your vision. Because you are ready to fill the big shoes. This is the most political phase and most dangerous.

In the most polite and professional way possible, I suggested we looked it up together to verify so that I could learn more. The guy got butthurt and told HR that I did poorly LMAO like wow...\n\nLike it's crazy, you're just expected to know all the tech shit and on top of that, somehow portray a personality that aligns with the interviewer rather than the company or society in general so that the guy passes you thinking \"wow you're just like me! let's work together, pass!\".\n\nThis is also why people find big tech somewhat easier since it follows a proper structure, LC -> System Design -> Fundamental questions about your programming language / domain -> STAR strategy - behavioral rounds.\n\nSo tldr, the only thing you can do is your best and prepare as much as you can.",

Then practice those and get to a really comfortable level.  At the time of my last interview, I was writing typescript and react code daily for a side project, so I was entirely in my element.\n\nSo if it's C# that's popular, practice and level up your proficiency with C# and .NET, if it's Java, then get good with Java and Spring or whatever.  \n\nAlso, think of difficult problems you've solved or ran into in the past.  Document how you solved them, and have a good answer for this kind of question.  It comes up in pretty much every interview I've had and always opens up a conversation going into more detail, and I feel like thats the best position to be in during an interview; a discussion where you get to take the lead and control the conversation.",

He himself said he changes jobs every couple of years and doesn't have \"expert level\" (which might just be mid that he thinks is \"expert\") in any one language. \n\nThe odds seem high he's fallen into the classic trap of 6x 1YOE rather than having 6YOE? If so, then no wonder he's struggling badly in mid level interviews in this current job market. Thus this is an aspect he needs to urgently address, but we can't even get to the point of discussing how to do this, if he won't even discuss it as a possibility.\n\nEdit 2, to reply to u/Azureflames20:\n\n> I feel like if you’re someone who takes this much offense to a valid possible criticism, there’s some bigger ego issues to work on and squish.\n\nYeah I'd bet money on the fact he doesn't just have technical skills he needs to work on, but is lacking in soft skills areas as well, that are likely coming through during the interviews.\n\nEdit 3, a reply to u/mariogario123:\n\n> So why is someone who stuck around for 6 years going to be knowing more than someone who jumped every, let’s say, 1.5 years. \n\nAm certainly not saying 6yrs is the optimal time to stay at a company! (from the employee perspective... )\n\nBut if you're jumping every year or two, then do you truly get to see the full entire SDLC? And thus truly feel the ramifications of the decisions that are made way back at the start. Or are you jumping too early every time to learn the lessons? \n\nDon't think we can say there is one magic \"optimal number\", depends so much on: the person, the company, market conditions, and more.\n\nEdit 4, a reply to u/evanescent-despair:\n\n> So what should someone who’s jobless even do if they have a 6x 1YOE situation?\n\nWell, first of all they need to recognize it, as then it is easier to come up with a plan to fix it. \n\nThey might even find this realization freeing. As if you're 6YOE deep into a career, you might feel yourself \"stuck\" in it with \"golden handcuffs\" (or at least silver plated handcuffs). And you can't just give this up and take a big drop / step back into a new career instead. \n\nHowever, if you're just at 1YOE into it reality, then it's much easier to decide upon a career pivot?\n\nWhile if they *do* decide to stick with it, they need to figure out their strengths and weaknesses, so they can play to their strengths and patch up their weaknesses to at least competent mid level. \n\nBecause they need to quickly be able to \"fake\" being mid/senior level and even better in the long run *actually become* mid/senior level ability. \n\nAs likely they're coming across in interviews and their CV as someone who is *not* mid/senior and interviewers are smelling this from a mile away. And nobody wants a 6YOE Junior!",

Companies get richer as a consequence of that... sure... but that's not why we're paying for our education. We're paying for our education because we want a job. That's it.\n\nBut at the same time, a lot of companies do have tuition reimbursement programs. Places like Target, Walmart, etc offer full tuition reimbursement to their employees. The idea being an \"unskilled\" minimum wage employee that gets their education paid for will stay at the company, but move into corporate/leadership roles that require an education.\n\nSo what you're describing already happens. But, an important part of that whole concept is you need to be an employee *before* you get tuition reimbursement. No company is just gonna pay for a random person's college. But a lot of them will pay for someone's college that is already a trusted employee, with the hopes that it builds a level of trust/loyalty and grows their employees internally.\n\nThe whole idea of graduating high school, and immediately going to college, and immediately starting your career in a job that requires a degree is just one way to enter the industry. If you choose that path, you're paying for your college. That's your choice. But if you choose an alternative path, where you put in your time at a place like Target, you can have your college paid for. For whatever reason a lot of people don't like that path though.",

They take the easy way out. I had an interview just like this a month ago, it was interesting.\n\nI'm too late to the party, but here are my few comments. I am tipsy.\n\nI have been an occasional hiring manager/tech interviewer for last 15 years in companies of various sizes. From nough startups to couple of billions in current account. Disclaimer - I mostly mostly work in highly regulated backend area (gambling/fintech) as a senior/staff/principal.\n\n* In organisation of any size hiring manager has way less input into how we evaluate candidates than you would think. From the company perspective your CV requires at least a screening meeting (internal), chat with HR (yes, candidate looks promising!) and time slots from at least 2 seniors for at least 2 different meetings + EM meeting (position fit) + executive meeting (culture/ambitions fit).\n\n* * We cannot spend time on every single candidate. You really are asked to stand out to proceed, cost of hiring you approaches $100k in time commitment from everyone involved + another $100k for your onboarding. I must apologise, but that is what our in-house recruiters are responsible for.\n\n* Good companies do domain specific take home assignment with known gotchas (e.g. rounding issues, how to handle various dimensions depending on domain, performance considerations, ability to join two tables to start with, not even talking about various consistency scenarios). Yes, it sounds like unpaid work, but it is a fantastic filter between those that have a clue and those that copy paste from stack overflow. We are about to invest 12 months in you getting up to speed, we ask for 4-8 hours of you showing off your skills.\n\n* * These assignments usually are crafted with great care by rather highly paid engineers in the org. There can only be so many of them prepared, check glassdoor, it usually will spell out what you need to succeed.\n\n* LC is a good screener for 99% of candidates that couldn't code their way out of looking up data from users table. Anyone who displays awareness of constraints, different naming nomenclatures, jeez (here comes the dragons) - time zones ... or even utf8mb4 v utf8mb3... automatically a plus.\n\n* Always remember that we WANT TO HIRE YOU! Seriously! We wouldn't be hiring otherwise! What seems to be a field of obstacles is not meant to discourage you, but to make sure you get a face time with your peers whose opinion will really count. Please accept that if my week is 40 hours and every day i have 2 hours blocked for hiring (with 15 minutes before each meeting to research candidate background, 15 minutes afterwards to summarize my notes and provide feedback all while actually moving business forward...) Executive or EM discussion fail can very easily be overriden if 2 actual team members says \"5 stars, he/she/they will fit GREAT\".\n\n* Candidates should and will be treated equally. Ignoring cases where candidate had a nervous breakdown during interview (has happened, more than once. it's not a showstopper, it's a stop-the-interview and reschedule to start from tabula rasa. One of the few things big tech gets right is to dismiss outlier incidents), we do need to show that we care about results, not about gender, race, etc. And we are pretty objective about it. Except positive bias.\n\n---\n\nAs for your specific comment that most managers are bad. I used to think the same until I became an engineering manager. There's so fucking much politics and shoulder playing between teams and horse trading to just move ahead with the project that is our job to shield you from.\n\nYes, you think your ticket with specification and acceptance criteria is done and easy and you can just proceed. 50% of the time that feature is actually under a chopping axe because someone else in the company wants to take eventual credit for it / is unable to formulate where their API points are expected to be / knows that you are doing null work that will be discarded because corporate strategy has separate team working on replacement. Sucks, but not due to you and not due to your EM.",

I conducted over a dozen last month.\n\nFor the record, our interviews include some discussion with the candidate on their experience, a leetcode type question, and some system design. The leetcode question is not meant to be difficult, and we use something that is classified as easy or homegrown stuff that is similarly quite easy. One question we often use, for example, has a very trivial n^2 solution (literally try every pair of values and make sure the index of j is after i).\n\nWhen I am conducting interviews everything matters. It's not just a black and white do you solve the question and I check off the box. Here's a list of some things that I am looking at to make a decision that aren't just \n\n* How quickly do you start solving and how quickly do you solve it? Does it look like you've seen the question before? Does it look like someone else or AI is solving the question for you?\n* How well can you articulate what your solution is and how it works? Do you articulate what your approach to the question is before you write code or after?\n* If you run into problems, what do you do for debugging? Are you reading the error logs? Are you printing things to see?\n* If you are struggling with the question, do you ask questions? What kind of questions do you ask? How long does it take for you to ask a question when you're stuck?\n* Our question has one common pitfall (which is honestly quite obvious). Do you fall for this? If you do, when I explain what is happening, can you pick up on where you fell into that pitfall? Do I have to explain it very explicitly or can you pick it up?\n* Can you even code? Do you run into basic syntax problems? Do you know what help to ask me for on the syntax issues? Does it look like you barely even know how to code?\n* Are you cognizant of the time we have and what our expectations are?\n* I specifically ask the candidate two follow up questions every time the answer is solved: what is the runtime complexity and is your solution optimal. This helps me figure out what kind of more formal education the person has (because all of us remember studying big O notation, right?). This also helps me figure out if they're capable of scrutinizing their own code. It also helps me see how they tackle a problem that may not have an obvious answer (or even one at all).\n\nDon't conduct an interview with a question that doesn't have a purpose. In fact, don't do things that don't have at least half a dozen purposes. Everything I do has a purpose and helps me evaluate it. I have absolutely no problem letting you sit in silence for 10 minutes as you mumble to yourself about your solution, it will help me see how you think. Heck, if you want to sit there in silence and write no code and ask zero questions it will show me how collaborative you want to be (and I explicitly mention they're welcome to ask me questions, even to ask for help). I very intentionally do not use difficult questions because I very intentionally want to measure other things. I could care less if you remember how to invert a binary tree or the difference between Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms or any of that mumbo jumbo that, as you point out, will never be useful on the job. I do care if you can reason your way through something new and present a working solution, even if it means asking someone for help.",

With a slow interview process, I was able to get up to speed on all the other parts, and by the time I got to a a hiring manager I felt pretty good. Now I'm a team lead at that job, lol.\n\nThe biggest difference, is that to be successful today, versus in 2020, is that companies are being a bit more picky. Whether that's judging pedigree/experience with more scrutiny, or making the interview process longer and involving more steps with higher bars.\n\nEither way, making a step up is very much possible, but you'll likely have to learn the interview process and invest time into the various skills: pitching yourself, LC (or whatever knowledge base is required for ML), systems design (esp. LLM serving, ML systems), and finally behavioral.\n\nPersonally, I'll jump in about 18 months if I don't make Staff and can't switch orgs, and I'm planning about a 6 month period of interview prep, some LC, lots of sys design, and really focus on behavioral. I'm definitely a corporate-type, neoliberal and process-based thinker, and if you can lean into that it really helps.",

I studied CS, but funny enough, I ended up getting more interviews for hardware related roles than my peers with more hardware centric degrees. \n\n—-\n\n1. The pay is higher IMO\n2. You don’t have to stress about learning the latest web technologies\n3. While there might not be as many jobs available, you’re also competing with a lot less people too (multiple orders of magnitude less).  The pool of talent is also getting smaller (and older)\n4. Your coworkers may be on the older side.  That can be good for a mentorship, but also it can be hard to change some of their ways\n5. You may end up working with much older technology.  Which is cool, but also a pain at times.  Don’t ever be worried about feeling out of date honestly\n6. LLMs have a lot less training data on this subject (compared to web and mobile), so if you’re worried about AI, it’s a bit safer IMO\n\nMy only regret from University was not learning more about hardware.",

They agreed, and I became a Consulting Engineer. Technically the same pay level as a manager, but seen as a technical leader of sorts and without the HR responsibility. The downside is the opportunity to earn fat bonuses was also substantially reduced, but overall great move for my personal sanity.\n\nThe biggest lesson I learned??

People with impostor syndrome always downplay their achievements and layer it with nuances of why its not perfect etc. That will end up biting you. If you're not content with something, it gives everyone else an excuse to not be happy with it. Learn to be proud of your achievements.\n\nIf this doesn't vibe with you, my biggest advice is just leave big tech. There are many types of organizations that are much suited for your personality and you just need to find the right fit. If you can't find something that fits you, then you'd have to change yourself to fit it. The latter has always been a challenge in my 20 year career as well.",

We started doing stack ranking and below meet expectations quota for performance review last year, “following examples set by faang in the industry”.

It’s mostly for team bonding and not flying everyone everytime\n\nBenefits: faang level or better. Free lunch. Wellness fund to spend on fitness/learning. 401k matches, most general holiday schedule ive seen (yea random holidays we get a day off where other companies are working), unlimited pto with no need for request unless out for 3 weeks.\n\nComp: im not a SWE (I work on ML so we get paid on a different scale) so can’t comment too much. But i think we are FAANG level or better. On levels fyi we are consistently ranked top 10-30 most well paid companies. It’s very front loaded stock vest so first year or two will absolutely beat equivalent of google/meta/whatever, but it may cliff fast later on if you don’t perform well \n\nLeadership: can’t comment. We are founded by ex googlers, but cofounder left the company recent years. Now VPs and C Suite (CEO is ex Google shopping VP) is all ex google who are more wallstreet persona supposedly. Not sure if its a good or bad thing but certainly still trying to expand/grow. We are more of a visual search and recommendation system for inspiration expanding into e-commerce and etc\n\n\nBut like others said: we are very hard to get an offer from (i feel like we are more picku than google sometimes). We mostly only hire ex faangs or equivalent. Even ex faangs get denied without interviews all the time. So try to get into the loop first and dont set expectations too high",

Worst case usually is they will just forget about you, and sometimes they'll even wish you well and be friendly the next time you cross paths.

We had one junior (there were six of us) that had this \"don't worry it's just java web development, it's easy.\" Some of us were struggling hard and hearing this actually made one of the devs switch to a QA position.

That said, there's things you can do that will help.\n\nBreak your team's responsibilities down into pillars or silos of knowledge (your manager can help with what your team specifically works on). Usually, it's these:\n\n* Infrastructure/Networking\n* Application Orchestration\n* Observability\n* Internal Tools\n\nTo start, pick one to go deep into, and develop a passable understanding of the rest. You will accumulate a deeper understanding of everything over time, and gain an instinct for what you should understand (principles) and what you can discard (bitrotting technical details). Work with your manager to get projects in the specific pillar you want to gain expertise in if possible. If that's not possible, pick something else for now and come back to it.\n\nWhen you're working on stuff, take notes on things that you learn that could be helpful in the future. Do personal retros on particular projects/tasks that you struggled with and try to internalize the knowledge that you gained. This takes a lot of effort, and some of it may come after hours. That's why DevOps/SRE tends to get paid more though, so...swings and roundabouts.\n\nTotal honesty here: people will tell you that you don't need to be a hardcore techie to be successful, but if we define \"hardcore techie\" as \"someone who is really into understanding why systems behave the way that they do and is not content with just a surface-level understanding\", then not being one is absolutely career limiting in DevOps/SRE. Because of how fast the tech moves in the infrastructure space (while simultaneously breaking in ways that require an understanding of the underlying primitives - like Linux Networking), hunger and curiosity is a requirement. If I had to add another thing, it would be a deep appreciation for rigorous and disciplined engineering.\n\nAll that is to say - the amount of stuff to learn should bring you joy, not stress. If all it does is stress you out, it might be best to find a regular SWE job.",

        "body": "Work life balance is subjective. That's why asking directly about it doesn't work.\n\nA company that demands everyone work for *only* 60 hours a week instead of 80 hours week could truthfully claim that they have a good work life balance. And they do, relative to that other company.\n\nThat, and if you're asking questions that have an objectively right answer, of course they can just lie. They know the answer you're looking for. \"Do you have a good WLB?\" --> \"Yep!\". Easy peezy.\n\nInstead, you have to ask questions about the things that in your opinion make up a good work life balance. Questions that don't have objectively correct answers.\n\nFor example, a favorite one of mine is to ask them to tell me about a time when the team was missing a deadline, and what was done in reaction. There is no \"right\" answer to that question. It's also asking about a *specific anecdote*, so people are much less likely to lie about that, and if they try it's much harder to come up with a good story-lie on the spot.\n\nIf an interviewer said something like \"The team really came together and rallied to hit the deadline despite all odds\" for example would be a good answer to some people. To me? Red flag. That means when the team gets bad deadlines, they do crunch time to make up for it. The answer *I'm* looking for is something about dialing back scope, extending the deadline, or allocating more resources. Those are green flags. That indicates management knows how to do project management 101, and developers aren't asked to work long hours to make up for unrealistic deadlines.\n\nAnother example, I like to ask about how frequent after-hours production support calls are. This gives me insight into product stability, and in turn what the on call rotation will look like.\n\nAgain, there isn't really an objectively correct answer to this question. Everyone might be looking for different answers. I remember one time I asked this question to the hiring manager, and he got this big grin on his face and said they only get called after hours 1-2 times a month. He genuinely thought that was a good thing. Maybe it is compared to a place like AWS, but what *I* was looking for was a stable product that only gets after hour calls 1-2 times ***a year***. Not a month. I politely rejected that company.\n\nThink about what makes up a good WLB *to you*. Then develop questions asking about those things.",

If you want to expand the system you likely are doing it in Java.  Not every company has a microservice architecture where you can choose to simply write a new feature in Go.\n\nOn the other hand a lot of what would formerly be written in Java if the project is greenfield Go is becoming very popular.  I've worked at two places now that concurrently supported services written in either Java or Go.  The benefits of Go are pretty obvious since you don't need to allocate a giant arena for the JVM so cloud costs can usually get reduced using it.  So its become more attractive in that sphere.  If your company runs on bare metal that benefit doesn't really hold true.\n\nSo basically I'd say if you're looking to get a job in the near term Java is still the safer bet but I only see Go's usage increasing as time goes on.  Luckily Go is a fairly tiny language (which honestly gets people in trouble because they become expert beginners in it very quickly) so its pretty quick to learn.  You just need to learn some of the idioms of the language.  Though I typically don't really hammer people on the language during interviews anyways.  I can pretty quickly get a Java dev up to speed on how to write proper Go.",

The job wasn't really an SWE position either, was some kind of weird support gig that was supposed to lead to one.\n\nSecond layoff was June 2018, after several hops and it was the first startup I ever worked for. Landed my next job exactly a month after being laid off, like to the day. Got back into SWE full time in 2012 so at this point I had about 6 years of experience. The full interview process took about 2 weeks.\n\nThird layoff was in February 2023 and also only took about a month. VP told a bunch of us about a colleague of his that was hiring, I recognized the name as a recruiter I connected with at a conference about five years earlier. Pinged the recruiter on LinkedIn and got in the mix quickly. This one took about 1.5 to 2 weeks.\n\nFourth layoff was October 2024, and it took about a month to land my current gig. Went to a local user group meeting I hadn't been to in a couple years, which was having its first meeting in the offices of the place I now work for, also their last meeting of the year. One of their staff engineers was present and ended up sitting next to me. Struck up a brief conversation with him, we connected via LinkedIn, and I sent him my resume the following Monday.

The reason being that your current employer might resent you for forcing their hand and look for a way to get rid of you later. I wouldn't necessarily agree with that, and have taken the counter-offer in the past without negative repercussions. I did leave that employer 6 months after taking the counter-offer when I got an even better offer, so it didn't really work out for them, but it was good for me.\n* Your compensation is on the low end for the senior SWE in a super expensive city, especially given the RTO requirement. The fact that you secured another offer, and your current employer wants to keep you, means you could likely do better.\n* Outside of compensation, there might be other benefits to working at the current company. E.g. You might get good leadership experience in the new lead role. Think about whether it might be possible to move within your current company to work under a different manager.\n* If you aren't able to switch teams while staying at your current employer, I'd probably recommend taking the other offer, based solely on the fact that you described the current team as \"quite toxic\". Hopefully the new role will be pretty chill, and you'll have time to upskill on your own, then seek out an even better offer.",

You are within your rights to be annoyed, and your leverage is the fact that you can look for a different job. If the tasks are sufficiently different from the job req, you might be able to collect unemployment if you leave the job, but I am neither a lawyer or expert in these laws.\n\nIf you want to bring this up to your manager in a professional way, you should acknowledge the assignments, assure him that you intend to perform your assigned duties to the best of your ability, but then directly tell him you are dissatisfied with this type of work and it does not match the expectations you had when taking the job. As long as you continue to do your tasks well, a good manager shouldn’t hold it against you if you express dissatisfaction. That being said, they might take this as an implicit threat to leave the role as soon as you find something better. \n\nThink carefully about what leverage you have and what other options you have. If you are a high performer and aren’t too worried about finding another job, you have a lot of leverage, and you could even consider making your intentions to seek another job explicit. If one or the other of those things is not true, then you don’t have much leverage, and I wouldn’t expect your manager to change anything.",

        "body": "I'll echo the others - bait and switch happens all the time. It's happened to me a couple of times and I've unfortunately had to do that with some employees. \n\nA backgrounder on what maybe going on. I am sure given they were onboarding you in that position that the intent was to keep you there. A couple things could have happened. I don't have all the details on your particular situation but generically it can be:  (1) they really need someone to do the hardware/software integration and you're the new guy so you get to do it or (2) your performance may not be what they were looking for and they're trying you in this role because it's easier & a lot less expensive to reassign vs terminating. \n\nYeah, the second one stings and is a shitty move for the person affected. But it happens and that's often the rationale. I hired someone for a front end UI development job - had stellar references, had really good work in his portfolio, passed our coding exam - and their code quality in the first 90 days was really, really bad. Like do over with the help of a senior developer bad. IDK where we messed up in catching this but after a particularly disastrous demo with my co-founder and our sales team, we had to figure something out. He was a good guy and tried hard and asked for help. We didn't want to just fire this guy 90 days later. So we gave him very small features and a lot of customer support and operations which we needed (and were about to open a role for). \n\nThe big difference here is that I and my VP of Engineering had a call and explained why were making the role change. He was disappointed but okay with it. I think the big one here is your manager didn't have the stones to tell you why. I bet if he did, you still might be pissed or wanting to leave but at least you'd know. \n\nAlso, politically, this manager may have been told to fill that software integrator immediately by higher ups. Maybe sales is pissy because the integration isn't done or it doesn't work or whatever. He may not have had a choice. This is pretty common and may be a reason why he didn't want to tell you. Or he's a jerk or a coward.  \n\nHere's what you may want to consider: \n\n1. Have a conversation with your manager. Be friendly and open. Do not go in there loaded for bear about the job switch and presenting any kind of threat that you're going to leave. You don't have leverage. The manager could call your bluff and you're out a job. Just ask them \"hey, curious why the job role change? Is there a problem?\" And if you can hold your nose and do it, you can say something like \"I get it I'm helping out and I'd really like to get back to my other work. Can you give me an ETA or some idea of when that will happen?\".  Do not mention the other job openings, etc, etc - you're going to set yourself up for a fight that now your manager is going to feel like they have to win. \n\n2. If you don't like the answer, vote with your feet. Start looking for a new job immediately. Do a good job at your current role, keep quiet, and get out. I think you've already seen enough signs that this isn't a good company or manager to work for. These things tend not to get better. \n\n3. If your manager gives you a legit reason like \"upper management needs this role filed and you were the new guy/best choice\" or \"we need someone to cover this for 6 months\" then again you'll need to evaluate. You \\*might\\* get to back to your own role but I'll tell you that if you're filling a gap, people aren't going to want to move you. \n\nGood luck and happy to DM if you any questions.",

You might want to print out the offer letter (and JD) that says you'd be working with C++, Comp. Vision, AI etc.  Talk 1-on-1 with your manager about how this is not what you signed up for.  It sounds like they have trouble finding integrators.

Lousy pay and a ton of travel (yes, that is a bad thing), but I got a lot of very high quality experience very quickly. With 7 years experience, I'm a lead dev at an oil and gas megacorp you have heard of. So it has paid off in the long run (so far at least).

Technical writing, product management, business analysis, project management, and sales engineering all leverage your tech background while moving away from pure development work.\n\nData analysis roles in non-tech industries like healthcare, finance, or logistics often need people who understand both technology and domain-specific problems. Your programming background makes you valuable for automating processes or building internal tools.\n\nTeaching or training - bootcamps, corporate training programs, or educational content creation - let you use your technical knowledge to help others learn. Many former developers transition into developer relations, technical recruiting, or consulting roles.\n\nThe current tech job market difficulties don't necessarily mean the entire industry is collapsing. Many experienced developers are finding opportunities, just with longer search times and more competition than previous years.\n\nBefore pivoting completely, consider whether you're dealing with temporary market conditions or genuine disinterest in technical work. The job search frustration might be influencing your desire to leave the field entirely.\n\nNon-tech pivots often require starting over salary-wise and building new professional networks. The grass isn't necessarily greener in other industries, many of which have their own challenges with job security and advancement.\n\nIf you do pivot, choose something that genuinely interests you rather than just escaping current difficulties. Career changes work better when driven by positive attraction to new opportunities rather than just running away from current problems.",

You should use the STAR method as a framework without being too robotic of formulaic. It’s still a conversation. Also, it’s okay to shorten examples based on time; make sure to acknowledge the clock and be respectful of people’s time. For the question above you can do something like, “When I have a disagreement with someone I do [X]. I approach it this way because [X]. An example of me having a disagreement with someone is [X]. The outcome of [X] was [X] which I felt [X] way about because of [X].” Another approach maybe “I had a disagreement with [X] about [X] when working on this project. My approach to resolving it was [X] because [X]. The outcome was [X] which I felt [X] way about. I would do [X] differently in the future because of [X]” \n\nObviously I’m being very general here. Find a format/style that fits you and your regular speaking cadence; but yes, even if brief, you should mention examples of when you came into this scenario they’re asking about. If they ask about a scenario you’ve never experienced you can say something like “I’ve actually not experienced [X] but here’s what I would do based on a similar [X] experience I had.” Show you’re flexible, adaptable and have learned from previous experiences.

I like to format them as STAR to bring them to the front of my brain and have 5 or so stories covering a wide range of topics and regardless of the question just use a prepared story.\n\nIn general when answering behavioral questions I start first by stating my general philosophy on the matter.  So if I'm asked \"How do you handle disagreement between yourself and another senior engineer?\" I would first state that I believe I'm a smart person and I believe I work with other smart people so I like to have a thoughtful 1-on-1 conversation and find the most optimal solution.  I'll then jump into a concrete example of times I have executed this in my career typically following a loose STAR format.  You have to show examples of times you have lived your philosophy.  But again if you do \"The situation is A.  I was asked to do B.  I started by doing C which resulted in D.\" it comes off really weird and non-conversational.",

For those examples you listed like \"What do you do when you have a disagreement\" - you can absolutely start with your general approach and then back it up with a concrete example. That's actually stronger than just giving a theoretical answer because it shows you've actually dealt with these situations before.\n\nThe key is reading what the interviewer really wants to know. Questions that start with \"Tell me about a time\" or \"Describe a situation\" are screaming for STAR format. But questions about your general approach or methods can be answered by explaining your process first, then illustrating it with a real example if you have one. The goal is to prove you're not just talking theory - you've actually navigated these challenges successfully. Since you're prepping so thoroughly, you might want to check out [interviews.chat](http://interviews.chat) to practice handling these different question types and get real-time feedback on when to use STAR versus other approaches. I'm on the team that built it, and we designed it specifically to help people navigate these kinds of tricky behavioral questions where the format isn't immediately obvious.",

        "body": "Funnily enough, I was actually in almost this exact same position for my first internship. Every single person who had worked on the system had quit before I got there and there was basically no documentation. Here’s what I did:\n\n1. Spent about 1 month reading, understanding, and *documenting* as much as I could. What’s the path of a regular request? What is each backend responsible for? I also drew a massive map in LucidCharts (whatever, pick your favorite drawing site) with arrows and boxes for the different backends and whatnot. I wrote 12 pages of documentation that is likely still being referenced today. \n\n2. Make sure to make absolutely clear how cooked you are. Right now, you are learning how to navigate and understand a large, unknown codebase. Inform your manager that whatever change they’re requesting will take over a month (or however much time) because you need to orient yourself and nobody can help you. It also helps to bring up that you are only here for a few months and want to help make sure that other engineers are able to make fixes after you’re gone. \n\n3. Try to figure out how to make changes, test, and receive feedback on those changes without bricking the system. For example, make custom endpoints/functions/whatever in the relevant backend that only you know of and use those to test logic before pasting it into the actual production code. It may even be good to inform your manager and seniors what error handling/logging currently looks like, and see if you can improve it. If making whatever fix is made impossibly difficult before this, let your manager/seniors know you need to be able to properly debug or you can’t make the fix. \n\n\nThis may seem sucky, but it was honestly an excellent learning experience for me. Although frankly, your situation seems worse than mine haha. \n\nYou have to be bluntly honest about how screwed you are for whatever deadline they’re trying to push for that fix. You’re an intern lol. Making fixes in an unknown, undocumented nightmare with shit logging and shit error handling would take anybody a lot of time. What’s the worst that happens, they get rid of you? You were planning on quitting anyway.",

What make me confused in my lead told me that there is no use for making charts or diagrams because it will be outdated anyway.\n\n\\- But I do think there is a sliver lining after this is I do learn a lot of stuff that SHOULD NOT BE DONE from this abomination of a codebase. When I first received this a raised some questions about it too like how things are not supposed to be returned but here we are.\n\nI hate their smug pikachu face when I tell them that ts gonna take me more time to understand and fix.

There's not many, and they all rely on your skip.\n\nOne path that solves everything is your skip decides your manager is not performing well, and they fire them. You have no idea if they'll do this, and they're certainly not gonna talk about it with you, and even if they are going to do it this could easily take 6+ months. Maybe more.\n\nIf they don't do that, or you don't want to wait for something that may never happen, the next option is to tell your skip to transfer teams. *Tell*. You don't even need to explain yourself, they know whats up.\n\nIf they don't let you transfer teams, then your final option is to start looking for jobs elsewhere.\n\nThis won't be the last bad manager you encounter in your career.

        "body": "Building confidence in this market requires focusing on what you can control rather than external factors. Keep your skills sharp through consistent practice and stay updated on relevant technologies in your field, but don't chase every new trend. Having a solid emergency fund reduces desperation and gives you negotiating power during job searches.\n\nFor quick job placement after layoffs, preparation matters more than speed. Maintain an updated resume, active LinkedIn presence, and professional network even while employed. Document your achievements with specific metrics and keep a portfolio of recent work ready. Many developers wait until they're unemployed to start networking, which puts them at a disadvantage.\n\nThe harsh reality is that \"quickly\" landing new jobs isn't realistic in the current market for most people. Even experienced developers are facing longer search periods than in previous years. Setting expectations of 3-6 months for job searches prevents the anxiety that comes from unrealistic timelines.\n\nFocus on financial preparation over trying to become \"layoff-proof\" since job security has decreased across the industry. Having 6-12 months of expenses saved provides genuine confidence because you can be selective about opportunities rather than accepting the first offer out of desperation.\n\nConsider contract or consulting work as bridge income rather than holding out exclusively for permanent positions. This keeps money coming in and often leads to full-time opportunities while maintaining your professional network.\n\nThe confidence issue often stems from comparing your situation to the boom years of tech hiring. The market has normalized into something more similar to other professional fields, which means standard job search strategies and realistic timelines matter more than they used to.",

I'm really confident in my chances of getting an internship for web, I'm just worried that it won't matter once I apply for a real job in low level after senior year.",
