With so many applicants being shrunk down to 21 people I imagine you were able to pick exactly who you thought could just slot right in with no training.\n\nYou had 9 out of 21 fail the phone screen.  I assume this is mostly vibe based and general work based.  So I can understand why 9 failed.\n\nYou then had 3 out of 12 people fail the data challenge.  I assume this was a basic data challenge to ensure you weren't just lying about credentials.  Which makes it odd that 25% failed, but again I can understand it.\n\nBut then 5 out of 9 failed the tech review.  I find that odd that so many failed.  Was it an experience issue with the tech stack.  Is this where technical questions about the tech stack were asked?\n\nAnything you would have wished gone different?  I find the funnel here to be very lopsided.  Do you think it would have been better to start with more than the 21 initial candidates?",

It’s *wildly ambitious* and technically impressive, but also not without issues.\n\n# ✅ What It Gets Right\n\n* **Extensibility**: You can plug in your own encodings/layouts/compression (Rust traits or WASM). That’s rare.\n* **Zero-Copy + Arrow Interop**: Shares memory with Arrow without copying — great for performance.\n* **Pushdown Compute on Compressed Data**: If supported, this is huge — filter/compute without decompressing.\n* **Forward-Compatible WASM Decompression**: You can ship a new encoding + its logic *inside* the file.\n* **Handles Ultra-Wide Tables**: O(1) access to 100k+ columns using FlatBuffers.\n\n# ❌ What It Gets Wrong (or Needs Work)\n\n* **Still immature**: Tooling is limited. No wide adoption (e.g., no Spark/Presto/DuckDB support).\n* **Too complex for most**: Great for low-level devs, but not plug-and-play for typical data teams.\n* **IPC Format = WIP**: This is critical for streaming/cloud-native workflows — and it’s not finished.\n* **Limited language support**: Rust and Python are solid; Java/Go/Scala?

My personal preference I Scala, although I'd probably recommend starting with Python as you'll see more materials online using this. \n\nIn terms of getting hands on \"big data\", more difficult but not impossible. There are tons of open datasets that you can practice using Spark on. Check on Kaggle, lichess, Google Big query sample data (for this one you cna get Google credits then write out these large datasets to parquet then you are good).\n\nI have to say that Spark was quite intimidating when I started around 6y ago but there are a lot of good materials out there.\n\n\nEdit: you will require basic sql knowledge but I would learn this via Spark APIs eg.

The Apache stack is a good place to start as it is free. Be warned, it is not easy with the configuration especially if you are a noob. You can also use the Databricks free edition to practice; and perhaps sign up for the databricks academy whilst you are at it.\n\nAlso, it is best that you also learn how to set up a linux virtual machine (to run your cluster), bash, get familiar with the linux terminal commands, and master SQL. The common sql flavours are Hive, Spark, Trino and PostGres. Heck even kafka uses its own brand of SQL. Learning PySpark is also useful, especially for Spark transformations and when using the Databricks platform. Learning Java is useful if you need to go deeper into those tools, as those big data tools by Apache run on Java, and the latest and greatest features are released on Java first. Learning git and docker (containerisation) is also useful for an infrastructure as code approach.\n\nIf you are intending to just be a user of Big Data platforms, just skip ahead to mastering SQL and PySpark.\n\nYou can also consider learning cloud infrastructure too (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform) as they have their own flavours of big data infrastructure which is another rabbit hole to venture into. They have their own courses and certification programmes.\n\nFor a more holistic education, reading books on data warehousing, data lakes and delta lakes would cap it off nicely. The books by Kimball on data warehousing are one of such \"bibles\".\n\nLastly, you can consider proper schools. In my country, there are short courses by local polytechnics and universities for undergrads and post-grads, with substantial government subsidies on the course fees.",

Just off the top of my head:\n\n- To make calculations consistent across teams. If teams across large orgs aren't sharing code with one another (as what typically happens), one team might calculate the same KPI slightly differently from another. This is just an extension of the single source of truth logic that guides a silver layer.\n\n- Not all analysts on all teams are going to be technically proficient enough to produce the aggregated data they need. That's a great aspirational goal, maybe FAANG gets there with their amazing pickings. But for 99% of orgs, that just isn't happening.\n\n- Some analysts re-query the same data sets *a lot* during development.

It still has millions and billions of rows, if you let business users or data analysts build aggregations and derive kpi's from it, then you'll end up with massive inconsistencies. \n\nI have also noticed where multiple teams interpret metrics in different way and that's an issue. Let's say, \"active customers\" which can have different meaning to different people.  \n\nData is still normalized to certain extent in silver. It's really at gold layer where data is demoralized for fact tables. That's where you could take huge advantage of partitioning and clustering based on low cardinality fields like date. ",

At my company, we treat both silver and gold as consumer-facing data marts. Silver is the atomic “business objects” (equivalent to fact/dim, but without the star schema). Then we have gold models for some pre-calculated/filtered/aggregated datasets, always using silver models. \n\nThere’s really nothing wrong with this kind of structure and people who get all annoyed about “medallion” are just whining and straw-manning the topic to death.",

Your use case (drilling down by UPC, store, category, department) is pretty much textbook OLAP stuff that CH excels at.\n\nA few things to consider though:\n\n1. You'll still need to think about your data modeling. ClickHouse works best when you denormalize things into wide tables, which might mean rethinking how you structure your retail data\n\n2. The PowerBI integration exists but it's not as smooth as native connectors. You might want to test the performance of PowerBI queries hitting ClickHouse before committing\n\n3. Consider whether you actually need PowerBI at all for this. Are you embedding a PowerBI dashboard into a user-facing app? If so, any reason not to ditch it and just build some data APIs and a custom dashboard UI?\n\nDruid is also solid for this but ClickHouse has better SQL support and is generally easier to work with imo.\n\nI'd definitely recommend spinning up a ClickHouse instance and loading a subset of your data to test query performance before making any big decisions.

And the latter is sometimes difficult because although every manager loves the idea of pay-per-use, they soon find out they actually have to pay for what they use, while in the old system they did not have that dynamic. \n\nGiven the amount of overhead of running something yourself, I would definitely not rule out Snowflake. It really is a breeze, you data size sounds like you are always in a small warehouse. One important aspect is your query patterns. A warehouse starts running with a single query and remains running for at least a minute after the last query (if configured to auto suspend). If you have something that queries the data periodically, like every five minutes, this will add up very fast. The smallest warehouse is like 3k per month full time running at the higher plans, so keep that in mind.\n\nWhat I think I would recommend is a combination of Snowflake and something opensource you can run yourself, using Iceberg tables. Do the heavy lifting in Snowflake, doe the simple querying with your own computer. We are eying that currently, and I think we will save around 50% on our Snowflake bill.",

It costs $X for Y compute, and $2X for 2Y compute, and so on.\n\nThey give you a free trial to figure out your estimated costs for your usage. It's easy to determine $X/Y ratio.\n\nIt scales up and down so you can match supply (Monday morning rush, end of month workloads, that new ML experiment you want to try, basically turn off on nights and weekends) with compute demand. The important thing about the cloud is you can rent compute elastically.\n\nBUT\n\nthat $X/Y ratio for compute in Snowflake (compared to other options including DIY) is a bit of premium, because it's a SaaS and everything is managed for you \\*and\\* they are offering a lot of functionality - particularly GenAI, enterprise-grade DR, data sharing, etc - that you may not need.\n\nIt's up to you to decide if you'll avail yourself of that functionality to justify the premium pricing Snowflake charges.\n\nSo the math is simple:\n\nDIY/open source/IaaS is lower capex (\"Free!\\*\\*\\*\") + a lot of opex (\"pay people to manage it\") for ... a highly variable set of functionality. (Good luck doing AI on open source Postgres)\n\nPaaS/SaaS is higher capex (\"Snowflake is expensive!\") + very little opex (\"this thing runs itself\") for ... a fairly robust set of functionality.\n\nSo in my opinion it's not really about the size of your data and more what you (and in your case, your tenants) intend to do with it.\n\nWhen my old boss was buying new chairs for the office, he said something that stuck with me: \"When you buy something cheap, and you use it every day, you start to hate yourself for being so cheap. When you buy something expensive, and you don't use it at all, you start to hate yourself for being so careless. Be sure before you buy something you know how often you're going to use it.\"\n\nPS: I work at Databricks where basically the same logic applies, so you can trust what I wrote here, I don't say nice things about Snowflake as a rule, but they are a high quality product at a high quality price. Don't think of it as \"needlessly\" expensive  -  think of it as \"am I going to use it in a way to deliver the value I'm trying to pay for?\"",

Challenges with OBTs include:\n\n   * Some reporting tools prefer or expect dimensional models\n   * Even with columnar storage there are performance impacts from having a large number of columns, especially high-cardinality, long strings.\n   * If you are keeping raw data so that you can rebuild your OBT, then you already need versioned models, which is the hard part of dimensional modeling, to support rebuilding it.\n   * Without dimension tables getting a consistent cross-tab with all possible dimension values isn't possible.  The best you can do is spend too much time querying to get all dimension values found in your dataset, which may be missing critical dimension values.\n   * Redacting PII or other data is vastly simpler in a dimension table of 100,000 rows than in a OBT of 400 columns and 10,000,000,000 rows.\n   * Sometimes people want to see dimensions associated with an event from some other time then when the event occurred.  For example, what's the contact for this customer *now*, or name of this company *now*, or what was the industry category for the customer at the end of last year?  All of this is trivial for a dimensional model and impossible for OBT.\n   * Usability sucks with a OBT with 250+ columns\n   * etc, etc, etc, etc\n\nFor this reason I see OBTs as an occasional early version, but dimensional models as the feature-rich mature version of most analytical databases.",

And so you proceed up the hill, washing the earth and narrowing your lines every time the absence of gold in the pan shows that you are outside the spread of the fan; and at last, twenty yards up the hill your lines have converged to a point—a single foot from that point you cannot find any gold. Your breath comes short and quick, you are feverish with excitement; the dinner-bell may ring its clapper off, you pay no attention; friends may die, weddings transpire, houses burn down, they are nothing to you; you sweat and dig and delve with a frantic interest—and all at once you strike it! Up comes a spadeful of earth and quartz that is all lovely with soiled lumps and leaves and sprays of gold. Sometimes that one spadeful is all—$500. Sometimes the nest contains $10,000, and it takes you three or four days to get it all out. The pocket-miners tell of one nest that yielded $60,000 and two men exhausted it in two weeks, and then sold the ground for $10,000 to a party who never got $300 out of it afterward.\n\nMark Twain, \"Roughing It\"\n\nAbout sums it up.

We all learn at our own pace.  Some learn faster, some learn slower.\n\nThat being said, confidence comes when you can accept your circumstances and just live with it.  Make a mistake? Be fine with it.  Do a great job? Feel proud, but don't let it get to your head.  People being shitty to you when you're trying to improve? Ignore them and keep your head down.  This is all part of learning and improving.\n\nSecond advice - if you want to be concretely better at stuff, only use LLMs when you want to save time doing things you already know how to do.  If you use LLMs to completely generate the output you are looking for, you will end up with huge gaps in your knowledge.  People hate the idea of spending time learning things, lean on LLMs to do everything for them, and in a few years wonder rage on Reddit about how they can't get a job because they get rejected for trying to use an LLM during an interview.",

        "body": "Obviously, great work if you did that alone without much DE experience beforehand. I guess a few points to consider:\n\n1. How will the pipeline behave if the UI changes on the website you are pulling the data from, or if the website is down or behaving slowly? In my own experience, Selenium is quite limited to basic actions like “wait for page to load” or “wait until the export button appears.” I would assume you, as a BI Analyst, would probably know when the UI change happens since you are closer to the business user. But still, you don’t (at least you have not mentioned it) have any sort of monitoring or alerting and are just relying on everything working smoothly. So I would advise thinking about adding logging and alerts for those cases.\n2. Again, this kind of follows the second point, but it would probably make sense to add some retry logic when pulling the data if the website is slow on that particular day.\n3. Raw data is usually pretty fucking bad, and it’s the task of a Data Engineer to make the business see only pretty fucking good data. What I mean by that is: do you have any validation in place to prevent bad data from getting into your Power BI models? You mentioned you are pulling customer data profiles and geolocations, and this kind of data is soooo easy to get messed up - it’s insane. For example, postal codes being bad, or missing pieces of an address, like the street being available but not the city, etc. So I would think about adding some sort of validation for your data, if it’s not already part of the transformations you are doing.\n4. You are pulling the Excel files, applying and saving them, and then reading them and saving as parquet. Why? Literally, no offense, but why? You have two versions of the same file in different file formats stored. I would probably store the raw Excel files somewhere for archival purposes so that if you need to check the raw data, you don’t need to re-download them. But I would store transformed files directly in parquet to avoid unnecessary reads/writes.\n5. Create/replace tables is a simple, working strategy, which is cool, but really inefficient for big tables since you have to reload everything. I would suggest checking out `MERGE` or `INSERT...ON CONFLICT` statements for incremental updates so that if a row is unchanged from the previous table version, you don’t need to reload it. Also, I assume your SQL commands look like: `CREATE TABLE t1 AS SELECT * FROM 'file1.parquet';` Which is normal, but I would advise wrapping it in transaction logic. What does this mean? Imagine your tables fail in the middle, and you have 10 tables. Now you are stuck with 5 updated and 5 old tables - sucks, right? To ensure that your group of loading operations is atomic (meaning they either all succeed or all fail together), you must manually wrap them in a transaction block. That way, you know for sure that either all of them were updated, or all of them are in their previous state, but the data is still consistent between them.\n\nAgain, what you did is really solid, especially for your first time, but maybe my wall of text will help you a bit. I am also open to any comments since I suck at DE and maybe messed up somewhere. Be very proud of what you designed.",

Yes, obviously GPUs have become big — if you’re paying any attention to either the tech or finance space you would’ve seen Nvidia dominating with their explosive stock growth (you know, during a gold rush, sell shovels and all that). A much more interesting discussion around this is how the AI boom is basically keeping the (American) economy sustained; how we’re on the verge of data center infrastructure bubble bursting similar to the telecom bubble the late 90s; how we’ll have trouble feeding electricity to all these new data centers and how electricity prices will continue go up because of that and because policy makers are putting the brakes on renewables; how all this new AI tech is amounting to little more low quality slop being generated at an unprecedented rate and we’re essentially stuck with it forever. Yes, I know these technically different topics but I find them much more relevant and the educated discussions around them much more insightful.\n\nThis article is just about shifting more computing resources to hardware designed for matrix multiplications… like, yea no shit. The title is clickbait, the content is feeble, and the whole premise is weak. Regular CS fundamentals are not going anywhere and will always be a core element of computing. I find Andrew Ng and Andrej Karpathy’s statements around this much more interesting — that with each paradigm shift, the makeup of software (and hence hardware) just shifts. I get that this article is essentially saying that, but there just isn’t much there besides the obvious.",

And it's heavily focused on the parts you can copy/paste from articles or stackoverflow (basic email regex, basic dockerfile, basic fastapi setup), not the parts for which an actual data engineer is needed (considerations for filetypes, data structures, algorithms, partitioning, larger-than-memory processing, multi-node processing, data lineage, access control, data quality for a team of at least 10 to 20 contributors, etc).\n\nIf you're humble, open-minded, you connect with the team, and you learn from them: all good. As long as you have enough understanding of the fundamentals (intuitive understanding, not leetcode), we can teach you the rest.\n\nIf, instead, you feel bad about being considered a Junior at first, you feel a constant need to talk about having been Lead Solution Eng. in the past, and it's distracting you from learning the job -> won't last.\n\nPay/salary would be Junior while you grow to Medior. If you have more experience than I would have guessed, or you learn faster, I could see someone get that raise within 3 months. If you have a normal trajectory instead, it would usually happen after 3+ years.\n\n----\n\ntl;dr: Seems like a lot of info, it boils down to:\n\n- Is going from Lead Solution Engineer to Data Engineering your genuine passion/interest? If it is, enjoy it, enjoy learning, let go of expectations. If it isn't, reconsider. It seems more sideways than upwards, which means reskilling.\n- Impostor syndrome can come from your expectations for yourself. You've never worked in this field, it's not appropriate to have expectations. Become a student again. Focus on learning the needs of the role, not on yourself / your self-doubt / your perception of yourself.",

Nothing else matters, and can be seen as a negative/distraction. You could learn >99% of technologies in the world and still not get a job if you didn't learn the 1 technology the company needed.\n\nFind yourself a company that can use your background beneficially (instead of seeing it as a negative), and that's willing to give you support to fill in the gaps while you're learning.\n\nI would say \"that's it\", but to be honest whether or not you find a company like that depends 100% on the individual hiring managers you will meet/interview, and you do need to get lucky.\n\nBut the good news is that no impostor syndrome is ever needed on this path.",

The shift toward treating data infrastructure more like software has been one of the biggest changes I've seen over the past few years.\n\nI think the \"data is too messy\" argument is kinda missing the point though. Like yeah, data is messy and unpredictable in ways that traditional software isn't, but that's exactly why you need better tooling and processes around it. The messiness doesn't go away just because you're cowboy coding your way through it.\n\nThe schema as code thing is huge. We believe very strongly in general \"data as code\" principles at Tinybird (all resources defined as code and managed with version control). Seen a lot of people get burned because their production schema drifted from what they thought it was, or they made an upstream change that broke downstream consumers without realizing it. Having that versioned and trackable is just basic hygiene at this point.\n\nThe local dev environment piece is important too. One thing that I love about webdev, specifically Next.js, is just spinning up that local next server and getting instant feedback on front end changes. We've focused on that a lot at Tinybird, making it easier for people to not only spin up ClickHouse locally, but actually test the whole pipeline end-to-end including ingestion and API layer. It's a huge shift in the right direction imo.\n\nI guess the key is not just blindly copying SE practices but adapting them for data's unique challenges. Like CI/CD for data pipelines needs to handle things like data quality checks, schema validation, backfill strategies etc that traditional software CI/CD doesn't really deal with.",

You end up writing a lot of glue code just to get something usable. Some folks hack together scripts that tail binlogs, write them to disk, and then batch-load into analytics systems, but that’s pretty fragile long-term.\n\nAre you pushing this into a warehouse? How often do you need fresh data? And how complex are your schemas (lots of deletes/updates or mostly inserts)?\n\nFor what it’s worth, I work at Estuary, and we actually do log-based CDC (including MySQL binlogs) but abstract all the hard parts away. It’s more like “click to connect” and you get real-time or batched syncs with very little to manage. Kind of like Fivetran but way more flexible and with a transparent pricing.",

Keeping all that infra running just to read binlogs in a small team setting didn’t feel worth it.\n\nOne project I recently came across that sits right in this middle ground is OLake. Instead of going full streaming, it can just read from MySQL/Postgres logs in a more batch or micro batch oriented way - like you schedule a sync job with Airflow or cron or they even have temporal integrated in their UI offering, and it picks up exactly what changed. No \"updated\\_at\" hacks, no Kafka clusters.\n\nCouple of things I liked about it:\n\n* It talks to the binlogs directly, so correctness is better than column-based filtering.\n* You can still run it in “batch or micro-batch” mode, so you don’t have to keep another service always-on.\n* It writes data straight to open formats like Iceberg or simple parquets in object store, so downstream analytics feels natural.\n\nIt’s open source and lightweight (basically a Docker container you can run anywhere), so might be worth a peek if you’re looking for that sweet spot between *timestamp columns* and *full streaming infra*.\n\nRepo here if you want to poke around → [https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake)",

Don’t shoehorn your functional requirements into a framework that wasn’t built to meet the functionality you need from your system.\n\nI personally like the medallion architecture in principle, but this is the classic issue with it: shoehorning your specific use case into a framework that doesn’t work for you. \n\nThe medallion works well for what it’s meant to because it encompasses separation of concerns, e.g. land raw, untouched data in ‘raw’, cast, parse, and make data workable in ‘stg’, then join and aggregate data into usable datasets in ‘gold’/‘marts’. This makes trouble shooting easier and pipeline creation systematic. \n\nYou architecture says to hell with that but let’s call it “medallion”. It’s not, when you modify data in “raw” it’s no longer actually… raw… the medallion architecture also wasn’t built with data catalogs (thinking catalogs in the observability sense, I.e a data dictionary, you may have a different meaning. Too many new buzzwords) or semantic layer in mind. It was built as a framework for what are now data/analytics engineers to systematically build pipelines. \n\nWith that being said, forget the idea of using medallion architecture for your use case. Don’t shoehorn your functional requirements into a framework that isn’t meant support your functional requirements. I don’t like the idea of joining tables or building incremental models in “bronze”, but if it makes sense for your use case then great. Is it because you need that data for backfills/full refreshes of your catalog layer? Maybe use s3 to store that in partitioned files instead. Have a team super familiar with sql/dbt but not familiar with how to integrate with s3 and would be a hassle to train? Then that solution is out of the picture. \n\nOne last thing: report specific layers are dumb imo. Don’t do that. That’s how you get one report that says revenue was X and another that says revenue was Y because analyst B was working with VP C who doesn’t believe GAAP needs to be followed precisely and wanted his dashboard to make him feel good. Or you’ll just get duplicate queries/tables. We have an “analytics”/metrics/semantic layer organized by what fact table it stems from. That’s what works for us, it may not work for you, but we designed it to work for our use case and tech stack",

        "body": "I'm not sure where the confusion is. We are exactly making sure not to shoehorn our requirements to fit into a framework that isn't built to meet the functionality needed for our system.\n\nThat's the entire point of the post and my comments here. Whenever there is a use case that comes in front of us that doesn't fit into the way we've structured our DBT project, we figure out how to fit it in, we don't change the requirements to fit how we're doing things.\n\nMaybe someone can actually expand on the downvotes to my comment instead of pointing out other things instead? I could be completely wrong with what I said, but I can't learn anything if we're not actually responding to anything specific in my downvoted reply. Only thing I can think of is that maybe DBT's recommendations have evolved since they've added semantic layers, since you would generally want to build semantic layers on top of your silver layer, so it should definitely fit somewhere into the DBT project.\n\nAs far as how the medallion architecture works, I've seen what I've said recommended here and elsewhere before. It's like you said, just do what fits your use case. When you say raw, you mean something more raw than I might. When people at my company say raw, they mean something that you can use to rebuild anything that's raw. That might be renaming fields back to their original names, reconstructing an original field, or casting numeric columns back to varchars.\n\nThat being said, I agree with you that once you starting doing more complex stuff like incrementals, joins, etc., it stops being a view into the original raw data and starts to become something more.\n\nHowever, if you asked me if these models more closely represented raw data in a bronze layer or business entities in a silver layer, I would tell you that these models more closely represented raw data. This is because the entire intention of these models are to surface a more curated view into the raw layer. They answer questions like \"I see that X from this data source is being mapped to Y in this other data source, why are these data sources related this way?\" Then you can go into the models for each data source and see how they've been transformed so that those models can be related together.\n\nFor example, maybe there's some fuzzy search logic that builds an incremental mapping for related columns shared by the 2 data sources which then gets joined into each model. Does this change the raw data in any way other than adding new fields to these datasets? No, but is this logic that we think is simple enough that we would justify doing it on top of our source data? No. And does the result represent a business entity? Still no, because the business entity would probably be these 2 datasets joined or unioned together.\n\nHaving said that, if your problem with my original post and not my comment is that I classified that layer as \"bronze\" and don't want me to call it that, that's fine. That's not my intention and frankly I don't care what it's called, I just chose to call it (in parentheses) something I thought others would understand. Maybe I didn't explain it very clearly in my original post, feel free to let me know.\n\nFor your last note, thanks for the suggestion. I agree, we try to shy away from report-specific stuff as much as we can unless we have a really specific use case that really doesn't fit with what everyone else is doing (some nasty period-over-period metrics for example). I like your idea of an \"analytics\" layer instead, makes perfect sense.",

You’ll probably want to also tie datasets back to specific reports depending on the analysts capabilities in your organization. You should also structure this better with a historical table and what not - just explaining an example approach and not a perfect ERD. \n\nIf analysts are viewing reports (and not building) then it might make sense to have a warning label on each report that appears when the dataset is considered stale. This will depend on your analysts tooling though and if they’re viewing raw data, using bi tools, etc. \n\nYou could also use something as simple as an email group with email notifications when pipelines fail.

        "body": "You are going about it in a weird way. Go back to your management and convince them to apply the concept of an analytics window. \n\nI have worked on this problem multiple times already, most notably with logistics. It’s the same concept with deliveries in that open orders on the last few days of the month will only be closed many days after. My advice is that you get the highest possible time that the order is closed, use that as your window, and only calculate by then. This is similar to intra-day calcs where hourly measures have maybe a window of a few minutes, a variance expectation, and an end-of-day resolution via batch job. \n\nAs an example: if closing an order takes 4 days maximum like in your case, then calculate your close rate on the morning of the 5th. Basically, you’ve given all open orders from the previous month the appropriate waiting time to close. This way, you can properly report on them already.\n\nWhat of the still open orders by then? Consider them unresolved. This is an analytical tradeoff your management should accept on a monthly basis. If they find this problematic, then do multiple checkpoints: an initial view a day after the month (highest number of open orders), a view after the initial window, i.e. T+5, and a view maybe 2 weeks after. At that point, you should be able to have extreme confidence in your data. Variance should be very low, except in extreme outlier circumstances.\n\nIf revenue is being tracked using this order system, well… you’re doing it wrong. Or rather your company is doing it wrong. They should be doing that off of your invoice system, not your analytical data. It can be a placeholder, sure, but nothing says money earned as well as money that actually arrived in the bank etc. The best you SHOULD tell your stakeholders is that this is estimated revenue from orders and that it is not indicative of actual money coming in. That is for the finance department to resolve, not yours. You’re a data engineer. And unless your name is Harry, you’re most probably not a wizard either.\n\nOverall, your approach can be solved by educating your stakeholder/client/management and reaching a compromise with them. Otherwise, you are in for a world of pain.",

You pick the smaller table and do cross join and create 1000 \\* 100 rows for TBL B, you add a new col in TBL A and 100m will be divided by 100 for each salt key resulting in 1m rows per each salt key. \n\nNow when you perform join, your executor is effectively processing still 1000 from B, 1m rows from TBL A --> final count per core / executor --> 1000 \\* 1m.\n\nYou can do the math for two large tbls, the only consideration is the table which is going to have smaller rows should be choosen for cross join candidate, and your executor should have enough memory to handle this data skew in the first place.\n\n  \nI'll let others pitchin for above two large tbl joins.",

If you have access to python and pandas, use it. Doing this entirely in VBA macros would be challenging. If your team has access to their own database server, that might be an option as well. The question will be where that script will live and run on a daily basis. \n\nThe other challenge you are facing sounds like understanding how to join your data sources to get the desired output, and it sounds like even the final output structure might not be fully defined yet. You need to know exactly what level of detail your final output should be and work backwards on how to get there. My understanding as you described it, you need a current view of commercial customers based on the previous business day, at the customer level, their CCID (commercial customer ID), some data related to that at the company/business level, delivered daily to a brand new Excel file which will live in a shared folder where another team can access it. Where it's not clear, is what level of data you are looking for. If it's at the company/business level, you mentioned you only need one id per company, then what is unique about customers that you need? Dates? Their commercial  status? If at customer level, should it be customer, account level? I see two levels you are looking at that you need to resolve, commercial customer (id), and individuals associated with that id. Look for maybe a relationship code in the source that has individuals, there may be a single individual with a primary relationship you can filter on, without knowing more, it would be difficult for anyone to help you with your join issues. It will be way easier to figure it out if you can import all that data into some kind of structured database environment, and pandas can emulate that.",

You know everyone wants to just move with velocity, but you’re concerned that it comes at the cost of reliability and will not scale. Your data points are X, Y, Z. You’re experience in the past that supports this is ABC. You can use the aforementioned example but need a concrete data point how it’s caused problems or slows down the team. Do not bikeshed on it, despite the universal urge to do so that we all feel and can relate to. Then move on and focus on delivering what leadership expects of you.

You highlighted my exact concern, bringing this up in the regular meetings is basically pointing a finger at someone and that's not my intent but right now is the best time to fix this as we just redesigned and I don't know how much is dependent on it yet. Unfortunately the people id have to pull in to answer those questions wouldn't consider it a priority.  \n\nI took this job to learn about organizing, culture and workflow of larger teams and unfortunately it's been more frustrating than educational. By the time the problems get to the devs it's far too late to do anything about it, I really wish we could have useful design reviews but that was something I was hoping to learn at this job. I know how to do all this on small teams where you just communicate, not so much when trying to essentially automate different teams workloads and getting them to fit together nicely",

Too many cooks.\n\nWith larger teams it does become more organizational, which is closer to what managers and directors think about. Staff and senior staff engineers normally work with that leadership to carve out projects and scope that meet high level direction. They also take the flak when things are slow, don’t pan out, or aren’t as useful as they expected. Ideally, with good leadership principles, this is transparent to the rest of the team but also not in a way that makes the team feel unsafe. These relationships are built on trust, good examples, work ethic, and competence. \n\nBut that good leadership is VERY VERY hard to find. Even at big FAANG companies. I’ve only experienced it a couple times in my whole career. Some people never experience it.",

Airbyte’s better on cost, but the managed version still needs care, and self-hosting isn't hands-off at all.\n\nDebezium is great when you want full control, but yeah, it needs a ton of infra and Kafka knowledge. Also, some ERP sources (like SAP) can be messy with Debezium or even unsupported directly, so you'd need to extract from a staging DB anyway.\n\nWhat kind of latency are you ok with? And do you have any infra budget or internal support for CI/CD pipelines? Also curious if you're planning to land the data in Delta Lake or use something like Synapse?\n\nFWIW, Estuary handles CDC with minimal setup and works well with most of your stack (Oracle, Salesforce, etc), and you don't need to run any infra. I work there, so obviously biased, but it’s been great for hybrid teams that want CDC without becoming experts in it.",

Large Language Models use randomness in their response generation anyway, so there's a good chance this will give you some results in the case of a minor error. Just make sure you clear the LLM's cache if necessary so that it doesn't always give you the same result for a given input. \n\nMore advanced approach would be to include the error message and the previous iteration of the pyspark code along with the repeated request. \n\nYest more advanced approach would be to store error logs to disk and use those to generate some sort of repair prompt to be used in case of errors.\n\nMost important thing is to remember that if you've been doing any of these for more than five or six iterations and it still isn't working for you, that you're wasting time and should just write the code yourself.",

Perhaps different to where you are in the world, although realistically speaking you better be pretty fucking good and experienced if you're going to demand contracting rates which are typically quite high for an engineer.  For example, I have a friend who contracts for a big pharma company in a Senior position managing clinical trials.  I have looked at day rates for a standard DE role here in the UK.  Our rates are not a million miles off each other given the gulf in responsibility and impact.\n\nAside from that, this requires a mindset shift.  As somebody who was self taught, I had the same problem of trying to measure myself and going down the very dark hole of asking, \"what jobs am I good enough for?\" which eventually devolved to \"will I ever be good enough?\".\n\nThe cycle is this - you apply for jobs.  You get nothing back - you go away and improve your existing code, take another look at your CV/resume, you continue learning.  You get something back, your profile and the job market conditions are in the right place.  You keep repeating until you get something back.\n\nThere are no secrets, hacks, or shortcuts.  It's just a case of staying in the race long enough until you get your chance.",

So I’d say most important is what you bring to the role, good attitude, energy and an openness to learning and developing skills. \n\nLike mentioned before, be proactive in understanding how the product or application (s) you are working on really works. Sketch the data pipelines, the tech stack and how they fit in together. Talk to seniors when you have questions. Identify areas that are bottlenecks, have legacy systems and that can be improved. Try not to change large blocks, but find small things you can improve. This will give you confidence to do bigger things. \n\nReading books and doing courses are okay, but you learn most by solving real problems.

You can use a custom encoding fine tuned on task specific output layers but 99% of the vibe coders don’t know this.\n2. OCR works great if you use the right OCR.  Cloud based OCR APIs from Azure, AWS, Google.  All can be set up securely and are 10-100x cheaper than LLMs.\n3. Find the right tool.  Look into successors of LayoutLM specifically built for charts.

You can read Athena tables in Glue because it reads the underlying S3 data, but you cannot write to Athena tables the same way you do in the Athena console.   \n  \nThe recommended approach is to perform the transformation and insertion entirely within Glue: first, read the source data from S3 into a Glue DynamicFrame, then apply any necessary transformations using PySpark, and finally write the results back to the target S3 location in the correct format (e.g., Parquet). This way, Glue handles ETL, and Athena is used for querying, avoiding the unsupported pattern of executing Athena queries from Glue.",

Basically, each connector has a set of identical tasks, each one of which is a virtual thread in JVM. The tasks are distributed through all Kafka connect nodes, so each node has approximately the same number of running threads. \n\nSource connector tasks each have Kafka producer inside, while sink connector tasks have consumers. If you understand how simple producers and consumers work, you should easily understand why distributing Kafka Connect is much easier than Kafka itself, since most of the work is done by Kafka itself (storing consumer group offsets for example). The state of Kafka Connect is stored in special topics. \n\nDebugging should be the same as with any other JVM application. It's usually possible to run connector or task locally outside of running Connect cluster, and it's even easier so with SMT. It also supports JMX out of the box.\n\nThe real problem is that many connector plugins are not open source (for example the ones from Confluent), so you have to rely on documentation and forums.",

From there, set up a source connector that reads the latest inserts into a table and into a Kafka topic. And then after that, set up a sink connector to read from that topic and put it in another table. \n\nIf you want, you can even practice doing some data manipulation in your config files as well.

I would ask a candidate 1) what is the software engineering concept not being followed that is causing this mess (my answer: lack of DRY models and not having one purpose per model) 2) How would you go about fixing this? (my answer: start with a model used for BI consumption, understand its source tables and columns, check column level lineage for each column, come up with a plan to consolidate intermediate models after understanding each column calculation) 3) How do you prevent this in the future? (My answer: create a strong culture of preplanning and peer review, alerting based on some measure of DAG messiness in the CI pipeline)\n\nGoing from “I just know general dbt concepts and execute them” to “I can make your data ecosystem stronger with my dbt skills and promote of a culture of engineering excellence” will take you way further.",

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery.  I'd recommend looking up some videos which will explain this much better than I can.  Take a look at some blog post etc. just generally get a few viewpoints and explanations as to what it is.\n\nGenerally, you develop code for your application locally and then it runs somewhere else on a schedule.  So, you have to get your code over to the location where it runs.  The process for most workflows is develop on your machine -> push to a branch/repo -> submit pull request to main -> deploy to where it runs.  This is a CI/CD process.\n\nTo avoid it getting too complicated, your CI/CD process is likely going to be as simple as branching off main -> making changes -> pushing to your remote branch -> pull to main -> auto publishing main -> schedule application via Github actions.\n\nThis is assuming you're familiar with git and source control.  If not, this is a great opportunity to learn.",

If traffic goes via a NAT Gateway, it can be a bottleneck (and pricey).\n* Avoid casts/joins/orderings in the UNLOAD query. Precompute into a temp table, then UNLOAD.",

Even a private google spreadsheet shared amongst your stakeholders would be better. Ideally you use blob storage as a sink and the allowed system automatically uploads the files there.

        "body": "I think it might be a little bit of a misunderstanding to hear different programmers experiences about their work hours and relate that to their efficiency as a programmer. Some of us are working on legacy systems that are so vast and full of engineering debt that we could never hope to make more than small changes at a time, lest we cripple an entire business model in some catastrophic way. And sometimes the expectations of the work environment dramatically shift leaving programmers with much more to do. Environment has everything to do with it. Programmers who are first in line at a start-up building brand new products from scratch are going to go blazing fast, while those working in enterprises with bureaucracy and existing customers will need to move much more purposefully. Finally, you have to consider that different programmers will target different career velocity.\n\nWith that out of the way I also have an answer to the specific question about productivity.\n\n**Become a master of your debugging tools**\n\nKnowing how to use breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, logging services and query languages for interpreting your logs is critical. If you're operating live services you probably also want to start picking up the ability to analyze and understand crash dumps and memory dumps. The difference in velocity between a developer who can do these things, and one who can't is immense.\n\n**Find the true requirements**\n\nDon't trust your managers, PM's, or customers to be able to convey what needs to be done. Communication is the hardest part of the whole job and it's everyone's responsibility to be engaged and active in the conversation. That means you are speaking up, asking questions, understanding the why and how. When appropriate, suggest alternate solutions that make more sense than what comes out of the requirements machine. You'll save yourself a huge headache and a lot of time over massaging semi-correct requirements to be a functional product.\n\n**Code isn't always the answer**\n\nTo a hammer every problem is a nail, and to a programmer every solution is code. But what makes a really great developer is getting out of the IDE every once in a while and getting a birds-eye view on the whole operation. There are mountains of tools available to us that aren't code for solving problems. It's all programming at the end of the day, just with different primitives. But if you can meet a business requirement with a $20 off the shelf solution that already exists... define a process that eliminates your requirement at no cost, or hook up some existing set of systems in such a way that you solve what would otherwise have been a large problem with little to no code that's a big win.\n\nRemember, every line of code you write needs to be tested. Kept up to date with changing requirements and compliance demands. Maintained for the lifetime of the product. Code is expensive.\n\n**Cut out the distractions**\n\nYeah, I know, you work better while listening to youtube and passively grinding your firemaking cape isn't really that much of an attention suck. You're still getting work done. But... how about just doing those things later because regardless about how you *feel* about your distractions impact, they are slowing you down. Humans aren't particularly good at multi-tasking. And while you might be moving forward, you won't know what things you wouldn't have missed without the distraction. I listen to music without lyrics while I code, that's my personal compromise. Over the long term of many years examining myself it's evident that I'll be less productive with anything more engaging than that in front of me.\n\n**Collaborate**\n\nI wish I saw more of this. Especially in a world where many of us are working remotely, or in isolated cubical/office spaces. All of the things I've described above are easier to do when you don't do them alone. Get a teammate who's on the same page as you in terms of increasing velocity by taking your work seriously and then do it together. Sit side by side and engage in coding 'sprints' where you push for continuous progress for 20 minute periods at a time. Then rest, then repeat. Have pair programming blocks, where you work together on the same problem for an hour. Give space for 'state of the code' discussions where you just talk about what engineering problems you're encountering, and what choices or projects might change things to improve the engineering environment.\n\n**Take breaks**\n\nAfter so many hours of cranking out solutions, you'll get fatigued and slow. I remember grinding in school, getting stuck and getting frustrated near the deadline for a project. I'd spend 4 hours making meaningful progress, and then 8 just being confused, tired, and frustrated. Only to get 6 hours of sleep, wake up in the morning and look at my project and suddenly it was all clear. Take your breaks. Eat regular meals. Get exercise. Be well. When you're in a healthy state your brain will function better.",

That’s why it’s so important to stay connected, even on low-energy days. Watch a CS video, read an article, or just mess with some code. The longer you’re away, the bigger the gap gets, and the harder it is to return, so you need to do something no matter however small that might be. For God sake even just opening vs code & browsing through the code for couple of min also counts.\nAlso,  a little arrogance is actually useful. Not just belief in yourself, but that competitive arrogance of “I want to be better than others.” When everything else feels low, that pride can keep you grinding. And don’t underestimate daydreaming. Imagine what you’ll be once you finish this project or learn that new concept. Sure, it’s mental masturbation, but it feeds your feedback loop and keeps the fire alive.\n\nAll these factors — discipline, arrogance, dreaming, consistency — they don’t always burn equally strong. Sometimes one carries you, sometimes another. But they only start working for you once you actually start and keep going. You might feel like some of these things don't apply to you but they will in their due time when you are at it.",

You don't need to collect languages. They come and go (from your mind) easily. What does \"finished C\" and \"doing C++\" mean to you? You learn the syntax and semantics of a language to *use* it. If you've put effort into learning some C, you should write some software in it. You'll retain very little unless you do. It doesn't make much sense to memorise a bunch of things about a language that you then abandon, just to repeat that with the next one, and so on...\n\nAs for C++, what are you planning on doing with it and why can't you do it in C to cement your existing knowledge? If you wanted to learn C++ you could have learned the modern flavour without C first, though it won't do you any harm and there's plenty of transfer between the two (as much as some don't like to admit it).\n\nIn summary, forget your rule, slow down, choose what you learn in a targeted manner, and commit to using it for a while to test your understanding and make it stick.",

C has a variety of uses, one of which is that a few of the textbooks I'm interested in working through use C.  Another important reason for learning C is that it forces a programmer to think more \"lower level\" than other programming languages, and learning how a program interacts with an operating system to use hardware is a useful thing for programmers to learn.  Not essential, I believe, but useful.  I intend to learn C++ after, because I like that C++ is object oriented, and I'm also interested in competitive programming.\n\nAs far as you 80/20 rule, I think the way you described it sounds fishy.  Just like there is no royal road to geometry, there is no royal road to learning a computer programming language.  With that being said, I've heard people claim something along the lines of 80 percent of the total work done by a system is done by 20 percent of that system.  But the validity and applicability of a particular philosophy is not the point of this post.  I think a good, small(ish) collection of problems for either C or C++ can be found in the first chapter of Kernighan and Ritchie's book The C Programming Language.  The first chapter is a whirlwind tour of C, and there are about 25 exercises in it that covers enough of the language that the authors claim, and I'm paraphrasing, to get a programmer up and running in C.  Sounds like what you're interested in.  C++ is not C, but I suspect that you might be able to use C++ for those problems as well and get some similar out of it.  \n\nHope that helps.",

        "body": "It looks like most answers here are talking about programming-specific reasons, but here are examples where even non-programmers, and you too, 'naturally' start with zero:\n\nWhen someone is born, they are 0 years old. Their \"first\" year of life all takes place while they are '0' years old. Interestingly, there are some cultures that start *this* indexing from 1, e.g. in traditional chinese age counting, a baby is 1 when they are born. Even then though, you can generalize this to other time periods. A person's first 'decade' of life all takes place while they are 0 decades old. This is the same reason why we are living in the \"21st\" century even though the year begins with \"20\" and not \"21\". (Although note there's some annoying aspects of the definition of this type of 'century').\n\nIn many buildings throughout the world, the \"1\" floor of the building is the one above the ground floor. More rarely, although I've seen it, the ground floor may even be labelled the '0' floor. I suspect this probably has other reasoning behind it, but it's at least tangentially related. Here's some simple reasoning for why counting floors like this works and might even help you to see what's \"nice\" about zero indexing in the first place. The ground floor is \"0\" floors above the ground. The second floor (labelled 1) is 1 floor above the ground. And so on, the nth floor is labelled n-1 and it is n-1 floors above the ground.\n\n(Side note: This \"number of floors offset from the ground\" idea is how arrays are implemented in C and many other programming languages. The first element has offset 0 to the 'start' of the array, the second has offset 1, and so on. So the reasoning and math lines up exactly with this floor offset stuff).\n\nHere is some mathematical reasoning for why such indexing is nice. Let's say you have 100 people and you want to split them into groups of 10 each. You could label them 1 to 100 and then split up the groups so that people labelled 1 through 10 are in the first group, 11 through 20 in the second, and so on. However, there is a nice property that you are *almost* able to exploit here... What if everyone in the first group has a \"0\" as their tens digit, everyone in the second has a \"1\" in their tens digit, and so on? We can't do this because the first group has the person labelled 10, the second has the person labelled 20, and so on. You *could* get this nice labelling if you instead labelled everyone from 0 to 99, so the first group is people labelled 0 through 9, second is 10 through 19, and so on.\n\nIt might seem like the example above is contrived (and it does work 'extra nicely' cuz I chose 100 and we use a base 10 numbering system), but you can generalize it as follows. Say you have n people (and n is divisible by p) and you want to split them into p groups. Say that n = p \\* q, so that each group has q people in it. Then, if you label these people from 0 to n-1, you could ask each person labelled i to find the result of i / q (truncated), and that gives them the \"group index\" they are in. So group 0 would be for people that are labelled 0 through q-1, group 1 would be for people labelled q through 2\\*q -1, and so on. We wouldn't get this nice scheme if we labelled our people from 1 to n (in fact, we would then have use the equation (i-1) / q, which is effectively re-labelling our people with zero indexing!) Another interesting thing to note here is that not only does this setup work nicely with zero indexing, but it also naturally *results* in a zero-indexed group numbering system.\n\nThe above example is related to why, when working in modular arithmetic, let's say the integers mod N, the 'canonical' form of the elements is usually considered to be from 0 through N-1. When you start to learn more algorithms, you'll see that many algorithms will work nicer or the algebra may be neater if we use zero indexing. (Note that there definitely are algorithms which work nicer with 1-indexing too, so this is more anecdotal than anything, but I think it'll still give you a feeling for why zero indexing is nice). The last example also relates to why using half open intervals i.e. \\[0, N), is such a common paradigm in programming (for example, a python range includes the 'start' but excludes the 'stop'). The 'niceness' of using half-open intervals (which may also seem strange at first) is somewhat related to the 'niceness' of using zero indexing.\n\nI'm sure there's more such examples, but hopefully this answers your question in a more broad sense, and you see that 'indexing by zero' is not just limited to programming, and, perhaps unintuitively, feels more 'natural' when you think about it.",

Play around, get creative. Goldplate it (which means do extra). This happens in the real world, we refine our code (or iteration).\n\nDo PROJECTS. Focus on your Git skills. Learn topics not studied in classes. You have no idea how many new grads we get who don't even now how to merge or what rebase means which leads us to declining them.\n\nWork with friends on silly projects. Silly little projects lead to exponential gains as you learn from each other. Do code reviews of each others Labs. Maybe Dave knows something Bob doesn't, so Dave can let Bob know of this and now Bob knows this and he can pass that knowledge onto others. This way you learn of branching, merging, rebasing and the rest to keep your branches up to date with others.\n\nYou can make friends with your teachers, because guess what? They were just like you. You never know what kind of insight they can give you.\n\nAlways ask questions. Something doesn't make sense? Who cares if its a silly question, you are PAYING to be there.\n\nFor reference:\n\nWhen I was in school, I took 7 classes a semester and still practice coding 2-3hrs a night. It seems like a lot, 2-3hrs? \"are you kidding?!\" No. 2-3hrs is so small, you might not even get any code written while you are learning how to, for example: API REST points for a silly CRUD app.\n\nMy friend group which was roughly \\~7 of us, all code reviewed each other, would hang out in Skype (oh god I'm old) and just do silly little things. We would all work on projects (not all 7 at the same time) and we would knit pick each other, say \"man this is stupid, do it this way\".\n\nNot only will you make friends, you are all uplifting each other, and you will all succeed because that group work is more beneficial in skill than working on a Lab in your class.\n\nBUT MOST OF ALL?\n\nHave fun.

You have class time, homework, and that's pretty much it. If you have questions, you ask in class.\n\nUniversities are different. Professors and TAs offer office hours, and you really, really should take advantage of them. Do the homework, go discuss it in office hours to just see what they say. Most of the time, the person having office hours will be completely alone and you won't be interrupting anyone else's time, because *no one seems to do this*. \n\nI took a graduate level Computability and Complexity class in my senior year. Another student and I learned the professor liked latte's. We'd buy him one and go to every single office hour he offered. We'd talk to him about the class, get extra help and insight into the material, and it was absolutely critical. Without that I would've failed the class, but I ended up getting an A.\n\nAnyway, that's just general college advice. For CS specifically, I'd say find the things you're interested in, whatever you're passionate about, and pursue those in classes if they're offered, and if not, find professors who can point you in the right direction (again, office hours!) to help you pursue them as side projects. \n\nI wouldn't worry about trying to learn as many languages as you can. Pick like two or three and learn them really well. Something systems level like C/C++/Rust, something very high level like Python, and something like Java/Go/C#/some other garbage collected but very productive language.  \n\nOne of the best things I did was to become a grader. It was sort of like a TA position, but we just graded projects and held office hours, we didn't teach classes. If something like that is available, I'd highly encourage doing it. It's one thing to learn how to debug your own code. Learning how to work through 30 other people's code? That's an irreplaceable experience. I mean I was paid to learn how to read and evaluate other people's code, and that is such an important skill. It's something they don't really tell you will be important, but when you're working in an existing codebase and with other people who are also contributing to it, you'll need to not only be able to write your own new code, but also to read other code that someone else wrote (and also your own 2 to 5 to 10 years later when you're a completely different person).",

(I joke, I like Rust overall).\n\nOnce you get into writing things the Rust way (TM?) you get to worry less (but not forget about completely) memory bugs that can cause crashes or be exploited. The benefits are many and varied. Rust also has a nice type system if you're into that, and nice language-level support for tagged/discriminated unions, and matching. If you're into function style/idioms, you'll feel at home, but if you're used to OOP there's plenty to recognise too, e.g. struct/impl/traits. I've often said my ideal general purpose HLL would be a cross between C and Rust (yes, I know about Zig and Odin), because I like both but find Rust annoying to write (especially when code involves lots of explicit lifetime annotation) and visually quite information-dense (IMO).\n\nI much prefer C, me/my teams rarely have most of the issues that the Rust compiler guards against, but nobody who likes Rust believes you when you say that :) I like to configure debug and release builds from the get go, and use the sanitisers (address etc.) in debug always. I have a big list of flags I use for compilation config built up over the years. LSPs and a parser (e.g. treesitter) catch some typos (e.g. . instead of -> or missing a \\*/& etc.) too.\n\nRust has no bearing on your Azure cert AFAIK, and to be honest it hasn't seen massive uptake commercially (yet?). I know lots of businesses (previous employers or places friends work) that are still using C and/or C++ with no interest even in committing to writing new software in Rust, let alone rewriting anything existing, anecdotally. I say this to say that the Rust job market isn't what it is for other languages (e.g. your C#, Java, others like JS and Python) which are seeing lots of use in recent years.\n\nThere are also better languages if you want to learn how to manage memory freely, as Rust enforces it's particular model.\n\nTLDR; Learn Rust because you want to. Don't if you don't. You aren't disadvantaging yourself by not learning it, and it's fairly easily picked up if need be once you've been programming a while. It can be used to write fast, robust native software. I use ripgrep, fd, every day.",

And eventually, you will have to learn most concepts anyway (you will find along the way that languages all have a lot in common). If your end goal is making games for a console, it's not going to be an issue at all to start in those languages. To directly answer your question, i would advise picking an ergonomic language to let you focus on learning the fundamentals instead of fighting the quirks of the language. Relative to BASIC or assembly, C will feel much easier",

Programming has certainly become a frontier extremely difficult to navigate these days— especially with the advent of AI.   \nThe only sure way to learn programming— and take my advice —is to try out open-source programs.   \nWhen I mean trying out, I don’t mean only to use it, but also to download the source code and compile it yourself. Study the code in a Sensible manner, and augment it, or see how far can possibly augment the code without breaking.   \nDocumentation Is very important, but let me tell you an Industrial-secret: \\[nobody, not even the guys who created Assembly-language itself know entirely what they are doing— nobody has the perfect idea atleast\\].   \nWhat does this mean? Trial and Error. And only by using this method, can you fully accomplish learning Industrial methods of engineering software.   \nYou may have noticed a sinister pattern. There is a broad Inequality in the spectrum of projects covered in courses and tutorials offered on the internet. Even then, they are often too basic and fall behind industrial specifications.   \nEven then, open-source softwares lag somewhat in certain areas, compared to the truly Industrial softwares produced by og Software-devs at the beginning of the Digital Age. This is because— and undeniably so — the best software is hidden behind  a pay-wall, and rightly so. \n\nSo, while dabbling with open-source is an excellent way of updating your learning, it also isn’t enough. But I wouldn’t recommend the ‘Grass-roots’ approach to programing— it’s just impossible. You need vast amount of people-hours to construct even most basic programs. Libraries develop, sure. But they are often by-products of designs intended for specific projects. This, in the end adds up to the inefficiency of the entire system. That is why, companies at-times resort to constructing their projects from as further back as possible— ie. CPU architectures. This is perhaps the best way to increase efficiency.   \nWhat does this mean for you? It means, that using Libraries aren’t as good as making libraries.   \nTo sum up everything I said in a way beneficial to you: begin by using and testing open-source software; don’t become Frustrated knowing that you can’t make a software like ‘TempleOS’. Making an excellent and efficient software is as difficult as building the pyramids. You need large man-hours. \n\nSpeaking of TempleOS. I am sure even Terry, the creator of TempleOS, understands how he was limited by the hardware— which was obviously impossible even for him.   \nI say that, because people pretend as if it is the most efficient software ever written— it isn’t.",

You contribute to open source because you've got expertise worth contributing. You don't have to be an expert, but a beginner is unlikely to be able to even understand the codebase and the outstanding issues well enough to make useful contributions.\n\nPeople will sometimes highlight \"this would be a good issue to work on for a beginner\" but they don't mean a beginner programmer - they mean an experienced programmer who is new to that open source project or even new to open source in general.

Here's my suggestions for what's been helping me.\n\n\nFirst start your own open source project. Work on a project you want to build, but look up the work flow and follow a basic structure large repos might use and make a CONTRIBUTING file based on some real ones from other projects. You can use it to learn forking, how do write an issue, how to write a PR, how to merge commits. When you're doing it make sure you write everything like you're writing it for someone else and tag any really easy things with good first issue. These will often get picked up by others. Then you'll get a chance to see the basics of what maintainers are looking for in other people's code, and you'll get experience with light collaboration with others. \n\n\n\n\nAfter doing this for a while you'll feel way more confident in how to contribute. Then you just have to find issues that are within your scope. That's easier said than done, but I'd look for medium sized projects that aren't as well know. At that point you'll have some experience and you can look to helping out in larger and larger projects.\n\n\n\n\nIt's not a fast process, but I've found it rewarding so far.",

For example, I didn't really \"get\" the quadratic equation until a teacher did a proof of it, so I could see how to get there from what I already knew.\n\nThe other big way to connect new concepts to existing understanding is through analogy, but different people have different existing knowledge to connect to. For example, most math students wouldn't be helped if you said \"domain is the set of all valid arguments for a pure function, and range is the set of all valid return values\". In your case, though, that may be a useful analogy. So for the function: int.ToString(), the domain is all integers from - 2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647, and the range is the set of all strings that match the regex \"\\-?\\d{1,10}\"",

Even if the database in question uses some other query language (Neo4j uses a special language to query graphs called Cypher, Mongo uses a specially crafted JSONs, etc) the ideas for data selection and aggregation are often transferrable between them. So, doing good at SQL will open doors to data science, business analysis, database performance work, and in general will make you more valuable for every developer team in the future.\n\nAnother one such \"language\" is regular expressions. Python may not be a good language to learn and use them because AFAIK it lacks special syntax support for them, but Ruby, Rust, JavaScript have better syntax for them. Learning regexes *well* will help you work with unstructured data, extract data form text, logs, do data migration between systems, and do quick changes to text files including some advanced search-and-replace operations in your code editor. It's a very good supplemental skill to have.\n\nLearning Shell scripting is my third recommendation. Learning how to combine programs together, build pipelines, learning SSH tunneling - all of this will be useful over decades, too.\n\nA large pert of programmer's work is spent outside of their primary language, so getting comfortable with the world besides `if`s and `for`s is always a good idea.",

On Windows you could make a pure Windows app for Pong, on Linux you could make a pure GTK Linux app for Pong. On some platforms like macOS or Android you could write an app that's 99% C with a tiny bit of another language to set things up and write Pong. None of them would be the same.\n\nWhat msot C books or courses will teach you is stuff that's a little more abstract - just problem solving and data manipulation, rather than building a complete app. That reflects how C is used these days. It's the foundational language used behind the scenes of everything so it's really important to know - but it's not the main language used to build apps and the software people actually use.\n\nMy advice would be to start with Harvard's CS50x. It includes C but also other languages.",

Most companies will have designers who create mockups/wireframes for you to implement. You won't usually be designing from scratch unless you're at a tiny startup where everyone wears 10 hats. Your job would be taking those designs and turning them into actual working code.\n\nThe fact that you've got CSS, HTML and most of JS down is solid. Frontend is way more forgiving when you're learning because you can actually see what you're building instead of staring at terminal outputs all day.\n\nAt Metana we see students make this exact transition all the time. Backend concepts like databases, server architecture, APIs etc can be overwhelming at first but frontend lets you build confidence with visual feedback. Plus the job market for frontend is pretty decent right now.\n\nMy advice would be to pick one path and stick with it for now instead of jumping around. If styling feels more natural than wrestling with Express, go frontend. You can always learn backend later once you're comfortable with one side of things. The whole \"full stack\" thing sounds cool but honestly most people end up specializing anyway.\n\nAlso stop using Mimo and start building actual projects.

Good times!\n\nIt depends what interests you. I started with C++, which was good because it's one of the most popular and well-supported languages there is, but it's relatively hard to get into. That was ok for me though, because I liked the challenge and learn how things worked under the hood, like how computers manage memory with pointers and all that.\n\nToday I program mostly C# and it's a fantastic language that's quite easy to pick up and very powerful. You can also use it for Unity or Godot game engine.\n\nYou can pick Java too which is very similar to C#, but I like it slightly less for some reason.\n\nPython I usually advise against as a first language, because of its dynamic typing and you might learn some things you may have to unlearn later on. On the plus side, Python is very good to know for prototyping and automation and it's very popular and you should definitely learn it at some point. I think it will be the most similar one to Lua, so if you want to try something a little more challenging and new, maybe pick something else.\n\nDefinitely dm me if you would like to chat or would like a code review or something.",

When you get stuck literally type the question into google no matter how stupid it may sound (ie. how do I make a string in typescript). You can google your way through the entire app if you need to. After you find yourself googling and writing (not copy pasting) stuff down over and over, then having to tweak some things to fit in your exact project. Then it will begin to click.\n\nThen you start realizing some patterns, the earliest one is programming is just a bunch of variables, if statements, and loops. You can then try to build little more advanced apps.\n\nYou just repeat this for a couple months and you will be making stuff you couldn’t even dream about when you started. Your calculator app you created will become a complete joke and you’ll probably consider just deleting it.\n\nA paid course will not teach you anything you can’t find on google. Some have the argument that it provides structural learning. You know what the best structural learning process is? When you figure out problems as they present themselves to you. So just start programming.\n\nEdit: Watch a short YouTube video and write some things down too if you find yourself in the position of not knowing what you don’t know.",

Some math maybe, but how deep do you really go?  \n  I had to take a lot of math, as an electrical engineering student.  I was slow to catch on, but I loved computer science.  Computer science is more than coding.  Trying to pull trig and algebra patterns out of your head to solve a calculus riddle is math I don't like.  But doing reductions of digital logic circuits using math algorithms was fun for me, and I did better some some people good a traditional math.    \n  Solving computer science homework/exam problems was hard for everybody, and I had my moments, but you have to picture in your head where you want to go, write it down in pictures, then you can conjure up the code to get there.   Well, at least for me.  Sometimes my code was called \"brute force\", but I didn't care, it worked and computers are large and fast these days.  \n\n  Sometimes  you have to take \"poetic license\" with the requirements of the problem to solve it.   I once had a class problem involving recursion.  It said each iteration had to spawn the next using the previous values.  The entire class literally had the method spin off another thread, until the computer cried out for mercy.   I just sent the values of the output back home to the main, made junk collection destroyed the method and recovered the resources, and created a new one, with the saved values.  Yeah, sound obvious to you now.  :)   The rest of the class thought I cheated.  The professor gave me a strange look, and said it was OK, probably because I had the only working solution.    Just solve the problem.  That means first map out how to get from here to there.  The coding actually becomes a bit relaxing until you reach compile time, and moment of truth.",

To a lot of us, the \"everyone else knows more and are better than me, how can I hope to keep up\" is just something our brain does that feels real but isn't, just like visual illusions and lots of other mistakes brains make. The feeling might even be mutual!\n1. My impression is that there seems to be something for programming that's similar to dyslexia or dyscalculia, as in, there seems to be some people who just don't get it, for reasons that appear incomprehensible to people who don't have the dysfunction. Having been an assistant in some courses, my impression is that it's very rare, but that there are some people who seem to get an experience that's a combination of [it goes in the square hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUbIkNUFs-4) (as the piece-tosser, and don't understand why the girl is upset) and [computer says no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0YGZPycMEU). I think it's unlikely that you'd last several years if that applied to you.\n1. There are several different types of programming environments, and what clicks for someone might not for another. As in, I have small experience with [LabView](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabVIEW) and don't want any more, but I have a friend who loves that and detests \"ordinary\" programming. Similarly, I find some languages like JS very hard to reason about because they're so … sloppy, and prefer rather strict languages; but there are plenty of people with the exact opposite preference. Finding out what _your_ preference is is also a key to feeling like you get it.",

It introduces you to all of the basic programming concepts like loops control flow variables while obscuring away explicit memory management or data types. It is also quite good  at a lot of data processing work because of the intuitive way it handles lists so there is a big market for python devs. Once you get a decent understanding of programming concepts, then moving onto something like c or c++ may be a better idea because you won’t be fighting to develop a mental model of both high level and low level cs topics at the same time.",

In the second one you ask what a \"beginner\" should do. The term beginner suggests to me a person who is learning to play the piano. Learning programming is nothing like this. It is more like learning calculus. If you are trying to learn programming this way, I cannot advise you, because I don't believe you will succeed no matter which language you learn. So let's assume you are not a beginner.\n\nIf you are a scholar, I recommend that you learn LISP. Every language that is considered a \"scripting\" language owes everything in its feature set to LISP. If you complete all of the exercises in ANSI Common LISP by Paul Graham, you will understand most programming languages better than 90% of all programmers. It is kind of like learning Latin. After this, every language will be easy.\n\nIf you are an engineer, I recommend that you learn C. Every language that is considered a \"scripting\" language (and even most that are not) directly or indirectly calls the C standard library, and thus C. In fact, C has practically a one-to-one correspondence with assembly language, which means if you learn C, you can learn assembly and understand computer hardware quite easily. By extension, you will understand everything running on your system, even if you don't know all of the details of that particular language.\n\nIf you are neither an engineer nor a scholar, I recommend that you learn Python. It is the simplest, most logical, most approachable, and one of the most popular languages. Anything that is worth doing can be done in Python, and if you cannot learn Python, you cannot learn to program in any language. However, if this is what appeals to you, I think you will be better off in another field, like data science.\n\nIf you are only interested in computer science for the money, I recommend that you learn Java. You will have no trouble finding work, and you will never truly understand anything about programming or computers. Since that wasn't your goal anyway, everything will work out fine.",

Still, there are jobs that prefer or demand Typescript knowledge, which is just strictly typed Javascript. That means learning about interfaces, generics and type literals, which is nowhere near as hard because I know most of that from Java. \n\nThe idea I'm getting at is that knowledge of the concepts I learned in Java are helping me now, even though I never use Java. Now change the scenario and let's say I built projects with Java, but had to switch to C or C++. Then I'd be blindsided with memory management and pointers which take a long time to master, and time isn't on your side  with so many bills to pay.\n\nLanguages like Ocaml or Haskell are difficult to learn and I don't see many jobs for them. They are functional programming languages and most languages are OOP or procedural, so I think that these may be best saved for last or skipped entirely.",

Bear in mind that if you do things like wildcard queries, you will end up scanning the entire \"users\" table on every search.\n\nIf you care about scaling to large numbers of users, then you'll want to use a full-text search engine that can use an index for efficient searching.\n\nI'm not familiar with Prisma, but it seems to be a wrapper around Postgres, and Postgres supports full-text search using the `tsvector` and `tsquery` types. This allows you to create an index on a *tokenized* field, so that searches can efficiently find only the rows containing those tokens. You can customize the tokenizer to do things like approximate searches, where the tokens are partial words instead of complete words. All of this is relatively straightforward in Postgres, but I'm not sure whether/how Prisma exposes it.\n\nIf you need even larger scale, and you don't want your database to become a bottleneck for searching, then you'll want to use a search engine that's separate from your DB, such as Elasticsearch or Solr. This adds a lot of complexity because whenever the data in your DB changes, you have to synchronize those changes to your search index.",

It contains links to all sorts of resources that noobs can use. I don't pretend to be an expert. But take a look and maybe you'll find a beginner's resource that works for you.

This was 15 years ago so it's not all applicable (IMO the bar is so unreasonably high now) but maybe it'll help.\n\nI graduated in 2010 with a business degree. We were still coming out of the Great Recession and I had no idea what was going to happen. I only managed to land a job because I played World of Warcraft with someone who lived in the same city and he offered to refer me.\n\nIt was a back office position, mostly trade support and compliance. Not riveting or lucrative stuff. At this point, I probably had two things going for me: I'd been working with computers in some capacity since I was 5, and I had recently done an internship where I was exposed to VBA and general scripting.\n\nAfter about 6 months on the job, I started playing around with VBA to automate parts of my daily tasks away. My manager was very supportive and so were my IT folks. After that, I snowballed because as I wrote scripts to automate my work away, I had more time to experiment. As I experimented, I collaborated with other teams to automate parts of their work.\n\nAfter a year, I got poached by a hedge fund. I learned a few more things, but it was a bad environment for me and I got fired inside of 3 months. Luckily, I had built my VBA skills enough that I got contracted to work on a year-long project at a large financial institution.\n\nAfter that project, I joined a consulting firm where I used my VBA knowledge to make Excel and PowerPoint do some incredibly complex things. After two years, I realized I needed more; I didn't want to stay in this niche and I saw the writing on the wall that this might all go away in the medium term. A friend from college I kept in touch with referred me to his company.\n\nThat was my first opportunity in a tech company. But I wasn't a software engineer, more of a \"solutions\" engineer. But I applied everything I learned into this new role. Except instead of VBA and Excel, it was Python scripts, PHP, SQL, and a bit of Bash. I also made sure to understand the ins and outs of our entire tech stack.\n\nTwo more years, I made my way into FAANG and haven't looked back since (I'm no longer in FAANG, but I'm still in tech, making more money than I ever thought I would).\n\nA few takeaways would be that networking is important, but it can take on many forms that are conducive to introverts (I'm one myself). How many people can say they got jobs through World of Warcraft? Another thing is, everyone runs their own race. I'd say the first 5 years of my career had little direction, and it wasn't until 7 years in that I thought to consider myself a software engineer at all, but each step I took was a calculated risk to incrementally get me there. I was always adjacent to the tech, to the code, and demonstrated value to the point where the developers started listening to me.\n\nIf you have an opportunity to now, I would encourage you to take whatever computer science courses you can to set yourself up. You can always teach yourself (as I did) but sometimes learning in a formal, structured setting has its benefits.",

See, websites are done with HTML, with the help of CSS to add aesthetics and JavaScript for making them dynamic. But there are frameworks done in Python that has to do with it.\n\nAn example is Django. It enables you to easily make a web app with python. You make some HTML templates, and install some Database program. Django then runs a web server, which takes the templates you make and fills it with data from the database. It also reads user input and makes it into data that gets stored on the database. How all of that is done is what you do with Python on Django.\n\nBut as the good ol' saying says: \"Jack of all trades, master of none\". Python **can** do pretty much anything, but that does not mean it is the best for everything. For example, if you want to do raw number crunching and high performance computing, Python is really slow, so languages like C or Fortran are more used in there.",

I believe you need to know how a program runs before you start coding. Also, I believe beginners don't know how to pick an appropriate size project, and that if they start projects right away, they fail to learn the basics, in particular, control flow. \n\nThat is, imagine you're a debugger (a program that lets you go step by step through a program). Could you do that without using a computer, that is, if I gave you a simple program, can you determine what it does?\n\n**Alternate approach**\n\nMany others find the standard method I've described boring and therefore hard to motivate themselves. So, they do the following\n\n* Pick a project\n* Google a lot to find enough relevant information to code it\n* Learn enough about coding while doing the project\n\nWhat they like about this approach is they are building something which is something they *enjoy*. Does everyone enjoy this? No, they don't. But for those that do, this kind of thing is super rewarding.\n\nHowever, there are problems with this approach. The first is it works for only a small number of people. They're able to find answers to what they're looking for. They are able to learn enough about programming to accomplish the task.\n\nTo me, this is the equivalent of going to a foreign country and trying to pick up the language on the fly. You read a few common phrases, and trust the people know enough English and can decipher your accent enough that you get by. Some find that approach better than an academic approach where you learn how to conjugate verbs and learn grammatical structure.\n\nWhen someone opts to do projects, they want to find something interesting and cool, but even the most boring programs you can think of (Hangman, Tic-tac-toe) are quite difficult for most beginners, and they want to write 3D first person shooters or have some AI or do some image or video processing. There are things they think are pretty easy, and it's incredibly difficult.\n\nHowever, you'll see more people posting \"do projects\" than the more academic approach.",

Thats the main skill you need as a programmer anyway, so what are you truly getting out from a course you pay for? Not a lot to be honest. A degree or a certificate (a valid certificate like the cyber world has) is another thing that may make paying for a course worth it, but you arent getting that from Udemy or CodeAcademy.\n\n\nSeriously, go check out the thousands of playlists on youtube for free. Hell, you can go take Harvards CS courses online for free if you really dont believe valuable knowledge is out there for free and see for yourself.

Using the knowledge you know to build something will teach you more than any course, because you get hands-on experience as to how something works and why it works.\n\nSo, are paid courses worth it?

For example on ARMv8 and above there are 4 privilege levels, which they call Exception Levels, with EL0 being the unprivileged level under which regular user applications execute, EL1 being intended for kernel supervisors, EL2 being intended for virtual machine hypervisors, and EL3 being intended for firmware security monitors.\n\nOn macOS you only have access up to EL2, and that requires using either the Hypervisor or Virtualization frameworks to create a virtualization environment (the Virtualization framework is a very high level virtual machine implementation on top of the Hypervisor framework), but you can run unrestricted EL3 code on all AArch64 Raspberry Pi models, so if you're interested in privileged bare-metal development, the Raspberry Pi is likely your best option. On the other hand, M4 Macs are already on ARMv9, which is pretty similar to ARMv8 as far as unprivileged code is concerned but significantly different for privileged code as many system registers were added, changed, and removed since ARMv8, plus the M4 in particular also has 512-bit Scalable Matrix Extension support, so depending on what you want to do, that may or may not be appealing to you.\n\nGeneral purpose AArch32 and AArch64 HTML documentation:\n\n* [ARMv6M, ARMv7, and ARMv8 assembly reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0801/latest/);\n* [ARMv8 and ARMv9 instruction set architecture](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/latest/)\n* [ARMv8 and ARMv9 system registers](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0601/latest/)\n\nDocumentation specific to the SoCs used by the Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 and their derivatives:\n\n* [Cortex A72 reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100095/latest/)\n* [Cortex A76 reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100798/latest/);\n* [ Generic Interrupt Controller core reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0471/latest/);\n* [Generic Interrupt Controller v2 specific reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0048/latest/);\n* [PrimeCell 0111 UART](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0183/latest/);\n* [BCM2711 datasheet (Pi 4)](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/bcm2711/bcm2711-peripherals.pdf).\n\nOther resources:\n\n* [Bare-metal section of the Raspberry Pi forums (I help there sometimes under the same name as my reddit account)](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewforum.php?f=72&sid=de4c2c97b2b1372281ef64d6aed3dc5f);\n* [Tutorial that got my feet wet on AArch64 (I already had experience with AArch32 from decades ago)](https://www.rpi4os.com/);\n* [Rust HDMI audio driver that I made for the Pi 4 and 5](https://github.com/CodexTextor/rpi-hdmi) (will not work on the BCM2712 D0 stepping SoC used on models of the Pi 5 introduced after I wrote that code because the physical addresses of the hardware are different).\n\nNote that there's no public official documentation for the BCM2712 SoCs of the Raspberry Pi 5, so all my code targeting that platform is based on my own reverse-engineering research effort that included reading the official Linux driver code from Broadcom, messing around with hardware registers on Linux to figure out how they work with a proper driver, and deriving knowledge from my experience with and available documentation for the BCM2711 SoC of the Pi 4, since there was very little community work done on this front when I got my first Pi 5. If you go the Raspberry Pi route I also recommend getting the Raspberry Pi Debug Probe, installing OpenOCD, and reading [this thread](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=362067) on the Raspberry Pi forums for the OpenOCD script.\n\nAs for setting up the environment for native development on macOS, you don't really need much beyond Xcode's command-line tools, which you can install by typing:\n\n    xcode-select --install\n\nAnd then following the on-screen instructions.\n\n---\n\nEdit: Added Xcode command-line suggestion.",

        "body": "Disclaimer: im still in uni for CS, but after interviewing and reading up on what web dev vs web design is like in industry, I have a few pointers I want to share.\n\nAt least in the realm of web dev and web design, some of the tools you would need for design would be Figma (building UI/UX designs), and other programs, but you wouldn't be programming much. But, im not all too familiar with design compared to web dev. If you are trying to design AND build them, learn CSS very well, classic styling tool.\n\nAs for web dev, you should get yourself familiar with the different components, such as frontend (what users see on the webpage), backend (logic for website components), and database (storing data related to website). Also look into different frameworks, which are just groupings of tools and languages for building. Some popular frameworks include react/node, laravel (php based), and spring boot is gaining attention recently i think. With web dev, you also pay attention to different layers such as optimization, memory consumption, so if you're into optimizing processes, this could be a good path for you too.\n\nPersonally, I like web dev over web design, although it's nice to know a bit of both. For instance, if you're doing freelance work as a web dev, it's important to know ui/ux design to make your websites look sharp and user-friendly. You should pick which path you want to take based on where you find satisfaction. For me, I absolutely love building something and seeing the hard work I've poured into a project after it's done.\n\nBest of luck, and everything will be okay no matter what you choose!",

For instance, processing optimization would be c++, rust, go. Memory allocation/optimization would be c or c#. If you're trying to program AI or ML integration or data analysis, look into python. Python is easiest to learn in my opinion, but it is not as fast as c++.\n\nBut then again, im not an expert, so I would strongly urge you to do your own research so that you can figure out what you think is best. I personally like C++ most and it was the lang I was taught at the beginning, but it really depends on what you want to do!\n\nAlso, just a quick tip that with being a good programmer, on top of having a language you know in depth, its crucial that you know how to adapt to new languages quickly. But don't worry, focus on one language for now, and understand the fundamentals of programming like data structures, algorithms, etc., and programming will become a lot easier.\n\nLet me know if you want to know anything more :)",

When I first started learning web dev, I started from the very basics with react, and I got some good fundamental knowledge there. I would probably get a book, but only for very fundamental stuff like c++, javascript, or Java, although this is just a recommendation.\n\nAlso, projects, projects, projects!! Practicing code in any way that is challenging yourself is probably one of the best ways to expand your skillset. Choose a simple project to work on that you have an interest for or would help you out in your own life. Just a fair warning that if you choose to use AI, try not to use it all the time, and use it wisely. I used to use chatgpt, copilot a lot when I first started out, and it's a trap, and it doesn't help you learn despite how fast you get things done. Really nail these concepts in by turning off copilot and learn how to read documentation too.\n\nLastly, don't be afraid to fail. Failure is one of the best ways to learn. Don't be too concerned with what are the best practices for something at the very beginning. Programming is all about problem solving, so try to solve the problem yourself first, and then look into better practices afterwards. This way, you don't get overwhelmed by the varying different solutions to different problems.",

        "body": "I think the term your looking for is \"plain text\" rather than ASCII.  A web page full of markup can be plain ASCII.  And you can have lots of non-ASCII characters that are perfectly readable.\n\nIt sounds like what you're looking for is a way to simplify a website to get it just the readable bits?  If so then this is a great little project.  Let me set some expectations for you though.\n\nThere are different degrees of solving this because all websites are constructed differently.  For simple websites this will be a good challenge for an introductory developer like yourself. \n\nAs websites get more and more complex, and have multiple components and internal frames that get loaded, or use dynamic loading, this becomes more and more of a challenge.  You could come back and revisit this problem for years to come as your skills grow.  Some websites are almost designed to make what you are doing here next to impossible. \n\nSo bottom line don't be surprised if what you build doesn't work for all sites at first, but it still will be a good exercise for your time, and possibly will make for an actual useful tool regardless.  I'd recommend targeting Wikipedia at first as I believe its pages are constructed fairly simply.\n\nFor a much more complex example, try extracting your receipts from Kroger or Costco.  In both cases the nice viewable page you're presented with is constructed in your browser, in Kroger's case from multiple sources,  and would be very hard to read the text of directly.  But that can wait until much later.",

Anyway, in other areas of life, I've had people suspect things about me that weren't true, but they just \"knew\" they were right and were completely wrong. If a candidate's not using AI is so important that the mere suspicion of their using without the actual confirmation of it is enough to get the candidate essentially black-listed, then companies should only test candidates in environments in which using AI is not an option.",

I was able to get a new position relatively quickly.\n\nMy strategy:\n\n1. Go onto LinkedIn, filter by recently added, apply to pretty much anything relevant with under 100 applicants. The lower the better. Do this multiple times a day, since postings get updated all the time. Don't even bother with anything over 100 applicants. 0-10 is the sweet spot. \n\n2. If you really see a position you like, tailor your resume to fit it. Use keywords directly from the job description and remove things that aren't relevant. I kept separate resumes emphasizing separate skill sets I have (e.g. a resume for AI skills and experience, a resume for web dev skills and experience, etc.). I found it worked much better than having a single resume with a combination of different skillsets. \n\n3. Mention things you did the past directly, and use numbers to support them (e.g. \"Delivered a system that reduced customer errors by 50%\"). One of the big things you want your resume to emphasize isn't just that you have experience in coding/data science/whatever, but how your experience was able to make an impact and deliver value. Don't be afraid to stretch out your experience to make that point, just be able to actually talk about what you did and how it delivered value.\n\n4. If a job requires a cover letter, it usually has less candidates. It sucks, but it's usually worth it. Don't use AI, just write about how your skills that are relevant to the position helped you deliver results.",

You might be given vague specifications (\"do thing that make profit!\") alongside very precise and bullshit instructions as to how you should implement something (\"using latest AI models!\"). You might have a coworker or boss whose approval you rely upon who is toxic. There are countless examples where your autonomy is stripped and you are put in an impossible position and you are pointedly told to deal and STFU.\n\nBurnout isn't limited to just tech, but I think it's more common in tech than most professions to have a few decisions made above you to render pointless the entirety of your work output while the expectations to \"perform\" remain.",

The very real risk of layoffs without warning.\n\n4. Being constantly individually measured and tracked in an overwhelming number of ways (most of which are divorced from actual productivity).\n\n5. As a developer, spending less than 10% of my time actually developing (and instead wearing mostly Ops and BA hats because the employer doesn't want to actually have Ops engineers or BAs).\n\n6. The bureaucracy - Agile in name only, sprawling meetings, seemingly random change moratoriums, sudden drastic changes in policies, etc.\n\n7. No control over fixing any of it.\n\nHow am I breaking out? I'm getting out of the golden handcuffs I'm wearing.

Its impossible to estimate \"potential and problem-solving ability\" from a single interview. Companies were not hiring for specific tech stacks before because the demand outweighed the supply.\n\n Hiring juniors is always a bet and now companies have the luxury of choosing among a vast pool of them.

It’s just much more valuable than only knowing one thing. \n\nYou will be fine with being a jack of all trades. But keep in mind the market sucks, so don’t consider that a reason if you can’t get a job. \n\nAlso, 33 isn’t that old - not old enough for fears of being left behind. I’m 2 years your senior and also had a less than normal background. I have a lot more depth in front end and react, but I can still muddle my way through other things. And my focused areas for depth of knowledge has changed as the industry does (nobody needs the depth of knowledge I do about CSS or mixins anymore lol), but that’s fine. Understanding data pipelines etc is something I believe is very valuable if that is what you’re interested in, and I’m always grateful to have other devs on the team with some understanding of what I do (React) because it means we can articulate needs ro one another easier (which is why breadth is so important)",

        "body": "I don’t think people should put so much stock in the raw application counts you’re seeing on LinkedIn or Indeed for a role like this (hybrid in London, no sponsorship). A lot of those listings aren’t even real, and many of the “applications” are just auto-apply clicks. That’s basically spam, and these platforms aren’t great at filtering it. Even when a post is legit, most applicants aren’t actually qualified for that specific role. I’m not saying the job market is healthy; it’s tough. I’m saying a lot of candidates are taking the wrong steps.\n\nInstead of relying on LinkedIn or Indeed, follow sites that pull openings directly from company career pages and look for roles that truly match your skills. Create a resume and cover letter tailored to each posting. Optimize for ATS and naturally include the right keywords from the job description, both the job title and the required skills, then apply.\n\nIf you’re focused on remote roles around the world, check out a creative method in this Reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).\n\nMass-applying to thousands of jobs is just noise. In a pile of 1,000-plus applications in a couple of hours like the one here, I’d bet barely one or two actually meet the stated requirements. Be one of those.",

The easiest way to do that is probably getting a programming job, observing the various roles around it, and making a switch.\n\nRE your self doubt, you’re smart enough to get a degree in CS, you seem motivated to get some credentials, to me it seems like you have a strong skill set. You made a game and open sourced it, that takes skill.\n\nIf you make a plan and present that to your parents, they will see it’s not your lack of initiative, it’s the fact that the rug (tech job market) has been pulled out so quickly from beneath you and there’s little to no support systems in place.\n\nAlso +1 to stop searching for remote gigs.

Sure, few interviews let me *literally* Google (some have, I just have to let them know I'm doing it), but every other interview has always made it very clear that I'm welcome and encouraged to ask syntax questions to the interviewer.\n\nNo interviewer I've worked with has ever been caught up on if I remember `.length` vs `.length()` (which I still get caught up on because of my heavy Java experience and my kinda recent transition to Node/Typescript). Nobody cares if I've memorized any of the syntax of the language I'm programming in. They care that I can program. That's why they're willing to answer syntax questions, which I've asked many times, and gotten offers from.\n\nI also don't recall a company that *forced* me to use a specific language. Hell, back in the pre-covid days we all whiteboarded in pseudocode anyways. But since I've been doing remote interviews, companies have always made it clear I was allowed to program in the language I was most comfortable in. Again, nobody's paying attention to syntax memorization, they want to see me solve a problem via logic. Not rattle off something memorized that the worst programmer in the world could memorize.\n\nSame for BE vs FE.... My current company is an example. I knocked the BE interview portion out of the park. I killed it. Then I got to the FE portion in React.... and I didn't do too well. I had to ask *a lot* of syntax questions, needed some nudging, some hand holding, and I didn't even finish the whole interview before time ran out.\n\nAnd yet, they gave me an offer. My resume made it very clear I'm mostly a BE developer, I made that very clear in the HR interview, I made that very clear in the HM interview. They knew what to expect, they just asked the FE questions as a formality. It may very well be the case that you're not doing as well as you think you are in the Java interview. That, or you're not making it clear that your strength is BE/Java, and not FE/React.\n\nI'm just surprised your experiences interviewing are literally polar opposites of mine. Literally everything you brought up, I've experienced the opposite of. I have 12 YOE, so I've been around the block.",

What is complexity of accessing a hashmap, what is an interface, what is REST, what is ACID, what is an index and when do you use it, would you choose monolithic or microservices architecture for a startup?\n\n2nd round - live coding: TDD approach, language of my choice, editor of my choice, testing framework of my choice, AI disabled. Create a very simple bank account and a way to do a transaction between 2 accounts. Then make it work in a multithreaded environment.\n\n3rd round - still live coding but very pseudo-code stuff. Write very simple load balancer (no network stuff, just simple code no real integration), make it random, make it round Robin. Then few stuff about SQL, what is pessimistic locking, what is optimistic locking and how does it work, write SQL for it, show me how to use it. What is a transaction, a dead lock, etc..\n\n4th round - system design.. model a system that solves this simple X real problem found in our domain. Just a chat basically.\n\n\n1st round quickly filters out people who don't have basic knowledge\n\n2nd round verifies skills in OOP, TDD, multithreading (locks, dead lock, race conditions).\n\n3rd round again verifies skills in OOP (bit redundant tbh), but then goes into the DB and verifies that you actually know what is going on under the framework\n\n4th round verifies that you know more high-level architecture stuff.. message queues, redundancy, gateway/api/reverse-proxy, sharding... and that you can think bigger than just a few classes.\n\nI think these 4 rounds could be compressed in just 3 and be just as effective. Phone call was 15 minutes, the 3 rounds were a little more than 1 hour each. A total of roughly 5 hours that could be shortened to 3.5 or 4. I am very confident this process filters out 100% of the people who can't do the job. They verify all the skills needed to do the daily work that people apply every day. Perfect, imho. I don't get why it is so difficult for other companies to do the same.\n\nThis process is applied by a tech unicorn, so it definitely works at scale too..",

At the time there was a researcher named Jacob Nelson who ran a site called useit.com that was all about improving user experience and the usefulness of sites. About the only site I can think of that adheres to most of his principles still is jacobin.com (I’m not here preaching their politics fyi).  \n\nThere’s also the issue that the people who’d build systems have a world view very different from the average user and can often assume people should just become experts. \n\nYou may want to look at the writings of Alan Cooper, specifically “The Inmates are Running the Asylum”",

If I hadn’t been laid off, I could have asked for more money. i usually try to avoid saying my number first, but I didn’t in this case. I may have cost myself money by doing that. When I told them my number, they said it was very doable. So, they likely had more budget. I explained my situation to them. I ended up getting more than I originally asked for, as we had some more decisions around comp, but not what I was making previously. \n\nI’m OK with it for now. I'm of the mindset jobs are temporary, but I’d love to find a long-term place. Of course I wish I was making the same or more. \n\nFWIW, I was honest during my interview process.

Went nowhere but I made my own hours and put it on my resume.\n\nNext job I started doing data entry for minimum wage at a company that developed in house software. Started writing software that helped my team, even though no one asked me and I wasn’t getting paid for it. Then the head IT guy left and me and another woman just started doing his job. Support, managing servers, etc. Then I started developing for our main software products.\n\nAfter that I was able to get a regular dev job at another company and did that for 3 years.\n\nA lot of it was luck and timing though. Took 7 years but I went from 25k/year to 140k/year, without a degree.\n\nNow I’m unemployed so I guess take my story with a grain of salt.",

Like, she did a masters and had no less than 10 breakdowns where she thought she was going to fail a test and get kicked out of the program... she got straight As bro.

It doesn't sound like it is, it sounds like it's literally just you not letting yourself believe that you can take the time off without everything falling apart.\n\nThere are things you can do to help - like, you can put together a plan for when you're out, you can talk to your boss and tell them you have this irrational concern so that she can let you know that's not the case and you can totally go.\n\nBut it might be trickier than that.",

If you genuinely feel like no one can do your job while you're away, that's a huge weakness for your team - no single dev should be load-bearing on a project. It also isn't great for your ability to be promoted if you're seen as the only person who can do your particular job. \n\nThis would be a GREAT thing to talk to your supervisor about in your next one-on-one. \"I've found that I feel guilty taking PTO because I worry that things will break down while I'm gone. What can we do to make our team more flexible, so that our ability to function well doesn't depend on me specifically sitting in that chair?\" \n\nMaybe have some suggestions - more comprehensive documentation, perhaps some cross-training with others on your team so have more of a grasp of each other's particular roles? This could even be a great look for you if you can lead the charge in getting your team to a point where you're relying on process and not personnel.",

Employers have so much to choose from, they'll easily find someone who has experience with the stack they use and will be productive on day 1.\n\nGiven that you are a recent grad, you have no previous job but you have your coursework, your projects, your interests. Try to find jobs that align with those.\n\nIf you are going to keep contributing to OSS or building projects of your own, try to stick to a theme or domain. Using a particular language, or a specific stack. Or writing code that is used by a specific industry. Basically look at the kind of jobs you want to target and try to develop the skills they want and need.\n\n\nI am sorry you graduated in the middle of a downturn. This is literally night and day  compared to most of the recent 25 years if you forget the dot com bust and the massive 2009 real estate crash. The economic system being upside down in the first place, and the people in charge of it being increasingly incompetent, this is just one of the many \"once in a lifetime\" economic crises you will have to go through.

But they can be used as protection by the company to demonstrate that there were performance issues with the employee. The goal being to convince others that the company didn't wrongfully terminate for illegal reasons. In case the terminated employee decides to pursue legal action against the company.\n\nBy placing someone on a PIP they create a paper trail (no matter how flimsy it is) that the person wasn't performing their job well. I suspect it's also to cause doubt in the employee's mind about the likelyhood of prevailing in court. By having a formalized process where they told you, that you weren't performing maybe that can convince you to just accept it and quietly go away.\n\nAs for your second question there's only a few paths. One, do whatever they ask to get off the PIP if possible. Though to be honest it sounds like you wouldn't be happy in your current role (QA Automation/ not dev and poorly maintained code base). Two, resign. Three collect pay checks while looking for the next job until they fire you. Option three will yield unemployment.\n\nEach one has tradeoffs. E.g. if you get fired while on the PIP you probably won't want to use your boss at the job as a reference. If you have a long employment history and can use someone else as a reference that may not be a problem.\n\nI can't comment on disability so I'll leave that to someone else to comment on.\n\nI'm sorry you are going through this. Hopefully you find yourself in a better job soon.\n\nETA spelling out for the inexperienced that the boss from the job wouldn't be one to use as a reference if you waited out the PIP and got fired.",

In addition to talking about what was involved in coding the dashboard, you should talk about things like: why your company wanted this dashboard built, how you worked with the design team to build your dashboard to their design spec, how you wrote unit/functional/e2e tests and UATed your dashboard prior to deploy, how you used feature flagging and log monitoring to ensure a successful deploy, and what business goals were accomplished after you successfully deployed your dashboard.

He can do his work autonomously, but he doesn’t actually think about the business and what we can do to improve, he is technically strong. He takes something from the roadmap and kind of drives the execution, but he puts no effort into understanding why we are trying to do something or how something can be improved. He has to ask us for basic business context, which shows he is only focussed on a solution, he doesn’t actually care about the teams goals.

        "body": "I’ll try my best but in general the definition is fuzzy. When I interview with a senior engineer I tend to look for:\n\n1. Experience. Not in terms of years but in terms of lessons learned. I tend ask what project stays with them and what lessons they learned. How does it inform how they review designs and code. I’m mostly looking for people who have learned from their failures and can debug their code and designs and do the same for others. Do they have a story where they may have changed their mind after new information was gained or is it a constant stream of “my way or the highway.” This also means as a senior they do have a bit of a network and will have stories of how they talk to and manage people.\n\n2. Technical communication. As a senior, I expect them to be able to communicate not just for themselves but for the team and to be an advocate for reasonable designs while keeping the schedule in mind. I need them to tell me why things will take x days, not just that things will take x days. I want to know why they came to a specific decision and what other decisions did they consider. For people who have had a ton of experience doing this they will have a good signal to noise ratio.\n\n3. Team advocacy. Ultimately trust-worthiness and energizing a team are part of being a leader. Are they going to be a net gain of energy across the team under tight deadlines or are they going to be toxic? It’s hard to determine this within an interview, but as you work with them it gets easier to see. If they are motivated to work as an engineer usually that passion will come out in an interview and is actually hard to fake across multiple interviews. How do they interact with their maybe peers in the team/peer interview?\n\n4. It’s really corny but leadership. What I mean by this is that senior engineers shouldn’t argue from a stance of authority. Authority is given to someone because of who they are not because of the title they wield. How do they make their case? Is it with evidence and data or because they fall back on “experience?” This falls into the communication pillar too. If you have the experience you can tell stories and don’t need to say “because I’m senior.”\n\n5. Understanding of the scientific method. What I mean by this is I see engineering as the practice of making the same behavior repeatable. This means similar to science everything is a hypothesis to be continuously tested. SLIs, KPIs, etc need to ensure that we continue to be good. A senior engineer advocating for manual testing is fine as long as they have a plan for how we maintain that process and why we need to. Do they question our accepted reality or do they accept it without thought?\n\n6. Hard skills are a given and they should be fairly proficient in at least one language. This means they should be able to tell me how the language works and what it’s good for and not good for. They should have tried and tested ways to debug problems in said language and have a reasonably good understanding of how the language runs on a computer. Ie if I get a resume where the guy tells me he is a C++ expert of 10 years I expect him to be able to explain things like how vector or shared_ptr work or how exceptions work and how memory works for C++. They should have stories of how their language of choice is annoying or incomprehensible at times because with enough projects and lines of code all projects become annoying to manage in some way.",

Instead of focusing on every technical detail, think of the story. What problem you were solving, why you chose certain design or tech decisions, and what the outcome was. Hiring managers often care more about how you think than whether you explain every technical term perfectly. Mock interviews, even with a friend or through platforms like Pramp, can also help you get more comfortable.\n\nBlanking out happens when your brain is overloaded. Try breaking things into simple, clear steps in your answers, and don’t be afraid to pause for a second to collect your thoughts. Interviewers usually don’t mind a short pause if it leads to a clearer answer. Over time, with practice, that blanking moment will happen less and less.

Most of them have PhDs, and the ones with a masters came from a top Ivy then straight into FAANG. No opinion on the matter, just providing some perspective. My team is also not Canadian, so unsure how different that is in Canada. \n\nThere are benefits of staying in Canada. Not being an immigrant on a work visa is eliminating a source of mental strain. Canada is generally speaking more politically stable, and I find the Canadian cities I've lived in (I've lived for extended periods in the top 4 cities) to be much more chill than any cities i've been to in America. There is definitely a cultural shift. Safety is another one, if you compare a city the size of Toronto to any similar sized cities in America, it looks insanely safe. Violent crime rate is almost incomparable. We also have better labour laws, and great unemployment. If I get laid off here, I am entitled to like 45 weeks of unemployment pay of like 700 a week or something like that. All in all, personally as a Canadian I just cannot bring myself to want to grow roots in a tech hub in America like SF or Seattle due to the cultural and safety concerns. It might be irrational, but I genuinely like being in Canada, so I am willing to tank the downsides of it. \n\nDownside is obviously the pay. I worked in an Amazon subsidiary for multiple years and my American colleagues of the same level were being paid almost double what I make after you convert USD to CAD. That being said, that is not a good way to measure pay as our COL is high, but not as high as some would think. We also obviously have less companies to choose from, and the middle tier companies pay significantly less than the top tier ones, so you are going to need to bust your head and rely on luck to get into the top tier companies. \n\nThat being said, its completely reasonable to get a good career and life working in tech in Canada. I have worked completely remotely for my entire career, going from a known Canadian tech company, to Amazon, then to a big tech company offering more pay. I was able to relocate to a MCOL city due to the remote job and I'm almost mortgage free before turning 29. All this is to say that its going to be hard to break in, but its definitely still a good way of life. \n\nIf you got any more questions I can answer for you just go ahead and shoot!",

But from my experience, CS at UBC is pretty solid, and the program is renowned in Canada.\n\nI personally did a data science minor in addition to my CS degree, but you can also minor in statistics or math if you prefer to get some theory under your belt.\n\nTLDR: UBC isn't known for its ML curriculum, but the CS program is top-notch.",

        "body": "If you enjoy CS don't give up on it. If the work is satisfying to you and tickles your brain don't switch career paths to do something you don't enjoy, there's value in doing something you like. It's also difficult to find a career with this type of opportunity (even if you might struggle to find a job initially), you can work for a FAANG or F500 company without necessarily having to know the right people or live in the right place. Regarding your concern about actually finding a job, here's what I'll say:\n\n**You'll find a job**. If you're passionate and put in the work, you'll find a job.\n\n**Don't rely solely on your degree(s)**. Do what you can to stand out from the competition. Don't wait until you get your bachelors degree, don't wait until you get your master's, start *now*. Everyone applying for the same job as you has a degree (mostly). Build something and put it somewhere hirers can see, prove that you can do the job that you want. UBC is a good school, but honestly most company's don't care where you graduated from. Having a strong resume is 100x more valuable than the school you graduated from.\n\n**Apply for CO-OP's/Internships**. Realistically this is the best way to get a job when you graduate. Get an internship and do a good job. Not only does this gain you real world experience that can go on your resume, but you pretty much get a 4-8 month interview where you can prove to the company that you would be useful as a permanent employee and hopefully you have a job when or before you grad. \n\n**Finding a job is a numbers game**. Apply everywhere, you won't hear back from 90% of companies, it's just how it goes. Just apply everywhere and familiarize yourself with the hiring process, it will help in the long run even if you don't get the job.\n\n**Take what you can get.** It's mostly only difficult to find a Junior position right now so don't be picky when you start your career. Work somewhere for 2-3 years then search for the job you always wanted. Right now you aren't *that* valuable to a company (no offense). Maybe take a job at a small unknown company for a few years and view it as an opportunity to learn. \n\nIf you're passionate about CS all of this won't feel like work and it will get you a job.",

        "body": "I am an ubc alumni and I graduated in the last recession in 2009 where unemployment rate in the states was 2.5x  times higher than it is now. You'll be fine. Everyone I graduated with ended up fine. This includes people who did stuff like polisci.\n\nRecessions and slow job markets come and go, the entry level job market sucks right now everywhere and its not good in any field.\n\nThe last thing is I would have a healthy degree of skepticism towards what people say in tech about their own job market. The field is very prone to coming up with stories and drinking their own koolaid. You will read everywhere about AI, but reality is you have several compounding factors that makes the job market suck right now. This includes high interest rates, which effects tech more than other industries as that means there is less startup money and financign out there, over hiring during the pandemic, general economic uncertainty due to tariffs and current immigration system in the u.s.  All of these things in the short term, but will go away at some point in the medium term.\n\nThe last thing is that I live in New York and regularly attend UBC alumni events. The recent graduates I've met have it so much better than 10 or 12 years ago. The one thing is UBC is a lot more recognized in the states as a university today, especially among tier a corporate companies. It used to be the case that the main way UBC students succeeded in U.S market wasa via american grad school, because professors knew of UBC students. Now a  days your seeing UBC students get jobs directly from undergraduate in Quant Firms, FAAANG and financial firms. THe one thing I will say is that almost everyone successful from UBC, leaves Vancouver.\n\nThe other thing to get is tech is never going away as a field even if all the doom and gloom is correct. You are going to one of the best universities in the world and its academic brand is extremely strong. As long as you can keep your grades up, pretty much every graduate school is fair game for masters and paths to any university exist for Ph.D. (this is not always true). The reality of the world is there are MANY paths to success for someone who is determined, has some luck and siezes an oppurtunity. UBC is a place that you definitely can find a path.",

That way you always have a list of what to improve when you’re asked. \n\nThe business is usually a lot more receptive than you’d expect to fixing tech debt. We as developers aren’t as good at pitching it and get smothered.",

That still means 93.9% of CS new grads are employed.\n\nThe underemployment rate for new CS grads is 16.5%. This is the number of people employed in a job that utilizes their college degree. So it filters out the people that gave up and went to McDonalds. *This* number for us puts us in the *bottom 5* for all degrees regarding underemployment. We're doing pretty damn well.

What has changed is how selective companies can be. Apply to a job if it interests you and if it's remotely a fit for your skillset. Years of experience is probably the main one. And apply to roles where there is a coding round so those skills can shine through\n\n>I could have made 400 dollars driving Uber instead\n\nYes, that's called opportunity cost. It's same the logic with going to college instead of working somewhere right out of high school\n\n>So, at interviews, I know the programming languages, many of the challenges, and how to answer questions about how frameworks and APIs work, but they only ask about what projects I did and then agile related questions and nothing about coding, so I've not been finding any reason to take more interviews.\n\nThe way people on this sub bemoan coding interviews ad nauseam, I thought this was a desirable format for interviews\n\nI don't think you're being a negativity spreader. The fact that you're asking that question makes me think that way\n\n>You're still not the ideal candidate unless you have a lot more.\n\nIt depends on the role, always",

At Metana we've seen people make this exact transition without dropping 50k on a degree. The trick is building a portfolio that shows you can actually do the work, not just pass exams.\n\nYour research internship is clutch, lean into that hard. Start contributing to open source ML projects, build some models that solve real problems, document everything on github. Companies care way more about seeing you ship ML products than seeing another piece of paper.\n\nAlso lol at \"computational biology being a one off\", that lab probably just follows the funding, which is how academia works. Don't take it personally.\n\nIf you're dead set on the masters route, consider part time programs or even bootcamp-style intensive programs that focus specifically on ML/data science. Way cheaper, way more practical, and you keep earning while learning.\n\nBut honestly? With your big tech experience, I'd bet you could transition internally at a different company before needing any additional schooling. The key is positioning your SWE skills as \"I understand production systems AND ML theory\" rather than \"I'm just another SWE who wants to do ML.\"\n\nThe market sucks right now but ML roles are still out there, especially if you can show you understand both sides of the equation.",

Of course it is important to enjoy and have interest in your work, but when you have the tendencies you describe (which for me are related to adhd) there are basically no jobs that will hold your interests in the way a hyperfixation will. You can be in the field you’ve always dreamed of and your job will still be boring (especially early career) and require you to have focus on boring mundane tasks that are necessary. \n\nGiven that I would suggest you think about things like job availability, locations that are hiring, starting pay, career growth, working environment/culture, ability to gain transferable skills, and generally how you want your life to look. You should make choices now that will enable you the greatest flexibility/options. I highly recommend narrowing your choices to a couple things, choose the degree that wins out of those, and aim for 2-3 internships between those couple fields. Depending on your internship experience you can pivot, change degrees or whatever. Personally I chose CS/SWE due the flexibility of types of roles, the pay, possibility for remote work in the future etc.",

        "body": "At smaller startups or mid-level to senior positions, you'll absolutely get asked about system design concepts even as a frontend developer because they want engineers who understand how their frontend decisions impact the broader system. Large tech companies especially love throwing CAP theorem, load balancing, and scaling questions at frontend candidates to see if you think beyond just the UI layer. That said, plenty of companies still focus purely on frontend-specific system design like state management, component architecture, performance optimization, and API integration patterns.\n\nYour experience with mostly frontend-focused interviews isn't unusual, but as you level up in your career, expect more full-stack system design questions to creep in. The good news is you don't need to be a backend expert - you just need to demonstrate you understand how frontend applications fit into larger distributed systems and can make informed decisions about caching strategies, data flow, and performance bottlenecks. The key is showing you can think holistically about user experience from both a technical and architectural perspective. I'm on the team that built [AI for interview practice](http://interviews.chat), and we've seen this trend where frontend roles increasingly include broader system design discussions, so having a tool to work on these trickier cross-domain questions can really help you stand out when these curveballs come up.",

The reasoning is that even if the immediate role is largely frontend, we're not hiring \"react devs\", we're hiring software engineers who may need to pivot and pick up other stuff at some point.\n\nYou don't need to name drop every concept under the sun, but given a set of requirements, you do need to choose the system components in a sensible and defensible way. What happens a lot is people name drop something somewhere that sounds like it might fit at a glance, but doesn't quite make sense in conjunction w/ everything else they added around it, I ask them a question about it, and they admit not knowing much about it, or worse they wing it, poking more and more holes into the design as they go.\n\nFor example, we might be talking about performance, and then they add redis somewhere in the diagram, but it's in a suboptimal place, or they didn't think about cache invalidation or whatever, and then they start adding bandaid arrows and it just goes downhill from there.\n\nAnother thing that a lot of candidates are surprisingly bad at is schema normalization, and that comes up quite a bit because data modeling is a sort of a \"checkbox\" topic.",
