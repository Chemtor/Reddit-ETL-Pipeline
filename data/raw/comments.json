Set up the initial infrastructure as a single prod database that read directly in from sources. No stage, no transformation layer, just source straight into prod. No backups either, and he thought backups were an extra expense we didn't need.\n2. Stored patient phone numbers and zip codes as numbers, dropping all leading zeroes for about four months' data until he put that into a reporting table and freaked out about why so many rows were wrong.\n3. After fixing the phone number issue, he decided to use phone numbers as a patient table's primary key, \n4. This is my all-time favorite: he put unhashed SSNs in a table that was fed into Tableau, so that all of our practice administrators could see the SSNs of all the patients across all of our practices. *Huge* security issue.\n5. Lied about a dozen times on a questionnaire about security practices for a data sharing deal the company wanted to do with BCBS. We were incredibly lucky that our privacy officer caught that on the way out and corrected things, although she ended up being the one who took the heat when BCBS said \"Oh *hell* no\" to the deal after seeing how sketchy things were.",

Managing 100+ metrics across multiple tools without a single unified view becomes a governance nightmare. Each tool ends up with slightly different calculations, and nobody knows which version is the correct one. A semantic layer gives you one source of truth.\n\nBut don't you need to derive the data that's going to provide this unified view? Doesn't that involve precisely the calculations that drift apart over time? So what's the semantic layer doing other than adding yet another bunch of transformation?\n\n> The key is the semantic logic layer, abstracting the physical world from the modeling world.\n\nThat sounds like horseshit to me. Both layers are abstractions, both layers are models, neither layer is physical - or rather, both layers are supported by physical hardware and eventually boil down to fluctuating voltages and so they're both physical in that sense, but neither is any more physical than the other. The question isn't whether one level of abstraction is more physical than the other, but what the new abstraction provides that the old one didn't and whether it makes life easier.",

The challenge is the enforcement of that governance.\n\nWithout a Semantic Layer: Governance is a series of documents, meetings, and wiki pages. An analyst has to remember to `SUM(revenue) - SUM(refunds)` to get `net_revenue` and to filter out test user accounts. It's manual and prone to error.\n\nWith a semantic layer (LookML in this case): You define these rules in code. You define `net_revenue` once.\n\n\n    measure: net_revenue {\n      type: sum\n      sql: ${TABLE}.revenue - ${TABLE}.refunds ;;\n      value_format_name: usd_0\n      description: \"Total revenue after refunds have been deducted.\"\n    }\n    \nNow, the business user doesn't need to remember the formula. They just see a field in the UI called \"Net Revenue.\" They can't calculate it incorrectly because the logic is baked in. \n\nFor ad-hoc stuff and reports that are ephemeral - semlayers slow things down.

On the one hand, if you actually manage to create some kind of long-shot digital transformation and data driven success story, that'd be pretty strong for you... OTOH yeah I think the odds of that succeeding are 0.01% given the factors you describe + your own lack of commitment to actually turning things around (you make it sound hopeless, which makes me think you yourself lack the grit to make a successful pivot happen).\n\nIf you want to stick around and try, you'll probably need to suck it up and pay out of pocket for some cloud subscriptions, buy your own Mac laptop, etc. The silver lining thing about a company with bad IT practices is -- you have the freedom to just go rogue, and \"probably\" no one will stop you if you intentionally build out your own shadow IT environment. Go sign up for a free Snowflake account ($400 in free credits), go hook it up with your own GitHub, and load up data from SharePoint by just downloading CSV files to your laptop... Yeah that would be all terrible and not best practices, but in this situation, it gives you autonomy and frees you from being blocked by IT. Then, with your rogue shadow IT environment, go BUILD something useful and amazing and revolutionary... You're trying to foment a rebellion here, but for your vision to win, you have to actually demonstrate something meaningfully different and revolutionary that COULD NOT BE ACHIEVED in their legacy stack -- if all you do is say, \"look guys I put our code into git, see this is better now\", then no one will give a shit because that by itself doesn't matter, doesn't change the business. \n\nBut I don't think you are going to be able to pull it off. So jumping ship seems like it would be better for you, but to be totally honest and blunt, your post gives me a weird vibe of someone trying to \"shortcut\" the career ladder by looking to be opportunistic about what's-best-for-your-brand, instead of someone who's actually sincere about putting in the work, engaging with stakeholders, learning how to dig out of a hole, etc. If you really want to be a director, you're supposed to learn how to overcome adversity, and not just look for the smoothest easiest path to inflate your title as high as you can with as little work or struggle as you can.",

Moose as an \"ORM\" is one approach (I know of at least one smallish company using it, they seem happy)\n\nWe've done something \"similar\" at Tinybird (similar in the sense that it's a CH abstraction designed to make it easier to integrate into the application), but our approach is more API-centric. Basically make it dead simple to turn a SQL query into an API, and then integration really becomes a question of how you handle your API routes in your backend code and doesn't really require you to \"think\" about the database.\n\nI'm genuinely curious to know how people would compare Moose vs. Tinybird - do people like the ORM approach? I'd imagine most people in this sub probably just love the raw ClickHouse/database interface anyway, but anyways... curious what people think",

This isn‚Äôt something you can expect to catch with CI because it happens outside of the version control cycle. The only answers I‚Äôm really aware of here are runtime validations (we have various checks on every write (non-null assertions, no empty partitions, etc), and monitoring (usually volumes/reasonable deltas over some period of time). If you‚Äôre really fancy you can build a model for outlier detection that wouldn‚Äôt show in volume alone.\n\nSometimes the data can shift in really unpredictable ways and cause failures. So if you have data whose cardinality you don‚Äôt control, this will always be a risk. Just last week I burned hours troubleshooting sudden failures due to viral user behavior skewing logs to an insane degree. If your data can skew, make sure you have proactive measures in place to prevent it from becoming an issue (salting before joins in spark, etc).",

You can store things in columns such as ID - Atrribute Name - Attribute value without flattening them, which makes ingestion transparent. Or you maintain link tables and cross referentials, without having to decide upfront what the precise grain is\n\nSo your gold layer can be:\n\n* the PowerBi datamodel, Tableau view or anything an analyst generates directly\n* a curated layer specifically for a consumer (Marketing datamart, Sales datamart on another grian, pre-aggregated finance figures to show year to date on the book year, ...)\n* views or tables designed to be consumed by a specific consumer, such as pre-filtered reports or tables that generate a daily outbound file to be consumed by another tool\n\nThis may not be \"by the book\", but this is what I've always seen in practice",

Yes, this is my personal pet peeve. </rant>\n\nWhen you start joining things for the semantic layer, you are assigning purpose to them. For example, if you create a star, how you join the dimensions to the fact table gives meaning (explicit or implicit) to the data that may not be true in all instances. Those data products are meant to keep your core available for all purposes and not any specific one. That being said, you could query to the core layer directly, but it may not perform as well as the semantic layer. The core is more about the relationships of the data at an overall business layer. When you are conforming and loading the core, you don't want the business queries getting in the way.",

If that's the case then there is more work to do. Of course this is still a bit of an \"it depends\" situation - if teams are happy with the process then there is no need to change it.

It's constant learning, even as an experienced engineer, whenever I switched to a new stack, I needed between one and two years to be proficient at the local stack and the local software. Good engineering managers know that and will mostly expect you to demonstrate that you are proactively learning by asking questions and reaching out to seniors to get help.\n\nIf you're good at SQL and have some experience with proper software engineering (git), dbt should be easy for you to pick up in a couple of weeks. Just follow their guides and best practices to make sure you use it correctly and in a way that is easy to follow by another dbt user.  \nSnowflake is probably the best hands-off OLAP distributed database, if you're good at SQL, there should be no difficulty. As with any data processing tool, the key is to focus on their documentation about optimizing query performance (partitioning, clustering...).\n\nSo, the learning is not going to be a problem, I think the hardest is going to be passing the selection in the current market.",

In an ironic way, I know I just say companies need automation more than the latest tools, however, this role was fun because my job was to learn the latest tools and see how they could be offered to clients internally and externally.\n\nAfter 18 months, I got my second job.  Learning became a lot easier because I had already seen most things before.  The same patterns crop up and it was a lot more battling very poor design decisions made by members of the team as well as external contractors although still doing the same thing.",

Sometimes it's from scratch-ish if I'm setting up something that doesn't already exist. \n\n* Or is this task often handled by a dedicated DevOps, Cloud, or Security team, especially in larger companies?\n\nI don't know about larger companies, and even then I expect it would depend on the company. In the companies I've worked at (startups / medium) the data team had their own AWS sub-account where we could implement whatever tools/policies we wanted - the official devops folks were focused on production architecture. We definitely worked with them and did some security reviews tho. \n\n\\> Should I dive deep into the IAM JSON policy syntax, or is it more important to have a strong conceptual understanding of what permissions are needed for a pipeline, and then learn to adapt existing policies?\n\nDon't bother learning the syntax unless that's going to be 90% of your workload. Copy paste is going to be your friend, and then you can adapt as needed. Keep in mind the principle of least privilege and you'll be fine - you always start from zero and only add access to what you need. But what you need is gonna depend on what you're trying to do (read? write? etc.) Architecture is much harder than the syntax piece.",

I'm probably not following what this subreddit would consider to be best practices, but here's what I did:\n\n* Built out a Python ETL platform that allows me to generate pipelines using JSON config files. The pipelines ingest Excel files directly from our local network, transform and clean the data, and pop it into an on-prem SQL Server database. My platform is modular and extensible, so I tend to add/update functionality as needed.\n* I use dev/test/prod environments in the DB but haven't done bronze/silver/gold layers. Monitoring is manual right now (log files!) but I plan to migrate to Prefect and/or implement some Power BI dashboards that consume my logs.\n* I avoid manually-managed documentation wherever possible, because that will be the first thing to go out of date. Instead, I'm using JSON schemas and GitHub Actions to automatically generate documentation for my config files on push, and docstrings + pdoc + GitHub Actions to do the same for my codebase. Only manually-maintained documentation is the top-level README for the repo.\n* Power BI is a star for me. Getting the on-prem gateway running was painful, but I've established dev/test/prod environments where I control access. Users can access the dashboards via Teams or, in some cases, export the semantic models to Excel for further analysis. I'm also using PBIB files so I can manage dev in GitHub.\n\nIn terms of general approach, I would start slow and be responsive. Full-stack data analysis means you're also your own PM, so be sure to communicate well and be able to justify your choices to stakeholders. Figure out your P0 items that are crucial for what you're building and then go build it. As you work on this, you'll naturally identify new concerns and priorities and be able to respond to those. Having a vision for what you want to do will help you build for the future--for example, I want to manage my configs via a website, so I established JSON schema rules that unlocked automated documentation--but your vision should remain flexible.\n\nGood luck!\n\n(Edit: Formatting)",

The vector store will bring you the answers, but if you only send the last line the user types, it can be something like \"What flags can I use to format the output?\" It's lacking content. The LLM is there to read this, along with all the conversation, and turn it into something like, \"What tool do I use to run health checks, and what flags can I use to format its output?\" That has a much higher chance to bring the chunks you need.

A sloppy WHERE date > last_refresh_date on a huge table can be a full scan, lock things up, and suddenly, the app is crawling. You do that once. The critical system goes down for a few hours and requires a reatart. The trust with your C-level is gone. After that, you‚Äôll only be allowed to receive CSVs by email that they extract for you ü§£\n\nCDC on database sources is great, but you have to know how the logs behave. They can balloon, not every system handles them cleanly, and if you‚Äôre unlucky, you get stuck pulling GBs of changes that still slow down the source. I‚Äôve lived the nightmare with MariaDB on a payments system. No matter how much you tune it, it just drags. Sql Server and others handle cdc great. No matter what you do, you must not affect source systems.\n\nI try to keep it simple:\n‚Ä¢ API when available.\n‚Ä¢ If you must hit a critical DB, use a read replica.\n‚Ä¢ Be aware of replica lag and don‚Äôt rely on it for anything that needs read-after-write.\n\nIf you‚Äôre lucky enough to be on RDS or similar, spinning up a read replica is dead simple. It costs a little more, but it saves you from nightmare scenarios, and your DBAs will actually like you better.",

Direct being key. That should answer your question regarding Google.\n\nIf your job is specifically within the software for a sales team I would argue you as revenue. They couldn‚Äôt do their sales jobs as good without you \n\n2 is a hard distinction, almost all cost centers support the revenue business in some way as all companies exist to make money. You wouldn‚Äôt have them in the first place if they contributed nothing. I think the way to look at is do you fully support the revenue cycle or do you support everyone. IT desk support can have higher overall job security even being a cost center because a business cannot afford to fire all of them \n\n3, it depends on how much of your time is spent on the chargeable service. Sometimes you can think of it this way. If the business fires your whole team would there be a way they could continue to survive without you be it outsourcing, praying, etc. that question may cause more questions because certain sales guys could be fired in that context. And guess what, sales guys do get fired in hard times, but the top/critical sales guys usually are not.

This would fit if you were doing maintenance and basic prod support, cyber security, governance, etc.\n\nProfit center: should be enabling the business to increase revenue and/or cut costs. You should be able to justify your expenses in terms of added business value (\"yes Mr. CEO, my expenses did increase by 300k year over year, but the new system integrations are estimated to increase bottom line profits by over 1 million per year\"). A data engineering profit center should be churning out valuable data pipelines, minimizing time to market, working closely with stakeholders, etc. \n\nOr you can have the worst of both worlds where you have the expectations of a profit center (build things fast, enable the business, etc) but then get treated as a cost center when budget allocations come around. \n\nProfit centers are more fun to work for, but they are also going to be more demanding.

When the business wants to lay people off to improve the numbers for a quarter, those business units will be amongst the last people they lay off. \n\nIf your business unit has a red number next to it in the monthly P&L meeting, that will be the first thing to go unless it‚Äôs deemed essential. You‚Äôre absolutely right that the real picture is far more nuanced, and many essential teams are cost centres- accounts, IT, facilities, and usually. the executives themselves. If your work has no price tag, it has no value in MBA math. \n\nTo reiterate, essential things are still costs. Buildings, utilities, salaries, so on. But the business will generally look to keep costs low.to use your example, the IT department is like rent- it‚Äôs an unavoidable necessity. \n\nThe trick as a cost center is to make sure your work gets properly credited to you, often through internal billing, sometimes via other KPIs and metrics.

Jeff has to be paid a salary and the accounting line for that gets assigned to a cost center. Jeff probably isn‚Äôt a product, though I guess you can stretch this to say it‚Äôs possible when talking about a person who is a model, or stripper, or something like that haha. Then they are what‚Äôs being sold. But so long as Jeff is something like a sales manager a logistics director, he‚Äôs not the product. It‚Äôs not that he doesn‚Äôt matter, but on the books, he doesn‚Äôt get to directly be tagged like a product. Now, his work is more directly involved in transactions that do get tagged with profit centers, though, than someone who is, say, in human resources. \n\nTransactions for inventory changes of physical consumer goods often end up getting tagged to both a profit center and a cost center. The profit center is just related to what the good is. But the cost center is usually location based. Factory A and Factory B are different cost centers. This becomes important because other costs are posted to each factory and can differ, like labor costs and electricity and rent.

ClickHouse community is strong and growing. The number of contributors and commits to ClickHouse has grown so much over the last 5-10 years. Just look at the contrib chart: [https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/graphs/contributors)  \n  \nPinot not so much: [https://github.com/apache/pinot/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/apache/pinot/graphs/contributors)  \n  \nIf your main concern is maintenance and operational overhead, to me this is the most important thing. I think the ClickHouse community takes the cake.\n\nPersonally I also think that CH is just easier to reason about. The SQL is mostly standard with some CH-specific stuff, but if you know SQL you can be productive quickly. For logs specifically, it handles high-volume ingestion really well and the compression is excellent.\n\nI don't have as much hands-on experience with Pinot, but from what I understand it can be more complex operationally - more moving pieces to manage. The trade-off is that it's designed more specifically for certain real-time analytics workloads.\n\nSince you mentioned you're starting with logs and might move to business metrics later, CH might be the safer bet. It's proven at massive scale (we have customers running trillions of rows) and the operational complexity is manageable. Plus if you're planning to eventually query business metrics alongside logs, having everything in one system can simplify things.\n\nWhat kind of log volumes are you looking at? And do you need real-time ingestion or is near real-time ok?\n\nBtw, maybe you'll find this template interesting or useful as a starting point -> [https://www.tinybird.co/templates/logs-explorer-template](https://www.tinybird.co/templates/logs-explorer-template) (if you're worried about operational overhead, maybe Tinybird could be a landing place for you... lmk if you have questions about it.",

You've just used words from different technologies and slapped them together. \n\nFabric offer pretty much nothing that Synapse doesn't - the \"one Lake\" approach is a new feature that dilutes the whole concept of \"single source of truth\". And Fabric doesn't support data flows.\n\nSynapse is a solution for enterprise needs, it can be optimised as you'd expect for that level of usage.\n\nFabric is aimed at \"citizen\" developers, e.g. people who operate as individuals and pull reports together from different sources. The one thing fabric genuinely does better than Synapse is allows you to connect to data sources easily. It's not difficult in Synapse, it's just not very intuitive.\n\nThe easiest way to envision is it:   \n  \nData Factory does a bunch of legacy operations and support basically everything that on prem does, with no need to rewrite it all. it also offers newer ways of doing things but that's not what makes it useful IMO.\n\nSynapse offers true \"PAYG\" data processing which takes the load off your internal systems, and generally will be cheaper than Data Factory but needs a significant rewrite on new technologies (Such as Spark, Python) and a whole new approach to how things are processed. The upside is the power of the servers you can provision is massive, and you only pay for what you use - instead of paying for them 24/7.\n\nFabric offers most of what Synapse does but has a very different interface to Synapse. It also leverages One Lake. The main difference is pricing. In Synapse you need to pay for each resource individually, but in Fabric you pay for \"capacity\" which can range from storage to processing - but it all comes under one payment.\n\nThe reality is that Synapse is a great product that can operate alongside DF, and both of them utilise each other for specific functions, but Synapse is a whole new world. Fabric is aimed to try and give non technical people \"democratised\" data processing - which is a great idea but functionally is very close to giving someone 15 excel files and hoping they know what they're doing when they copy paste from them all that the data is correct at the end.\n\nAll of these technologies need a data platform and approach - trying to sell Fabric as \"better\" is just wild. I know MS are pushing it, but having worked with all 3 technologies AND on prem, i can safely say there are more headaches in fabric than the others because it's solving a problem that data engineers didn't need solved.",

Yes, you need a data platform in both. But there are genuinely significant improvements in Fabric that aren't in Synapse.\n\nYes, Synapse is a very capable platform. But it's also a challenging platform to use well. \n Synapse SQL Dedicated Pools make you choose between best performance (storing in its proprietary internal tables) and open formats (external tables). Scaling is offline, and disruptive. And they require a lot of tuning to get good performance out of them. Synapse Serverless SQL pools are better on that front, but have a lot of limitations of their own.\n\nI genuinely believe Fabric Warehouse is better than them. It gets rid of that division, and has many, many improvements elsewhere, from provisioning (scaling is online like Synapse Serverless SQL Pools, but faster and more intelligent), query optimization (overhauled and distinct from either Synapse SQL Pool offerings), query execution (improved beyond both previous products), and so on. \nI have worked on all 3 products, seen the customer experiences on all 3, and that's my honest opinion.\n\nSimilarly, if you look at Fabric Spark, it has NEE, based on Gluten and Velox, to improve performance and lower costs:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/native-execution-engine-overview?tabs=sparksql\n\nNote that Fabric Spark has a pay as you go billing option:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/autoscale-billing-for-spark-overview\n\nThere have been discussions about expanding that to other workloads where it makes sense, but that's a question for PMs rather than me.\n\nFeature development is focused on Fabric these days, so the engines in Fabric will continue to improve further with time. And as I said above, I genuinely believe they're already significantly better than what we have in Synapse. And unfortunately, many of those improvements are not really feasible to bring to Synapse - we had to do very significant rearchitecting to deliver them, and that rearchitecting means it's not really feasible to put the improvements into the older products, they just weren't designed for it. \n\nAnyway, you don't have to agree with me, that's fine. This is my personal opinion; that's your personal opinion. Reasonable people can have differences of opinions.\nThanks for sharing yours, hope this helps you understand mine a bit better too.",

In production it's even scarier as companies often refer to business concepts with different descriptions (hell, I don't even understand the ask sometimes because their description is so bad).  Then the feedback they get is often the SQL itself, which is gibberish to most people so they can't validate that the LLM got it right.

Also worth checking out tools like Waii or Text2SQL.ai that specialize in this problem.\n\nThe real issue is that business users describe things completely differently than how the data is actually structured. Like they'll ask for \"revenue\" but your table has \"net_sales_amount\" or whatever. You almost need a translation layer between business language and actual schema.\n\nHave you tried fine tuning a model on your specific schema with lots of query examples?

Getting data out of sage + odoo into postgres with minimal work is already a big win.",

I definitely have doubts, but in theory some things could be replaced here and there. But the main thing I think is that in many careers including tech, these LLMs have no judgment, it's all just guesswork. Humans actually have judgment, they can be put in charge of things and knowingly take calculated risks, I don't believe LLMs have any real concept of this, when you ask them questions regarding more soft skill type stuff instead of strictly technical, they just BS you and basically answer the question however they think you wanted them to answer it, or they give a non-commital answer, etc. They can't really be trusted for anything serious and I think that will remain a huge gap for decades at least.",

Different orgs refer to people and roles slightly differently, absent protections for certain professional titles (e.g. Engineer).\n\nIf you want to say that it takes a programmer (or coder, or software engineer, or developer...) to be able to evaluate the output of LLMs in a particular context in order for LLMs to be useful for building complex software, just say that. There's no need to start splitting hairs over terminology.

It might be interesting to use for reviewing code, but I really don't understand the mindset of those who think it's anywhere near able to replace anyone in this industry.\n\nPeople are turning to AI to solve problems that can and should be solved by actual deterministic, properly thought, and battle-tested frameworks instead, and I think this is wrong in many ways, because at the end of the day it's not deterministic so the same prompt is totally unlikely to generate the same code twice, unless you run the model locally and always provide it with the same seed and prompt sequence, but most people don't even do that. Not only that but as of now AI doesn't even come close to a proficient programmer at any meaningful task as the AI generated code that I've read so far suffered from being extremely verbose, lacking proper structure, and containing lots of useless comments, which considering that we have already been suffering from a huge code quality problem due to businesses making it normal to focus on developer experience instead of user experience for decades, means nothing good for this industry.\n\nPeople using AI to take on tasks that they are not versed in are also hurting themselves, not only by letting it produce potentially crap code whose correctness they can't really verify, but because by letting the AI do it, they are also missing out on potentially insightful learning opportunities. AI might be able to generate lots of code very fast, giving people the impression that they are actually saving time, while in reality the brittle nature of that code couple with nobody really having a deep understanding of the train of thought behind it means that technical debt is accumulating very quickly, leading to whole projects having to be scrapped and rewritten from scratch once the codebase becomes unmanageable.\n\nWe might also already be witnessing the dawn of a new job title that I would call AI janitor, where some companies vibe code their way to success, the resulting mess becomes totally unmanageable, and they end up having to hire humans to rewrite everything from scratch. I am actually positioning myself to take on this role at some point in the future, by continuing to learn, keeping my brain sharp, and also taking advantage of AI to learn about AI itself and the use cases where it has already largely surpassed human intelligence and can actually be helpful, because honestly when it comes to this technology, I don't think this is the time to relegate myself to the passenger's seat when I can instead take it up to the next level by becoming a pilot.\n\nAt present, companies are collectively spending 10 times more on AI than they're making back, and that's not to mention our consumption of natural resources, so while it's generating revenue, it requires an insane and totally unsustainable amount of investment to do it. The hope is to eventually come up with a way to build an AGI, but since nobody can really predict the consequences of that, I don't think it's realistic to plan with that scenario in mind, especially when other scenarios like model collapse due to the phenomenon where AI slop in training data makes models significantly more likely to hallucinate are a lot more realistic, so I think it's safe to say that we're collecting betting our future on finding a pegasus unicorn.\n\nLastly, there's also the fact that, at present, AI still lacks human curiosity and drive to try new things, so if most people decide to rely on it, once the investment tap is shut, no new innovation will actually be achieved, including on AI itself, since no new problem-solving paradigms will be attempted as AI is only really able to shuffle combinations of the same old strategies. Therefore in the end AI might replace many jobs in this industry not because it became smarter than us but because we collectively decided to get dumber, and while I don't personally mind this scenario from an economical perspective, because I am positioning myself to not only survive the devastation resulting from the explosion of this hype bubble completely unscathed, but to also thrive by providing a helping hand in the aftermath, I am still concerned about the permanent damage we're doing to the natural resources on our planet which we're still totally dependent on for survival.",

There's still room for mathematicians, writers, researchers, mechanics and map creators, and of course software engineers.\n\nFor people who want to create software, either for money or passion, of course they should learn in-depth knowledge about how software works. But I think it is important for people to realize that the landscape of software development is just as large as any of the other fields I mentioned. Merely understanding code compares to software development as changing a tire compares to being a mechanic, or how being able to calculate compares to being a mathematician. Or even between being able to read (and post on reddit) versus writing a series of fiction books. Creating a fictional world requires a huge amount of skill beyond knowing what the words mean.\n\nFor the last couple of years before AI, there was such a huge demand for software developers that job positions were constantly filled with people who had basically just learned how to read code (and write a simple program at best). Which happened because digital literacy is so low and the demand for programmers was so high. That's good for those people, but I don't think it could have been a stable dynamic into the future.  \nNow that decent coding AIs are available, people simply don't know what the future will look like. The AI doesn't neatly fit in the corporate structures that have been built about working with a massive number of junior developers, so the industry will change. It is hard to know what skills will be desired for software development 5 years from now, so my suggestion is to maybe not chase the money right now, but definitely chase the passion.\n\nBut again, \"learning to code\" itself, I would say that everyone should do that, just to understand the very basics of the dozens of computer chips around you every day. (Even the notion that a person today interacts with up to a 100 different programmable computer chips every day is probably weird to many people. If you include internet servers in the mix, the number shoots up to thousands.) The world is still getting more automated every day, and digital illiteracy will eventually became as limiting as normal illiteracy is today.",

I routinely get a laugh out of the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm `round(random.normalvariate(27, 2))` years old. Is that too old to learn Python?‚Äù questions. Just go for it!\n\nOn AI, I‚Äôve seen a lot of tech hype over the years, but it seems like the right answer is to try what‚Äôs new. LLMs are interesting. Writing serious prose, I dislike pretty much everything I get out of them. But, by having something to react to, I more quickly clarify my own logic and get more done. Code completions are often not great when changing tasks, but they‚Äôre often good at making coordinating edits to match the one I just made. Generating longer code ranges from not all that useful (particularly specialized uses or where I have a clear idea of what I want) to massively productive (using a new to me package or things with a lot of boilerplate/structure like dashboards/web frameworks). It‚Äôs nuanced and not always predictable, so you experiment and build intuition. \n\nProgramming is great outside of work, too. I wrote a Python program to help us name our first child and made it (minimally) web-based to help us name our second. My five year old wanted to learn some Python (she saw it in VS Code while we were working on a short book we had an LLM write with her input), so I sat her in front of a terminal interpreter and had her type simple expressions like math and using string methods. The artwork on our walls is all on the same centerline, because I wrote a function to translate picture frame dimensions and the center of the stretched picture wire to a wall location for the hanging hook. I cant count the number of times I‚Äôve whipped up a personal project that analyzes some data or written some abomination of a regex that reformats something mangled into a structured form.\n\nOne of the amazing things about programming is that failure is frequent and relatively costless. Imagine if you messed up a cooking recipe and could simply edit and reprocess it with no ingredient loss and millisecond cooking time as many times as needed. That‚Äôs why diving in is the right approach. You‚Äôll answer your ‚Äúshould I‚Äù question quickly, and you may love it. The many small wins are really gratifying.",

I asked the receptionist nicely and she went and grabbed a spare for me. When I got back to the office, I got to hear the management telling my boss that the keys were numbered and it simply wasn't possible to give me a key.  As I triumphantly held up the key, my boss told them that their system had failed and hung up. The next week I baked a batch of cookies in the morning and dropped them off for the office next door. \n\nSoft skills makes things smoother. People look out for you and you can sometimes get a small job squeaked through even though everything is booked.\n\nBut you have to remember that everything goes both ways. You have to express your appreciation and bribery when people bend over backwards to help you out. Fresh bread, cookies, a box of live crickets delivered to the office, whatever will spark joy in the person who helped you. Hell, mail them a physical card saying thank you.",

And those people were there to see that mess play out, and still continued to repeat the same problem.  \n\nOne time I was challenged on the way I did something by one of those supposed seniors, and while I was trying to explain the very simple pattern I had used, they literally told me that they weren't as smart as me and didn't get it.  I'm like, dude this is just a pub/sub pattern.  How do you have 20 years of experience in this field and you can't follow a basic pattern?\n\nI've never suffered from imposter syndrome because I was immediately shown that idiocy is rewarded in this field, or at least in web development.",

Suddenly you became a kind of semi-hero in the work space? A kind of defacto tech support and programmer (even if that wasn't your main job!). \n\n------------------------------\n\nThe need was so great that... At that point, there's was pretty much nothing you could ever do to get fired! \n\nLike ya... I was younger at that time, and foolish, so even though I didn't control my emotions at some point and even yelled back at the senior founding partner of our firm, I still didn't get fired! \n\nI kid you not: I even got caught late at night in a rather compromising position with a certain colleague, in which her and I were inappropriately hitting it off... and then... well... hit it off one late night, when wouldn't you know it: that same senior partner came into the office unusually to check something. And kinda freaked, then backed out, and never spoke about it to me! (Ya, if that was today, I would have been long fired multiple times!)\n\n------------------------------\n\nAnyways... \n\nSo, I actually got hired by a pretty well known international law firm as a technical writer, since I had done two entirely separate university degrees: one physics, and one English Literature. \n\nYa, I know: that's a strange and weird combo, but those are my 2 loves in life! Despite the fact that unfortunately I'm not all that good in either of them, lol! \n\nBut the law firm dealt in many aspects related to the sciences and engineering, ranging from patents to immigration of highly talented people, etc... So they needed someone who could read scientific papers, and be semi-decent at writing. (As you can see from the length of this comment, I'm a pretty crazy writer: always constantly writing. Just not anything all that good! But still always writing, and I can type at about 90 to 100 words per minute.) \n\n------------------------------\n\nFinally to get to the point, not only did I do technical writing... \n\nBut if anyone had a problem with their computer in the office, my phone line would light up and ring (if the main tech-guy/admin wasn't there yet in the morning, or was already busy). \n\nAnd then people would approach me to help them automate some tasks. \n\nSo believe it or not, I would actually use C++ (taping into Win32) combined with a program called \"Autohotkey\" to do scripting and automation! \n\nLike who uses C++ of all things, to do quick scripting and automation tasks!? Well apparently that would be me! \n\n------------------------------\n\nBut ya, I got the job after I graduated with my second degree, and boy was I surprised by me being thrust into that role, and just rapidly utilizing anything I knew to get the job done, even if it wasn't anything close to 100% the correct language or solution model for the problem. \n\nJust as long as it worked, mostly glitch free, then nobody gave a flying F what programming language or tool I used to get the job done. \n\nAnd because of that, they never-ever-ever wanted to fire me, even though they had to scold me several times. \n\n------------------------------\n\nFast forward to today, and ya... \n\nTimes have really changed, mostly for the worse in this field unfortunately. \n\nI worry the good old fashioned crazy pure days of fun are behind us now in the tech sector, and companies have turned something great into something of misery... \n\nAka: the enshittification of everything by corporations, CEO's and MBA bro culture.",

Back when we were starting, you could just have the basic skills with almost no qualifications and stumble into a job. Also, startups aside, there used to be a lot more job security in general at the bigger corporations, but that doesn't seem to be the current climate.\n\nRegarding AI, I'm not saying it's gonna replace us all, but it's certainly causing a kind of mass hysteria/industry transformation/paradigm shift, and I don't know whether that will ultimately be for better or worse, I'm betting on worse. My personal thing is that I got into this career because I love to code and debug, but I never enjoyed all the other stuff, from design to meetings to bureaucracy to operations. Well with AI, the coding aspect is kind of ruined in my opinion, like being a good coder gives you very little edge, and on the job the coding will become more and more prompt engineering stuff which is just whatever, and the job will reduce down to just the other aspects.",

        "body": "I've been on the other side: interviewing candidates for entry level back-end focused dev positions. Here's my thoughts.  \n\nActive Github profile (daily commits) - not important. \"Daily commits\" is especially not important, some days you just aren't going to have code worth committing. The important part is _having worked on a project of nontrivial complexity_. You had a problem and you tried to solve it... how did you approach the problem, and why did you choose the solution you did? Talking about the candidate's prior work is very valuable as the person trying to understand if the candidate in front of me might be a good fit.  \n\nWell-structured and documented programs (Modular & uses Swagger) - maybe of interest, but just having used tools like OpenAPI (which is the name of the spec for what was called \"swagger\" btw) or readthedocs or redoc doesn't actually tell me anything. Remember, I'm trying to figure out your approach to solving engineering problems. Does slapping swagger-ui into a maven project mean you're any more informed about how or why to use such a tool? Not necessarily. Now, if what you developed had an external API with users that needed to know about/test your endpoints, that's something worth asking about. This could dovetail into asking about other tools like Postman.   \n\n\"Well structured\" is too vague of advice and honestly I'd be wary of anyone preaching this to a new developer. Trying to perfectly architect your work in progress ToDo app is not a good use of time. Get your hands dirty. Learning from mistakes and iterating is the name of the game. Waxing philosophic about how you wanted your first app to scale to thousands of users might be relevant if you're interviewing at Netflix, but anywhere else it's probably just signalling that you didn't really understand when it's appropriate to use the tools at hand, or worse, that you might be the kind of junior dev who needlessly introduces more compexity.  \n\nProjects - yes, very important. Your plan is simple but if you follow through you will be fine. The only thing that stands out to me is that you don't have concrete examples for your projects. You should pick problem(s) that sounds interesting to you and then just work on them. You will inevitably run into topics that you know nothing about (how do I hook up my server to my database? how do I expose this API endpoint? how do I secure my endpoint behind basic AuthN? if my project is depending on other services, how do I rate limit my service so that I don't get angry emails/IP blocked from those services? is there some way I can process this data more efficiently?). If you are able to work on any actively maintained open source project, you can get some \"real\" dev experience before getting your first job.\n\nHere are some of the kinds of basic questions I have in my interview template:  \n\n* What do you do in your current position (if any)?  \n* What side projects have you worked on? Which languages do you use or which are you learning?\n* How familiar are you with <framework>? (e.g. Spring, React, etc)\n* Have you used git or other source control tools? Have you submitted (or reviewed and approved) a pull request before?\n* Do you know what a unit test is? What do you think is the point of tests?\n* Walk me through your side project (if any). What was your role, how did the design go, what were any challenges you ran into? What would you have changed?\n* <coding/logic problem>\n* Can you talk about a situation where someone disagreed with your recommendation, or vice versa, on an important aspect of a project?",

Read from a string (eg.\"13+8-9+21\")\n\n>It took one google search to remind me I could use the find\\_first\\_of() and substr() function.\n\nIMO a binary tree is exactly what they were asking for. This is a 3-case lex, 3-function recursive descent parse, then single-function tree walk situation, if you want a proper solution. I'd expect the first solution to be some awkward/inflexible string splitting which broke the second the input changed slightly. If I had more than 30 mins I'd ask how it could be made more robust, at which point I'd expect a suggestion like mine above. I probably wouldn't make them code it up though. Just knowing tells me what I need to know about them for the purpose of the interview.  If I had to suggest the improvement, I might see if they could work with me to code it up by asking good questions etc, almost pair programming style.\n\nMy advice in these is always to use the interviewer as a resource as much as possible. Lots of people go very quiet and try to mentally brute force, then fail, when they could have asked for more help from me. I don't know what they need help with specifically without them asking. On the job, it's fine to ask colleagues things, so it's generally not frowned upon in interview either, as long as you're not asking for the full solution etc.\n\nEdit: code in thread below.",

It's only easy from the human perspective. It doesn't take you more than a minute to do that calculation, but you process the string in whatever order you want. That is, if you had had * or /, you would have handled that computation first.\n\nBy contrast, the string is an array of characters, and you have to translate it numbers, plus apply the operator. Because it's infix, it's quite a challenge to do it accurately. As you yourself said, it took half an hour even after you Googled for the C functions you needed.\n\nI suppose the tip is to know you C string functions. \n\nThere is a bunch of ways to solve it. If you could create a second array, you could have replaced +/- with spaces, and then split on that. Then pull out the integers into an array, then process the +/- from the array.\n\nI don't think this is an easy programming problem at all.\n\nAnother person suggested creating a binary tree.

I wrote an entire book on recursion (published by No Starch Press) because I kept seeing recursion poorly taught: [The Recursive Book of Recursion](https://inventwithpython.com/recursion/)\n\nMore recently, I wrote up five tips for writing recursive functions in a blog post: [The Recursive Leap of Faith, Explained](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/leap-of-faith.html)\n\nThe five tips are (with explanations in the blog post):\n\n1. Start by figuring out the data types of the parameters and return value.\n1. Next, implement the base case.\n1. Take a leap of faith and assume your recursive function magically returns the correct value, and write your recursive case.\n1. First Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call cannot be the original argument.\n1. Second Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call must ALWAYS get closer to the base case.\n\n\nThe main thing to know is that recursion is mostly overrated. If your problem involves both 1) a tree structure and 2) back tracking, then it's a good candidate for recursion. Otherwise, if you find yourself asking, \"Why couldn't I just do this with a loop\" then you're right: it's a poor candidate for recursion and you should just use the simpler loop solution.",

But you'd need one stack for the file scanner objects (representing the system's view of the directories you had descended) and another for the data you were building for each directory... and you'd carefully inspect each file object, and push a new file scanner if it was a directory, and carefully handle your end-of-scan issues at each level, popping both stacks... it could get tricky.\n\nNow consider doing it with recursion.  You imagine the functional interface you want ‚Äì let's say, a File, and a DataSoFar.  Consider your base case ‚Äì is the File a simple file, not a directory?  Great, you're done.  Produce your output.  Otherwise you need to recurse ‚Äì okay, it's a directory: update DataSoFar, create a scanner from the File, loop through the scanner and call your function on each of the files.  Boom, done.  The book-keeping and boundary conditions are handled for you by the program stack, and you stick to familiar function calling and error-handling idioms.\n\nThe key leap for me is always that imaginative step: *what's the functional interface I wish I could use to solve one step of this problem?*  Recursion sometimes allows you to achieve that interface with minimal effort and great clarity.",

Each employee is only tasked with a small task, like finding a particular item or swapping two items based alphabetically based on their name. At the end, you'll have that one employee that found the item you were looking for or the warehouse will be sorted depending on what task you were trying to solve.\n\nThat's probably worse than any analogy a good article would provide.

If you enjoy it, you'll naturally want to do it often, read about it, take courses, etc. - basically, you'll have drive. It takes a certain analytical mind to enjoy coding, but it also takes a creative mind. You have to enjoy making things and solving problems.\n2. Naturally, at first you're going to suck at it. This applies to anything new. When I just started, I was terrible. I once \"randomized\" an array by generating random numbers and putting them in each slot, waiting longer and longer for the correct unused number as the array filled up. You need to push through this learning curve - there's no way around it. It took me about 6 years to become even moderately decent.\n3. You mentioned switching from one language to another. Here's the thing about programming: it's way more about understanding the concepts than memorizing the specific language syntax. If you understand how variables work, how if-else statements function, how loops operate, etc., you're already 80% of the way there with any language. The remaining 20% is just syntax differences you can easily look up when needed.",

The next time you are building one of your own creations, you have some ideas of what pieces you have and how they could be used, so you disassemble some of your sets, and try to use the pieces in different ways in your own creation. Maybe it'll work, and you have to order more pieces like it - or it won't work and you have to imagine something else.\n\nWhen not building you are sorting your pieces, experimenting with connecting them in different ways, trying out small techniques outside of large projects, and you get ideas for how you also could use those pieces, maybe you even get an idea for a large project using the pieces that way!\n\nAlso, you follow builders on social media, and talk with other builders, asking for inspiration, looking inside their creations, and you are always learning!\n\nWhen you have an idea for something, but absolute no knowledge of how to build it, you try sketching it, experiment with the pieces you have, will this fit? No, well how about this? Maybe if I turn that one that way?\n\nYou won't always succeed, and some projects might be abandoned, but you are always learning!\n\n  \nDon't ever expect to \"see\" the magical piece that will solve your exact problem, if you have never worked on anything even remotely similar, or even seen pieces anywhere close to what you need!\n\nAnd don't think that you'll immediately get to know thousands of pieces and how they connect - sometimes you will have to make things \"the wrong way\", or simply \"fake\" them, make a function that pretends to do the work for you, until you learn the right way. Take a look at the LEGO creations by young kids, they almost never look exactly like they should, but they are an appromixation.\n\nSo, answer 1 is: always be learning, experiment with what you have, try to solve it close enough. And answer 2 is: Don't try to look for the perfect solution when you only know 1% of everything that is - look around you, and see if you can get just a little closer to your goal!

Without that, a five minute research search can end with me realizing it's 2 am and I've gotten nothing done. \n\nAs for the rest... it really is just experience, and not feeling bad about the fact that you still need to look stuff up X years in. For example, I've been using PHP for like 20 years and I still have to look up simple functions because I forget the syntax *all the time*. Who cares, though? I know what it does and how it works, not remembering what comes first in a substring isn't the end of the world.\n\nFor me, at least, becoming a better programmer is less about memorization or always knowing what the right \"piece\" is, and is more about a general understanding and \"feel\" for how things work. You might not know if a specific function exists to do what you want, and it sucks to spend the time working on something only to find out later it was as easy as using a function that already exists, but it's probably going to happen to you more than once - but now you know the function exists and you know how to work without it. Figuring out how to do something, even the most trivial \"I'll never need to do this again\" thing, is never a *bad* thing and will help you grow. Maybe later you'll be learning another language that's similar but it doesn't have an applicable function for what you were doing, and it's not a problem because you know how to do it by hand. This probably isn't the most realistic example, the point is that I try to never look at \"I just did more than I needed to\" as a negative as long as it's not causing you to miss deadlines (and as long as it's not happening constantly).\n\nI'm hesitant to push AI as it's really easy to become overly reliant on it, and you should never rely on code AI slings out without vetting it yourself, but if you treat it like a search engine it's certainly a lot easier to say \"I'm trying to do X with Y and am wondering what methods others currently use\" than to try and get the perfect Google search or scroll through docs.\n\nIt never hurts to join a coding community, either. I haven't done that since usenet but I'm sure there are discords or whatever out there.",

Not necessarily trivial - I've been programming for almost 4 decades, but I've never learned Rust for instance and if you told me I had to write something in Rust with a gun to my head I of course couldn't do it. But if I got hired for a job and was told \"Oh yeah we only work in Rust\" I'd just go \"Great, I'm excited to learn Rust!\" and not be too intimidated by it.\n\nOnce you've got a strong foundation, your choice of technology will just be driven by what you want to *do* next. You pick something you want to create (or get hired onto a job) and you learn what you need to know as you need to know it. If you're working on getting hired, you pick a project that overlaps strongly with the needs of your local job market, and you learn what you need to make yourself an attractive candidate.\n\nBut if you don't have fundamentals down, go back to working on that. Without tutorials, AI, or any of that junk. Take one of the many free university courses (university courses, even if they're free and not for credit, tend to be much more rigorous than much of the junk on youtube or whatever) and get your data structures and algorithms skills solid, etc.\n\nFirst step though is really assessing where you are right now.",

Java Spring Boot does a similar thing but with decorators, favouring composition over inheritance. Node Express doesn‚Äôt have Controller classes/prototypes, instead endpoints are just function properties assigned to an instance of an App object with callbacks to define their behaviour. They all have the concept of endpoints, they all have HTTP verbs and request/response objects, they all push you more or less to an MVC architecture, but very different implementations. Knowing the concept is way more important than knowing only one implementation.\n\nWhen you move to a language you don‚Äôt know - say Rust - and you try and implement an endpoint as a Node Express style async function, you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time.

In fact, JS should probably only ever be used by anybody if and when they have a compelling reason why they can't use TS instead.\n\nLearning TS will also teach you JS; all you need to learn there are which TS bits are \"extra\".\n\nThe one thing JS has over TS is the way you can just plug a tiny snippet into a webpage and have it do something. That's probably helpful for beginners on day 1, but by the end of a week they'd have been better off starting with TS.",

There is no tutorial, there is no shortcut.\n\nTutorials/courses can teach you the basic skills; they can lay the *foundation*. It is upon you to build the house brick by brick, floor by floor.\n\nYou start with small, simple games and work your way up.\n\nTake the game engine of your choice (I'd recommend Godot for starters) and build something simple, something like e.g. *Tic-Tac-Toe*. Then venture into more complex territory, e.g. something like *Battleships*. Then, move on to more complex tasks, e.g. *Sokoban (Box Pusher)* - these are all fairly simple to make games that will each teach you a lot. To get something more dynamic, the classic *Pong* or *Breakout (Arkanoid clone)* are good starts, but only after you have progressed enough. Make a *Pacman* clone. \n\nUsing old games has the advantage that the entire *game mechanics* are well known and well documented.\n\nWhen you gradually build up your skills you can always venture into larger, more complex games, make the switch from 2D to 2.5D (often also wrongly called Isometric) to 3D.\n\nWith each game you make you will improve your skills, *provided* that you don't just do tutorial after tutorial that creates the game *for* you. At utmost, use the tutorials as inspiration and try to make things on your own. Then, if you fail and can't find a solution, look at the tutorial to see how they did it. Don't just copy the tutorial. First, try on your own. Experimenting, trying, failing, fixing are all part of learning, copying is not learning.\n\nAlso, games are developed *incrementally*. They start with simple mechanics, e.g. how to interact with the player, how to set up the levels, etc. Then, they work with the collisions, and so on. Commonly, the *game art* is quite far towards the end of the development. Sure, you need to know roughly how big your game entities (players, enemies, background, etc.) will be but you don't need to have them fully developed at the start.\n\nGet things working first and then make them good and pretty.",

Then you will get to apply those basics to build something that _interests YOU_. Useful can also mean, that you are learning something. Maybe you are learning a new language, a new framework, a new library. That is useful as a preparation for other things to come.\n\nWork? Yes, yes ... That will be how you sustain yourself, but most likely, if you are a craftsman, or artist, work will be less interesting, than your own projects. As you progress in skill, your work will probably be simpler, more rote, than your own projects.\n\nAbout interviews: Don't forget, that interviews are a stress situation. Depending on the person, mostly what they test is stress resilience, not your computer programming skill. What you are describing about being given 2h and a bunch of files ... That might as well be badly designed code, that is a trap into bad design. In such a situation you might have to deal with the shit you are given as code, but keep an open mind to alternative solutions.\n\nI have been working for 7y mostly using Python and still I did no good in interviews with live coding. Sometimes it was the requirements, that were too narrow, them expecting one particular solution. Other times I was too nervous and simply couldn't think straight. In contrast to my work experience, in which I basically built a company from the ground up, at least on the technical side, and on my own designed and developed multiple still maintained services, that make the company their money.\nSo mostly my interviewing experience has been quite shit, and it can happen to everyone.

Build something where you have to think on a higher level of abstraction than while-loops and if-statements, struggle with understanding the framework, and use all your knowledge of the language to build something 'standard'.\n\nYou are \"done\" with learning the programming language, now you have to learn how to build programs - and the easiest way to get started is to follow advanced tutorials, and notice repeating patterns in the way they build things!\n\nAlso, don't forget about the interview-exam - store it somewhere, and pick it up again in a few weeks, try to see if it suddenly becomes easier.",

In the former days, this was an actual ROM, now it is usually some form of erasable programmable memory, like an EEPROM.\n\nThe BIOS then has all the code to carry out the POST (Power On Self Test), plus libraries/functionality to talk with the various hardware components, and the code to then start, in case of a PC, the Operating System, of which the boot-loader is stored in a certain place on the hard drive (SSD, nVme, etc) of the computer.\n\nIn case of the modern UEFI BIOS, this system is usually also stored on the computer's hard drive, but also exists in a storage on the main board so that when you change the hard drive, the computer can still boot.\n\nA good start to understand how everything of this plays together is to look into Microcontrollers, like the 8031/8051, Atmel (Arduino) as they are basically the same as a PC minus the operating system.",

        "body": "> At the moment I have the impression that every language is able to do anything\n\nYes and no.  Any Turing complete language, which is effectively all of them, can manipulate state, which is what programs do.  Any general purpose language, which is most of them, can do most tasks.\n\nHowever, where those languages can be used is a function of implementation.  OS broadly, web browser narrowly, your favorite game, maybe Lua.\n\n> Can you give me examples of where some feature is not implemented in a language because it would directly block another feature? \n\nHow about [type systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system)?  How a language lets you define and handle types tends to be a defining feature.  It also will impact every aspect of how you develop a program in that language.  Choose one, block the other.  A strict type system catches errors at compile time, a loose one might only catch some errors at run time.  Write your tests accordingly.\n\nAlong the same lines, [mutablity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object).  This is the break point between imperative and declarative.  The level to which that can be dictated by the programmer also defines a language.\n\n[Function overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading) comes to mind.  It's extremely popular, lots of languages do it, and lots don't.  There are pros and cons in implementing such a feature.  There is implementation complexity but also programmer expectation.\n\nGarbage collection?  How resources are released is a big deal in all languages.  In some languages, all clean up is the responsibility of the programmer.  In others, the programmer barely has a say.\n\nVirtual machines?  Java and .NET, among others, run inside a sandbox.  This is good for portability and stability, buy denies access to the OS; you get what the sandbox gives you.\n\nLast, but not exhaustively, libraries.  The standard libraries available to a language might dictate its use.  If what you want to do only has a library in C, you're either porting it to your favorite language, creating an interop wrapper for it, or writing in C.",

Most of them can do the task. It's just what you like.\n\nThink about C++ and Objective-C. Both were attempts to make C object-oriented. Did one stop when they heard about the other? Did C++ win because it was the best for the job? No, C++ won because it was part of AT&T which was a much bigger entity than the folks that developed Objective-C.\n\nIt's just like natural languages. Is English the best language? Some (who natively speak it) say yes, but it's only because they speak it. Others insist that their language is best. We could learn Esperanto which was a designed language where the ease of learning was a key objective. Yet, it's not popular because people love their own languages, and maybe ease of learning isn't that important. Some people love how complex their language is (or how many feature it has).\n\nTo get to your second question, there are languages that try to avoid using null, so they have to create Option types (that's one way to do it). This creates a level of mental overhead that those who have never used those types find unimportant, yet others, who think null pointer exceptions are evil and the cause of many errors feel it's justified.\n\nOr languages that want to be pure functional have problems with I/O, such as printing, and have to use complex math structures like monads, when everyone else feels printing is really easy, but it's counter to the functional philosophy.\n\nProlog was built to have a backtracking mechanism, and for most, it looks like nothing you'd expect and is hard to get your mind around, and because of that, hard to figure out. Erlang, which was inspired by Prolog, has a syntax that's hard for those used to C-style syntax (which is most popular languages) to understand, partly because it was designed before language designers decided languages should look like C.\n\nAnd was that because C was a great language? No, but it was hugely popular in industry, so to design languages that looked like C was considered beneficial because people were more likely to try out your language if they didn't have to struggle with the syntax as much.\n\nFunctional languages don't like having state, so they don't have plain old for-loops because the looping variables change values. So, they use functions like: fold, map, filter, zip, etc. to achieve looping capabilities without a looping variable. They also rely a lot on recursion.\n\nIt helps if you try these other languages like learning Prolog or Erlang or Haskell to see how different they are.",

Some languages have them others dont. And this is not a this language just hasnt gotten to the point of implementing them, its a deliberate decission to leave it to the programmer to do deal with it them self so they wont ever get that \"feature\". You can also argue that its a feature to not have a garbage collection.\n\nThis goes on with other things, like some languages are made in mind to be used with oop and thus have strong support for oop. Other are made in mind with procedual code. And the maintainers of a procedual language wont implement oop features. \n\nSo no its not about just speed.",

The muscle memory comes back fast.\n\nUse AI tools as your coding buddy. These days, knowing how to prompt an AI and debug its output is almost as important as raw coding skills.\n\nDocument everything. Push to GitHub from day one (even tiny projects) so you never lose progress again.\n\nThink portfolio, not perfection. Build stuff that excites you ‚Äî it‚Äôs way more motivating than tutorials.\n\nI actually wrote a piece about choosing the right programming language and career path based on your strengths. A lot of people who come back to coding after a break get stuck on where to restart, and that‚Äôs exactly what I tried to answer.

I've had similar experiences with courses where the instructor seems to contradict themselves, and it definitely slows things down.\n\nFrom my own experience, I'd suggest a couple of resources that are great for getting a solid foundation in PHP:\n\nThe official PHP Manual (PHP.net): It can be a bit dry, but it's the absolute source of truth. Whenever I was stuck on what a function did or the right way to write something, I'd go there. It's less a tutorial and more of a reference, but it's essential.\n\nfreeCodeCamp: They have a full, comprehensive PHP course on YouTube that is completely free. It's well-structured and a fantastic alternative to a confusing paid course.\n\nAs for how long it takes, everyone's different. My biggest piece of advice, based on my own journey, is don't get lost in a forest of theory and code at the start.\n\nJust learn the absolute basics‚Äîvariables, loops, etc.‚Äîand then immediately start doing. Try to build something super simple. A huge help for me was using an AI assistant. You can literally tell it, \"Explain this to me like I'm a child,\" and it will break down complex concepts into really simple terms. Use it to guide you as you build your first small project.\n\nOnce you have some hands-on experience and things start to click, then go back and learn the deeper theory. It'll make so much more sense because you'll have actual context for it.\n\nYou got this, good luck",

In fact they're probably a good idea!\n\nWhen you start to work with other people, the rule is \"Good code is self-documenting,\" meaning it should be obvious what the code does without needing explanatory comments.\n\nUse variable names, data structures and encapsulation to minimise the amount of thinking that a reader has to do. For example, I'd refactor your code to make `Card` a class:\n\n```\nclass Card:\n    def __init__(self, cardString):\n        self.name = self._getName(cardString[0])\n        self.value = self._getValue(cardString[0])\n        self.suit = self._getSuit(cardString[1])\n\n    def _getName(self, cardFirstCharacter):\n        if cardFirstCharacter in v.faceCards:\n            return v.faceCards[cardFirstCharacter]\n        elif cardFirstCharacter.upper() == 'A':\n            return 'Ace'\n        else:\n            return cardFirstCharacter\n\n    def _getValue(self, cardFirstCharacter):\n        if cardFirstCharacter in v.faceCards:\n            return 10\n        elif cardFirstCharacter.upper() == 'A':\n            return 11\n        else:\n            return int(cardFirstCharacter)\n\n    def _getSuit(self, cardSecondCharacter):\n        suits = [\"Hearts\", \"Diamonds\", \"Clubs\", \"Spades\"]\n        return next((suit for suit in suits if suit[0] == cardSecondCharacter), None)\n```\n\nThen `hit()` becomes easy:\n\n```\ndef hit():\n    drawnCard = drawCard()\n    v.cardIdens.append(drawnCard)\n    card = Card(drawnCard)\n    return card.name, card.value\n```\n\n**Variable names** - `drawnCard` and `cardString` are the exact same thing, given different names in different contexts. The `Card` class doesn't need to care that a `cardString` was just drawn from `drawCard()`. Similarly, `cardString[0]` might look a bit mad, but when we pass it to a method we rename it to `cardFirstCharacter` in the method, which clearly tells you what it is.\n\n**Data structures** - I'm really bad at this to be honest. I'm a JavaScript dev, and JavaScript only has arrays (lists) and objects (dicts), so I tend to think only in arrays and objects for any problem.\n\n**Encapsulation** - `hit()` doesn't need to know or care how a card's value is calculated, because that implementation is _encapsulated_ in the `Card` class. If `Card` is assumed to work fine (because we also wrote tests!) then a developer debugging `hit()` can ignore it. Similarly, `Card._getSuit` contains some _really_ funky code, it's borderline unreadable. But if we only care how a card gets its name and value, we don't have to read any of the funky code that gets the suit.",

This is because they ***own*** the JVM and the Op Codes, and JVM is designed so they can have a One-to-One disassembly.

You guys really should because it is really long and convoluted.

I'll answer them separately:\n\n>is it necessary to read ~~all of~~ the documentation for a programming language to fully understand it?\n\nI'd lean on the side of yes. Reason being - each language has it's idiosyncracies/hidden gotchas/pitfalls. Most (if not all) of these are usually spelt out in the docs. In fact, several questions people ask on reddit/stackoverflow have their answers lying partially or wholly in the docs.\n\nThat being said, there are caveats to how much of the docs one needs to read. I've added some context around this further below.\n\n>is it necessary to read ALL OF the documentation for a programming language to fully understand it?\n\nNo. It's recommended, but not necessary to read ALL of the documentation.  My personal opinion is that you should only read the docs for things you're explicitly working with (though it's always good to go above and beyond).\n\n>I ask because documentation often contains a lot of specifications and information that can be overwhelming. I have been advised to read the \"reference manuals\" first, but even that is difficult.\n\nI feel you. Docs can be overwhelming especially if you're just starting out / are not familiar with the language. Here's how I do it (may or may not work for you) - I tend to generally only give docs a very surface level read/ avoid them until I'm fairly well versed with the language. Then - once I start doing more complex stuff - I tend to simply use my IDE to read docs for specific things I'm working with.\n\nE.g. in Java, if I'm using a class from the core library, I can hit F12 in my IDE to go to the class's source code and read the doc comments directly within that class.\n\nI find that this compartmentalizes the doc information to only the specific pieces of info I need for my work. It's much less overwhelming to me that way. YMMV.",

Nope.\n\nWhile you certainly can, it may not be the best way to approach it.\n\nIve been learning since jan, ive been using udemy courses, yt vids, projects and docs. Nowhere could i find a methodology to go through the documentation to find something and honestly its kinda confusing especially with poorly written docs.\n\nWhat i have found to help is to start high level and zoom into specifics as you get a better idea of what to do. \n\nHeres a recent example from my side while building a crud app. \n\nI want to create and view a blog article so what do i do? \nAssuming the html forms and express server is already set up. Ok so i need to be able to firstly log the inputs, what does it look like, how do i do that, and if its not in a useable state, how do i transform it. Ok then i need to be able to access the json file and also somehow save to the json file. Ok then lastly to view the article i need to again access the json and somehow display the info somewhere in my html( or in my case ejs template). Again what would happen if the data is not in a useable state? \n\nThis breaks down all the steps which you can then go looking for your methods. So as an example (im using node and express for the backend) i want to access the json file. So you can google that and read around or go straight to the docs (if you know roughly which module) and then look for various ways to read a json file. And then when you find, ok so in the fs module i have a few methods to choose from, .read().readFile().createReadStream(), so among these methods which one is applicable to my situation. Now you're reading the docs, looking at specifics, comparing methods with a specific goal in mind. You can even test each one to see if it works or not. \n\nI have found this to work for me... And yes its very time intensive as compared to just getting the code from AI in 30sec. \n\nLike i said, im still learning, but im keen to hear your opinions and any more seasoned professionals on how they approach docs. Its something that doesn't get explained on how to navigate and find what you need.",

The problem you need to solve is _text processing and XML handling_, but what you're asking about is _fully understanding Python_. These are two different things.\n\nPython as a language lets you be productive with only a small understanding of the language itself (that's how I got started with it; I've actually forgotten how or when I started writing Python, at some point I realised that's what I was writing my scripts in, rather than Perl or Bash).\n\nIn programming, as elsewhere, a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. The stuff you write with only a minimal understanding of Python will look awkward to someone more experienced, including yourself some few months from now.\n\nGenerally what you want is:\n\n1. a _good enough_ understanding of the language semantics itself. \"Good enough\" is poorly defined, and varies by language:\n  * A language like Rust will require more investment in learning up front, but deliver very few gotchas down the line\n  * A language like Javascript or PHP will require very little investment in learning up front, but deliver more gotchas down the line\n  * Python is kinda more middle-of-the-road.\n  * For this bit you kinda just gotta read a book, preferably a good one so you don't fall asleep, and do some exercises to get a feel for it.\n1. A decent understanding of engineering in the language, as in, how do you write long-term maintainable code?\n  * This includes which libraries and external tools you're expected to use.\n  * For Python you kinda have to check /r/Python and other resources, but currently Astral tools like `uv` and `ruff` are good to have in your toolkit, and a typechecker like Microsoft's `pyright` until Astral's `ty` gets to 1.0.\n  * Static analysis, both typechecking and linters, will help you catch weaknesses in your understanding of what you're doing.\n1. A decent ability to discover relevant information in documentation, especially reading API docs.\n  * Generally searching is better than trying to memorize everything. Your brain can only fit so much information.\n  * Language servers / IDEs can help a lot with discoverability.",

That can come later once you actually develop the app, and shouldn't have much bearing on how the app is developed. \n\nWebb apps have 3 main components. A backend of some sort (usually some kind of API that serves JSON, but depending on your design it might also serve fully rendered HTML), a database that stores persistent data (user info, product info, user content, etc) that your backend interacts with, and a frontend that consists of HTML, JS, and CSS (this frontend may be served by the same backend discussed before or could be served by a different service. Doesn't really matter for development.\n\nSo how do you pick what to use? You'll get tons of answers. One answer could be that you should use whatever your team currently uses. Another might be that you have really specific performance requirements that demand a certain stack. \n\nFor you, the answer is \"whatever you want\". Really. I would look up some common stacks that maybe use languages you're already familiar with and then just pick one and go with a getting started guide. \n\nLike javascript a lot? Use MERN. More of a Python guy? Use Flask or Fast API and pick either Vue or React for the frontend. Want to learn more vanilla javascript and not bother with frameworks? Cool. You don't need React or Vue or any other framework. \n\nFor other tools, make sure you're comfortable with git, github, working in bash or zsh or some other *nix shell. Once you actually have an app developed, you should be in a good place to figure out how to actually deploy it.",

It doesn't have to be bound to a controller. It can be, but a DTO is just that: A data transfer object. It is a box of properties that simply moves data from A to B. It can be used to move data outside of the application, but it can also be used to simplify transferring data from one side of the codebase to the other.\n\nHowever, if we assume that a DTO in this case always correlates with some data being returned in a controller, then you'd most likely want to do the mapping in the controller. Being dogmatic about this can be a little difficult, as you'd quickly end up making DTO objects between the service and the controller layer for situations where you have to join together data from different sources (which can be fine as well).\n\nThe issue with having the service layer coupled with API DTOs is that other parts of the system might want to use your service without being coupled to the API (which you point out in your post), which can become a problem. However, if that doesn't happen, then there's no issue.\n\nMy point is that there's no single rule. It depends on the dependencies within the system, as well as how the system will develop over time. \n\nMy general advice here is to push everything outward from the core of your application until it starts to become annoying. When you've found the sweetspot, then keep it there until other things start making it annoying, then consider pushing it further out (or pull it inwards) depending on how it is annoying. Don't be set in stone; instead, be pragmatic and flexible.",

Without it, we have to do this mapping on our own.\n\nThen we can can make a simplified DAO service, which provide CRUD operations we can use in the controller (presentation layer). It's already possible to use the ORM operations directly in the controller, but I prefer a service class to make this cleaner.\n\nSomehow, we have to map from entityDTO to presentationDTO. The presentationDTO is used to return a response to the client. \n\nI read that this mapping is done in the service layer, the problem:\n\nIf we map the entityDTO in the service to the presentationDTO, the service will always return a presentationDTO that is expected to be used in a controller or view.   \n  \nFor example, in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) core, we do not want to return a response from the entityDTO directly, since they contain navigation properties. We want the JSON output to exclude the navigation props and instead translate type references to foreign key fields. That is why we map to a presentationDTO.\n\nBut sometimes we want to use service class in another service class and we do not want to already return a presentationDTO from the service. In this case, the service should return an entityDTO so we can use this data in the other services if necessary. Then if we want to map this entityDTO to a presentationDTO, it's best to do this in the controller.\n\nDo you know what I mean?",

You *can, it's possible,* in the same way anything you want to code is possible. The convention is to not return these in this form. They are mapped the moment they are retrieved from a database, so by definition they are returned from the Data Access Object (or DB layer) and this is unavoidable - so you always start by mapping the data from a persistence driver to a language class instance (or dictionary).\n\n  \nWhile controllers return a *response* that can easily just be whatever the service returns wrapped in whatever response your protocol expects. The response from a service is what is in question here.\n\nIn spring for example, you will commonly see in a service:\n\nexample() {  \nvar stuff = repo.getStuff();  \n...business logic...  \n\n\nreturn stuff.stream().map(StuffToDtoMapper::EntityToDTO}....;\n\n)\n\nThis is done in the service layer because the service doesn't want to return the entire entity model to the controller, assuming it's a service method that is called directly by a controller, often times, the service might not even be receiving the entity itself, but rather an intermittent object still on the database side (e.g. spring projections) which it would still want mapped to a presentation DTO, as you said.\n\nWhen you want to use the entire entity in a different service, which is completely normal, you define a separate method in your service (some even opt for different services, but that's overkill in my opinion) that returns the entity itself, indicating that it is used for inter-service communication and not to be routed back through a controller.\n\nAll these things are just conventions, you can technically do anything you want, but this communicates intent to other developers who are familiar with the convention.",

To freelance you need to be able to do a little of everything. You need years of experience working on real-world projects.\n* For fully-remote freelance work, you're competing against the whole world - and there are some very talented freelance developers in third-world countries who work for very little money. There are also millions of other developers hoping to break into freelancing who are charging very little in order to build a reputation.\n* It's not just enough to want to earn money from home. You actually have to have the aptitude and interest. Learning to be a developer takes years of dedication and hard work. Most people who think it sounds interesting give up once they realize how hard it is.\n\nIf you're interested in being a developer, the only solid route is a 4-year Computer Science degree (or equivalent), then a few years of in-person employment to get experience, then you might have a chance of going remote eventually.",

Learn something like data structures, loops, and functions, then immediately put them into practice through small, fun projects. For example, if you learn about lists and loops, build a simple quiz game or a to do list app. This way, you‚Äôll reinforce your learning and keep it engaging. Projects don‚Äôt have to be big or complex at this stage so just think of them more as practice reps.\n\nExam prep and coding will come down to prioritization. Your exam is the gateway to METU, so make sure that‚Äôs your main focus until it‚Äôs done. But coding can act as a mental refresh so use it as a productive break from studying. Consistency beats intensity so it‚Äôs better to code a little regularly than to burn out trying to do everything at once.

Then expose the Pi server to the internet however, e.g. using Cloudflare.\n\nFor a more robust setup, I'd go with an ESP32 (capable of deep sleep when idle) to read the button, which sends a notification to a backend API server, which updates a separate static web server. Both the API server and the web server can be either locally or remotely hosted, depending on how much effort you want to go to, how much traffic you expect, and how much you want to pay.",

At my first internship I was having lunch with a friend and he mentioned that I wasn't looking him in the eye when I talked to him.  I had honestly never noticed that was something I was not doing.  From then on, I made it a point to make the right amount of eye contact with people and get comfortable with that.  I tell this story to help give you an idea of just how awkward I was at talking to people.\n\n2. In University, I enrolled in a public speaking course to force me out of my comfort zone.  Honestly it was one of the most valuable courses I took in my entire Pure Math & Computer Science degree, because after that I felt comfortable giving presentations.\n\n3. As a junior dev you can mostly get by with quietly coding what you are told to code.  However, even then you will have to collaborate with others.  I got really good at listening.  Learning a few languages can also help with accents and other language barriers that you may encounter.\n\n4. As you work your way up from junior to senior dev you will have to start taking on more of a leadership role: Giving presentations, holding team meetings, meeting 1:1 with people, discussing designs, etc.\n\n5. If you work your way up to dev manager, then soft skills start taking over almost completely from technical skills.  You will have to navigate emotional conversations with your reports, mediate conflicts, liase with other team leads.  At one point when I was leading a team of 12 people, all with different backgrounds and from different parts of the world, I got feedback from one of my reports that she was impressed that I could even understand what everyone was saying during our team standups since a lot of people had strong accents.  This is where point 3 really helped.\n\n6. It's still not easy.  Recently my manager wanted me to travel to headquarters because he felt my team was not \"visible\" enough.  That meant my mission was to go there and have face to face meetings with as many people as possible.  To be honest, I was dreading this trip.  However, sometimes you just have to jump into the deep end instead of trying to tiptoe in.  I set up the meetings, I got on the flight, and I spent a week talking to people about work stuff.  The feedback I got was that the trip was a huge success.

If you're good at making a certain impression of yourself or even are manipulative, you can skate on that for your career, but at some point your lack of technical skills will show. On the other hand, working in a team mandates a decent level of proficiency in communication and a personality that is welcome (or tolerable at minimum) in a group of people.\n\nI can't say I understand what your describing that well though. Totally guessing, I'd say you're either a bit too harsh on yourself and perhaps have above average expectations of your own social performance, or maybe you do have some tendencies to be less than perfectly social, like being on the spectrum - which would not super unusual either. If there's actually something to it, it's good that you're aware of it either way, that's the first step to getting to the bottom of it. If you can describe a situation you have in mind in more detail, perhaps it'd be easier to say anything more meaningful here.\n\nAlso, to add one thing regarding communication - it's probably less on you than you might think. It's the team's professional interest to maintain a meeting environment that's open and inviting of any respectful and constructive contribution.  However, I've seen environments where the meeting quickly devolves into a heated debate of a few people, and it's a match of grasping at a chance to say anything for everyone else. If you have a valuable thing to say, it's not on you to move mountains just to be able to say it.",

Steve wrote the entire program in 6502 Assembly - on paper - then hand-translated everything in the numeric machine code that then could be loaded on the Apple computers. You can find plenty information on how Steve did it on the internet.\n\nWhen I learnt 8051 Assembly in my degree program we initially also learnt to hand-translate the Mnemonics into machine code and vice versa. Can highly recommend to learn that with simpler CPUs, like the 6502, the Zilog Z-80, or the 8051/8031/8080 series Microcontrollers.\n\nAssembly is just a 1:1 translation of machine code and therefore is closest to hardware.",

Well the first assembler would have been written in machine code. With the tedium of converting the bytes of the assembly code into something you could work with to eventually get machine code out.

In a basic sense functions take in data do something with it then return data back to whatever called it.\n\nit‚Äôs generally bad practice to have functions work on non local variables if you can avoid it because it makes the code less reusable and more prone to weird difficult to diagnose bugs because you have many functions work on the same data it becomes much harder to diagnose and fix undefined behavior.\n\nSimple pattern to start. If you need to mutate a variable, instead of the function mutating the variable directly, set the function to take an input, mutate that input and return the value you want to mutate. That way the function can do the same behavior, mutating the variable, but it can also save that variable to a new variable.\nHere‚Äôs a sample snippet of python code to explain what I mean.\nEdit: Reddit messing up formatting here.\n\ndef increment(x):\n        return x + 1\n\ncount = 0\n\ncount = increment(count)  # updates original\n\nnew_count = increment(count)  # keeps original\n\nCount starts at zero, the increment function increments it by one and then you save the incremented count to new_count. This structure is much clearer to people reading your code, the function can now be used for more than just mutating a single global variable and you are discouraged from creating single use functions.\n\nAs you get better at programming, free floating variables become much rarer. Most variables are used as temporary storage for working data, (and if we are really to get into the weeds they act as human readable abstractions that become pure memory operations at compile time) while all persistent data has a clear owner. This makes it much easier to reason about where data lives, who‚Äôs allowed to change it, and how long it will exist. If you are making simple python scripts right now it might seem tempting to do things quick and dirty, after all that is what python is good for, but developing good habits in the beginning pay dividends once you have to start working on more complex systems.",

But if you want more structured learning, Chad Darby's Spring Boot course on Udemy is solid. Covers everything from basics to connecting with databases and building REST APIs.\n\nAlso, since you're coming from a React background, you might want to consider the MERN stack instead of jumping straight to Java/Spring Boot. Node.js with Express is way easier to pick up when you already know JavaScript, and you can focus on learning backend concepts without learning a whole new language at the same time.\n\nAt Metana we actually see this transition a lot. Frontend devs wanting to go full stack. Most find it easier to stick with JavaScript ecosystem first (Node/Express) then maybe explore Java later if needed. But if your project specifically needs Spring Boot or you're targeting Java jobs, then go for it.\n\nEither way, the key is building that project while you learn. Don't just do tutorials tho. Actually build your backend API as you go through the course material. You'll learn way faster that way.",

Once you finish that, do it again. Then, try again the next day, and the next week.\n\nYou'll encounter different bugs each time, which will help you get a better overall understanding of the project.

Printing it out would be much easier, but then it's hard to use the factors afterwards.\n\nBut the optimization is something rather simple and follows a trick that you use to determine if a number is prime.\n\nInstead of going from 1 to n, you go from 1 to ceil(sqrt(n)). Here's why you can stop at the square root of n. \n\nSuppose you find a factor that's smaller than the square root of n. Let's call it x. Because it's a factor, there's also another factor y such that `x * y = n`.\n\nNow `y` has to be bigger than (or equal to) the square root of n. If it weren't, then you have two numbers smaller than the square root of n which, when multiplied, will be smaller than n.\n\nYou might wonder, could we miss some factors greater than the square root of n by stopping so soon? The answer is no. Why? For a similar reason. Suppose there is a factor, `y` that's bigger than the square root of n. Then, it must have a corresponding factor, `x`, which is less than the square root. If it didn't, then both `x` and `y` would both be greater than the square root of n, and their product would be greater than n (which would mean they aren't factors).\n\nSo, you could modify it something like\n\n      float root= sqrt((float) n); // or however you get the square root\n      // Crude way to get the ceiling of the root\n      int limit = (int) (root + 1);\n      for (int i = 1; i <= limit; i++) {\n         if (n % i == 0) { // Check if it's a factor\n            // It is\n            printf(\"%d is a factor\\n\", i);\n            int other = n / i; // Get other factor\n            if (other != i) {\n                 // Don't double print if we hit the square root\n                printf(\"%d is a also a factor\\n\", i);\n            }\n       }\n\nIf you wanted to save the array allocation cost and do it once, you could run this loop twice. The first time, you'd check for how many factors there were (create a counter before the loop and increment each time you print). Then, you'd malloc the array, then fill in the array again.\n\nHard to say which is more efficient, but the square root trick is pretty useful because square root of n is MUCH smaller than n, so that's the number 1 idea you can use.",

        "body": "Squeezing this kind of optimization (to me) seems silly. You're calling the square root function *once*. On the other hand, you're computing `i * i` each time through the loop. When both are good enough (C programmers from the 1980s and 1990s obsessed over writing the fastest code, but these days, if the code runs fast enough, then clarity of code matters more than efficiency), you opt for the one that is clearer to the reader which could be you or be someone else.\n\nThis is why some people use Python (with Django or Flask) on the backend or even Node. A Rust backend would be faster, at the expense of being harder to read. Speed isn't everything, and even when it is, guessing what is fast or slow is not an effective way to improve the speed: you need a way to measure your program's execution (this is called instrumenting it). There are tools called *profilers* that can do this, but it's not super easy to set up and differs from language to language.\n\nFor example, you can call a very expensive function that takes, say, a second once, but if you have a loop that goes a million times, and you can shave a millisecond off each iteration, that matters more.\n\nIn this case, the square root trick really reduces the number of iterations and has the biggest impact, far more than deciding whether to use square root or i * i. I think it's fine to stick with i * i, because it's pretty close to saying square root. This is where it's useful to have a comment like\n \n    // Not using square root because i * i is more efficient\n\ncan help. Often, when you're trying to speed things up, comments help indicate you're writing less obvious code to help speed it up.\n\nHowever, many beginners obsess over speed without truly knowing how to speed it up (basically, they try a bunch of things). Algorithmic improvements are usually the ones to aim for rather than smaller things like how fast square root runs. Having said that, many years ago I wrote a program using sine and cosine, and because I computed it over and over, it was slow (I had no idea).\n\nThe solution was to create an array with the results pre-computed. I only had a limited number of values I was running these trig functions on (say, 60), so placing the pre-computed values in the array and looking those values up was far more efficient.\n\nSo, it *can* matter. But usually you want to spot big loops which is where things tend to slow down.",

But it's also generally a good idea in this industry to not move on from a problem as soon as we have some viable solution. If we have the time, refining the solution is absolutely recommended. If you can find a constant-time solution instead of using a loop, or something else that reduces the time/memory use, that's usually highly appreciated.\n\nOften also it's worth struggling and trying out various solutions. If you get a real _oh, riiiight_ reaction when you're shown the solution, then you likely learned something. :)\n\nI still get that for the math problems over at projecteuler, and sometimes when I go to the forums there I just conclude that I don't understand the best solutions. Likely I _could_ understand them if I actually applied myself to more math studies, but being able to figure out a solution even if I don't have all the background knowledge I could have had can still be fun.\n\n---\n\nI'll also note we generally use the `while` loop for when the loop is going to have some spicy development. Like in [the hailstone sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) we don't really know how many steps will be involved or how we'd express it as a for-each loop, so it's more expected to get a `while n != 1`.\n\nBut if we want to repeat a step exactly `k` times, then we generally use a for-each loop, like `for i in range(k): ‚Ä¶`\n\nI don't know how the MOOC you're taking teaches loops.",

I was able to have an interesting conversation with the HM during the final interview. \n\nAnd I have a lot of social anxiety, but had a job in the past that required I talk to people a lot on the phone. So even tho I may be awkward in social settings, my work relationships are usually much easier to maintain. \n\nThen again, I like playing politics at work, I think it's kinda fun. But here are some additional tips I'd recommend:\n\n* audibly repeat back your understanding of what someone else wants you to do to avoid confusion\n\n* Don't complain about co workers, it's fine to ask your boss for feedback on how to handle a coworker, but don't come across as attacking them. \n\n* Only bitch upwards, it's not a good look if you're complaining about bosses to people less senior than you,but when you do complain about something to your boss, offer solutions\n\n* praise often, praise early - if someone has a good idea, tell them. This avoids coming across like a contrarian and shows you're open to other people's ideas. \n\n* admit when you don't know something - no one likes a no it all especially about matters you clearly don't understand. This gives your thoughts and opinions more weight when you do express them.\n\n* Use words like \"We\", \"Us\", & \"As a team\", instead of \"you created this bug on this PR\", \"we created this bug, and we missed it during the PR\", \"what if we need to add  X functionality?\"\n\n* form relationships with users (if non public facing software) and stakeholders. If you have a bug you're investigating, just tell the user, this builds more trust and good will. \n\n* when debating about designs/patterns/architecture, just don't say \"this isn't good because X, Y, Z\", ask people questions in a way that it will lead them to the conclusion you want them to make. \"Will this work under this use case?\", \"what if the user does X?\", etc. \n* ask your manager how other folks are doing, \"how is John doing lately? He seems a bit stressed out or anxious\". Shows you're aware of people's emotions and you're concerned about others. \n\nI feel like there are more, but this is what I've found.",

The rise in AI-generated content has blurred the lines of authenticity in online discussions. Here are a few reasons why it might *feel* like that:\n\n# üß† Why Posts Might Feel AI-Generated\n\n1. **Overly Polished Language** Posts are increasingly written in this weirdly structured, ‚Äúessay-like‚Äù format. People don‚Äôt usually talk like that on Reddit ‚Äî especially in tech circles where tone tends to be blunt, sarcastic, or informal.\n2. **Generic Advice & Vague Details** A lot of posts give surface-level advice or talk about issues in super broad terms without getting into the gritty technical details ‚Äî which is common with AI output unless prompted very specifically.\n3. **Repetitive Phrasing and Templates** You‚Äôll often see similar turns of phrase or story structures across different posts ‚Äî things like ‚ÄúAfter X years in the industry, I realized Y‚Äù or ‚ÄúAm I the only one who feels Z?‚Äù It starts to feel formulaic.\n4. **Influx of Low-Effort Engagement Farming** Some users (or bots) are using AI to mass-generate posts and comments to farm karma, drive traffic, or build fake authority on niche topics.\n\n# ü§ñ Signs a Post Might Be AI-Generated\n\n* Lacks personal anecdotes or uses generic placeholders.\n* Echoes common sentiments without adding anything new.\n* Oddly balanced tone: too formal but pretending to be casual, lol.\n* Uncanny ability to sit on the fence on controversial topics.\n* Unnatural use of üí© emojis.\n* Overuse of the em dash (‚Äî).\n\n# üß© You're Not \"Schizo\" ‚Äî You're Perceptive\n\nIt‚Äôs unsettling, yeah. And it *does* erode trust ‚Äî not just in content, but in online community culture itself. Part of Reddit‚Äôs value used to be real, lived experience and human nuance. If that‚Äôs being diluted, it makes total sense to question what you're reading and who's actually behind it.\n\nIf you're feeling disoriented by all this, it‚Äôs not paranoia ‚Äî it‚Äôs pattern recognition. You‚Äôre seeing a shift, and you‚Äôre trying to make sense of it. That‚Äôs a sane reaction.\n\nWant to talk about how to filter for more authentic content or spot AI in the wild?",

Booths would get maybe half or a third of the footfall you'd see previously. Those we did speak to only wanted to speak about layoffs.\n\n* The quality of hiring across the board in all big tech companies have fallen off a cliff. It might be a reliance on GenAI, or it might be the drop I mentioned previously, but we see far more rejections than the last few years.\n\nIMO fewer people will take CS, because they've seen enough to suggest that the jobs are hard to land, there is zero employee protection, and that the big salaries are meaningless when you're going to get PIP or laid off soon anyway.",

Then some day the stories of those exact people having to leave a completely oversaturaded market and of CS being a meatgrinder fueling on broken dreams will come to the awareness of the mainstream. As a consequence some enrollments will then fall under a rate at which people will level up from Junior to regular and then and only from then on, it's just another 3 years until pressure on Juniors drop.\n\n\nLet me be clear: for graduates this current situation is not a game where you just have to wait long enough to get a seat. It's a \"musical chairs\" game, where the music stopped playing 2 years ago and you either want to work with computers at the help desk or look for jobs in other industries. Or you are absolutely borderline hacker genius since kindergarten. Then this doesn't apply to you and you get a Junior role at some place, that didn't even have an open role advertised.",

Take credit for your work\n\nYou can't rely on other people doing it for you and it's by far the biggest mistake people make early in their careers. Keep a log of every win you've had - everything you've delivered, any example of you doing more than expected, every piece of positive feedback you've gotten. You should have a \"brag\" document, and religiously populate it.\n\n2. Be aggressive about taking on work that is worth taking credit for, and avoiding (as much as possible) to do work that isn't worth taking credit for\n\nAsk for the visible project. Show you're good, and then use that to buy yourself the entry to the projects that will make you look good. If you get signed up for a project that sucks, do what you can to get moved out of that project, or to do as little for that project as possible. \n\nNow, this becomes much easier to do if you're really good at your job, but even if you're not - sometimes the squeaky wheel gets the grease.\n\n3. Prove to be more valuable than you are a hassle\n\nWhat's interesting is that this is much more important advice in general for tech people than it is for how it specifically relates to foreign labor. Real talk: a lot of tech people are fucking miserable to work with. Be pleasent to work with. Be open minded. Be available. Be polite. Be punctual. \n\nYes, if you're really good at your job you can get away with being a complete asshole. I've met like 2 such people in my career. I've met *dozens* who *thought* they were that dude, and it very much limited their careers because they did not understand that they were just not smart enough to get away with being such huge jerks.",

Furthermore the unemployment rate continued to rise for 2 years  after the recession to almost 11 percent and didn't meaningfully fall for half a decade. Just so you know the unemployment rate for young people is ALWAYS higher than the average unemployment rate, so you were in a market where almost 20 percent  (18.8%) of people under 25 could not find ANY job, including part time work, \n\n source: (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LRUN24TTUSM156S)\n\nOutside the U.S. it was worse, Spain and Greece youth unemployment rose to 50 percent and remained there through the first half of the 2010s. It wasn't until 2014 when the economy started too feel like it was going back to normal and even then the U.S. unemployment rate was still 6 percent (which is recessionary).\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/30/spain-youth-unemployment-record-high](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/30/spain-youth-unemployment-record-high)\n\nMy facebook, which back then was young cool social media,  could be divided into two types of people. People with bachelors degrees from prestigious schools and people who went to normal schools. The people at prestigious schools ended up fine, but the ones who went to your average school had their lives permanently altered. Your talking about people with business degrees go  or math degrees go work dead end service industry jobs until their mid 20s or teach english in Japan. Some of those people eventually retooled or went back to school and have careers, others are still bar tending somewhere.\n\nThis is economic research from that time period, from IZA, which is one of the top affiliation groups in labor economics [https://docs.iza.org/dp5674.pdf](https://docs.iza.org/dp5674.pdf)\n\nNow for the CS job market faired better than most other jobs. Smart phones had just been invented so the tech boom seeds had been planted, but back then people weren't throwing money at software companies like they have been the past 6 or 7 years. Like I worked a data science/risk quant job at a regional bank and all the old guys in the office were laughing at the \"ridiculously high IPO price for facebook at 35$\".  People would throw money into apple, which had great P&L financials, but the things that companies were really looking at then where oil and energy. Fracking had just taken off etc.\n\nFuthermore, the 2010 recession was a financial crisis. That means it effected the finance industry and guess what is part fo the finance industry? Venture Capital. Venture Capital is partially funded by banks. 2009 was a time when there was a lot of regulation was introduced on banks. Banks had taken or were foreced to take government loans, wells fargo and JP Morgan were asked to do acquisitions of bad banks. The crisis caused  a lot of focus on risk management practices in ganks and venture capital inherently is taking high risks. So it basically meant that startup funding was inherently lot harder to get.  Furthemore, at the time of that recession the last big recession was the previous tech bubble, so there was a lot more skepticism about the tech industry.\n\nI think one thing to realize when talking about job markets  is that most people who went through the last recession are in their mid 30s. Like people who graduated college beween 2009 and 2012    are all 33 to 40. This means you have an  entire generation of workers that are in their late 20s that have never seen a recession and don't ahve anything base it on. So they are quick to toss the word around. The other thing is that people who graduated between 2020 through 2022 basically went to the best job market in 50 years and its completely due to COVID stimulus.  That means that people who missed the boat feel that the job market is worse than it actually is, because your expectations are anchored on that boom. LIke I don't buy for a second AI is the main reason entry level hiring is down. Sure this is part of it, but the real reason that hiring is down is that interest rates are high (meaning capital is expensive and finance firms won't throw around money) and you had massive over hiring in the panemic.\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE)\n\nLike this is a time series plot of software engineering job postings on indeed from the FED. See how it goes up and down, that isn't normal behavior. If it was growing normally it would be slight increase over time. What his shows is the the number of job postings in the peak of 2021  over doubled relative to the prepandemic number of job postings. In 2025 its about 60 percent of the prepandemic level.\n\nThere is very good chacne that tech industry might have a slower recovery than every other industry after a recession. I don't think this will be CS and Data Science as a whole, its just that a lot more hiring of those jobs are going to be taking place at non-tech companies and your not going to see these salaries of people making 200k TC straight out of school at tier one companies. Its going to be a lot more I just go my first CS job making 85k at a regional bank or  home depot, and less of those fat equity grants.",

The basic stuff you'd expect for a dwindling economy.\n\nBut, the internet, and tech was more fun. Things were fresh, new; not every idea and thing created was built with a paywall behind it.\n\nThen, there was nothing even relatable to the scale of what's going on now. AI tech, social media showing what little promise, lack of privacy. A lot of it has been learning new things that re-invent the wheel over and over again.\n\nAnd discussing the current market allows for teams to discuss strategy. Being in the know of what's going on, and having experience in new and arising tech puts you ahead of others, and not only that, allows you to better seek talent that align with goals.\n\nBack then, there weren't job sites with jobs that will never be filled, there wasn't a massive amount of CS degrees and engineering was what people promoted. Software engineers weren't as prevalent.\n\nThey weren't good economic times though. Houses where I'm from sold for about the price of a VCR after being gutted.

Its basically saying \"we were very clear about what you needed to do, And you didn't do it so we're firing you\".\n\nIf they put you on a PIP and then they fire you even if you did everything they asked you to do, then they're opening themselves up to a lawsuit.\n\nSo I would maybe read up a bit on PIPs and also make sure that if things look shady (i.e., if you're actually doing good at your job but they're trying to fire you for cause when they should instead be laying you off), that you figure out what recourse you have.",

By far, the most common reason is that your manager didn't collect enough supporting data to support firing you, if you choose to sue.  For example, you should have gotten a written summary of every 1:1 with your manager since the PIP began. If not, they may want to allow for more time to get better documentation.\n\nYou don't need documentation to close the PIP without firing you.  All your manager has to say is \"u/linkthecat's performance has been acceptable and I want to close the PIP.\"  Boom, done.\n\nThe fact that it's extended most likely means that your manager still wants to get rid of you, but HR is blocking it.\n\nThere are chances that your manager said \"they seem to be improving, but I need more time\". This happens, but it's unusual, simply because PIPs are unpleasant for the manager and they're unlikely to want to extend them.  \n\nIt's also possible that they're waiting to get your replacement.  That happens, but it's less likely, simply because it's better to be a little short-handed than to keep a bad performer around.  Besides, if your performance is bad enough to warrant a PIP, you're probably not contributing much, anyway.",

As it advances, the less effective you will become as a developer.  Just like it is harming students, and it won't be Juniors replaced by AI this time - it will be you.\n\nI respect myself and my skills more than that.  I will use AI to do jobs out of scope for me; like writing dummy copy instead of lorem ipsum, but I just can't ever see myself going down the slippery slope that is letting it be a stand in for my own skills.",

I think that the companies that hyper-fixate on not hiring junior engineers and using AI as a quick fix will die. I include Amazon, Meta, maybe even Google in this list, for the sole reason that outside of AI you can probably count the new service or major product launches that any average person has heard of from any of them on one hand. It's all a crux to keep the share price high, at a time where MBA's seem to be ruling tech.\n\nWhat I can see happening is a company or two, maybe more emerging, and eating their lunch. It might be an innovation in search, a social network that dooms Facebook and Instagram, a marketplace that dominates the market, or maybe even something totally new. They'll look at how directionless big tech is, and they'll build something great from a hoard of juniors with respectful senior leadership. Those companies will be what people aspire to work for, relegating FAANG to Boomer Tech.\n\nUltimately, engineers don't *need* to be employed. They could build something, or they could make their own luck. A shift in the stock market and a downturn in tech might be enough for VC's to think that big tech has had its day, and for them to invest elsewhere - causing a shift towards new tech.",

If you run out of seniors to hire, then you need to go down the chain to juniors. If LLMs are so great, you can strap an LLM to a junior now. (I think juniors should be treated better than that, but point still stands.)\n\nIf you're out of things to do, that's different. But most companies aren't.\n\nFWIW - most places I've been at stopped hiring juniors due to belt tightening. Except the CS schools kept throwing out more graduates at a system that stopped hiring juniors, and now we're here.\n\nI think hiring of juniors will come back - but I dread the schools just churning out endless waves of CS grads again.",

You cannot leave opportunities on the ground especially when they throw themselves at you. You can always outlast a bad manager or coworkers‚Äîone of the most important things when determining work satisfaction. You can‚Äôt always find a good opportunity to advance yourself. \n\nDevOps is close enough to what you‚Äôre already doing that you could transition back if you wanted to and it‚Äôs a step in the right direction if you decide you want to do more dev stuff. \n\nA potential issue is the lack of dedicated support structure or guidance regarding best practices, the future of your company ops, and career development. Certainly in your team, if not the org at large. Been there, done that. \n\nThat means your trajectory will be up to you to make or break. It‚Äôs hard to be a trailblazer, but the benefits can be huge. If you decide you need to go somewhere to do some learning in a year or two, it will be that much easier with the title under your belt. \n\nAs for being rusty with programming, I wouldn‚Äôt stress it too much. I‚Äôve never held the title explicitly, but as a data engineer who has only worked at small companies, I‚Äôve done a lot of ops stuff. Coding is an important tool but it‚Äôs not going to be the make or break issue. You‚Äôre managing other people‚Äôs software and writing simple middleware not building an in-house operations management tool (yet).",

        "body": "> So is ‚Äúcold applying‚Äù for a job in 2025 essentially dead?\n\nNo.\n\n>  Is it just like buying a lottery ticket\n\n\"Buying\" is the wrong way to look at it. Lottery tickets are discretionary spending despite what gambling addicts believe. When you apply for a job, you're actively seeking a new income source. Apples and oranges.\n\n> After over 200 applications to MLE and data scientist positions (even data analyst roles that I‚Äôm clearly overqualified for), I‚Äôve only been met with rejection or ghosting.\n\nEven before universities had specific graduate programs targeting Data Science / Machine Learning (so before 2019 lets say), it was very challenging to find a position where you fucked with models/charts, tweaked parameters, and performed EDA all day. And this was peak Data Science mania hiring among corporate leadership -- Data Science was the GenAI before GenAI existed from ~2016 through 2019. Sounds great right? Except boy do I know a ***ton*** of people in that space who got laid off between 2020 and 2022 so lets set the nostalgic rose-colored glasses down.\n\n> Both of these times, the recruiters have been enthusiastic to hear about my experience, and often praise my resume and my accomplishments.\n\nThe fundamental challenge for Data Science / Machine Learning roles is an organization will need 1, maybe 2, of that type of skillset for every ~500 run-of-the-mill software engineers that they need to build software products. Maybe closer to 1 every 30 if you're a highly specialized quant firm or something. This is very specialized labor, for a very specialized purpose, and orgs just don't need that many of them relative to other roles.\n\nIf you're looking exclusively in NYC, or for fully remote positions, you may very well be competing with the absolute cream of the crop top-tier candidates. NYC is an extremely competitive market -- lots of people. You could even be one of those top-tier candidates, but when there's 20 other candidates who are lets say within ~10% of each other in terms of performance and team fit coming out of an interview, what the manager had for breakfast the day of the interview could be a significant contributing factor to which candidate gets hired. The candidate that got hired instead of you doesn't necessarily need to be \"god tier\".\n\nSo, some practical advice:\n\n1. Increase your volume of applications\n2. Target different markets/sectors. ~80% of your applications in finance, but no bites? Try energy, medical devices / medicine, ad tech -- you get the idea.",

Orosz is the author of the fantastic newsletter Pragmatic Engineer and he's assembled a lot of his wisdom into this fantastic book. It's broken out into sections for each level of engineering, so you'd definitely get a lot of mileage out of it.\n\n\\- Fundamentals of Software Architecture by Mark Richards and Neal Ford. This is a little more advanced, and you probably wouldn't need the last third that talks more about selling your architectural vision, but it's a great overview of the different kinds of distributed architectures you'll encounter in the wild.\n\n\\- A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout. Really quick read and an implied rebuttal to Clean Code by Bob Martin. I really enjoyed this one and it provides a good framework for how to think when writing code.\n\nThe reason I've read way too many software books is because I host a podcast called Book Overflow ([YouTube link here](https://www.youtube.com/@BookOverflowPod), but we're on every major platform) where each week my co-host and I read and discuss a new tech book. We've done episodes on all the books I've listed, and have even interviewed every one of their authors! If you don't have time to read the whole books, you might get a lot of insight from just listening to the episodes!",

No other part is more critical to the success of the project.‚Äù*\n\n*‚Äî Fred Brooks, \"No Silver Bullet: Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering\" (1986)*\n\nSoftware is created to fulfill stakeholders‚Äô objectives. To achieve that, you need to understand and document three key aspects: WHO your stakeholders are, WHAT their objectives are, and WHY those objectives matter. Most failed projects don‚Äôt fail in code; they fail in understanding what the stakeholders actually need.\n\n\"Software Requirements Essentials\" by Karl Wiegers and Candase Hokanson is short, accessible, and a great introduction.\n\nThe \"bible\" of the field is Karl Wiegers‚Äô classic \"Software Requirements\" (now in its 3rd edition, co-authored with Joy Beatty). It covers everything from stakeholder analysis to requirements elicitation techniques to use cases and beyond. It‚Äôs comprehensive, methodical, and full of real-world examples.\n\nFocusing on stakeholders and requirements makes you a better software engineer regardless of your tech stack or methodology.",

If you weren't \"getting it\" odds are there are some structural problems in your QA department that have nothing to do with you.

Things are fine for 6 months, then people learn the job and suddenly we're meant to be senior level. Managment complains because they let go or had the previous high experience staff leave. Everything is monitored and micromanaged. People leave. Repeat. \n\nAlso upper managers ime tend to neg their employees, they'll feed you praise first then neg you into thinking you can do more and more until you burn out then hire someone new thinking \"oh this new engineer will be just as good\" not realising it takes like 6-12 months to fully settle into a senior role even if you are a senior from a different company. \n\nEither way, in most cases it's time to run because they're looking to lay people off.",

Always got fantastic reviews, sales soared, everything golden. \n\nThen after COVID and work from home, my manager started riding me over every little thing. I had been given tons of independence up to that point because our sales were so great and because my manager honestly didn‚Äôt know exactly what it was I did. I built the entire position from scratch and my manager had no computer skills so digital marketing and data analytics were not something he could really check my work on. So as long as number went up, he let me be. \n\nI had 5 years of smooth sailing, loved the work, did a good job, etc. So it felt super out of left field when I started getting grief daily. Note that our online sales were better than ever and growing faster than ever too. The hassling got worse and worse until finally I was given an official disciplinary review for my poor performance. \n\nWanna know the craziest part? Remember how I was the ONLY employee under my manager, the one who built the entire department from scratch? Well, a week after I got that disciplinary review for poor performance, my manager won employee of the year because of his department‚Äôs outstanding performance. He got a big bonus lol. \n\nGot called in the next week for another disciplinary review where they tried to push me into a lower pay position (I already got paid well below market standard, like half) and I quit on the spot lol. Sent him all the data I had, updated all my contacts and consultants to email him going forward, sent him a text file with something like 80 or 90 usernames/passwords for the various tools, apps, etc I was handling, and just walked out. \n\nBut it‚Äôs not all bad. I got a call a year later and they were still trying to fill the position and wanted me to come back. Apparently they couldn‚Äôt find anyone who would do 3 jobs for shit pay. That was the perkiest ‚Äúno‚Äù I‚Äôve ever delivered.\n\nI don‚Äôt know the best solution in your case, but if possible you should try to get them to fire you. I was too disgusted to stay so I missed out on a lot of benefits. But that was the best decision for me. You gotta find the best solution for you. Best of luck!",

You're establishing professional boundaries and making it clear that your working hours are 9-5, M-F. You'll be working 100% of your working hours.\n\nI don't know how cutthrough the consulting scene is, so take my advice with a grain of salt, but that's the advice I normally give to people suffering burnout. People always think in extremes. \"Put up with being miserable working 12 hour days\" vs \"Quit without anything lined up\".\n\nIn reality there's usually a less extreme option: \"Enforce your professional boundaries, and work 8 hour days, regardless of what's going on around you with the project and management\". And immediately start job searching with all that extra time.\n\nThe thing about that approach is even if that ruffles feathers, they usually don't fire you right away. They'll heckle you about your performance, they might PIP you, they'll desperately start looking for your replacement, maybe the client will drop you... but all that often takes months. Firing you outright is a much larger impact to the project than letting you work \"normal\" 8 hour days until they hire and train your replacement. It'd be a stupid management decision to react prematurely.\n\nSo in that time before they fire you... you're job searching *and* collecting a paycheck instead of draining your savings. And the best part of that approach is if they do end up firing you before you line something else up, you're *exactly* where you were about to put yourself voluntarily: Unemployed.\n\nThat said, at the end of the day quitting without something lined up isn't the end of the world. It's a calculated risk and an expense. If you decide that's worth it, go for it. If even after reducing your workday to 8 hours you're still feeling miserable, then that's likely not going to help, so quitting ASAP may be the best option for you.\n\nI'm surprised you lasted 3+ years of 12+ hour days... I would've be gone in month 1. WLB is my #1 priority. I'm a 9-5 employee. If I'm ever at a company where that's not sufficient, I take the above advice.",

Be professional, be cordial, but more than anything cover your ass, document everything, and prepare yourself to play counteroffense so that you can at least make their life difficult.\n\nPS: using the specific term \"hostile work environment\" is key because that is HR code for \"I can sue you\". Calling her a bad boss, saying she's mean, toxic, bad at her job, unfair - all of that doesn't matter if HR doesn't think you can get them in trouble. But if they think that - were they to fire you - you might hit them with a lawsuit for wrongful termination and hostile work environment stuff? At the very least HR is going to have to spend some time making sure this boss isn't the problem and that they have everything they need in place to make sure you don't have a valid lawsuit.

It's a fact that almost every tech company is hiring only mid level to senior developers at the moment, and that there are thousands of new grads looking for positions. For a data point, when the startup I work for opened a job position on linked in, 99%+ of the people applying were new grads who didn't have the experience we needed.\n\nThe best way your partner is going to find a position is:\n\n1. Knowing someone who can refer him to a company  \n2. Him reaching out to people on LinkedIn personally, asking them to refer him (usually after a coffee chat or a Google Meet call)  \n3. Really having his interview skills down. Get off Cursor and any auto completions. If he cannot do the Blind75 questions, or Neetcode150, that is also a reason why he isn't landing an offer.  \n4. Yet again, get a referral.\n\nThe first job (even so now) is the hardest to get. I remember when I first started my career almost 10 years ago, no one wanted to talk to me. Recruiters ghosted me after smiling at me in video calls, and just causing me to get no where. After I got my first job, exactly at the one year mark after starting, I had recruiters in my mailbox daily.\n\nPersevere. He will make it.",

Find non-profits, send out emails, see if he has any luck. By doing that, when the market gets better, he'll have a strong enough resume to apply. It'll also give him a sense of purpose for now.\n\nIf possible, he can also go to a college for 2 years, get a diploma in healthcare-related profession. Or join the military/police.

There's no one specific thing I can really point to because all of my experiences have been so different. I'll just that that I enjoyed working the private sector and even state government's more.\n\nOne benefit of working for government contractors though is job is kind of expected, so after you get a few years of experience under your belt, you have lots of opportunities to get a new job with a big pay bump. And if you land in a shithole, you can usually find an exit by just being open to new opportunities on linkedIn.\n\nAs for the weather, yeah summers can be swampy. DC was literally built on a swamp. It's not the most humid place I've been, but it's close. The other thing is if you are from a place that gets real winter, we have no idea what to do in snow. We talk about snow storms that the midwest would barely register as storms, like hurricanes. A couple of inches of snow at rush hour can cripple our roadways. To be fair, so can rain, and clear skies...basically, whatever the weather, someone infront of you has never seen it before and is freaking out.\n\nDriving here is also pretty terrible in general. We collect the world's worst drivers and put them on overcrowded roads. The metro is fine. I used it when I worked in DC. I didn't love it when I had to drive to the Vienna station, pay for parking and then ride into the city. I've never did that math, but I do wonder is I should have just paid for parking downtown. \n\nThe cost of living is also quite high. Rent and house prices have been obscene since the 90s. Laidoff federal workers choosing to leave might make a difference, but it will be relatively small.\n\nOn the other hand, the public schools tend to be good, and because we have so many bored government workers around, there are more types of recreation than you would think. The choice of activities I have within an hour of my house is insane. They're all crowded, and none of them are world class, but still, if I want to take up a hobby outside my house, there's some place relatively close where I can go. \n\nTL;DR; NoVa is fine. I can't argue for it over any of the other locations you mentioned. Truth be told, if my wife had an opportunity in Chicago and wanted to move closer to here family, I'd probably be excited about the move.",

It‚Äôs not like anyone makes you sit in the office from 9-5, if I have a doctors appointment or just want to work from home in the morning and go in for my meetings in the afternoon or whatever, nobody really cares.

Else go for free while working when your employer pays for it. Though the only employer I know that pays is the US government.\n\n>I make only $40k/year.\n\nWell that is shit pay. MS program looking better now all of a sudden. MS \"resets\" to look again for internships and move up. UMD isn't elite tier but it's decent like you're saying.\n\nI guess you can argue this either way. You could very well have no job at graduation and be in serious debt, or you could jump up to fair pay.\n\nI don't know why you would go through applying for an MS application without applying to new CS jobs. In normal cost of living, $60k base salary for entry level is low but not terrible. At 3 YoE, you're above entry level and therefore have less competition but can still apply for it. Then OMSCS at Georgia Tech is online and legit and very cheap. No funding other than beer money by being a TA after your first year.",

There‚Äôs an implicit learning that occurs with any skill (trading, coding, speaking, writing, sports, etc etc) so probably talking to more people (normal convos, business ones, casual ones, etc), then reflecting afterward probably helps a ton. \n\nLike you can research everything about riding a bike, but once you just try hopping on one and practicing, you instinctively start learning the patterns that help you get better at that skill.",

I felt like I could give him a task and with only a little guidance, he would figure it out on his own get it done and was really quick to pick up on things. I also didn't have to explain things to him multiple times. He would complete things quickly and with the enthusiasm of someone still fresh in the field.\n\nDespite me never wanting an intern in the first place I ended up pushing to hire him after the internship ended and after he finished out his last semester in school. He is now with us full time and whenever raise time comes around, I'm asking my boss what if anything I can do to help him get a promotion/raise- the answer is usually nothing, but I want to keep him because he has proven himself to be super valuable to the team and I know that earlier on in your career is when you can make moves to other companies for the biggest jumps in your career.\n\n  \nI guess to me what made the difference was that, he learned/improved quickly and was fairly independent. I didn't have to spell out each and every little step like I would to a chatgpt prompt. He had his own mind and could think through things instead of just follow my step by step instructions.",

No idea how, but he's managed to stay there for almost a decade. I don't even know what \"solutions engineer\" at google means, like there's people specifically trying to be good at that?  A good out for start up CTO is leading teams of people building new software, but that guy just turned left.\n\nSo something like that: get lucky early with a position you in no way earned, then flop into a corporate role where what you do is largely non-technical.",

You‚Äôre drowning and the first thing to do is to give yourself some air. My suggestion would be to start by carving out some time for mental decompression every day - it can be something as simple as taking 15-20 mins everyday for a walk or workout or just sitting and staring out the window. But no phones, no emails, no bringing a family member along to make this time about them- this is your time to spend some time with yourself so that you can process your own emotions.\n\nNext, I‚Äôd focus on the positives of the situation. To me, it looks like things may not be as bad as they seem - to you it feels like everyone is weighing down on you, but in reality everyone is probably as stressed as you are and they are just passing that along to you, as they are to everyone. Second, no matter how bad it seems, it‚Äôs a temporary situation and it will change. It feels like the end of the world right now because you are in the eye of the storm, but it will pass. Have faith in that if it feels like everything else is failing.\n\nYour employability may also be better than you feel. Even if it‚Äôs a niche industry, I‚Äôm sure there are skills you have that are transferable, and there may be opportunities in places you haven‚Äôt looked, like sister industries and customers where they may not be doing exactly what you are doing but your expertise could be valuable. It might be worth reaching out to mentors in the industry to figure out your blind spots in terms of employability.\n\nHope it works out, and remember, this too shall pass",

There is really no movement right now due to some policy things Cheeto Caligula is doing.  \n\nDo be fair, I'm not at my best right now due to stress, and my coping mechanisms aren't working for once. I think the big thing I struggle with is that when they switched to doing daily huddles rather than bi-weekly project updates, it felt like every employee was getting grilled in their work and I've had to push stats to appease them that weren't true to keep the peace and then work weekends to make it up.

Dont do it if you need to get crazy loans for it. \n\nIt might help early in your career to get that extra 5k a year or some companies might immediately make you a mid-level engineer instead of a jr. But in this career, experience trumps a master's degree. I got mine in 2021 but I had my company pay for like 85% of it. I only paid 5k out of pocket. I felt like it made my resume look nicer and i got in the door to more places. A master's might get you in the door but it wont get you the job and the slight upside isnt that different.",

It‚Äôs not a requirement at all to find a job, but it makes the search a little easier due to networking and possibility for return offers etc. \n\nSTEM in general, and especially CS, job hunts take longer than normal but it‚Äôs not a death sentence to have a few months gap between graduation and now. \n\nThere‚Äôs no data from 24 and beyond but 23 and before shows that our unemployment is high, because our industry is cyclical, but under employment is super low so job hunts turn out good.",

I finished my stories early last sprint and asked my lead if I could pickup a backend story, and he was like sorry we have higher priority frontend work to pick up.\n\n2. You're right, it's a good idea to review backend PRs. That way I get visibility into what they're doing, can ask questions why they're doing something (just for my knowledge instead of being a stickler), and I can grow that way.\n\n3. I really like my team but at this point would like to switch companies (because I've only worked at one company and I'm not being paid competitively like big tech).\n\n4. I am interested in exploring your last point. I think it makes sense to go that route especially when we have a ton of work in our backlog. But when our backlog is pretty thin, then it might be harder. But good point",

So most of these employment contracts include language that prohibits or at least restricts in some way the clients' ability to hire employees of the provider company.",

It's mostly a lose-lose proposition for them at the point where you've already left and began work for their client. If the company also had some kind of non-solicitation agreement with your agency, that's not really _your_ problem.\n\nI was in a similar position to you and the non-solicitation clause did not prevent me from joining the client company (a global 500).

If you‚Äôre not getting job experience (which feels like one of the only things on your resume that actually matters), I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad idea at all to start training for a potentially different field.\n\nUnfortunately though I‚Äôm not sure how much safer EE really is. EE has been plagued by excessive outsourcing the same as CS has for years. The nature of the work makes it easy to just outsource a specific project, get a working design and never talk to the designer again. Additionally I‚Äôm not convinced it‚Äôs immune to LLMs taking over, although it won‚Äôt happen as quickly as CS since it‚Äôs not just pure text that needs to be spit out. \n\nThat said if you‚Äôre financially able to potentially work contract jobs or spend some time developing skills, it‚Äôs not that bad of an idea. I don‚Äôt want to discourage you cause I understand how you feel exactly, but there‚Äôs something to be said about working in a field you‚Äôre passionate about.

If your soon to be wife loves her job, you love your city, you're planning on having kids soon, etc... then that will need to take precedence. That might mean that you let Jan come and try to find a job in the meantime and tighten your belt a bit. Once kids come into the mix, you need to think long and hard about where you want to park for a second. \n\nDo you have any networks from college days? Is your manager understanding of the situation? If so, I would have a blunt conversation with them and ask them if you can use them as a reference or if they know anyone around the area that's hiring. Anyone you know that might be at a company, possibly hiring? The market is not great right now, and companies know this, so they're pulling whatever bullshit they can for attrition (my company is doing the same thing although maybe a softer version of yours). \n\nTo answer your question about your current knowledge, you might want to give yourself more credit. I doubt someone goes into a role for 4 years and \"everyone else is doing the work\". Have you received any promotions since starting? If that's the case, then you probably did something to get there. But the fact that you know Kotlin and Java is good, the industry is full of Java roles. So you could shift to Java (or C#... they're similar enough) and see what's out there. \n\nAt the end of the day, it's business to companies, but personal to you. This stuff can be really hard mentally and emotionally. I can't tell you which path to take, but if it were me, I would first ask yourself if you want to stay in mobile. If so, then focus on learning the rest of the process. Read up your code base, pick up more Kotlin, learn JetPack Composer, etc. If not, then consider a shift into learning more about Java and/or C# then try your luck there.\n\nMost importantly, talk to your partner about the move. If they will be happier where you are, then just explain that you'll be tightening belts until you can find something else. And if you need to, get a temporary job somewhere not related to CS until you can gnab that interview. \n\nAlso, look for any resources in the area for interview prep, resume editing, etc. \n\nBest of luck to you.",

The vibe I'm getting here is that you don't really like the job and really are only considering it because of the pay and you feel trapped into it because you don't feel like you could find another option that would keep you where you are which would allow your wife you keep her job as well.\n\nIf this were me, I guess the way I'd weigh it out would be to walk through what the option would look like that would end with me getting a job that I'd like long term, and to me a job that I like and care about is important, which I realize isn't true for everyone. To me, moving would be like putting a bandaid on the solution that doesn't really fix the long term problem, while also making someone I care about suffer in the mean time. So I don't think I'd move unless moving would up your chances of finding work that would actually be meaningful to you.\n\nMy personal experience with this, without the whole moving dilemma - right now I feel like I've backed myself into a somewhat niche part of the SWE industry and I'm attempting to either get myself out of this niche, or continue in the niche at a different company that would allow me to skill up in things that would allow me more options to either expand or get out in the future. What I've realized while searching is that with the job market the way it is right now, and how I'm lacking some of the more common skills that people are looking for, is that I'm going to have to compromise somewhere in my job search - either I'm going to have to continue in somewhat of the same niche for more money, or I'm going to have to accept a little less to get out now.  You've only vaguely mentioned your job search and how it hasn't been going well. I don't think Udemy courses are going to help you much now that you've had multiple years of professional experience. I think you probably need to figure out how to convey your skills in a way that sounds transferable to the jobs you want to take and probably lower your salary requirements given that your goal here is to set yourself up long term rather than make $$$ now. Wish I could be more helpful here, but I'm not really familiar with the Android developer market, the market right now is more difficult to find jobs in now than it has been in the past, and tbh I'm working on figuring it out myself too.\n\nedited to add - if you don't move, I would make them let you go over it rather than quitting voluntarily",

In-person career fairs are how I got all my opportunity.\n\nHalf the CS advice is wrong because it's by students and cosplayers who never got hired in CS.\n\nOn your own time, you can learn tech stacks. Is a reasonable idea. Recruiters don't care about and won't look at your GitHub. I have never listed mine. If you can hold a conversation and talk through the programming language and common software it uses, you're in good shape. You still have to get to the interview stage and the #1 way to help that is land an internship. At this point, your grades matter. Competition is fierce. Be willing to relocate and sublease.\n\nMost jobs are in 1 of C# or Java or TypeScript/JavaScript, with Python for support. Learn a database such as Postgres and writing CRUD to it. I'd hope your classes cover this. Don't try to learn everything. Look at job descriptions and see what they ask for. You don't need 30/30 requirements but a few are mandatory. The joke is you need 5 YoE in everything and it's not completely a joke.",

The summer is almost over and bigger companies will begin opening their 2026 summer internship roles. Start applying. Go to career fairs, school events, and as much as I hate it, cold network with the occasional LinkedIn recruiter. It works sometimes. Your opportunity to find an internship only expires when May 2026 hits, so literally just start right now. Internships are the best thing you can do as an undergrad.\n\n2. Projects. Yes, I always hated when people said that. 'Just learn'. Not that easy, especially when you get trapped in tutorial hell. Follow a couple of tutorials and then try to make something on your own. Go find a 'To-Do' list tutorial if you want to do web development, go find a course if there's something specific you want to learn.\n\nI didn't do anything...I mean ANYTHING until I was already a junior and I think I'm fine. Go network, apply for internships (or apprenticeships or fellowships or whatever) and follow some tutorials.",

I probably get them all done in the 2 weeks I have to work with. If I over/under commit, or we learn something that changes priorities, I reflect on that with the rest of the team. Then I plan the next 2 weeks. That's basically how an agile/scrum team works.\n\nIf you're feeling overwhelmed, or underutilized, talk with your manager/lead about it. Back when I managed people, if you literally just copy+pasted this post into a Slack message, that'd be enough for me to work with.\n\nIf you don't feel safe talking to your manager/lead about being over/under utilized, that's a red flag. You should have a modicum of psychological safety when interacting with the person who signs your paychecks and appraises your performance. Could be you're just not the trusting type, could be your manager sucks. But it's a problem.",

Now your ability to social with the team, appearance, hygiene (for some people), just showing up to business events is called into question. \n\nThat‚Äôs before we get to the studies that show commuting even 40 minutes reduces job satisfaction significantly enough that you‚Äôd have to earn nearly double to be just as happy. With other studies from Sean Achors research on happiness that show the happier the staff, the more productive. So, what immediately happens is you‚Äôre more likely to fail onsite. Because you have to maintain a lot for your mood.\n\nIf those things are ok, then you have to deal with those who struggle to socialise outside of work and tend to like the office from the social aspect. By that I mean, they think this is the place to get all their social fill and interrupt, talk about shit I don‚Äôt care about, gossip, and generally make the day worse purely for their own benefit. \n\nThat‚Äôs if they‚Äôre not disrupting you, there‚Äôs equal studies from the nords on the open office plan being cancer for focus. \n\nAnyways, that‚Äôs how I feel about it. When you‚Äôre onsite, suddenly your requirements expand 10 fold. \n\n‚Äî worked remote for 8 years, also been on site for 8 years prior. \n\nThat‚Äôs just my opinion though. Hope it goes well either way.\n\nEdit: format, and appending, then telling you they‚Äôll make you manager doesn‚Äôt mean much. And for only 10k more? I dunno. Work life balance will give you the progression as you‚Äôll have the energy to keep going.",

And while salaries have dropped (anyone in a senior position try to lateral lately? Good luck), you‚Äôre still finding remote roles paying way more than on site roles for people in LCOL, even MCOL areas. \n\nThe only reasonable thing that I can conclude is that these on site companies are looking for desperate people, or warm bodies. Because they know they‚Äôd never get a talented senior who can get $160k in a remote role, offering $100k and mandating a daily commute. \n\nYou seem to really want to be in management, so I‚Äôm not going to bash you for your decision.
