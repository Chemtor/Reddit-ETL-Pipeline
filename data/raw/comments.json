The main analyst freaked out, suddenly quit, formed his own company, and poached the entire staff of his original team leaving only the ‚Äúmanager‚Äù for that team. The guy pretended everything was fine for 2 weeks and told nobody that he was soloing all this work. During that two weeks, he fucked up some report for management that made the corporate metrics look absolutely dogshit which triggered an analytics all hands meeting to figure out what was happening. Offshore ‚Äúmanager‚Äù joined remotely and when leadership asked to see the rest of the team, he just said,‚Äù what team? They all quit.

        "body": "Let me take a crack at it with a handful of examples:\n\n**First Normal Form (1NF): No Crowded Rows**\n\nEvery row should be unique, and you can't stuff multiple rows into one cell.\n\n*   **Rule:** Each cell in a table should have only one value.\n*   **Example:** Let's say you have a table of your friends and their favorite colors.\n\n**Messy (Not 1NF):**\n\n    | Name  | Favorite Colors      |\n    | :---- | :------------------- |\n    | Alex  | Blue, Green          |\n    | Bella | Pink                 |\n\nTo make this 1NF, you give each favorite color its own row:\n\n**Organized (1NF):**\n\n    | Name  | Favorite Color |\n    | :---- | :------------- |\n    | Alex  | Blue           |\n    | Alex  | Green          |\n    | Bella | Pink           |\n\nNow, every field in your table has just one piece of information.\n\n**Second Normal Form (2NF): Everything in its Right Place**\n\nThis rule is for tables that have a composite key, i.e. made of more than one part. It says that everything in the table should be about the *whole* key, not just a piece of it.\n\n*   **Rule:** Be in 1NF and have no partial dependencies. This means that all the information in a row must depend on the entire primary key.\n*   **Example:** Imagine a table for pizza orders. The key is the `Customer` and the `Pizza Type`.\n\n**Messy (Not 2NF):**\n\n    | Customer | Pizza Type | Customer's Favorite Topping |\n    | :------- | :--------- | :-------------------------- |\n    | Sam      | Pepperoni  | Olives                      |\n    | Mia      | Cheese     | Pineapple                   |\n    | Sam      | Veggie     | Olives                      |\n\nThe problem here is that the \"Favorite Topping\" is only about the `Customer`, not what kind of pizza they ordered that day. To fix this, we can split the table into two:\n\n**Organized (2NF):**\n\n**Orders Table:**\n\n    | Customer | Pizza Type |\n    | :------- | :--------- |\n    | Sam      | Pepperoni  |\n    | Mia      | Cheese     |\n    | Sam      | Veggie     |\n\n**Customers Table:**\n\n    | Customer | Favorite Topping |\n    | :------- | :--------------- |\n    | Sam      | Olives           |\n    | Mia      | Pineapple        |\n\nNow, the \"Favorite Topping\" is in a table all about the customers.\n\n### **Third Normal Form (3NF): No Secret Information Hiding**\n\nThis is about making sure that the information in your table is only about the main topic (the key) and not about other things in the same table.\n\n*   **Rule:** Be in 2NF and have no transitive dependencies (in other words, each cell on the row should *only* depend on the key, not on other cells)\n*   **Example:** Let's look at a table about your favorite Disney characters. We'll throw in their first movie appearance for good measure.\n\n**Messy (Not 3NF):**\n\n    | Character         | Movie               | Movie's Director |\n    | :---------------- | :------------------ | :--------------- |\n    | Buzz Lightyear    | Toy Story           | John Lasseter    |\n    | Woody             | Toy Story           | John Lasseter    |\n    | Elsa              | Frozen              | Chris Buck       |\n\nHere, the \"Movie's Director\" is really about the `Movie`, not the `Character`. If the director changes, you'd have to update it for every character in that movie. So, we split it up:\n\n**Organized (3NF):**\n\n**Characters Table:**\n\n    | Character         | Movie       |\n    | :---------------- | :---------- |\n    | Buzz Lightyear    | Toy Story   |\n    | Woody             | Toy Story   |\n    | Elsa              | Frozen      |\n\n**Movies Table:**\n\n    | Movie     | Director      |\n    | :-------- | :------------ |\n    | Toy Story | John Lasseter |\n    | Frozen    | Chris Buck    |\n\nNow, the director is in the \"Movies\" table, which makes more sense.",

Same with the doctor. Every time the doctor sees a patient, if you store all the data about the doctor, you're storing their name every time. In addition to being very inefficient from a space perspective, it's harder to modify data later. Let's assume the doctor changes their name. Now you have to go back and update the doctor's name at every instance it was recorded in the database. \n\nInstead if you normalize the data, you have one record in a patient table to represent a patient, and one record in a doctor table to represent the doctor. Then you just give each record an ID and \"point\" to those records when you want to reference them from somewhere else in the database. It also has the benefit of conceptually distinguishing the different entities in the universe of data.",

No PRs should be accepted unless the owner of the data (preferably a senior/experienced dev) approves it.\n* Idempotency, idempotency, idempotency. Probably the most crucial part of any data warehouse pipeline. It is really not that hard to implement these days (most modern pipelines and warehouses have multiple ways to enforce it). Prevents 95%+ of data inconsistency issues in production.\n* Backwards/forwards compatible transfer protocol. My current favorite is Protobuf (or proto-adjacent forks) for its 'data-contract'-iness behavior, but Avro + schema registry works too (though I personally hate having to manage yet one more cog in the flow)\n* Monorepo your schemas. Slightly controversial take, but this helps definitions/migrations fail at *compilation time*, which in my experience reduces runtime problems by orders of magnitude.\n* Pick a database that can be locally initialized via a container, and keep an append-only log of all migrations in git. This makes testing so much more reproducible, and makes it quite rare to have unexpected issues in production you didn't find at the test phase.\n\nIn my experience following most/all of these makes everything else follow naturally in place.",

If you have to manually massage some process all the time, they don't care unless it's blocking you from releasing new stuff.  They also wonder why you didn't \"do it right the first time\".  They also don't want to invest more money to rebuild a platform that they already paid for, so you often get stuck with the crap they paid some consulting firm to build and have to slowly fix it over time.\n\nTBH this isn't a data warehouse thing, this is a general IT thing where you sort of wait around for some lull in requests to do that kind of stuff.  My company has a billing platform that they implemented 15 years ago and over time implemented every new significant product line differently, such that the processes were all unique.

While I do agree that personal projects do help, it is tough to find the energy and motivation outside of a few hours over the weekends.\n\nI do want to change this mindset, but doing extra data engineering work after already doing DE for work 8 hours/day, just isn't good for my mental health right now. I just get burnt out and depressed being in front of a screen for so long. I envy some of the people on this subreddit that seem to be indefatigable when it comes to learning new tools and skills.\n\nI prefer to do more career growth through books currently  (non-digital) as it just feels healthier for me.",

They can continue to work as normal if you don't \"drop in\".\n\n4) We've also had similar success with \"co-working\" hours a couple times a week which is just a zoom that anyone can drop into and chat or just sit and work but be available for others to ping.  If the manager is smart they will ask their Seniors/Tech leaders/wannabe Seniors to make themselves available during this time as part of their demonstration of leadership.\n\nBoth 3 and 4 are intended to help with avoiding constant interruptions for go-to folks so they can get into their flow state, while still helping those who need it by setting aside time to make themselves available for technical help / mentoring / problem solving / etc",

Palantir is just one of several, though. But one of the best-backed (wealthiest/with strongest ties to Governments abroad which make a compelling case in a sales pitch to the NHS).\n\nThere is similar money coming to the UK and pressurising various senior folks in the UK to use Palantir, lobbying Government to continue the use of private companies etc. It's like a stealth privatisation except it is in plain sight for all to see. The amount of money the NHS spends on private consultancies is massive, and Palantir has been sniffing around that buffet for a long time (and has landed a number of contracts over the last 10 years). This isn't really news, but it's worth stating/sharing.\n\nThe fact that the UK Government seems desperate to use AI to cut ~~corners~~ sorry, \"costs\", plays into the Palantir sales pitch in a timely way (which makes you wonder who is persuading Government that AI is fit for purpose - because currently the hype massively outweighs the actual, tangible, net \"win\" evidence that exists. It's largely a solution desperate to find a matching problem at the moment). Someone, somewhere (or groups, somewhere) are pushing AI usage within UK Government schemes and Palantir is also being pushed into the same rooms where that stuff is being discussed.\n\nThere was public outcry in the last few years when Palantir might be getting its grubby mits on patient data on a trust-by-trust basis, when I think it was an \"opt-in\" system (or opt-out, I can't remember what the outcry was centred-on), but they are going to be relentless because there's millions of pounds available and all you need is a good sales pitch and most NHS \"leaders\" will lap it up. All you need to do is lie about how much money you'll save a trust, and they'll bite your hand off. There's no way to prove or disprove an AI sales pitch that alleges millions saved for US health companies \"simply from using FoundryTM\", you have to get in bed with Palantir to even understand whether any savings can be made - so it's easy for Palantir to lie/guess and land the gig (versus other companies who may be more honest, more realistic). Same situation as seen with software consultancies for decades: often the biggest lies win the most work.\n\nAnyways - yes we should be worried - yes Palantir is dodgy af - and no they can't be trusted.

You get to see a successful production implementation and understand what it takes to maintain one\n* On-prem isn't sexy, but the tooling otherwise seems pretty modern\n* WLB matters a lot to most people's long-term careers. You have to be disciplined about \"coasting,\" but most of us need to spend time operating well below capacity to avoid burnout\n* Data teams functioning as support can struggle for visibility, which means career opportunities can be limited\n\nStartup thoughts:\n\n* Product data roles are relatively rare. I've turned down a few product-based roles and work with product engineers. My impression is that your incentives are very different from internal-facing work\n* It's probably going to be sink-or-swim. They wouldn't have extended an offer if they didn't think you could hack it, but if you like more support, it's probably not a good fit\n* There's likely very little structure around teams, advancement, and growth. It's very common for everyone to believe in \"the mission,\" and your major target is less about titles and salary and more about driving the company to IPO / acquisition, so your equity is worth something\n* If you actually get to work on streaming / near-realtime, that experience is very valuable to a smaller number of employers. Data warehousing / batch processing is much more widely applicable\n\nHow I'd think about the decision:\n\n* Are you OK with being tossed in the deep end and figuring things out? That's likely the expectation at the startup\n* Are you comfortable with more than just doing heads-down work? Startups generally require you to be more cross-functional / collaborative since you may not have mature processes (product management, team leads, etc.)\n* Are you capable of managing burnout? This can be a problem at both places, but your manager at the corpo probably has more experience identifying and heading it off (lowering workload, encouraging vacation / holiday, etc.)\n* Is working on the latest tech really important to you? If it is, the startup is a no brainer. If you're OK with learning more enduring patterns on an older stack, this is less of a differentiating factor",

Hadoop/Spark/Hive experience is still okay, but it‚Äôs much more ‚Äúlegacy enterprise‚Äù skillset. If you want options in NA or EU in a few years, cloud-native experience will open way more doors.\n2. **Customer-facing product experience:** Working on something that thousands of companies actually use is huge. It shows you can handle scale, real-time systems, and impact‚Äîstuff recruiters notice. Internal ETL for business ops at a big company looks nice on a resume but doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúcan build product-grade systems.‚Äù\n3. **Fast-paced, growth environment:** Yes, it‚Äôs stressful and work-life balance might suck a bit, but that‚Äôs exactly where you learn the most. You‚Äôll get exposure to data validation, lineage tracking, fraud detection pipelines‚Äîthese are highly in-demand skills.\n4. **International opportunities:** The tech stack + product experience will make moving abroad far easier than internal enterprise ops work. People hiring in NA or EU will instantly recognize those skills.\n\nIf you want a chill ride and don‚Äôt care about moving internationally or building the ‚Äúmodern data engineer‚Äù skillset, A is fine. But for leveling up, B is the one that actually sets you up for the future.\n\nBasically: stress now ‚Üí way more options later. That‚Äôs how I see it.",

        "body": "I've been designing DW solutions for 30 years. Up until recently, surrogate keys were always defined as int or bigint and to generate them you used a sequential number generator or similar.  This meant a couple things.  You almost always had to process your dimension before facts (because the dimension table contained the mapping of the business keys to the dw surrogate key assigned).  When processing fact tables, for every fk, you would need to lookup the associated surrogate key in the corresponding dimension table.  In the old days when we were all using OLTP based database systems like Oracle and SQL Server (on-prem because that is all we had), using integer based surrogates added in performance at query time).  Later Dan L came up with Data Vault methodolgy.  That is a very different way of modelling with one of the often listed benefits of being able to process in parallel entities that would be come dimensions from those that were facts.  To do this, he used hashing (of some sort) so that you didn't necessarily have to process data in a certain order (apologies if I have some of this wrong....I only worked on 1 DV project 14 years ago).    The other thing which occurred was columnar database solutions, the cloud and elastic and ultra scalable dbms solutions like Snowflake (and before that Terradata and Netezza).  These systems reduce/eliminate the need to worry about defining surrogate keys as integers and using a hash methodology works fine so hence, you now see many practitioners use a fixed length deterministic hash column as the surrogate.\n\nBTW:  one of the lesser known reasons for using a surrogate (based on a sequential number generator) was that you build in some isolation from the source system.  While not common, systems of record have been known to change the key of a source record (probably seldom happens now) so using a surrogate key meant that it was possible to only need to change the relationship of the dimensional business key to the existing surrogate (no need to update the FK in all related fact tables where it occurred.  By using a hash, that won't work anymore since the source key fields which might change, will result in a different hash.  But since these new systems are so much faster, probably not a big deal (I don't recall ever running into that situation but I recall Ralph Kimball mentioning this in one of his books...I think)\n\napologies for rambling on.",

There are a few advantages:\n\n* Independent processing:  You can generate foreign key without needing to do a lookup. So you could create fact records without needing to join to already loaded dimensions, or satellite and link records without joining to hubs. This allows parallel processing that isn't dependent on load order (warning: it can also lead to including a foreign key that doesn't actually exist)\n* Prevent having to do multi-column joins. For example when you have to do a diff or merge for incremental load, you can join on the hash key. \n* Records from the same source data will have the same key in all environments. This can help in some testing scenarios. \n\nThere are some disadvantages such as increasing storage of the key, risk of collisions, and being less human-readable.",

Please add or correct. \n\nAdvantages of using hash function to generate a surrogate key over creating surrogate key from sequence \n\n1. During table load into distributed system, generating sequence could become a bottleneck where as if we use hash function based on business keys, they could be loaded independently parallel much faster. \n\n2. Anonymization: Hashing protects sensitive data by creating a oneway, non reversible key. By using hash keys, you ensure that the vast majority of your data warehouse users‚Äîwho are simply analyzing metrics‚Äîcan't even see the sensitive data because it's not present in the tables they access. Usually dimensional tables hold sensitive info like ssn, credit card etc. \n\n3. Efficiency while doing data lookups and data integration. Use of hash keyed surrogates avoid the need for what they call pre-join. Using a sequential key requires a lookup against the dimension table to find the correct key for a given business key. But if we are using hashed surrogates, we can derive this directly from the business keys and avoid pre-join. I think what they mean is an application querying with business keys does not need to go to the dimension tables first to find the sequence number foreign key and then use that to fetch fact table details. Instead, the application querying can directly generate a hash from the business keys that the user entered and query the fact table directly. \n\n4. If data is sourced from different source systems, the hashed key approach ensures the same key will be generated for say the same customer whereas if we use sequence, that will end up creating multiple records  for the same customer causing data integrity issues.",

Like I said, I was dealing with tens of thousands of simulation files regularly on hardware that would make you cry. This volume is nothing for current systems.\n\nSecond.

It would be a good idea to look into dbt for analytics engineering as well as spark and try some complex sql (rows between and etc.). After 12 years, I also just stumbled onto ckann. Guessing you are more open source like me. Dbt has an equivalent in pure gcp but cuts across all popular systems. A solid side project from data collection (try out dagster) to data modelling to ml models, agents, and llms is a good idea. An llm can help you find answers to questions quickly.

Hive is 'simpler' than iceberg, which is both good and bad: **Good** because there is less involved management of the objects (no snapshots TTLs for example) and it is simpler to reason about the partitions and buckets (to some extent) but **bad** because you lack access to operations such as MERGE, DELETE, UPDATE that simplify the logic of the pipelines. In hive if you want to create a SCD2 you have to do it in more steps and always with the mindset that you have to move data to another temp or staging table in order to do a final insert with the data you want to 'update'. In iceberg you can just MERGE/UPSERT.\n\n\n2. Iceberg has more functionalities that enable you to write efficient tables and queries to access their data: z-order, bloom filters (supported to some extent in hive table format) and hidden partitions are a few of them, but now that I think about it not a lot of people used them to get the most out of the hardware. You can achieve great results while optimizing large tables if you use them in the right way (good sorting to improve compression, adding bloom filters for columns often used in equi-wheres, use the right type of merge (CoW/MoR) depending on how the data lands in the table and is queried, etc)\n\nI would prefer iceberg because of the extra functionalities to manipulate data, but without snapshots or at least a very simplified version of it.",

That way BI teams and analysts are able to query data that could reside across many systems. They then add on additional benefits like governance, optimization, cataloging, and the like. \n\nIn my opinion their current downside is the number of integrations they support compared to their competitors.

Write each user into SEPARATE ordered extents into S3.\n\nStep 3: Run a single historical spark job to rewrite the data into historical logs for each user in the order the tables were designed in. Select where id > 0 && id < step1.table_id_seq. Upload those to each users extents.\n\nAll queries are now embarrassingly parallel, and you control the data, not Snowflake.\n\nIf you are under 100TB you can do this in under a week with a handful of spot instances, S3 and just one engineer (yourself).\n\nThese cloud vendors are literally selling shuffle debt as a service due to SQL destroying physical locality at ingest.

When working with larger datasets both tools are expecting you to maintain near real time replicas in your SQL Server DBs.\n\nFor your 3 SF Orgs with DBAmp you'll be using sf\\_Refresh and with SQL-Sales ss\\_Delta to maintain (for example):\n\n* ReplicaDB\\_Org1.dbo.Account\n* ReplicaDB\\_Org1.dbo.Account\n* ReplicaDB\\_Org3.dbo.Account\n\nwhich will only pull the last delta (insert/update/delete) based off of SystemModStamp of a given object.  When run frequently either sproc call runs quickly and has always been \"quick enough\" for what I need the data for (or just to define a nightly snapshot, but run quickly and not hours as it could do on larger objects). \n\nYou have two additional options with SQL-Sales, which may help in your situation - (1) to work within the same DB with schema isolation so for example\n\n* ReplicaDB.org1.Account\n* ReplicaDB.org2.Account\n* ReplicaDB.org3.Account\n\nWhen working with multiple SF sources (Orgs), it's quite handy sometimes to be working in just the one replicas DB \n\nOr (2) you can define a custom replica table name so for example:\n\n* ReplicaDB.dbo.Account\\_Org1 (Account from Org1)\n* ReplicaDB.dbo.Account\\_Org2 (Account from Org2)\n* ReplicaDB.dbo.Account\\_Org3 (Account from Org3)\n\nI've only used this feature when I've needed to have different column scope tables for the same SF Object in the same DB - but for your use case, you could go down this route I guess.\n\nTo make the delta pulls more efficient (i.e. quicker) both tools allow you to filter the column scope of your replicas but personally I rarely bother doing that and just go with both tool's default all column option - unless you have some crazy wide SF object or huge textarea columns you want to avoid.  That all said this would keep you in SQL Server by maintaining (SQL Server) replicas yourself but this may give you some alternative options in the short term while you plan this out.",

        "body": "Informatica mappings are actually simple model to model transforms. There are two main challenges in migrating it to modern systems:\n\n* First - modern systems do not speak the language of structured datasets - so you will have to break it down into two parts - ingestion and transformation, and\n* Second - that typically there are a ton of infa mappings that companies have created over a period of time that becomes a pain to catalog and go through one by one - so bulk migration almost seems like the only way out.\n\nThankfully there is a system that is fully capable of taking on Informatica mapping style pipelines - it is called tabsdata and is an on-prem system that you can run on bare metal or on k8s clusters on the cloud. Bottom line you own it and and run it. This system offers the pub/sub for tables model for ETL. Here is how you use it to migrate infa pipelines:\n\n* Step 1: for every input port in the infa pipeline, you create a publisher that reads the input table and creates a tabs data table.\n* Step 2: for every transform in the infa mapping, you can create a transformer in tabsdata that will take one or more tables within tabsdata and do your join/aggregate/filter etc.\n* Step 3: once you have created the curated dataset, you add subscribers to it so that they can be loaded into the target platform.\n\nWhile this sounds like more work than one-to-one migration of infa mappings, you will be surprised at the ease and reusability that this approach produces and that itself could cut the pipeline complexity and count significantly. Check out [this overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVITxb-HSPQ&t=20s) to see if this is the right thing for you. Hope this helps.",

This means that after every change to the tables, every new column, every change in team/domain structures, the governance steps need to be kept up-to-date. Someone needs to update lineage manually, change data quality rules, and make this a part of their development process.\n\nMy suggestion after implementing a couple of these types of solutions would be to either have a very clear post-implementation maintanence process mapped out, or to look for solutions that would already integrate the governance within the rest of the development lifecycle.",

A huge chunk of our data is unstructured and lives in on prem resources. The challenge wasn't just cataloging a cloud data warehouse, but getting a handle on this massive, distributed file environment.\n\nWe ended up using the integrated catalog that comes with our storage platform, DeepSpace storage. It was a good fit because its core job is to manage all of our on prem file storage. Since DeepSpace is already tracking every file for its tiering and archival purposes. There's no drift between the catalog and the storage because the catalog¬†is¬†the storage's metadata. Our resources lean onprom though, we may have gone a different way if we were primarily in the cloud.",

It is a daunting task, as in the act of taking the first step is monumental for a lot of folks (and why creating something you deem a 'stupid website hosted on aws with shitty architecture' is FAR more impressive than doing a calculator app (literally anyone can do it and there is not real value/insight to glean from it). It is like trying to do calculus when you can barely add two numbers. If someone wants to make a game without the foundation then they will most likely flounder about cause they are trying to start on step 10 where instead they need to start at step 1 (what language do you know, downloading an IDE etc...)\n\nBut with the prevalence of AI, the barrier has been reduced down considerably. I condone the idea of 'vibe' coding ie copy/pasting what you see and not digesting (reading what the AI spit out doesnt count). But I do recommend asking thoughtful questions that are small queries to AI (how to do print statement, why is ('hello' + d) not working etc...). And when you get the response back, think about why it is telling you the error is happening. So if ('I said hello' + 10 + 'times') threw an error then the AI might respond you cant add a str to an int. Now think about why that is ie you are adding two incompatible data types (string, int) which should lead you to asking what kind of data types are there and why data formatting is important etc...\n\nWork on the proof of concepts, small building blocks first. Even if it is stupid like learning how to add two numbers literally on some scratchpad of your coding IDE that will help you on your journey. It builds momentum, confidence and skill so you know what to employ .\n\nYour first iteration will suck ass. The first 1000 line of legitimate code will suck ass. Don't try to be perfect.

For instance, you pick up your first book and learn how to do variable assignment, and print, input, and if statements in some language.  I would then spend a month writing text games in Python using only those components. And then I would learn about loops and arrays and write a bunch of better games.

Not saying you 100%  have to like all these things, but if you are lacking, you better do them like you love them. \n\nHere‚Äôs what you need to do, even if you don‚Äôt like it.\n\nLeetcode is a terrible assessment of ability, but I do believe you could get up to speed in about a month of regular study, at least enough for interviews. Go to neetcode, learn the algorithms first for the section you are about to try, then go do them. 30 mins is your max timer, if you get there, look up  the answer, and move on. At the end of your session go back and do the ones you missed. It took me about 2 weeks to get up to speed. \n\nPick a language, and ‚Äúmaster it‚Äù. What I mean by this is find a language you actually enjoy, who cares if it‚Äôs the most practical. Learn the basics, tips and tricks, become familiar with the standard library, build a pair with it, connect to a database with it, etc etc. roadmaps.sh is a good resource for what order to learn things. Being very capable in one language does help as you are aware of what is possible, then you can go translate it into another language. \n\nYou like frontend? Pick 3 popular websites, and remake them. For each use a different frontend stack if you don‚Äôt know what you like. I‚Äôll choose them for you, tailwindcss with svelte, bulma with React, and plain CSS with vanilla JS. Don‚Äôt stop until you have a working homepage and links. Add to GitHub and repeat. Obviously go expand on this as you go but these are starting points. Along the way take the time to explore and learn. \n\nSince it seems you‚Äôre still in school, get a tutor, join clubs, make friends to program with, go to hackathons, go to game jams, job fairs, etc etc. \n\nIf you really want to do this, write down a plan that would make it seem silly if you didn‚Äôt make it and then go execute. Stop saying you like the idea and go become one. \n\nCheers, if you want more specific advice regarding what to do let me know. Best of luck.",

        "body": "What the other commenter said. \"Efficiency\" like you describe is what managers see to juggle scrum points and velocity. It's a useless metric for actually working on code.\n\nImagine programming as a gigantic space of possibilities. You're searching for positions (programs) in that space that fulfil certain functional (the thing the program should do) and usually some non-functional requirements (memory/time constraints, being readable and maintainable). There's not one solution but many, but they are far out (as far as lines you need to write to get there). Each line you write gets you closer to some solutions and farther from others.\n\nUnless you have decades of experience and the program is quite small, it's usually not possible to just \"see\" a good solution and write it down in one go. You need to iterate on it, write parts of it you know will likely be part of a good solution. And even identifying those is lots of experience. Often you'll have to rewrite parts to make it work.\n\nThe first running prototype is usually garbage because it shows the meandering path you took to get there. Restructuring and cleaning up your solution is still expected when you work on large programs, so that the overall commit history doesn't look like a rabbit on acid typed it. This is something that is discussed in professional settings as well. If coders think refactorings are necessary, who will pay for them? Some teams just silently do them as part of other tasks, others try to communicate the need to higher ups.\n\n>  I've tried the Algorithmic thinking tip from the FAQ to help me plan the processes, but I don't notice classes and objects immediately\n\nThat part of the FAQ is not for planning programs. It's for translating doing something into a series of steps that a complete moron (i.e. a computer) can follow and not missing anything in the process. It won't help you with planning ahead. You don't want to plan your programs ahead, neither as a beginner nor as a veteran. It's nigh impossibly hard and the reason why Agile exists.",

They don't explain that!\" Your goal is to say, \"How do I use this specific tool the best of it's ability and how do I know this tool's limits.\"\n\nIn many cases courses are hiding aspects you don't yet understand specfically because they are not tied directly to the thing that course is tying to teach.\n\nA course on data structures won't be teaching you any hardware hacks, because \"data structures\" are the meta of how to store and manipulate data and while certain choices might work better on certain hardware, the course is about teaching the differences between data structures. Why a programmer might chose a linked list, or double linked list over say a binary tree.\n\nIt's also about showing you ways to store data that are \"Worse\" or bad enough no one would do it so that you are learning the pitfalls about why we don't store data in an unsorted list. Instead when we add an element to the data we insert it in the sorted position to make searching in the future faster.\n\n* How to get out of tutorial hell? You just have to enough tutorials to cover:\n\n * How to select the correct pancake mix\n\n * Shipping it to your home.\n\n * How to mix batter\n\n * Errors that arise from licking the wisk\n\n * How to pour\n\n * How to use a spatula without flicking wet batter everywhere.\n\n * How to adjust heat on flame or electric stoves.\n\n* Once you have all the pieces learned you are leaving tutorial hell. The problem is that when you are in one tutorial, e.g. our spatula example, you aren't even aware of all the other steps that are being \"glossed over\" to teach you just that one aspect.\n\n * So you might learn spatula, and then heat, and think Why can't I make pancakes on my own yet! Not realizing there are like 20 more basic tutorial type deals you have to get through just to do that task.\n\n* In short I think tutorial hell is a by product of not having a good road map. If you are taking MIT's (Free) Open course-ware. You can look and see how many other courses you have to take to \"Get to the end\" the end being a certain level of education.\n\n * But even 4-year degree-ed under grads don't feel like they can step in and do everything. Because they can't. But hopefully they have the tools to lay out and study on their own and create a new plan to teach themselves what they need to accomplish some tasks.\n\n * But most of the time they are paired with a \"mentor\" at work that has struggled through the same things. What tools does the company use etc. And that person can give them the roadmap.",

So pick like a small subject area then expand. \n\nAs an example you want to learn about APIs so break that down, let‚Äôs say you have a JSON rest api.  Ok first look at the definition of rest.  Then at api endpoints, each has a http verb and a route and will return a http response code.  You don‚Äôt need to know it by heart but look at what response codes could be returned, look at which verb each route uses and understand why - then you can build test cases to hit each one, like what data gets you a 200 ok response vs a 400 error response and how can you make each happen. \n\nKeep a notebook with everything you hear that you‚Äôre not sure about and Google.

Though, some interviewers seem to be looking for that skill for whatever reason.\n\nBut in an interview situation, it's really hard to tell.  Who knows, if I'm the interviewer and I have a fishy feeling that you're not \"up to snuff\" as it were, maybe I'll throw you a random algorithm question and see how you respond. And if you don't get the job, who knows, maybe you'll go off to Twitter or X or something and whine about how company Y wants people to memorize algorithms or something. Really? I don't think it's that simple in an interview situation.\n\nPersonally I think you should be able to program an implementation of something, given a description of an algorithm. All non-trivial programs that we are making nowadays are essentially algorithms to solve problems for which we (almost never) have a truly complete specification. The \"Algorithms\" in algorithms books are simply smaller problems which have been studied thoroughly, for which complete specifications exist.\n\nFor example, we know 100% what we mean to say whether a sequence is sorted or not, so it's easy to specify that a sorting algorithm takes a sequence for which that property may or may not be true and produces a sequence for which that property is true. \n\nThough even in that problem there are sometimes overlooked edge cases. For example, occasionally the difference between stable sort and unstable sort crops up naturally. If you have never studied algorithms, how likely is it that you would even understand the difference between a stable sort and a non-stable sort. Also how likely is it that you would know which algorithms guarantee stability and which ones don't?",

But we've all heard the mantra - those who don't know the past are doomed to repeat it.\n\nThere is a root to this wisdom that applies to all fields of learning - knowledge builds your intuition. Intuition is knowledge you don't actively think about. It's implied. It's inherent to your thinking. It silently informs you and influences you. If you watch a master of his craft, any craft, you will see they make it look so easy. They don't \"just know\" better, it's not merely muscle memory, it's a career of lessons learned, and decisions made, and fundamental concepts wholly and completely understood.\n\nSo a master developer can get cracking at code in an instant, whereas you might have to spend a lot more time trying to understand the problem and design a solution. The master can do it because all that understanding and design work? Yeah, they already did that - same as you, even for this very problem today, they just did the work 20 years ago...\n\nSo you learn this stuff not because anyone gives a shit whether you can actually implement a binary tree in an interview. RARELY do we implement primitive and fundamental data structures ourselves. The point is that you understand it, and you end up leveraging that intuition in all your thinking for the rest of your career.",

Can't remember if it's on Steam, though...\n\nShenzen I/O - Has you build some gadgets - programming is in an Assembly-like language. IMHO good for training problem solving and debugging skills, as well as some logic (AND, OR, etc.).\n\nTIS-100 - Somewhat like Shenzen, but more simplistic. Has you program the fictional TIS-100 chip for various purposes. Uses an Assembly-like language.\n\nWhile true: Learn(); - Primarily visual programming, teaches AI and neural networking concepts.\n\nGrey Hack - Very nice hacking game where you can build your own exploits and helper programs. Uses its own scripting language, but does teach you problem solving and how to help yourself with code.\n\n\n\nThen there's the real kicker - try to program simple games in C# yourself while learning. One of my firsts was a simple hangman/wheel of fortune game that I made as a console app. Trying to render simple console stuff and text graphics is a good way to start out learning the fundamentals of graphics programming.\n\nAnother good start could be making a simple 2D engine for a shoot-em-up, which can teach you how to manipulate graphics, make sprites and move stuff around. My first one back in the day ran inside a C# form using GDI - it was a b\\*tch to program, but included a very simple AI, parallax scrolling and some other neat stuff.\n\nBack in CS class, I had a semester project (actually two), that consisted of a tile engine running a sort of educational RPG. It was written in C# and ran on the now-dead XNA framework...\n\nIt's probably the harder way to go about things, but it's something you can do as side projects while learning the basics of C# before moving on to Unity.",

Preferably `subprocess.run` with `check=True` so that any errors that occur will get raised into exceptions.\n\n  \nUsing `Popen` directly is useful if you don't want the function to block while the program is running, so it's useful for opening a program for the user that will stay open for some indeterminate amount of time, like opening a text editor, the calculator, etc. (if this is your intention, do NOT use Popen in a with statement, just call it directly.) `subprocess.run` is probably what you usually want for command line utilities because you'll actually be able to see the results.\n\n  \nThere is also `subprocess.call` and `subprocess.check_call`, these are okay but the docs describe them as an \"older API\" meant for use by \"existing code,\" so I'd probably just stick to `subprocess.run` for anything new\n\n*also, `Popen` and `subprocess.run` will let you pass strings as the first argument like you can with `os.system`. Don't do this, because then you're back to that same problem you get with `os.system`. Stick to passing them sequences like tuples or lists, and don't use them with `shell=True`.\n\nIf you feel like you have to hit the shell, you probably can work around it. One time I thought I had to hit the shell was for a cross platform way to run the \"default program\" for a file, via `start` on Windows, `open` on Mac, or `xdg-open` on Linux. However, the latter two are actual binaries and not shell commands so they can be opened via `Popen`, while the former has a dedicated Python function, `os.startfile`, so in all cases it is possible to avoid hitting the shell.",

Learning a language is easy but learning how to program is hard the same way learning to use a saw is easy but being a great wood worker takes time. The language is your tool. Being a competent programmer is to change how you think. Which is something anyone can learn. You just have to be patient and be open minded and it will eventually start clicking. \n\nBreak every problem down to tiny micro steps and tackle each one. Want to move a character? Well how do i read what button to input? How do I set the velocity of the character? How do I animate it? Three little problems from one problem that sounded small in the first place. \n\nDon't let perfection be the enemy of progress as a professional programmer i still look at my code and think I can do better. Body builders are never entirely happy with their figure and still want more muscle growth. The same thing happens in our brain with code. \n\nEven very successful games have had a history of terrible code. Pok√©mon sun and moon is a very famous example of poor project organization and I'm pretty sure eve online had to rewrite their engine before because of how much spaghetti was in it. It happens and you will learn with experience. Just keep making your games and more will click\n\nAlso, I do want to address the anxiety here. If you go in to every hobby and skill wondering if it's for you and get analysis paralysis then you will never truly enjoy anything new and give it a chance. If you have a hard time addressing this i do recommend seeking help and learning to be more comfortable in your own head and getting some confidence",

So the declarations `int x;` and `float y;` will both allocate 4 bytes of memory.\n\nBut the *interpretation* of those bits/bytes is different depending on the type. So the compiler generates different code to work with them.\n\nFor instance, the 32- bit pattern `00111110000000000000000000000000` represents the numeric value 0.125 when interpreted as a float, or the integer value 1040187392 when interpreted as an int. And if you want to do something like add the bit patterns representing two numbers, the logic for doing that will be totally different depending on whether they're ints or floats.\n\nSo if you write the statement `x += 1;`, the compiler generates code to load the value of `x`, perform an *integer* addition, and store the value back into `x`. But if you do `y += 1;`, a *floating-point* addition is performed instead. (And the compiler is smart enough to automatically convert the integer constant `1` into the floating-point constant `1.0` so that the types are compatible.)\n\nSo in general, the purpose of data types is to help the programmer (and the compiler) keep track of how any given chunk of memory is \"supposed\" to be interpreted.",

        "body": "Yes-ish, but also not quite. Your view is very \"C influenced\", and C has a quite impoverished type system -- so you miss an important part of the picture.\n\nThe type certainly determines how the compiler translates your code into machine code: how much stack space it allocates for the values, which registers it uses for them, which instructions it has to use, ... all these things.\n\nAnd at the level of assembly languages the types are \\*usually\\* (certainly with C in its current form) indeed for the most part erased (there are typed assembly languages and there still are some differences between certain data on common architectures, but generally speaking \"it's all just bytes\").\n\nThat said: the principal purpose of types is to ensure the \\*correctness\\* of your code. Type systems are essentially logical calculi (in fact typed programs are in a very real sense equivalent to logical proofs), and in writing your code (with types) you build up a logical formula that the compiler then can reason about to some extent (which is ultimately what results in it reserving enough space for your data, using the right instructions etc). There's drastic differences in the \"power\" of those logical systems: with C you're very much on the weak side of things, which means types really are rather \"stupid\". Other languages go far further here, allowing you to encode way more intricate properties via types -- which then for example results in dealing with types that don't have \\*any\\* possible values, or that have values that have no size in memory at all \\[and contrary to what you might initally expect these types turn out to be \\*very\\* useful in practice\\].  \n\n\n(An issue with what you wrote is that `int` is not generally guaranteed to be 4 bytes, but that's more of an issue with C and many introductory resources. If you want to be able to say more about the sizes of your data in memory you'll have to use more specific types like `int32_t`)",

They're binary values to the hardware, but they're whatever you interpret them to be (numbers, characters, something denoting true/false etc.) in your program.\n\nAt the compiler level they're the primitive building blocks that language creators wanted to provide to users of their programming language, and they have the interface and semantics they define and build into them (e.g. String in Java appears quite different than char \\* in C, despite there being an array of character values somewhere in Java's String implementation).\n\nAt the language user's level, whatever the language says you have. If it says that int will give you a 4 byte number (for example) then it will.\n\nSo data types are basically a compiler/interpreter level construct that allows you to represent, store, retrieve, and often mutate, data in your programs. Beyond that it's up to the compiler implementer to define what you write, what you can do with each, what you can't. Often it's not specified how a type is stored underneath, because a programmer may not need to know in certain environments (e.g. browsers).",

While those areas may be growing, they're still a small niche. The idea of adding AI into literally everything is a fad that will probably disappear.\n\nShitty 2025 AI toasters and ice makers are a fad.  2075 AI toasters and ice makers are absolutely a potentially legitimate product with staying power.\n\nThe underlying tech is not going anywhere.  It will normalize over time and disappear into the infrastructure. Same way microchips went from novelty, to places they had no right to be given their limited capabilities, to fully useful and effectively invisible infrastructure.\n\nIn my view, AI and machine learning should be requisite courses for a CS degree, at least up to basics like minimax and neural networks.  You‚Äôd be wise to take them as electorates for your understanding, if nothing else, even if you never directly use a neural network in all of your career.\n\n> The absolute most important thing you should do is not use AI to help with your coursework. There's been an epidemic of CS grads cheating their way through school using AI and they are ending up with a degree and no skills. Companies have no interest in someone with a degree who can't code without the help of AI. Don't let that happen to you.\n\nWhile this is all accurate, this advice is better framed as ‚Äúdon‚Äôt cheat yourself.‚Äù  Using AI to help with your homework is fine.  The problem comes when you pack it up and start playing video games after the computer did your homework for you, and you didn‚Äôt take the time to learn how to solve it on your own.  It‚Äôs not the fault of the AI that you didn‚Äôt bother to actually learn anything.  That‚Äôs on you.\n\nAnd the problem I have with blanket advice like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt use AI‚Äù is that **you‚Äôre missing out massively if you are not using AI for the purpose of self-learning.**  \n\nUse AI as your personal tutor who clears up your misunderstandings, answers your ‚Äústupid‚Äù questions, and helps you understand complex topics, not a nerd that you bully into doing your homework.  It can even help you with your homework, but your goal needs to be to obtain knowledge and understanding.  You will progress much faster with AI than without it, if you‚Äôre using it competently.",

        "body": "Massively simplified analogy: You need to find the email of Professor Dan to beg him to let you into his full class next semester. There are a number of ways you can go about getting that:\n\n1. Ask your current CS teacher what Dan's email is. He says \"I don't know, Professor Smith might know though.\" So you go ask Professor Smith what his email is and she says \"I don't know, but Professor Stevens might know.\" You go ask Professor Stevens and she says \"I don't know, try Professor Jones.\" You keep going down the chain, each person telling you to go talk to someone else, until you reach someone who knows what the email is, and who knows how many people you're going to have to talk to and you just don't want to do that.\n2. So you realize that oh wait, you can just look him up in the staff directory and find the email that belongs to him. You know he's a CS professor so you can just start with the CS directory instead of scanning down from Dr. Aarons in Academic Advising, and you already know the guy's name is Professor Dan so you can just jump to D.\n\nThat's basically the difference between finding something in a linked list vs. hash table In reality it's a bit more complicated:\n\n3. Suppose you go to the staff directory and it's not in alphabetical or department order -- it seems totally random. Also, it's split into 20,000 pages. So you have no idea where Dan is and you're thinking you've got to just work your way down, and you really don't want to do that. But then you see that the directory is maintained by the department weirdo Dr. Bryant. You go ask Dr. Bryant, who tells you almost immediately \"Dan? He's on page 56.\" You ask, astonished: \"You just memorized that???\" Dr. Bryant: \"Nah, I just multiplied the letters of DAN, so 4 \\* 1 \\* 14 is 56.\"\n\n4. You go to page 56, and sure enough there's Dan's bio and email. Problem solved! But then the next day you have a realization and go back to Dr. Bryant: \"Wait a minute, what if you hire another guy named Dan? Only one of them can be on page 56, your system won't work anymore.\" Bryant goes \"Uh..... wait, I know, his employee ID is 4LBA8F, and his ID is unique so I can just use that instead!\"\n\n5. Satisfied, you leave his office, then 2 minutes later turn around and go back in. \"But that's not gonna work either, what if you have employee 222 and 22B? Or 2BB? What about 6666, 666F, 66FF?\"  Dr. Bryant says he needs to think about that.\n\nThis is also massively simplified and obviously the actual calculations are more complicated, but that's the general idea: since your data is probably not going to be perfectly ordered, you need to come up with a function to map each item to a numerical value, and that value will be the index to the \"bucket\" of memory that data will go into. You don't want that function to come up with different values because that makes things complicated, but unless you have an infinite amount of space, it's impossible to prevent that completely. All you can do is try to limit how often it happens; there's mathematical theory for the best ways to limit that and various implementations for how to handle whatever collisions do happen.\n\n\"OK, why not make it ordered then?\" You could do that, but then you'll have to continually fix the order every time you insert new data, instead of just crunching a number for where to insert it. So if you're doing a lot of insertions compared to lookups, that may not be ideal.",

Very sophisticated CPU caches do have the ability to notice that you're chasing pointers (they correlate values previously loaded with the addresses fetched) but that's most helpful if you repeatedly access shallow data structures.\n\nThere just isn't much that can be done to hide memory latency when the data structure is really deep.\n\nIf a linked list is the best choice it's probably because you need a LIFO or FIFO queue and search is rare.\n\nOther points in favor of linked lists\n\n* concurrent LLs (multiple threads will access at the same time) are easier than concurrent hash tables and compete with concurrent ring buffers\n* The objects you intend to link are members of some other data structure and the LL acts as an alternate way to access them.

To even have a chance you need a good LinkedIn, a good GitHub (you can pin up to 6 projects to the front of your GitHub), and a reviewed resume (r/CsCareerQuestions has two resume review days a week). To use GitHub you need to learn the command line tool called \"git\". To use a command line tool, you need to learn the command line.

        "body": "I will give you some actual code feedback, but the game is actually quite fun :) \n\n1. I like the type\\_out() function. \n\n2. You should wrap your code in a main block. In Python this looks like this: `if __name__==\"__main__\":` In this way your code will only execute if you actually run the file, not if you import it. \n\n3. I like that you commented everything pretty well. Your comments are not very detailed, but they give me a good idea what a codeblock should do very quickly. \n\n3.5. As a tip for comments: Use docstrings [https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) In many IDEs docstrings show up when you hover over a function, do quickly tell you what it does. \n\n4. In line 150, I would suggest using an object, or a dictionary to store the data, since it's closely related to each other. There will never be a case, where you want to keep the vitals of the old patient, but generate a new name for example. This could be done like this: \n\n    class Patient():\n      \"\"\" represents Patient data\"\"\"\n      def __init__(self, name, id, status, vitals, dialogue, is_expected):\n        self.name = name\n        self.id = id \n        [...]\n    \n    [...]\n        type_out(f\"Patient Name: {patient.name}\")\n        \n\nYou already seem to use a smaller version of this as a dictionary in `generate_expected_patient_list()`, so I think unifying both datastructure would be a good idea, especially if you want to develop this game further. \n\n4.5: You also seem to use the exact same line of code `type_out(f\"Name: {p['name']}, ID: {p['id']}\")`quite a few times. This could be rolled into the class I suggested above, giving Patient a method to type\\_out their name and id. You would then use it in code as `patient.type_out()` for example. \n\nAll in all your code is structured okay, but for better readability you could thinnk about moving the actions and the new\\_day part of your loop into their own functions. This might not look like a benefit in your codebase right now, but if your game logic gets bigger, like a few thousand lines of code bigger, your game loop really should look roughly like this: \n\n    while True:\n      new_patient = get_new_patient()\n      action = get_player_action()\n      handle_action(action)\n      check_game_over(strikes)\n      check_new_day(expected_patients)\n\nAnyways, good job for a beginner :) Keep it up!",

There's \".data\" memory section for all global variables that you or other code define. Before compilation  you can allocate as much memory in it as you think the program will need for its entire lifetime, like few megabytes (mebibytes). But you need to manage memory inside that buffer by yourself and what if you need more memory during the execution of the program ? Here comes the heap memory that OS manages by itself, you just request memory allocation to it. The C/C++ runtime code now manages the heap memory regions that it controls, you just call \"malloc/free\" in C or \"new/delete\" in C++ and they return a \"pointer\" to this new memory pages. It's just a number to that memory address. Now you can refer to data outside memory constrained \".data\" section and have dynamic data allocations. Each memory section have pages of memory allocated to them, so they all may have access attributes associated with them. \".data\" section is readable, writable. \".text\" code section is readable, executable. So you can't ovetwrite the code that your program is dependent on. \nC/C++ without understanding OS concepts would be hard to understand cause many APIs rely on understanding them.",

Just to clarify, I'm not some kind of genius, this is all pretty standard stuff that would be covered in digital logic and computer architecture courses in a typical CS curriculum.\n\nTo thoroughly answer your questions I would basically have to teach one of those courses, and I'm not going to try to do that. Instead I'll just try to clarify my previous comment a bit.\n\nYou have to distinguish between the *simulated* CPU (the custom 16-bit design that the Youtuber you linked came up with) and the *real* CPU that is being used to run the simulation.\n\nA real CPU is made out of many millions of physical logic gates. All of those logic gates operate simultaneously. But they work together so that the real CPU executes one \"instruction\" at a time. (This is a massive oversimplification, but it's good enough for this discussion.)\n\nLet's say that the simulated CPU needs a few hundred logic gates to make a 32-bit adder. If you write a gate-level software simulation on the real CPU, the simulation will have to process each of those logic gates one at a time. So like I said, it will take many hundreds or thousands of real CPU instructions to *simulate* a single addition operation on the simulated CPU. That's what I meant by \"iterate\". The simulator has to go through each logic gate one at a time to compute its result.\n\nIf instead, you write an emulator that runs on the real CPU, then when it needs to add two numbers, it can execute a single `ADD` instruction. Now, *physically*, that `ADD` instruction is still implemented within the CPU by many logic gates. But because those gates are real physical things, all operating simultaneously, they don't have to be simulated one at a time. They all happen in parallel. So the execution is much faster. (But the physical arrangement of the CPU's logic gates is fixed in hardware. You can't customize it the way you could customize a gate-level simulation that's performed in software.)\n\nI'm just using addition as an example, but the same principle applies to other things too. The 16-bit CPU has lots of other control circuitry that decides *what* instruction to execute at any given time. That control circuitry is made up of many logic gates. But the work that is done by a large number of logic gates can alternatively be implemented by a smaller number of CPU instructions on the real physical CPU, doing the same work directly, without simulating the behavior of all the individual gates.\n\n> And why does the guy‚Äôs actual processor itself get to skip over all of those logic gates that logism can‚Äôt?\n\nThey're not \"skipped over\". But when you take the logic design that was being simulated in Logisim, and build it out of real physical logic gates, then those gates are all operating in parallel. So you don't have to wait for a software simulation to process them one at a time.\n\n----\n\nIf you want to learn more about this topic, I would suggest going through the free self-guided [Nand2Tetris course.](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)",

        "body": "Repositories are self-contained dependency trees of commits. Every repository has an index or staging area which is where you add the changes that you intend to commit eventually. The staging area acts as a temporary safe space that is not a full commit and to which you can restore your tracked files if for some reason you aren't happy with the latest changes, and the changes saved to the staging area can also be restored. When you make a commit, only the changes tracked in the staging area are used.\n\nCommits in a repository are uniquely identified by hashes, which look like long strings of random characters that are in fact generated from all the information that they save. Commits contain the hashes of their immediate ancestors, the differences in the code between them and their immediate ancestors, the names and E-mail addresses of their authors, a timestamp, a message explaining what they change and why so that other people in the future can gain a deeper understanding of why specific changes were made, and optionally a digital signature to reinforce their authenticity. Commits represent snapshots of branch states at specific times.\n\nSince commit hashes aren't easy to remember, git provides the ability to tag them with more remarkable names. Tags are often used to record milestones, like the official version of a project at that point, but they can be used for anything you want, and can always have descriptions independent of their respective commit messages.\n\nBranches represent distinct and possibly concurrent development paths, and every git repository has at least one conventionally named main these days or master in the past, however branches can have arbitrary names. Branches are simply alternative HEAD pointers, you can create a branch from any commit in the repository, which will result in its HEAD pointing at that commit, and after that every commit you make to that branch will have the original commit of the branch as an ancestor in its history. Branches are typically used to avoid cluttering the main history of the project with irrelevant versioning information related to refactoring, bug fixing, feature development, or even to continue developing old versions of the same project concurrently to the main branch.\n\nRemotes provide the ability to name external repositories, and are intended to synchronize with the work done by other developers. Each branch can also track a single branch on a remote repository, which is typically used to synchronize with an upstream source of truth, and doesn't really need to have the same name as the local branch. Pushing to a remote branch attempts to append your changes in a local branch to the remote branch, whereas pulling attempts to append the remote changes of the remote branch to your local branch. If this succeeds then the resulting trivial merge is called a fast forward, otherwise you will be required to resolve the conflicts before the local and remote repositories can be synchronized. The HEAD of a tracked remote branch is pointed at by REMOTE_HEAD\n\nMerging is a process in which two divergent branches, both local or one local and one remote, are synchronized by a commit that addresses all the conflicts. Since only local branches can be written to, the merge commit is always created locally. After a merge all the concurrent commits are added to the history of the local branch, which can make the commit history rather confusing to understand. A different option to merging is rebasing, where all the divergent changes in one of the branches are added on top of the other branch, but this too can mess up the commit history, because if both branches have been getting concurrent commits, the timestamps in the resulting history where all the commits to one branch are logically applied after all the commits to the other branch will result in a history of commits that are not progressive over time, so git also provides the ability to squash commits, which can be used to coalesce a range of commits.\n\nReverting is the process in which the changes made by one or more commits are applied in reverse to a branch, effectively resulting in those changes being removed from the code. Reverting commits does not alter the commit history of a branch, instead a new revert commit is created specifically to remove the changes, at which point the author of the reverse is given a chance to address any conflicts that might prevent the operation. Switching is a process in which git is instructed to go back to any commit in the repository. If the switch is made to a branch then the local files will be updated to the HEAD commit of the branch, otherwise the switch is considered headless and no commits can be made until a branch is created to track them. Resetting moves the HEAD of a branch to any commit on the repository, which can result in some commits becoming unreachable and eventually garbage collected.\n\nStashing is the concept of committing your changes to a local commit tracker and restoring everything to how it was in the previous commit. Stashes are global and as such are completely independent of branches.\n\nOther concepts like pull requests, forks, and releases are specific to GitHub. Pull requests are just regular posts to a repository linking to a branch on your own repository whose changes you would like to get merged with the remote repository. Forks are just other developers cloning your repository under a new repository on their own account. Releases are essentially tags on steroids that you can use to provide ready-to-use builds of your project.\n\nGit is also quite versatile when it comes to rewriting history, however this is a fairly advanced subject that I'm not going to touch on here since it requires a good understanding of its fundamental concepts. Rewriting history can sometimes make commits unreachable from any branch, and These commits are kept around for a while but eventually git's garbage collector gets rid of them, however this grace period makes it possible to recover them, so even if you completely mess up a repository it's almost always possible to manually recover everything back during this period.\n\nHopefully this comment covers all the basics with enough detail but without being overwhelming.",

I think you have a good mindset, of wanting to understand core concepts, terms, and vocabulary, so that you can communicate better.\n\nThe other Reddit comments that you referenced are likely addressing people who have not had any experience building anything.\n\nThe truth is that in order to become a good programmer, you need a lot of experience in *both* reading about core concepts *and also* building things. It won't work out well if you focus on only either one of those two things while neglecting the other.",

The advice I would give to a beginner would be something more like this:\n\n1) Have a specific goal of what you want to accomplish by learning programming\n2) Make sure that what you're doing is moving you towards that goal\n\nSo many people skip (1) when they're asking for advice on what to do, but it's super important. Why *specifically* do you want to learn programing? Is it to make video games? Or is it to automate business processes at your accounting firm? Or is it to hack your smart-fridge? Those are all vastly different skill sets, with different paths you'll need to take in your learning. Knowing what you want to do is so so important to making sure you're learning the right things.\n\nOnce you've figured out (1) step (2) is a lot easier (still hard though!). Usually, step (2) starts with following one comprehensive course on the relevant programming language / framework / environment. Make sure it's a high quality, modern course on the topic. As you go, make sure you're doing exercises, and writing code independently to test that you're following along. **Once you've finished this course, you should have the \"vernacular\"** that you're talking about in your post. At that point, you can start building (small) projects.\n\nOftentimes where people get stuck on (2) is that they jump around between too many different tutorials, they don't learn things on their own, or they don't focus on the learning that will actively help them achieve their goals. But doing a single, high quality course is definitely not \"tutorial hell\".\n\nPeople who suggest doing projects are right that the true, deep learning comes after you've taken the training wheels of a course or tutorial off. There's a lot of important and valuable struggle that comes from putting the pieces together yourself. But you really want to go into your first projects with a decent understanding of the fundamentals, otherwise it will be hard to see the forest for the trees.",

You get 80% of the benefit from just picking up heavy shit and putting it back down, and 18% of the remaining 20% from doing the easiest optimizations (alternating which muscle groups are worked + watching your calories).\n\nThe obvious thing everyone can agree on but gets lost in the argument is that it's pointless to focus on your diet, get perfect sleep, and buy the right supplements... but never actually go to the gym.\n\nWe can (and do!) argue on and on about if it's optimal to build projects, watch presentations from industry professionals, focus on languages versus abstract CS ideas, learn through integration or building from scratch, if you should focus on learning functional and declarative paradigms, philosophies of state management, keeping up with industry standards...\n\n... and the advice of \"go *practice*\" gets lost.\n\nGo. Try to build something. It'll be bad. You'll probably get completely stuck at some point. Research how other people solved the problem. Watch some tech talks or YouTubers, read a blog, whatever. Find a library that does the thing. Try again. It'll be better. Still bad. Rinse and repeat. Once you're in the swing of learning, building, iterating, *then* you can worry about branching out to new languages, picking up modern frameworks, etc...",

You need a pointer if you want to modify the input, because the function is gonna delete any copy it makes after it exits.\n\nAs for syntax things: 'pointer->item' is just a pointer access operator. It's short hand for '\\*(pointer).item'\n\nBut tbh, this doesn't look like a pointer issue on your part. Like, the code wouldn't change much if this were C++ code using a class or something. This code is pretty clear, so this is a comprehension issue, and I'm hoping you at least got told how a queue works before you got the slides.\n\nIf you know what a Queue is, what's going on here is that your prof has defined a few functions that take a Queue pointer as input, and didn't tell you how they work yet. The prof has also defined a Queue struct, and hasn't told you how that was implemented either. Odds are, your prof intended you to read this and interpret it kinda like pseudo code. Or you didn't read far enough in his lecture slides to find the rest of the info. Either way, read the whole set of slides before jumping to conclusions.\n\nThe Queue struct would seem to be implemented using an array. My guess is it probably looks something like this:\n\n    typedef struct {\n        int front = -1; // index of the first item in the array. -1 means it's pointing at nothing.\n        int back = -1; // index of the last item in the array. -1 means it's pointing at nothing.\n        'Datatype' val[CAPACITY]; // where we store everything in the queue. Can be of any type. \n    } Queue;\n\nThen there's the functions he defined. In order:\n\n* int length(Queue q\\*) : Tells you how many things are stored in the provided queue. Probably does this by checking the difference of the front and back indexes +1 modulo CAPACITY.\n* int isEmpty(Queue q\\*) : Tells you if both the front & back indexes are -1.\n\nThere may have also been an initialize function to set front & back to -1, I don't actually recall if I can do that in the struct definition. Either way, point remains: Ask your prof. This is what office hours are for. Or e-mail them.",

        "body": "At the root of pointers is understanding how a computer actually works. When a program is running, it has access to its segment of program memory, with each unit of memory (byte, word, dword whatever depending on architecture) having an address.\n\nThe point of data structures is to store the program's data in memory in a cohesive structure that is fast for your usecase and lets you access it later. Data structures (and pointers) are the tools by which you manage memory for your program.\n\nYou know that a pointer is an address to a piece of memory. Getting the value of the memory at that address is called *dereferencing* the pointer. Dereferencing uses the \\* operator. \\*ptr will give the value at pointer ptr.\n\nYour queue has an offset to the current last element (called back). This holds the offset of the address of the first free address of the queue. The function enqueue also takes in a queue pointer called q. To access the value of back, you would first have to dereference the queue pointer \"q\", then access its instance variable \"back\". Because dereferencing a pointer to an object to access one of its attributes is such a common occurrence, there is a special operator -> that does exactly that. If q was not a pointer to a queue object but rather the queue object itself, you would access back by doing q.back. but because q is a pointer, you do q->back.\n\nPointers can also be *indexed into* meaning to take the address referenced by pointer p and adding the number in brackets to that address. For example if pointer p had the address 0x00001, then you could reference the value at address 0x00002 by doing p\\[1\\].\n\nTo trace your code with all of this understanding is pretty simple. The function first checks if the queue is full (meaning a new element cannot be added) and simply returns in this case.\n\nIf the queue is empty, set the first element in the queue to newData. The variable val is an instance pointer to the start of the queue. q->val\\[0\\] refers to the data value at the address at the start of the queue.\n\nback, as previously established is the offset from the base of the queue (val) to the next free address in the queue. To add a value to a non-empty queue, the code stores back in a temporary value, idx. The code then stores newData in that address (val\\[idx\\] is the same thing as saying val\\[q->back\\]), then increments back by one, ensuring that it continues to be the offset of a free address.",

C is generally preferred for controlling devices, partly because C is more than adequate for control logic (whereas something like object-oriented programming is too complicated), but also because it's much easier to manage limited CPU and memory resources with C.\n\nAs for getting started, there's an awful lot of satisfaction in making even the most basic projects work.  Since you have an Arduino, you could start with a simple programme that uses the Arduino to control an LED.\n\nHere are some things you can try in order:\n\n- Make the LED switch on after a second (a basic \"Hello World\")\n- Make the LED flash on and off (teaches loops)\n- Add a push switch to the circuit and have the switch cycle the LED between on and off states every time you push it. (teaches you events)\n- Use the push switch to turn a flashing LED on and off (combines events with loops)\n- Add multiple LEDs and build a binary counter from 0 to `n` (teaches `for` loops specifically)\n- Pushing the button resets the counter.\n- Add a second button that changes the behaviour of the LED (e.g. switches between flashing and counting; teaches functions/separation of behaviours).\n\nEverything you do with the LED, you can do with a servo, relay, transistor, or anything else that can be connected to a circuit.\n\nOnce you've worked out how to control output with a button, you can think about using different kinds of input, like using a thermistor to react to a temperature change, or an LDR to react to light levels.",

Don't jump from one language to another just because you think you understood the basics. Use the basics to build projects that get more complex from project to project. If you gonna learn Web Development then one resource I can recommend because I did it myself is the Odin Project. It's free and open source.

WebKit gets around 40 commits a day currently, so if you start working on WebKit and it takes you a month to get something working, by the time you're done WebKit will have had 1000 commits and you'll probably have to fix a bunch of things to catch up.\n\nI just saw that you're aware of the WinCairo fork that provides MiniBrowser. I'm afraid that's all you're going to find. I thought you wanted to build your own browser? If so, MiniBrowser is a perfect place to start - a working bare-bones browser with a clean slate so you can build whatever you want on top of it.\n\nIf you want a complete browser with modern features to extend and modify, that doesn't exist on Windows based on WebKit right now, as far as I know.",

Sit down with pencil and paper and work over the assignment. Analyze it, break it down into steps. Solve each of the steps **your** way, don't even think about programming at that stage. Track the steps. Once you have a working solution, test it. Then, when the solution is confirmed, start *implementing* it in code. Ideally, when you've done the breakdown right, the code should come naturally. Use whatever you can think of: bulleted lists, flow charts, pseudo code, anything to write down what the program has to perform.\n\nCode is the end, not the beginning. Analysis, breaking down, planning, solving are the beginning. Code comes later.\n\nJust *reading* completed code will not help you building the ability to solve problems. Reading code is like looking at a complete car in order to learn to design a new car. You miss everything important: analysis, decisions, considerations, compromises. You might get an understanding of the *immediate* solution, but not the skills to apply this to even slightly different situations.\n\nBuild your own projects starting from something as small and simple as Tic-Tac-Toe and working your way gradually up to larger and more complex. Yes, this will take time, effort, determination, discipline, and patience, but that's the way to go. Not the easy road to use google, AI or tutorials for everything.\n\nProgramming is lifelong learning. It takes months to build up basic competence, years to obtain some proficiency and a lifetime for expertise.\n\n-----\n\nAbout your task:\n\n> i had to create a license plate checker which would output valid or invalid.\n\nWell, not much information you give here, but still:\n\nWhat do you need for your program?\n\n+ You need some form of getting the license plate - user input\n+ you need a place to store the license plate - variable\n+ There are some rules that you need to follow (which you haven't told - so, I'm blind guessing)\n   + most likely, you will need to extract each character from the license plate - you will need a way to split the entered data and a store for it - maybe an array - could just as well be that you only need to loop over each character\n   + you need to perform some action with the character - maybe some summing, multiplication, etc.\n   + At the end, you will get some checksum or some indication\n+ you will need to verify that indication (conditional)\n+ you need to output valid or invalid\n\nThat's the way to break down a problem. The more detailed you do it, the easier it will be to implement the code.\n\n-----\n\n\nI'll leave some comment from a [former, similar post](https://redd.it/1mhcd21) here:\n\nHonestly, most of it is down to practice. Use sites like [Exercism](https://exercism.org) for ample practice exercises.\n\nThere are several books commonly recommended:\n\n+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul\n+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas\n+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman\n+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles Petzold\n\nAnd finally, I'll leave some of my comments to previous, similar posts, as this is a very frequently discussed topic:\n\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j9ezmx/getting_better_at_coding/mhdna2e/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1iz7wv3/how_to_become_a_better_engineer/mf10qbg/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j3w7x9/how_to_actually_learn_problem_solving_skills/mg3q9ya/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ioehwa/struggling_to_put_together_my_own_code/mcirhxq/\n+ https://redd.it/1jyd36k",

These languages _will_ trick you into releasing vulnerable software.\n\nK&R should give you an okay, if outdated, concept of the core language.

If you read about [the semantics of a semaphore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_%28programming%29) you'll see that the behavior doesn't depend on what that initial value was. So at the implementation level, the current value is all that matters, and the OS doesn't even bother to remember the initial value.\n\nThe only purpose of the semaphore is to prevent the *current* value of the semaphore from going negative, by blocking when the value would otherwise drop below zero. Aside from that, it's up to the application programmer to decide what the semaphore's value \"means\" and to increment/decrement it correctly.\n\nSee, for instance, the \"producer-consumer\" example on the Wikipedia page I linked. In that example, you use two semaphores tracking two \"resources\": `fullCount` for the number of items in the queue, and `emptyCount` for the number of available slots in the queue. If the queue is initially empty, then the `fullCount` semaphore is initialized to zero, but its value can later increase when items are added to the queue. It doesn't make sense to limit the semaphore to its initial value, because it would prevent use cases like this.\n\nIf there is only a single resource being managed then it's up to the application to ensure that it never increments the semaphore above 1.",

It‚Äôs easy to look at it preventing off shoring to India, but in reality it prevents any work from outside the US on portions of the product that benefit the US. Imagine being a global company and saying that everyone working on the core backend has to be American or else you face a huge tax. Will companies give up their entire global engineering department, or just start shifting more work outside of the US?\n\nNot to mention I wonder how much of an impact it would have on remote work to prevent hiring people outside the country. An employer that‚Äôs remote first can get the best candidates not only in the US, but also places like Canada or the EU. If that‚Äôs just US, then remote work loses some of its benefits.\n\nFor off shoring in India, I don‚Äôt know that 25% is enough to matter. For the above scenarios, it‚Äôs too much to be practical.",

Let me just tell you how disheartening it is now that most of my simple ideas and projects are capable of being done by a prompt rather than the hours it takes to study, understand the material, research libraries and cross reference other methods in order to create some code. I fear that the kind of jobs I wanted to have won't exist by the time I get out there. I enjoy trucking but there is no industry that AI will not touch.  My employer has implemented a camera in our trucks that already use AI and it's capable of detecting our eye movement to know if we are distracted, drowsy, and tracks our following distance, speed, braking, turning and any other metric you could imagine to gauge the competency of a truck driver. Then gives us a score and compares us to other drivers in the fleet. I dislike it but it's the future. I hope you find the job you are looking for but this is the end of an era and the birth of something we cannot stop nor fathom the implications and what will be on the other side of this.

I'm not saying my kids are 100% the reason why I'm not getting any better and focusing 100% of my work time towards coding and my career in general and being able to do overtime as and when and taking time on the weekend to learn new skills etc.\n\nBut yeah, trying to do any professional job and improve in it whilst raising kids and trying to be a parent, a GOOD parent, whilst being there for sick kids and not being as work and feeling like you are letting the team down.  The fear of the online and offline world judging your every parenting skills and then having the fear of being lambasted because you make 1 mistake out of a million times when your kids usually don't \"misbehave\", its tough.\n\nAll I can say is, yes being a good developer who can code and everything is fantastic to have.  Have you had one to ones with your seniors or bosses recently? One thing that came out of a meeting I had with my boss, when I said I was shocked at how good the new hires were compared to me (3-4 yoe) and my boss remarked that if I felt that way, what the company saw was that I am a really good person to have in meetings, in projects, who could understand the scope needed for a project, who could bridge communication between stakeholders and developers, and people just felt knew that I was like a go to person when there was help needed etc.\n\nIf you can, do your best and find ways and opportunities to develop your coding skills.  Your soft skills from something as simple as communication between teams, don't neglect or underestimate these either, these can also help you stand out as a senior dev or higher",

        "body": "Some companies have a formal process to graduate engineers to senior and beyond as individual technical contributors. But I feel like many go based mostly on feel and perception. If you feel you are stuck and will have a hard time being thought of as senior by your peers because you can't keep up in architecture and design discussions that might hold you back and force you to job hunt.\n\nI agree you should talk to your manager and try to feel out how likely it is you can meet their expectations to stay on assuming you enjoy the work aside from the new hoops they want you to jump through.\n\nI saw some others suggested asking more questions to keep improving your skills. Many people are afraid to ask dumb questions too often as it can make you seem too dependent on the other engineers. But these days honestly you can try talking to an AI about technical details. Most software design and architecture is very well understood and the AI can easily walk you through design questions and help you understand any parts that don't make sense so the next time you have a discussion you are more clear about what is happening.\n\nJust a month back there was a discussion at work explaining a mesh network setup for one of our products. And my networking is super rusty. An hour conversation with the AI and I was following their mesh design much more clearly and asking their team good questions, not the dumb ones where I was unaware of basics or some lingo. Most designs in software aren't super novel or deviant from knowledge the AI has.\n\nThe AIs can still lie so I do recommend double checking it's statements if you are going to put your reputation on the line defending a claim it made. But I feel like there has never been a better tool to help drill down on some \"dumb\" questions we all have.\n\nI will say I am generally perceived as very good at my job and I love software and design discussions. I am totally not immune to feeling stupid or inadequate. Especially on newer projects. Imposter syndrome creeps up on most people unless you have a godly ego. So it's hard to say how you feel really equals no hope of reaching senior in your current role. \n\n Also I don't do side projects. Clearly they are great if you can. But software is just a job and I love my kids more than I love my work. Most people I work with take this stance. I put in extra time to make sure stuff works during crunch time. And I do occasionally enjoy software arch videos on YouTube. But otherwise I enjoy my family and my personal free time. Don't let people make you think you have to give up a decent work life balance.",

It's difficult to tell the difference between early career and experienced commenters, and good advice is often counter intuitive. \n\nThere are two pieces of bad advice I am constantly trying to correct. First is learning more skills won't lead you to being overworked. People complain about the rising popularity of full stack development. They say they refuse to learn frontend or backend because that will just lead to your employer expecting you to do two jobs. That's not true. Learning more skills will make you more efficient at your job, saving you time. It will also make you more competitive on the job market, meaning it will be easier for you to find a job with good WLB. There's more than enough dedicated frontend or backend work. If an employer is going to overwork you, they're going to do it regardless if you know full stack or not.\n\nSecond is becoming more senior destroys your WLB. That's again not true. The things that destroy your WLB are getting a senior title before your ready and getting a senior title at a mismanaged company. Some people get thrust into a tech lead role 3 years into their career. These people are usually stressed AF because they don't have the experience to do it effectively, and the fact that they were promoted means the average level of experience is lower then theirs. That means they're going to be even more stressed trying to bail out all of the people on their team, because they also don't have the experience to do their jobs effectively. Don't try to avoid promotions. Avoid premature promotions and take on a senior/tech lead title when you feel comfortable you can do the job in <40 hours per week.",

Keep in mind that my answers are going to be based on visas from a company that does follow the spirit and letter of the law.\n\n  \nThere is not a direct pay gap between H1bs and regular employees who are hired at the same level of experience. However, H1bs have much less _leverage_ to negotiate their position particularly as the years go by. This doesn't necessarily lead to them getting underpaid relative to other employees, but it means that they're more likely to accept worse conditions or volunteer (or be voluntold) for work that they might not have to. This is especially bad for people who have to wait a long time to get a green card.\n\nAdditionally, if you've worked in tech for a while, you'll know that usually the best way to increase your salary is to job hop, and staying at the same company is not typically rewarded- I will get a 7% payrise this year, but I know that if I could switch to another company I'd likely get a 20-30% payrise. It's harder to switch companies as a H1b, so their wages will grow slower than peers in their industry.\n\nCompanies are required to go through certain steps in order to sponsor a H1b to prevent harming the local economy that a worker is being hired into, the LCA. The LCA effectively requires paying the potential employee the higher of the prevailing wage for the area for the job of that employee, or what that employer would pay other employees with similar experience. \n\nSome H1bs do get paid less (but not where I work) because they are a H1b. There are some companies out there that essentially offer you relocation to the US as a job perk and may not pay you well - WITCH companies, mostly. These companies don't have much interest in fair working conditions and will offer relocation to the US to people who I would consider vulnerable, mostly Indians, and will preferentially hire Indians, especially from similar castes as the hiring manager.\n\nAnd, obviously, when you have more people competing for the same position that nominally drives down wages. However, the companies that abuse this system - WITCH companies, again - never intended to hire an American to do the job. An American job is not being displaced by a WITCH company hiring an Indian (although it _is_ still abuse of the H1b system).\n\nSimplistic gut-feeling analyses on \"increasing supply\" affecting wages fall short because they don't take into account a whole bunch of things, not least that a more productive economy with more workers generally leads to more job opportunities in the economy as a whole. As an extremely simplified example, a software shop being set up in a city might prompt a starbucks branch being built nearby to capture the market of higher paid engineers, that might otherwise not exist, which means that the hiring of some engineers (of which some might be H1bs) leads to more tax revenue for the locality as well as more job opportunities, just not _the same_ job opportunities. This is why, in general, immigration is viewed as a positive for the economy",

So imo it's more a self-selection thing--H1B holders are more willing to accept worse jobs that pay less. But if an American wanted to, they can have that kind of job too.",

It was a long time ago, when there was a huge backlog for all countries, not just India and China. \n\nSo after my green card arrived, i started being able to climb the ladder towards top companies 1-2 years at a time, getting significant raises every time. I was making double in 4 years.\n\nAlso note that when you are applying for permanent residency, you get labor certification for a certain job description. Moving that job description upwards is kind of risky, as you would not be doing the task you got the certification for. So it might slow down your growth anyway.\n\nNone of this would actually be relevant if the path from H1B to permanent residency was remotely reasonable.

This isn't a big deal if you're actually an expert with in demand skills because there will likely be other openings. However, if you're just a general software engineer in the current job market, you're going to work more hours or take on extra responsibility to avoid having a 60 day count down to going home.\n\nThe whole premise of the H1B program is to help with situations where we don't have enough qualified people to fill a certain role. When it's used in those situations, it doesn't hurt anybody because H1B holders have enough career mobility to avoid getting underpaid or overworked and US residents won't get pushed out because visa holders are filling a gap, not competing with US workers. If we grant 2000 H1B visas to MDs who want to work in the US, that's fine because we have a shortage of doctors and those visas will benefit the H1B workers without negatively impacting US workers. If we grant 40000 H1B visas to entry level tech workers, which already face high unemployment rates, that not only goes against the goals of the H1B program, it makes the job market worse for all workers involved. Some H1B holders will earn less, some H1B holders will be forced to work under unfair conditions to keep their visa status, supply will exceed demand causing wages to drop, and US workers will have to either accept the unfair conditions or get replaced by an H1B holder who will.\n\nUnder paying H1B visa holders happens at some consulting companies, but even at companies that pay them the same wage as US workers, it's a problem when the system is abused.",

I‚Äôve grieved the career, considered leaving it repeatedly, panic applied to dozens of jobs from many different industries, considered sizable pay cuts, schooling, etc. I have found new success ( we will see how long it lasts though ‚Ä¶) with the following thoughts and plans\n\nI objectively cannot make this much money doing anything else in a different field, or if I could there would be at least a few years of building up. I lack formal education and am in a rural LCOL area. \n\nEspecially reading this sub I have developed even more extreme imposter syndrome and anxiety about losing the job and never finding another tech job bc of competition and industry trends. who knows I could get exited from the industry before I‚Äôm fully ready to leave anyway, so I need prepare and plan accordingly\n\nI have personal traits that lead me to burn out, and that‚Äôs in any job I will ever have so I need to address that if I‚Äôm going to last doing anything. \n\nMy current plan is to stick it out another 7-10 years in tech. If I can do that, without lifestyle creep, I will pay my house off and be 100% debt free and will have been able to sock away a decent bit of cash toward retirement and toward investments I could potentially draw some interest off of. THEN, I can work literally whatever job I want. I will need to bring in some nominal standard income but I could certainly stand to lose my tech level wage. It‚Äôs the plan that feels most plausible and future proof both from an industry perspective and just how long I can put up with this career field. Im pretty tired of it \n\nMy advice to fellow burnouts, make a goal and an exit plan. Having the goal for me has been extremely motivating in the short term, and you can always continue working in it after if you have a change of heart. Just know if you exit, weigh the re-entry cost if you think it‚Äôs at ALL possible you‚Äôd ever want to come back.",

I typically work about 50 hours a week, have ownership in something I believe in, and still have plenty of time to raid on FF14, play tennis, or read. \n\nHowever, many of the people I know in tech also seem happy, and I caution people in the field against assuming the grass will always be greener on the other side. For example, a lot of the complaints people on this Reddit often echo‚Äîannoying/incompetent managers, unreasonable deadlines, leadership with no vision, etc.‚Äîare present in virtually every industry; I got lucky with the partners and senior associated I worked under in law, but others at my law firm would routinely get screamed at by partners for minor issues.",

Even before AI students frequently skimmed material just to limp through the questions, or copied off of classmates blatantly, or got so much help from a classmate that they barely learned the material themselves.

Almost every major fintech has an office here and its the 2nd largest tech hub. It also is the largeast finance hub.  Also NYC the sky is the limit so you can really use this as an oppurtunity to spring board.\n\nIts  very likely you will be making double to tripple what you are currently making within 5 to 8 years.\n\nWhat life style is like in NYC at that salary? 120k in NYC is around  a 6500 month net salary (due to city taxes).\n\n1. If you want to live somewhere fun for singles in their 20s, you would need to eitehr pick between living alone, living somewhere nice with roomates. You'd qualify a miximum of 3k a budget rent and at that price you can live alone. But you have to choose between  living in a nice apartment in jersey/outer areas or in a pre-war shoe box in the nice trendy neighborhood. Nice in NYC is 'mid' in other cities. Its usually means you have a building with some amenities like laundry room or laundry in unit (rarer) and a dishwasher. NYC is a story of under consturction. Most apartments here are 100 years old (prewar) and lack modern conveniences like laundry, dishwasher and central AC. I picked the shoe box, its more fun to be in a good neighborhood if you like to go out and party.\n2. A lot of people your age would choose to live with roomates in order to be  in a nicer apartment in a good location. Generally apartments are a lot mroe cost effective in a 4 bed 2 bath or 3 bed 1 bath situation. If a studio in an apartment building is renting for 4000$, there is a good chance the 3 bed is only 8000$ and the 4 bed is 10,000$. So a very common strategy for young professionals is to just have roomates to live in a nicer apartment in a fun location.\n3. You can afford to live alone and somewher nice, but it would generally be in outer neighborhoods that are either gentrifying or in places like jersey city, a part of New Jersey that is connected by Manhattan via a subway called path.\n\nThe biggest cost in NYC is rent.  Almost all of the cost of living is real estate. That effects things like entertainment and other stuff, because bars/coffee shops/ restaurants and gyms are paying even more per sq feet than you are. But outside of that the cost is the same its not like Amazon charges more here when they are deliving goods to you. Groceries can be all over the map, but trader joes generally is cost effective as they use national price\n\nTo give oyu some idea what prices are like.  Manhattan (you can take off 20 percent for other areas\n\n1. Hair cuts 40 to 75$\n2. Gym depends on which but 50 to 300$. 125 would be mid-tier\n3. Fast Casual lunch  15 to 20$\n4. Street food from a take out only operation  8 to 12$.\n5. Specialty  Coffee from a cafe   (6$ - 7$ before tax)\n6. Dinner at sit down casual restaurant with a waiter  40 to 80$ per person.  You can easily spend 150$ per person at more upscale. This is assuming no alcohol.\n7. Alcohol  6 to 10$ for beer, 10-20$ for wine, 16 to 25$ cocktails. Non-alcoholic options will be offered at most bars.  NYC has a BIG drinking culture. Tech community in particular has a lot of happy hour networking and social events that they host through apps like Luma, Posh VIP, Super Momos, Partiful. So even if you don't drink a whole lot, its in your interest to go to bars and get some non-alocholic drinks.\n8. Ubers 20$ per mile in Manhattan south of 96th street,  10$ per mile in Brooklyn/Queens/Bronx without manhattan entry.\n\nThe other thing thats nice about NYC, because the city is so expensive you won't have pressure to be extravagent which happens in middle cost of living cities. This is a place where people who make 300k a year might live like college students and no one would bat an eye.\n\nTLDR: 120k is a great salary for someone your age in NYC in the fin-tech space. You will ahve enough money to go out quite a bit, save adequately for retirment and you can essentially pick  where you want to live. It is a place where you will need to budget some and not be extravagent, but you can enjoy some luxuries. From a career perspective its also great, the only city that is better for Tech is SF and NYC is good at multiple industries. Fin-Tech space there is always the option of just transitioning into tech roles in finance and NYC is the capital of finance. You can basically live your best life.",

Obviously as a SWE, you deal with all those on a daily basis, but confidently answering 101 + 201 questions are very important in setting the tone for the interview.\n\n  \nwent through my resume bullet points and wrote down about 2 pages per bullet point going deeper in to depth, answering questions like \"how was this metric you put defined?\" \"go a little deeper in the hardest parts of this problem\" \"give a 30 second pitch on how it was implemented\" etc.\n\n  \nHad 1 page written per sample behavior question - \"how do you handle technical disputes - any examples?\" \"how do you normally approach a new technology\". Stuff like that -- not to memorize, just to kind of find the rhythm of your own answer.\n\n  \nFind something non-work related but technical and have it in your back pocket for when someone asks \"and how do you stay on top of technical trends?\" - i found in my interview process there is a big difference between \"I try to find ways to learn on the job\" and \"yeah I'm interested in learning about WASM, I have a couple of data-visualization projects I mess around with when I have time, etc\" and have actually put a few hours in to so you have made at least 1 technical decision you can talk about on it. It doesn't have to be something crazy - just something that shows you aren't a \"in tech for the paycheck\" type of person (which I personally find completely acceptable - but some hiring managers don't)\n\n  \nI have found in my experience that, at least at this midlevel in career, most interviews are just a \"remix\" of stuff you've done in the past -- there is probably enough stuff in your career to mine for experience to be able to handle a system design interview without too much prep -- you just have to sit down before hand and think about all the problems you have done from a bunch of different angles.",

I did not really practice LC - I did a few problems for fun, but in no way would I consider would I did \"grinding\", nor did I make any attempt to memorize the solutions. The 3 LC interviews that I did get were all mediums where I was able to work out non-optimal but reasonable solutions, and I passed the interviews despite my non-optimal solutions.\n\nProbably worth mentioning that the non-LC coding interviews I received by and large still required a strong grasp of CS fundamentals like recursion and proper use of data structures. So if you're not solid with that kind of thing, then practicing LC may still help. I would also not say that the non-LC coding interviews are necessarily easier than LC - just that their difficulty is more about turning complex requirements into code than about figuring out \"this one neat trick\", which I do think is a more fair type of difficulty and more reflective of job skills. Also I did not interview with any FAANG companies, and I think they are more notorious for having LC interviews.\n\nThe vast majority of my interview prep time was spent on practicing systems design and fleshing out my behavioral interview stories, and personally I thought that was a much better use of my time than grinding LC (as a senior candidate).",

It's what I want for myself too.\n\nBut I don't want to be obsessed with always having to live larger. I'm at 1 YoE and had to resign at my past job ($78k/yr salary) and just landed an offer with a $95k/yr salary not counting bonuses and whatnot.\n\nAnd I'm really happy about it, I'm in Chicago and I can make that money go far. I don't need (or want) to live in a big, spacious, luxurious condo, I'd be comfortable and content in a 1br place that's in a location I really like.\n\nI do expect to make more at each successive job in my future but I don't have a target in mind for salary, I just want an opportunity that'll let me live comfortably in a place I really like and enjoy all that with a good work life balance.\n\nI'm 25, and I get that in this job market you have to work a lot harder even during your undergrad. I worked hard for my internships and all the work I did afterward to get to where I am, but I don't want to dedicate my entire life to just working and grinding. I already worked hard enough to land these jobs and internships.\n\nYouth is a short, fleeting, temporary thing and I don't want to spend all my youth obsessively grinding in pursuit of the prospect of wealth, luxury, and prestige. I just want to live a happy, comfortable life with a job that allows me to do that.\n\nThere's so much more to life than just wealth, prestige, and grinding. Live comfortably.",

Are you expecting them to be around to have lots of time to talk with you? Assign you tasks first-hand? Daily interactions? Answer your questions about the business? Stuff like that?\n\nI'm pretty self-reliant, I don't need my manager around for that kind of stuff. I can figure out business logic on my own, I can talk to other engineers, I've always worked at places that had good processes in-place so asking my manager for a Jira ticket would be unheard of.\n\nWhat I expect from my managers is to handle politics, handle cross-team dependencies/conversations, planning, negotiating between product and engineering, etc. I want them operating at a level above me, above the individual. They're there to protect us from external stakeholders, and unblock us from external dependencies.\n\nSo that's why I'm curious what exactly you mean by \"ghost manager\". If I don't *see* or *speak* to my manager in weeks, not a big deal. They're still doing the job I expect of them behind the scenes. But if they're literally doing nothing for several weeks, that's another story entirely.\n\nI'd still much rather have that than a micromanager though. A Senior / Staff / Architect can step up to cover that kind of a role in the event of an absent manager. Otherwise your team's at risk of the Mack Truck Theory. You don't want the absence of a single person to bring your whole team to a grinding halt.",

In other words, this isn‚Äôt random. Take the 15 minutes.\n\nIt‚Äôs also important to clear up a common misconception: a job being posted on a careers site does not *always* mean it‚Äôs actively open for hire. Likewise, a role can be open and available to fill even if it isn‚Äôt posted publicly.\n\nThink of a job posting like a flyer on a bulletin board. If someone was already hired but the recruiter forgot to take the flyer down, it can look like ‚Äúthere was never a real job.‚Äù \n\nOn the flip side, if the recruiter is hiring but chooses not to hang a flyer, it doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt hiring‚Äîit just means the posting isn‚Äôt public. \n\nWhat truly matters is whether the *requisition* is open and approved as a **headcount**. That‚Äôs what determines if someone can be hired.\n\nP.S. Internal recruiters for Microsoft are not paid on commission. They are salaried full time employees, or hourly contractors.

I wasn't thinking about the money.\n\nOne big difference about my approach, and the approach I see a lot of people on this subreddit taking is I chose the degree *first*, not my job.\n\nA lot of people here decide they want to be a SWE first, and then work backwards to a CS degree. This hyper-focuses their career path and job search, which can make it significantly more difficult. Especially early career where they may not land their ideal role right away, and because they worked backwards from their ideal role, they view it as a failure and get depressed, and give up.\n\nWhereas with me, I would've been happy with *any* job remotely in technology. I would've been *totally fine* with help desk. When I was in college I was applying to every internship under the sun. IT, Help Desk, PM, SysAdmin, QA, whatever. If it was tech-related, I applied. Since I didn't have tunnel-vision on any specific role, this gave me flexibility. I couldn't get a SWE internship after my sophomore year, but I did get an offer for a PM internship. As a new grad, I only had 1 SWE offer, and that came pretty late. But I *did* have backups. A return offer from my PM internship, other IT offers, etc. If that late SWE offer never came, I was totally prepared to take one of those other offers, and been completely content with it. I got my CS degree, and I got a job out of it. Goal met. It's much easier to meet a goal like that than it is \"SWE at FAANG\".",

I don't really consider Chicago to be much of a tech city. If it was, housing would be considerably more expensive. Most of the tech work in the area is tied to finance, consulting, pharma and other corporate flavors. While some tech companies have a presence, it's noticeably smaller. \n\nA 1.5 hour commute will be brutal. \n\nI worked at a company that did consulting work for Grainger, but I never worked on a project for them. I got the impression their tech was kind of weak. A lot of other companies in that area (far north suburbs, I believe) are dominated by Indian dev teams and management - both local and offshore. The horror stories you read on this sub where an Indian manager comes in and the entire tech team becomes Indian is a big problem with a lot of companies in that area. I can't speak to Grainger, specifically, so you should ask around and try to find more info. I suppose the possibilities of this will be pretty high at Visa, too.",

They do this because SWE roles usually impact the whole product, and they want to lower the risk of a bad hire. The downside is it makes the process exhausting and slow for candidates even when you‚Äôre already experienced. For UI/UX, employers judge more by portfolios and past projects. If someone can show 10 years of design work, it‚Äôs easier for hiring managers to quickly see their value. Their work speaks for itself, and companies don‚Äôt always add as many hoops for design roles. \n\nIt‚Äôs not really that one career is easier than the other, it‚Äôs just that the hiring culture is different. SWE interviews have become standardized around heavy testing, and design and other fields lean more on proof of work and interviews that focus on collaboration and problem solving.",

I never felt that LC was a great indicator of on the job performance more than it was an indicator of who was willing to grind problems and memorize how they were solved. \n\nThat being said, I‚Äôd always make sure that you have strong fundamentals.

After 8 years, I don‚Äôt feel like it matters nearly as much. \n\nThere‚Äôs definitely still jobs that won‚Äôt even look at my resume without an advanced degree. But tbh, those jobs probably still wouldn‚Äôt look at me with a Masters, they pay super well and can afford to hire just PhD‚Äôs.\n\nI think if you want to get into management or entrepreneurship, something like an MBA at a good school where you can network with people who have similar goals or mindsets could be worth it. But if you still want to be on the technical path, Idk I just feel like the time and money you‚Äôd have to spend getting the Masters could be spent doing other stuff that might have a bigger impact on career trajectory. Like, for maybe 1/10th the time and money, could you make a point of going to 1 or 2 meetups or conferences related to the jobs you want, and just aggressively network, and get to know everyone in the field so when opportunities pop up, you‚Äôll know people who can help you get those jobs/opportunities?\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention, I think the AI wave/hype is largely dying out.

They can even say \"Great!\" and not be lying, because what a \"Good WLB\" is is very subjective. They may genuinely think their WLB is great because they only have you working 60 hours instead of 80.\n\nSo instead, ask them about stories. In the exact same way they use \"tell me about a time when...\" questions on *you* to gain insight into *you* as opposed to directly asking. \"When was the last time the team was missing a deadline, and how was that handled?\", \"How are deadlines decided, and who decides on them?\", \"When do most people generally come in/leave for the day?\", \"When's the last time the team got an after hours support call and how was that handled?\", \"What's considered 'crunch time', and how often is the team doing that?\", \"What are your expectations of \\[role\\]?\", etc, etc.\n\nThere are many, many different answers to those questions. It's up to you to decide if you think their answer demonstrates the kind of WLB/culture you're willing to join.\n\nIf from any of the questions it sounds like this is a \"work hard play hard\" team, you reject them.\n\nI've worked for 2 startups, and they had amazing WLB's.

Say, you get an increase becase of an external job offer. How will the company trust you are not going to look again externally to use as leverage? it just doesn't look good on you and doesn't scale.\n\n2. Your manager's reasoning for lack of promotion *\"it just doesn't happen after 1 year\"* is very poor. Each individual performs uniquely. They have to advocate for you when trying to promote you, so if their logic just falls into \"it's not usually how it's done here\", there's no spine. What could you have done better? What's the company state wrt promotions right now? Is there something you're missing? That would be helpful feedback. FYI, sure you need a great relationship with your manager, but also consider skip manager, you want leadership visibility and to have them on your side.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea to \"negotiate\" annual rise. If your goal is to get promoted, you need to hunt it down, advocate for your, and convince with results to leadership/team that you deserve it. If your goal is salary increase, jump to another company.",

Your brain is not as \"plastic\" as it once was, so you will need time to get this stuff locked in (and that is OK).\n\nThe way I'd go about it is to seriously try the Leetcode Easy. Why Easy? Because a lot of the Mediums are generalizations of Easy problems, and the Easy problems give you a good foundation of key techniques.\n\nOnce you find a solution to an Easy, take around 10-15 minutes and think if you can find a faster solution. On Leetcode it is usually to tell if there is a faster solution by the speed/memory distribution.\n\nOnce you get the hang of Easys, then start doing Mediums that are semi-related to the Easys you've done. (For example, if you did an Easy in strings, do some Mediums in strings. If you did Easies in arrays, do some Mediums in arrays.) Your mind will be somewhat attuned to possible patterns and techniques.\n\nWRT AI... please don't. People will find out. If they don't find out then, they will find out at the interview when they make you code in front of them. And once recruiters find out, they tell other recruiters privately that this candidate used AI. Even if you somehow make it, you'll be miserable. You will have a case of impostor syndrome that you've never believed can exist. You will know inside that you're way above where you are, because the work will be assigned based on the AI version of you, not you. And if you think you can use AI at work... sure, I'm sure people will not mind as much, but you will NOT be happy in that role.\n\nEDIT: A lot of ppl have some flavor of what I said. I wanted to add. Please make sure you know basic Data structures (Arrays, Lists, Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks, Hash tables) and Algorithms (Sorting, Binary search, divide and conquer, BFS, DFS, Binary Search Trees and Tree Traversals, etc).",

Stop testing yourself on stuff you haven't practiced yet.\n\nLearn the concepts and ideas behind \"algorithms and data structures\". Actually make sure you understand what it is about, how things work in principle. Then start practicing. Do not try to solve as many questions as you can, but look at a question, understand it, and work your way not just to a solution, but to understanding what it does, and why, and how, and explain why that is better than sub-optimal alternatives.\n\nOnce you're good at that, you should have very few problems with leetcode anymore.\n\nThere are problems that you'll absolutely have to memorize. Dijkstra's algorithm is named after the dude because it is nothing short of brilliant. I know I am not that clever, so I won't come up with that solution to that problem. but i don't have to memorize how to scan an array for the largest value, because I actually understand what is going on, any way,  and can rebuild the solution when it is needed.\n\n\\*: Fun fact, chicken sexing is one weird exception that nobody has an explanation for yet. But, without doing any research, I suppose that is by design. There's money to be made from keeping the knowledge secret and mysterious....",

Practice explaining your reasoning even when you're unsure, because interviewers want to see how you think through problems, not just whether you get the perfect answer.

Business Analyst / Product Analyst is a great fit if you enjoy breaking down processes and making things more efficient. With data Analysis / data Strategy you don‚Äôt have to be a hardcore data scientist. Analysts use tools like SQL, Excel, and visualization software, which are less about coding and more about insights. Since you already touched enterprise architecture / IT strategy role a bit, this could be a way to stay close to tech decisions without being the one coding. Cybersecurity / Cloud Operations has lots of problem solving, and you can pick areas that don‚Äôt require daily coding.

        "body": "It takes as long as it takes. Some folks land another job fairly quickly, others it'll take months.\n\nThe biggest thing you're up against at the moment is the calendar. Lots of places slow down hiring as the year draws to a close. I was laid off in mid-October last year and told my wife if I didn't land something by Thanksgiving then it likely dry up until mid- to late January. Fortunately I landed something in November.\n\nIt sucks losing your job, and if I recall from your previous post this is your first time going through this. I experienced being laid off at my first job after graduating, only being there about six months. Felt like an absolute failure, especially to my parents because I was still living at home. They were very understanding and mainly just felt bad for me, but we're happy to let me live with them as long as I was hunting for another job. Lots of folks will be more understanding than you realize, and for the ones who don't or seem to pull away I'd say you'll learn the \"value\" of those relationships.\n\nThe best advice I can give you would be:\n\n1) Realize it's very likely not your fault and simply a business decision. This is not a reflection on you as a person or on your skills as much as you may think it is. You now know that most employers don't really value you or others as much as you may have thought.\n\n2) If there are local user groups for your field of study, attend those and network as much as possible. I've been able to keep my recent stints with layoffs fairly short due to the network I've built over the years. Talking with folks and getting their help in applying for open positions is gonna do more for you than online submissions where you're a name among hundreds or thousands of others. I landed my current position by going to a local user group and connecting with a staff engineer of the company hosting it, who was willing to submit my resume directly to HR for an open position.\n\n3) In the current market, you may need to be more open to both returning to an office to work and even taking short term contract gigs. Fully in office positions will likely have fewer applicants compared to hybrid, and both will have fewer applicants compared to fully remote. Taking contract work can also be an option, as most times those interview loops are one or two rounds and often not that involved. Part of this is because they can cut you loose at any moment and owe you nothing, because you likely won't have paid time off (you can take time off, just not paid). Benefits, if offered, can usually be stupid expensive depending on your needs, but contract work will almost always pay far better than unemployment, and keeps long gaps off your resume. It may lead to a permanent position, and if not then at least you avoid dipping into your savings for a while. You can absolutely keep interviewing for better gigs in the meantime.\n\n4) If needed, take part-time work somewhere or work in something adjacent to your field of study if possible. I floated by on support and sys admin type roles for about three years, from 2009 to 2012, because I was a new grad with minimal experience losing out on jobs to folks who had that experience. I managed to stay close to the industry and make decent money from it while waiting for my time to get back into SWE jobs in full.\n\nI get it man, losing a job sucks and is a big hit to your mental. Know that you're not the first to experience this, you won't be the last, and this may not be your last time experiencing it. There's gonna be aspects of paranoia about it happening again going forward and you just gotta learn how to deal with it. The best way to deal with it is to build both a solid amount of savings, along with a solid network of folks you can reach out to if it ever happens again.\n\nYou'll get through this, and you'll be stronger for it.",

Employers in tech and finance especially recognize it. Since it already has stats and machine learning modules, it gives you a good mix of theory and practical skills that you could apply to data science later. The downside is that you might feel like you‚Äôre spending a lot of time on modules you‚Äôre not passionate about if they aren‚Äôt data focused.\n\nThe Statistics & Data Science MSc is more specialized. It shows that you‚Äôre committed to a career in data and analytics. This can help you stand out if you‚Äôre going straight for data scientist, data analyst, or data consultant roles. But data science is competitive as many people enter with a PhD or years of experience. So, with just a master‚Äôs, you‚Äôd want to build a strong portfolio of projects, maybe internships, and show you can apply your learning to real world problems.\n\nIf you want maximum flexibility and aren‚Äôt 100% sure whether you‚Äôll go into pure data or something adjacent, stick with Computer Science. If you‚Äôre confident you want data focused roles and want your degree title to reflect that directly, then go with Statistics & Data Science. Since you‚Äôre also open to more human facing roles like data consultant, either degree could work. Employers will usually care less about the exact title and more about your ability to explain data clearly, work with stakeholders, and use tools like Python, SQL, and visualization platforms.

Also, maybe they're just not asking publicly? Maybe they talk with somebody else directly? \n- Why wouldn't it be sincere? Why are you supposing \"ill intent\" from them? They're your team",

A 12 YOE SWE needing considerable help in their first 6 months is different than a 12 YOE SWE needing considerable help after working at the same company for 2 years.\n\nDo you have standups where you give status updates? Or something similar? What kind of status updates are you giving?\n\nIf someone's *asking* me for my status, whether that be asking me if I'm done yet, or if I need help, or if I'm killing it, or if I'm stuck, or if the deadline is still on target, etc.... that's a failure of communication on my part. People shouldn't need to pull my status out of me.\n\nIf my task is dragging on for one reason or another, I don't necessarily need help, but that is something I'll communicate to the team so they can react accordingly. Sometimes a delayed ticket can have a ripple affect and threaten bigger deadlines. And if I do need help, I don't hesitate to ask. 12 YOE here as well. I ask from time to time, but when I'm past the 6 month mark at a company, I don't generally need much help, but I'm also not dragging tickets.\n\nBut if you *need* help, *ask for it*. Just letting tickets blow through important deadlines because you don't think you're \"supposed\" to ask for help isn't a great option.\\[\n\nAnd how do you know people aren't asking for help? Are you micromanaging every interaction between every other person on your team? Maybe they're just used to going to someone else.",

Reddit is a terrible source of what you really need - therapy.\n\nLook, there's a few problematic themes already common throughout all of your posts. You wonder why your coworkers aren't direct with you, you are always paranoid that they're trying to sabotage your career behind your back, and you seem to be afraid of potential confrontations about your performance.

Even if we validate your paranoia and anxieties, is it really productive for you?\n\nI say this in the kindest and most direct way possible - you need professional help and you need to stick with it.

If employer is paying for then still fine, is an accomplishment you can list on a resume. But they're not paying so you better pass.\n\n>Are more AWS certs or other certs worth it?\n\nNo. I almost say AWS is worthless but I worked at a company that liked seeing AWS Associate. I didn't have it or any AWS experience and was hired since I used Azure at my last job. The cloud certs are the only ones I ever see and only about 10% of the time. Less relevant for that 10% if the company uses 1 of the other 2. So you see, low value but not zero.\n\nRest of certs are scams.\n\n*How do you stand out more after graduating?*\n\n1. Work experience. Nice if the job is a similar industry. List technology you used on the job because no one wants to train you. Make the hiring manage believe you can make significant contributions with minimal training. Easy to get the chance if they like you resume.\n2. Greater than 1 YoE, resume can be 1 or 2 pages, or 1.5 is okay white space kind of looks bad. Use a big font if 2 pages. Honestly, big font is underrated. Eye tracking surveys you can search for show HR reads you resume for less than 8 seconds. Don't make it an adjective fiesta. I list the tech stacks both in the job descriptions and in a separate section at the bottom for ease of reading.\n3. A select few companies like seeing community involvement such as volunteering. Can attend young professionals events and maybe make friends at companies that are hiring. Adult kickball leagues, I know multiple married couples that met on teams.\n4. Sounds obvious but be within driving distance of the office. I don't list my full address, just City, State, Zipcode. Remote jobs all well and good but those get the most applicants. Almost every company I know went back to 3-4 days in the office.\n\n>still managed to hit \\~120 applications. No job still.\n\nIn 4 months, that is slack. 10 applications a day = 300 a month is still slack. You have no idea how overcrowded CS is. Pick it up.",
