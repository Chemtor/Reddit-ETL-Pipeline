Yet, none of them really solve the core data issues like nulls, duplicates, redundancy and many more. The simple and old school style of sql, bash scripts and crontab jobs can do much more than fancy tools. \n\nIt makes feel like we all should go back to roots using pure sql for most part for pipelines processing and maybe little bit of Python here and there. I hate how much noise Databricks makes using the term, \"medallion architecture\", which already been in practice for more than 3 decades even in traditional warehouse environments. They just used fancy marketing tactics to sell their product. ",

Namely, in the same order as the diagram: \n\n- big data specialist\n- DWH specialist\n- data analyst\n- data engineer\n- database professional\n- BI analyst\n\nThe fact that big data specialist comes before DE, although a DE is in general considered a big data specialist, may just show how the DE title still lacks recognition.  \n\nAt the opposite, surprisingly DA and DS are put together whereas there could be a giant gap of skills between an SQL DA and a DS expert in ML. \n\nOverall, I feel this study or this result is too unclear to draw much conclusion.",

Even more interestingly since it’s “in process” it has full access to the memory space of the process.

So will behave differently. \n\nMsSql can do both, even within an OLTP database with an index of type clustered column store. \n\nDuckDB being a column based storage database. \n\nBuild an on-prem VM or cloud VM, for a Snowflake-like DB with it, for 0$ monthly usage fees. Speed will be whatever power that VM has for I/O and CPUs. Just follow a white paper.\n\nSome companies don’t need to pay for Snowflake at all, DuckDB will suffice.",

The oldest dude on the call from our side was the CFO at 33, so we had *no* idea how to evaluate what we were looking at.\n\nIt was pretty dang close to the pitch that the Databricks folks gave us, but with a heavy helping of “We partner with <XYZ security agency>” and “We serve X% of the Fortune 50/100/500 firms”, and an even bigger helping of jargon. My manager then was a profoundly inept MBA who got pawned off on the burgeoning data team after one too many fuckups on the finance team, so he was a big sucker for the jargon that MBAs like.\n\nOne thing that I missed at the time, and only realized years later, was that they never even showed us images of the interface. The Databricks, Fivetran, and Snowflake folks all at least showed us their interface. The Snowflake folks even fired up a test environment to show off, too. ",

The promise that knowledge gained by doing this will give them an edge in the market. Faster results. Faster internal solutions. While your competitors are waiting for legal, compliance and governance to approve a new app idea, onboard the developers to the 6 different platforms they need access to your team has spun up a workshop in a day because they know where the data is at… in the ontology. \n\nAgain this is the promise. GCP, AWS, AZURE don’t have a unified messaging like this. The simply exist and you can build what you need. Not as ‘sexy’. They built an abstraction layer they control between the platform that can be overwhelming and the employees that interact with it every day. They are apple of platforms. Yea with an android I can jailbreak and do whatever I want. Chain 100 together make a server. Cool. Can’t do as much with an iPhone but they sell a feeling. Simple. Don’t think about all that stuff.

Each team could create its own «Workspaces». I documented the whole thing on here: [https://kanton-bern.github.io/hellodata-be/concepts/workspaces/](https://kanton-bern.github.io/hellodata-be/concepts/workspaces/), and we used it in an open-source data platform called [HelloDATA BE.](https://github.com/kanton-bern/hellodata-be) \n\nBut I'm curious how other organizations are doing this?

I knew I needed a repo for the IaC (AWS and Snowflake), pipelines (Meltano plus custom code pipelines), data models (dbt), orchestration (airflow), and some custom applications, I had different people working in different areas, and we didn't have a lot of time to agree on best practices for collaborative development - instead, I chose to have one, max two people work in each area (and thus repo), and we did ship fast. We were less dependent on each other, and if something blew up on our face, the repo separation contained the blast radius.\n\nAt the same time, we actually had some monorepo happening too. For the sake of fast shipping we opted to use Meltano to run Airflow and dbt. This meant those three ran off a monorepo, and it was indeed good at moving fast, but it also hit a scaling wall within 6 months of going production, since airflow had to run with only a single worker in this mode. We took Airflow and dbt out of the repo and into their own, and man, we paid a bit of a price - but it was worth the initial velocity.\n\nLooking back, it's almost like making the Conway's law work for you: we had a poor, immature organization communication structure in the data engineering team, so mirror that structure in multiple repos. If your team is collocated and cohesive, go reap the benefits of a monorepo. In this world of AI-augmented coding where context is everything, having a monorepo seems to enable that well: our dbt repo is monorepo, and it has such a rich context that many people in the company write analytic queries in Cursor with that repo open.",

It should, should, execute in the time, a full table scan completes, so on 500mm rows, maybe 5-10minutes, dont know the hardware setup.\n\nReasoning behind that statement :  \nVariable length string, that is just in the table meta data. Actual data is written to data pages. So EXPANING the length, should not cause a full page rewrite of a given page, since nothing needs to get rewritten. Already existing page splits, are not effected either, its already a pointer to another page.\n\nSo, it should be rather harmless, to change the variable length, as long as it gets increased. Decreasing the length, I'd be a bit more careful, but should functionally behave the same. Not having a clustered index... it should not affect that change, since if I know how mssql works internally, it will check every row, if it complies with \"new column meta data\", so a full read trough of the entire table. It doesn't matter in reality, if that table is a heap or a clustered index for a full scan.\n\nI'd say, plan for a couple of minutes of outage, and go for it. Take a full backup to a testing stage, run the change, to get a good idea of how long you got an outage. You will have a short outage, since you will have a full table lock, and any application trying to write to the table, will wait for that lock to be released. Depending on the isolation levels, you will have read queries do the same.\n\nTLDR:\n\nShouldn't be a big issue, should be 5-10 minutes of downtime.\n\n/edit: Its gonna be a schema lock, so whatever isolation level, read queries will be blocked as well.",

I lost my job during the pando, taught myself and have only ever wanted to DE seriously.\n\n>What would you *not* waste time on if you were starting today?\n\nThis pops up a lot and I honestly hate this question.  The idea of \"never wasting any time\" is akin to not enjoying anything.  Before you know it, you end up becoming a leetcode robot.  And, by the way, this is the perspective of somebody who was literally jobless and paying all living expenses for two people through rapidly dwindling savings so stakes were extremely high in my case.\n\nTo answer your question, if you want to not waste time, then learn concepts and only concepts.  Skip putting a lot of time into specific tools.  If you want to \"learn Airflow\", you're much better off understanding orchestration and building something with some kind of orchestration in it.  This is the equivalent of building a table instead of learning how to use a hammer.  If you can understand common problems and patterns with orchestration, all orchestrators have tons of overlap.  On the flip side, Airflow will have features not in ADF which may, or may not have features listed in \\[insert name of wanky orchestrator here\\].\n\nBuild projects and ignore everybody who says they don't matter because projects are a lot more about getting you in the right mindset and having something to talk about during the interview.\n\nGet off the internet and write code.  Do not follow influencers.  Do not track the state of the job market.  Do not give yourself space to fall into a negative mindset.  Code, learn, apply for jobs, have a break, repeat.\n\nAt the end of the day, there are a lot of DE jobs out there and even more people who just whine about the job market being hard.  If those people took the time they spent complaining and doomscrolling and applied it to learning, they might actually be on par with the people who just cracked on in the meanwhile.",

You are doing a Masters in CS - honestly you can pick up a lot of good skills towards DE by working first as a software engineer and working around data systems. People tend to get into DE either down a software engineering route and specialising in software or as a data analyst/scientist transitioning into more pipeline and modelling work.\n\nThe main obstacle I see to a new entrant into DE is just the breadth of technologies and tools out there, for mid level roles we can find candidates who have worked on our tech stack and junior jobs are incredibly competitive as its a hot job title right now. We are in the middle of hiring a DE and we had over 250 applications for one open position.\n\n  \nI've been doing DE for just over 3 years, after 5 years as a software eng after doing a PhD in Engineering. To answer your questions:\n\nHow early to start applying? If you are doing something super data based then maybe a year or two after starting your first position. This would allow you to get in and really get to know a specific database and understand how to operate in a development environment. If you're also doing personal development and learning on what you're interested in then it could work.\n\nAre certs worth it? I believe they can be useful for getting your baseline but they aren't something I have chased. I would very much do it on a case by case basis. If you start at an employer they might require you to get certain certifications and they would pay for them.\n\nWhat helped the most? I joined a team which was pretty small, mostly focused around data science. My programming skills were really solid but my database skills were not great. I was able to learn enough database work to get through the door and focused my effort on using software experience to really push standards in the team and improve confidence.\n\nWhat would I not waste time on? I don't know. I don't think doing the PhD was the best use of my time but I can't go back and change that so I'm happy enough with the result. DE wise, as I've specialised into data I already had a solid foundation. There are technologies and prototypes which were a waste of time but there isn't really anything I would regret.\n\nI appreciate this might not be the sort of feedback you were wanting to get, I am only one person and there are different thoughts around how easy it is to break into DE.

Use widgets and `dbutils.widgets.get()`.  \n• **CI/CD**: Databricks CLI or REST API + GitHub Actions (or Azure DevOps) work well. Keep tests fast—mock Spark contexts where needed.  \n• **Data**: Stick to Delta + Unity Catalog for governance/versioning. Partition smartly, coalesce when needed, avoid wide shuffles.  \n• **Learning**: If you're Python-first, Databricks Notebooks will feel natural. Check out Delta, Jobs, and Workflows early on.",

You’re not chasing prestige—you’re chasing consistency. Platforms like DataCamp have career tracks that walk you through Python, Airflow, Spark, dbt, cloud, and testing *with* hands-on projects baked in. That kind of setup might be just what you need.\n\n# What to focus on next:\n\nSounds like you’re solid on Python, Airflow basics, and batch stuff. If you want to move from “I adapt what’s already built” to “I build and improve,” aim for:\n\n* **Advanced Airflow** (custom operators, sensors, etc.)\n* **dbt** (great for modeling, testing, and habits that scale)\n* **CI/CD** (even lightweight GitHub Actions can go a long way)\n* **Cloud skills** (pick one—AWS, GCP, whatever your team might grow into)\n* **Streaming with Kafka** (even small local projects help)\n\n# Make it stick:\n\nIf you tend to fall off self-paced stuff (totally fair), give yourself some structure without burning out:\n\n* Pick one portfolio project and let that guide your learning.\n* Show up at the same time every day—even 30 mins counts.\n* Use tools that track streaks (DataCamp, GitHub commits).\n* Find a learning buddy or join a Discord to stay accountable.\n\n# Are certs worth it?\n\nOnly if they *help you finish*. If a nanodegree or structured program keeps you going, it’s 100% worth it. Just avoid collecting shiny badges without building anything. One finished track with a solid portfolio project beats 10 abandoned ones.",

Like data quality, governance, security, anonymization, masking, encrypting.\n\nMaybe try studying technologies used at your company, see what database options are there, do they use the cloud? They code in python or spark? Do they use dbt? Be curious! Maybe they even have a study path to get into the tech stack they handle. \n\nHope this is helpful :)",

That just means with ELT get the data loaded into the database before transforming it.

        "body": "ETL vs ELT is a form of shorthand.\nRather than neatly dividing data processing into two types; it encourages you to think about the steps.\n\nExtraction, is typically \"given\". You're generally bound by the transfer rates of the source and they provide the data in whatever format they choose. It's always going to come first.\n\nLoading, is a more variable step. You're still bound by the properties of the target storage. But since you choose what you're writing you have some more control of the process.\n\nTransformation is extremely variable. You usually have a lot of freedom in deciding how you transform the source data into target data. That includes breaking up the transformation into multiple steps.\n\nMoving from ETL to ELT is more about breaking up the T than it is about actually saving it to the end. The actual process is typically more like ET1L1T2L2T3L3...\n\nT1 is often limited to very simple transformations; de-duping and some light error checking is common. Then it gets written to disk in \"raw form\". We keep this work light so it can be fast and reliable. Since real systems have errors, we want to keep this simple so we minimize the chance of dropping data.\n\nT2 typically cleans the data. That typically takes more work since we're looking at the data more carefully and changing it more. We then write that to disk too since there are many different things we might do next.\n\nT3+ are typically curation steps that answer specific business questions. They can be very expensive to calculate (there are often dozens of JOINS going many layers deep) and they often drop data (often for speed or security) so we want to keep those older versions too. These final versions also get stored so the business users can access them quickly.\n\nNone of this makes much sense in small systems. They're techniques that are used in \"big data\". I would practice the basic tools (SQL, Spark, Python, etc) and supplement that by reading case studies on data deployments. That's where you'll see the real implementations and it's never as clean as ETL vs ELT.",

Startups often build for current needs without considering future growth, leading to painful refactoring later. Another is overlooking data integrity and consistency across systems. It's crucial to establish clear data governance early on. \n\nI learned these lessons the hard way scaling an AI platform from 10K to 1M+ users. Proper data modeling was key to our growth. Happy to chat more about avoiding these pitfalls - it's why I'm passionate about mentoring founders through arbhavesh growth hacker now. What other data challenges are you all seeing?",

I'd steer anyone away from the academy for sure.\n\nA trap laid in the agreement to join the academy is talk of a refund but only if you did every bit of course work on the timeline they set up. So if you're stuck like OP you might miss deadlines, meaning they can deny your exit request. The agreement also states all issues are to be handled via arbitration. \n\nI ended up becoming a data engineer on my own but not because of the \"academy \".",

Either meet with a department head or manager who wants something done, or meet with an individual who's been asking for something to be fixed for months.

I rarely see the results of my work, or feel like my data is impacting anything- except in cases where I get to work with individual employees who are working directly with the data. \n\nA lot of this may just be a function of being a mid-level engineer. I'm the guy who rote work gets delegated to when it's already been designed and needs to be implemented well.",

Sometimes they are engaged and other times they aren't.  Some refuse to just think about the data and insist you build like 20 different versions of the final data for them to \"play with\" until they are done iterating through their requirements.  Some don't know what the hell the DE/Analytics team wants because the technical team can't communicate well.

One thing that helped us a lot was their fallback cursor option - basically, if your primary cursor (updated_at) is null, it can fall back to another column like created_at without missing rows.\n\nThey added this feature recently in response to this exact scenario: PR #403 (https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/pull/403)\n\nWe’ve been syncing to S3 buckets using it, and it’s been stable so far even on large tables. You don’t need CDC or any schema changes on the source DB, which was a big win for us.\n\nMight be worth checking out if you're still exploring options.",

The pro subscription is a fixed cost per month (quite low), so if you have numerous job runs per month, it approaches 0 cents per run.\n* There are no details on the configuration / connectors being used for loading the TPCH dataset. CPU usage can vary quite a bit depending on the connector, and underlying driver. Furthermore, it could be mis-configured or not using the most optimal setup. Overall, users are quite happy with the performance.\n* Many useful features are omitted, such as [VSCode extension](https://docs.slingdata.io/sling-cli/vscode), [transforms](https://docs.slingdata.io/concepts/replication/transforms), [runtime variables](https://docs.slingdata.io/concepts/replication/runtime-variables), replication tagging, [python wrapper lib](https://docs.slingdata.io/examples/sling-python) (which is quite easy to use compared to dlt), [global connection system + dbt conns support](https://docs.slingdata.io/sling-cli/environment), [column casing/typing](https://docs.slingdata.io/concepts/replication/columns#column-casing), etc.\n* Sling reading APIs will come out soon, currently in private beta.\n\nWhat has become clear, at the end of the day, it is a matter of taste.

Or can you alter the prompt to generate those columns (and then monitor for malformed JSON where the prompt forgets)? \n\n\nIf so, maybe your postgres table could have those core columns, then you have an \"additional data\" json field that holds the rest of the response. You then create a view / table that extracts the additional metadata into its own table with a common key. \n\n\nThat solves the ETL side, IDK about meta base but hopefully it could lazy load some of the data from the view? ",

If you're very strong in all aspects of SQL (Joins, CTE's, order of execution, etc), then you're solid for a DE role. \n\nNow focus on data modeling which is very hard skill to get good at even after years of experience and many fail interviews even at senior levels, it's unfortunate truth but it is what it is. Take some Udemy courses, watch YT videos on dimensional modeling. There are plenty of free project YT videos on building pipelines. \n\nSince you're good with Oracle, start there for a valid certificate that you think can relate to DE role, even a data or solution architect certificate would be good on resume but experience always precedes certificates. \n\nLearn distributed compute and storage (Snowflake, Databricks), one is fine. Databricks has uphill learning curve compare to snowflake. \n\nPickup little bit of cloud (AWS or Azure), one is fine since the concepts can be applied across. Google cloud isn't very popular compare to the other two. You can also pickup cloud related skills on the job, doesn't have a steep learning curve. \n\nIf you're aiming for FAANG, then you'll need to learn DSA (Python works). I hate this part cuz even though much of what is asked in interviews is not used in the job, it's still required to learn coz big companies use this technique to eliminate bad or not so good candidates. \n\nDE sometimes feels like a multi-skill role, but even today, lot of heavy lifting is done using SQL. Ignore all the loud noise about AI. It's good to have it but won't replace DE role anytime soon. Our team DE's are using the paid version of copilot for GitHub, VSS code stuff to make their life easy, faster, detect issues early enough. ",

A transformation would be calculating longitude & latitude for that address, that the X & Y coordinates don't exist in the source system.\n\nSo the world of DW is easily a year full-time university course, of course lots of courses online too.\n\nSo... At least once... A relationship between to tables, inner join or left join. In DW world you avoid left joins like the plague, unknown data will actually have a pre-defined value.\n\nThis is domain / entity specific, like when you specify 1-to-1, 1-to-many, 1-to-0. So at least once would be 1-to-1 and 1-to-many.\n\nIf you load a product table and a sub-table is color, another is category and sub-category, depending on the (various) sources you can have a product with no color, no category or sub-categ, you must assign a value for the missing data, so that INNER JOIN always works.\n\nSo you'd have a DIM\\_PRODUCT\\_CATEGORY with a surrogate key and business value 'UNKNOWN' or 'NOT DEFINED' even though in the source system that category doesn't exist.\n\nYou have to remember that DWs are report orientated and tools like PowerBI and the analysts using them will not appreciate having to render NULLs and won't be happy with missing sales numbers.",

You may find yourself really enjoying the work AND the company.  In this case you'd want to make sure you're building relationships there and ask about a potential conversion to FTE after graduation, or at the very least an extension on your internship.\n\nIf you find yourself enjoying data-related work but don't necessarily see yourself staying with the company, you'll want to start researching about different data-related roles (Data Engineer, DBA, BI/Analytics Engineer, Data Analyst, etc.) and continue building applicable skills. You'll also want to be aggressively applying for internships for related roles.\n\nIf you don't have a particular affinity for data related work but still want to stay in CS / tech, then you'll still want to be aggressively looking for internships or junior roles. Again, the market is tough so just get those applications out.  Best case you land an offer, worst case you get interview practice which will help you in the future.  Speaking of which:\n\n>I’m very weak at coding and don’t know much about it.\n\nDo yourself a favor and start practicing leetcode. It sucks but you'll find live coding to be a part of the SWE interview process at many companies. I'm not here to argue how effective it is or isn't at identifying good candidates, I'm just stating the facts.",

In truth, I haven't tried out the Free Edition so I couldn't vouch for it but in terms of Scala and Spark as others have pointed out it's not getting as much attention as Python.\n\nBy far the focus is on PySpark and SparkSQL and perhaps some R. It seems like they're moving away from Scala. I mean it's still Scala 2 not even Scala 3 so one can only wonder...\n\nThe Databricks Academy doesn't even offer any trainings on Scala Spark from what I can see. You're best bet is to look for some course or book on O'Reilly (I've done the same) or online free materials.",

        "body": "Fundamentals for DSA and languages are important probably moreso than ever.\n\nFor example, if you prompt copilot in javascript with something like `function quicksort(nums) {` it will almost always output the wrong answer. It looks like quicksort but its a very inefficient implementation of it. Usually it will create new partition arrays and concatenate at the end which is very slow and not \"quick\" like it implies in the name. The proper implementation is done in-place. If you are solid in DSA and coding fundamentals, even if you don't know the quicksort algorithm, you will probably be able to look at it and realize that allocating a bunch of new memory each recursive iteration is very inefficient. Almost all sorting algorithms implementations are done in place since speed is very important.\n\nThat said I think AI has huge potential value in acting as a teacher and mentor if prompted the right way. My recommendation would be to turn off copilot, don't use cursor or any codegen, and prompt it to not give any code examples. A prompt like 'I want to study binary search as if I'm reading a textbook, from first principles and with theory, without many real code samples, in order to learn it through and through. Be as verbose and long form as possible' . The output of that prompt is actually pretty good stuff, it was trained on textbooks so get that level of information from it like you're taking a class on it.\n\nA soft skill I would add to that is to learn how to learn. Ask probing questions. Seek to understand at a deep and innate level. Ask for explanations in different ways and analogies that help you understand better. It should be difficult and hurt your brain when you're learning and growing. You don't build muscle without pushing the limits of your body, and its the same with your brain. You grow when things aren't easy or simple or mindless.",

You can create a class/ function to retrieve the data from each of these sources, but then imagine the frustration when you have to create an interface that now supports all of these different uses so that you can wire in whatever getter object you want to use. Now imagine that you want to reuse the session from your API code (for other api calls unrelated to grabbing the previous data), instead of reinitializing a new session for every API call. And now you need to support some new interface for another use case, so you’ll have two interfaces and so on and things get messy.

This website doesn't deal with finding a job, but is great for knowing \\_what\\_ to learn in many technologies and career paths: [https://roadmap.sh/python](https://roadmap.sh/python) . If you don't have direction, that gives you it. Also join smaller online communities where daily discussions happen, so you can see not only what's in the tutorials and curated content, but how things work day-to-day.\n\nSkill itself is not enough to find a job. Yes, the market is much tougher than it was 5 years ago, but programming is still the right choice if you have the brains for it. It's going to take hard work to get a job, but the value/effort ratio is much higher than that for other jobs. The best case scenario is to know someone that can introduce you to the right company: trust and a feeling of community are valuable to companies that know what's good for them. So see if you, your family, or your friends know someone like that. Even if they don't have an opening, they may introduce you to further connections of theirs. Listen to their advice and don't take anything for granted.\n\nIf you can't find that person, it's time to polish your CV and hit the job boards. If you're not at all comfortable with your skill level, aim for \\*\\*PAID\\*\\* internships. You might need to apply to hundreds of jobs. It's going to feel like a slog, but it's worth it. Be respectful, definitely don't let AI write your application or emails, the lack of effort is noticed. Many companies won't notice a presence of effort either, but you're better off without them. When you see a company you really like, try to prototype an open source project in the same domain as their product, and put it in the application. Best case scenario they see the effort and dedication, and they'll know you can be valuable to them, worst case scenario you have one more small project in your portfolio for the next company you apply to. There was a period where being disruptive and extra casual gave you a leg up, we're no longer in that period: be respectful (don't confuse this with submissive) and professional. Remember the people on the other side are people too, and if you can make their life easier by being honest and not making the interview/email tough for them, they're more likely to want you as a team mate.\n\nBest of luck, and if you have any more questions feel free to ask.",

But wierdly I am still resistant to this.\n\nSometimes I sit for literally hours trying other approaches. I know! I'll write it out on paper! I know! I'll draw it!\n\nAnd I'm a f\\*\\*\\*ing idiot because every time I end up having to write a small program to test the theory of what I'm doing ... and that will lead me to the answer. \n\nI feel like I experience a lot of impedance to simply switcing windows and opening up a new program and doing the thing.\n\nAND what's even more interesting, the best programmers I know (but of course that's subjective) do this too. Not necessarily that they get stuck but they do this switching context to experiment thing. When programmers I admire pair with me I see them do this all the time.\n\nSo that's my answer. When you get stuck try and write programs that unstick you.

Yet, only trying to implement already existing solutions is not the best way to get there.\n\nMy recommendation would be that if you see an interesting project somewhere try to replicate it *without* looking at the code first. This is the real way to learn. Figure out how things work. Try things. Experiment. Fail. Fix. Succeed.\n\nDo not be afraid of failure. Every failure is teaching you something.

No one here can tell you if your approach is good FOR YOU.\n\nIn principle, your approach seems not bad. You should keep in mind as you go through these exercises that no matter how many repositories you comb through, you will only ever be touching the tip of the iceberg. The world of software development has more ways of doing absolutely everything than you can shake your fist at, and you will never become an expert by just looking at other people's work.\n\nI suggest as you go through these exercises, instead of trying to rebuild the same thing you just observed from scratch, establish a cadence of identifying problems that can be solved or improvements that can be made with code. While reviewing repositories, take notes. Then, when using the concepts you discovered in these repositories in your own solutions, do not allow yourself to look at the repositories at all. Instead, look at your notes.\n\nAnd remember as you go through this that it is not recreating other people's solutions that makes a great developer. I understand you're just trying to get started, and that's fine. But be aware that at some point you will want to detach completely from the example repositories and make an effort to implement a novel idea without any example to guide you. Programmer talent really shines when you find a gap and fix it. And the best developers are the ones who can think outside the box and identify solutions where one is not readily available. So make it your goal to get to a point where you're comfortable trying to do something that's entirely yours.",

How to code comes out of having a need that prevents you from attaining or achieving something that you want.  Figure out the why, and the how will come with experience.  \n\nWith your approach, you don't know why code is written in a certain way, or why code is written at all in a project to some extent.  It's a lot easier to learn when you know what the end objective is, and what success looks like.  It's a measurable, achievable milestone, rather than aiming at some amorphous end point that isn't anchored to the amount of experience and know-how you have.\n\nAn analogy; if you play chess for the first time, you may think that a good approach to play is to just capture as many pieces as possible.  Unfortunately, chess isn't so simple.  An 1800 ELO player is going to make moves that a 400 ELO player simply cannot even begin to understand the justification for, even if they understand the how, which was simply to move a piece legally.  So you might be able to go into a mature code base that people acknowledge as being well-written.  But you have no idea why it was written in that way, the intentions, the problems faced, the historical context.  And if you can't figure out the why, then I might as well hire an LLM over you, because they at least know the HOW even better than a human, even if they have no idea WHY they're writing code in a certain way for a certain purpose.",

See what happens, and what you can make happen, and understand what things do not just through your research but intuitively. What does it actually look like to change this number? Does it do what i expect? Can I add a button, or reroute a button to go somewhere else or do something else entirely? I think that, getting into an existing codebase and wreaking absolute havoc with Google at your side and Git protecting you from self-destruction is a great way to learn, and then once youre comfortable, yes.

        "body": "I actually think that this highlights a fundamental tension around Python that lots of people either don't recognize, or don't engage with.\n\nOn the one hand: Python is a great language for teaching, for a couple of reasons.  The whitespace handling enforces good practices, the simple syntax is really great, the robust libraries available make it easy to not-worry-about parts of the code that aren't the focus of the current lesson.\n\nOn the other hand: Python is a great language for Getting Shit Done, because generally speaking people are in agreement about what's \"the Pythonic approach\" to a problem.  Lots of libraries already exist, and also, most of them have easy-to-pick-up interfaces because they're generally developed \"Pythonically\".\n\nNow - when you're learning \"programming\", you're learning several things at once: the fundamentals of programming (data structures, algorithms, what a variable is), and also a specific programming language (do statements end in a semicolon? how do I import something from another file?), and also a particular development context (how should my project be structured?  How do I invoke build tools?).\n\n**Python is very good at simplifying some of this**.  The \"learning a specific programming language\" part of it is pretty simple, and the development context is easily simplifiable (it can get complicated in real-life deployment situations, needing to navigate pyenv etc - but that's not anything a beginner needs to worry about in order to get started).\n\n**The tension is this:** Because Python has an active community of senior developers, who have coalesced on specific ways of working (canonized and blessed particular by the BDFL), there are some corners of Python that don't feel right if you've been exposed to other kinds of programming - some of which might actually be \"harder\" than the level of abstraction that Python works at!\n\nFor a long time, this manifested for me as: *every time I try to learn Python, I pick a simple project and implement it - but feel like I haven't gained any knowledge about the language*.  It was like it was too easy - like there was so little friction that nothing stuck in my brain.\n\nWhat made it click for me was to fully synthesize the idea that \"programming Pythonically\" is a distinct skill, and that \"knowing how to program\" *in general* was helpful for it but by no means sufficient for it.  Similar to learning piano after learning guitar - there are definitely some conceptual overlaps and transferable skills, but some things that \"should be\" easy are suddenly hard, and other things that \"should be\" hard feel weirdly easy.",

        "body": "So when you move from C-like languages to Python you have to avoid \"thinking in C.\"  It is kinda hard to explain but every language has a \"mental model\" you have to adhere to.  If you use a \"mental model\" that is incompatible with your current language, it creates a sort of mental fog and you will get stuck.  \n\nI can tell you have a C model because you used words like \"iterate\" and \"insert.\"  I know Python programmers use them too but these words don't mean quite the same thing as what you have in mind.   \n\nThe mental model for C is \"memory\" like little pieces of boxes of data that you manipulate.  This data has an address and a type.  Variables in C are really pointers (of specific type) pointing at memory boxes. \n\nThe mental model for Python is more complicated because it has multiple fundamental types.  I will just use colloquial naem since a lot of higher languages all share these types.  They are scalar, array/vector, hash-table/named-array, and pair/dict.  Note they are not interchangeable.  When you program them you have to keep track of which type you are dealing with.  \n\nThis may seem trivial but it is a big difference especially with the issue you have.  You see, an array in Python is not the same as an array in C.  An array in Python is ***a type of object*** while in C it is just ***an array (a continuous line) of memory boxes.***\n\nThis means you cannot think of insert as ***iterating*** to the right spot of the memory and ***insert a box*** and move the rest of the box over to the right (assuming going from left to right).   \n\nIn object oriented languages like Python, you just simply use the object's method to insert.  Doing it any other way is just creating trouble for yourself.   \n\nIn some sense this gives Python its ease of use but it also creates a strange weakness.  Python programmers often have trouble adjusting to lower level languages like C.  It is your problem in reverse, except it is a lot harder to overcome.  \n\nI do not understand it completely but I feel it is like learning a manual clutch car versus automatic.  It is easy to learn automatics because you do not need to understand much to start much.  On the other hand, you need to understand the gear boxes to have that mental picture of the gear switching process when you drive to feel the gears switching into the right positions to get it.   If you are already accustomed to something easy why would you ever bother and want to struggle with something hard.  You will just quit.  So, congrats for learning a C based language first.\n\ne:  a big weakness of higher level languages, most but not all, is that you cannot create new fundamental types.   You might be asking what other types could there be?  A lot actually, pretty much everything you find in the standard C/C++ library.",

I think youre confused because you have skipped some steps. games are very complex as softwares and building one with no concept of coding or system design would be very difficult.\n\ni think you should go learn coding first. know the more complex data types. know some algorithms so you can learn to think like a problem solver. the journey of learning is different for everyone. idk what would be best for you, but i can share how i started back in the day.\n\nso this is how i learned python: wanted to learn in a more practical way instead of just watching tutorials. went to https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard. picked python from their \"prepare by topic\" section and just started solving the problems one by one. you can see that it starts from very basic stuff like hello world, then arithmetic operators, if-else, loop... and eventually moves on to harder stuff. i googled when i got stuck. looked at solutions if i failed. even if i succeeded, i looked at solutions as it would always teach me different ways of doing things. i found the one-liners very interesting in particular. hackerrank gives you a goal, in the form of badges. i kept doing it till i had the max level badge. after that i moved on to codeforces to practice more problems. found this ladder [https://earthshakira.github.io/a2oj-clientside/server/Ladder11.html](https://earthshakira.github.io/a2oj-clientside/server/Ladder11.html) . some easy-ish problems that you should be breezing through.\n\nthis entire thing should take you 1-2 months. you should be very comfortable with python at the end of this journey. switching to something like gdscript or c# shouldnt be a big issue. if your look closely, all languages are same with some small fancy syntax differences. if you find yourself losing interest halfway through, then you might not be as interested in coding as you thought.\n\nmaking a game would still be a challenge after this journey but you should find yourself in a far more comfortable position that now.",

This will give you a solid baseline to work from. I suggested Python, because you mentioned *Godot* for Game Dev and Python is closest to GDScript (which is basically a specialized Python).\n\nThe fundamental data types are easily explained:\n\n+ *boolean* - a \"yes/no\", \"true/false\", \"on/off\" value\n+ *int* - a whole number\n+ *float* - a decimal number\n\n---\n\n*Class* is a bit more difficult: it is a scheme, a blueprint for data (fields) together with behavior (methods) - it is a generic description of what can be stored and done with something. Think of e.g. a *Poker Card*\n\n+ it has a *suit*\n+ it has a *rank*\n+ it may have a *numeric value* (mostly for sorting, or similar, or for a point value)\n+ it has a *face* (image)\n+ it has a *backside* (image)\n+ it can be *face up* or *face down* (which decides what the card will report when asked)\n   \nall the above are *data* - they are *fields*, *attributes*. Then, there is *behavior*, the *methods* - for a Poker Card these are fairly simple:  \n\n+ It can report its rank (provided that it is face up)  \n+ It can report its suit (provided that it is face up)  \n+ it can be *flipped* (toggled between face up and face down)   \n+ it can *draw* itself  \n\nNow, you have a *concept* of a *Poker Card* - a full description of the data and behavior - this is a *class*.\n\nAs such, this doesn't say anything about a *specific* card yet. That's where *objects* come into play - they are the *concrete* implementations, like the \"Queen of Hearts\", the \"Ace of Spades\", etc. Each card in a Poker Deck is a concrete *object*, an *instance* of our *Card* class, of our *blueprint*.\n\n----\n\nWhen to use what is a different story. This comes with practical experience. The more programs you write, the better you will understand what to use when.\n\nNote that in my description I did not (apart from \"class\" and \"object\", \"boolean\", \"int\", \"float\") use *any* programming language specific terminology as these *concepts* are common to most programming languages.\n\nExactly here is where good *courses* (like the aforementioned course), not just *tutorials*, shine. They explain everything from the ground up and give you ample practical exercises so that *you* have to do the work and understand the subjects.\n\nYou will need to sit down and start from zero with a proper course. That's the way to go.\n\nMost of the tutorials around assume some pre-existing knowledge or fall short on explaining the fundamentals.",

Its the standard reply I've seen when people ask \"how do I learn\" and other people respond \"just learn by doing projects from documentation and tutorials and such\"\n\nPersonally, I think that's incredibly stupid. It is migraine inducing cuz you're just flailing about randomly, and your foundations will be non-existent cuz your learning methodology involves \"monkey try thing, monkey see if thing work or not work, but either way monkey not know why thing work or not work\".\n\nFind a long detailed tutorial which suits your tastes that covers the fundamentals.  \nThe typical data-types (float vs double vs array vs list vs dict vs Godzilla's ballsack), the typical loops and the differences between them (while do vs do while, for vs while), indexing (most programming languages have 0 indexing), etc.\n\nIt may not be as sexy, and where Joe schmoe has a fully fledged game you may only have theoretical knowledge, but the difference is when you design a game, you will actually know how & why it works and you'll be able to account for why you chose a double instead of an integer and why you needed to use X instead of Y.\n\nPersonally I liked this tutorial [https://youtu.be/\\_uQrJ0TkZlc](https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc) when I was beginning, but feel free to find one which suits your tastes.\n\n  \nBut yeah - how do you learn programming. My opinion, same way you should learn anything else. Don't put the cart before the horse and just start wildly doing things. Learn the fundamentals - what elements are at play, how they can be used, how they can't be used, etc. ONCE you're solid on that (won't take too long, its simple stuff, a few weeks depending on if this is your main pursuit or your learning it as a side interest) then do projects and learn by documentation and such",

It would be checking for basic bad practices mostly. Conditionals that could be simplified but aren’t clear, bad naming, etc. More things you could expect to make the code confusing or difficult to add to in the future. Also of course you can check for basic business logic that it probably does what it should and whatever else you might happen to stumble upon. \n\nWhat is it like when you receive code reviews? I think you’re mixing code review expectations with general teamwork communication. I would think before you get to code review is typically when you make yourself available to answer questions and help younger devs out which it sounds like is your next wanted steps.",

If you can read the code and do simple tasks, that's a great start\n\nAs for projects to practice, that depends on where you are in your learning.  If you're just starting a good test of your understanding of the basics is to make a simple game, where the computer selects a number, and you guess what it is, and the computer tells you higher or lower.  That handles loops, i/o, conditionals, etc.\n\nOnce you move past that it's more important to focus on a project you enjoy.  Why are you trying to learn C++? If you have a motivating end goal you can work towards that can kind of set up a path.",

Which is the basics such as knowing how to use variables, functions, logical statements, booleans, etc.\n\nStart small with basic projects related to something you enjoy in real life. For example, football, cooking, wrestling, gaming, etc. Take gaming for example, I’ve been playing runescape lately and enjoying that. I thought of an idea where you can select the items you want to upgrade to and it will tell you exactly the costs and items to upgrade it with and give a plan on that.\n\nWith any project break the idea / problem down to smaller objectives you can easily do. For the above I would do something like:\n* Hard code the upgrade data and item list for now\n* Create a function that can calculate the upgrade route of selected items\n* Display the items that you can select \n* Display the upgrade route once items are selected\n\nNow always keep your project simple and hard coded, then you can start adding improvements. For example I can connect it to a database, maybe supabase or MySQL or mongodb, etc. I can also connect it to authentication so users can save their ideal upgrade builds, presets, etc.\n\nYou want to always start small, then incrementally add to it. By adding overtime, that’s when a project gets complex. Even with the complex projects you mentioned, if you break them down into parts they’re actually very simple.\n\nYou have HTML, CSS and JS knowledge, so I’d recommend you pick up a framework like React / Next.js, Angular or Vue. I’d recommend you try all three with a basic project then you’ll get a feel on which one you’d like to use long term.\n\nIf you want some project ideas give a shout on what you enjoy and I can hit you back with some ideas. Try not to use AI during this period, use things like documentation, googling, books. Then once you’re comfortable you can use AI for research but don’t heavily rely on it for your code, you want to use it to help you grasp concepts. The key thing for you right now is to learn problem solving while you’re doing these projects.",

Also, cheat as much as you can: copy other’s code and use AI where possible. You’ll probably have issues but that is where you learn how to disect other’s code. To use someone elses code, you should understand it (aka more learning). Copy, paste, modify. \n\nThis advice applies to learning anything: want to learn an instrument?

If you were to re-write this, I would phrase it as a question, and not assume you know more about how to teach students than the CS Department of your University.  It's good to be curious, it's good to question things, but remember they've likely been doing this a lot longer, and they likely have an answer as to why they choose XYZ first.  \n\n  \nI have a few thoughts for why they might teach Syntax first.\n\n  \n**Easy Victories lead to greater motivation -**  Almost invariably, everyone's first program is 'Hello World'.  This is a very easy first step that teaches you some basic syntax, the basics of how your IDE work, and the basics of runtime/compiling.  If your code doesn't compile, you have a syntax error, that's likely your first bug!  And it's easy to solve.  This will quickly become trivially easy, but you had to learn it at some point, and if you can see that the basics of coding is no harder than installing a few programs and writing a sentence with good grammar, that might be enough to get a few students who were on the fence to stay in the game.\n\n  \n**Most people learn what to do, and then how to do it, then why you do it -** You likely don't have kids, but my daughter is learning to walk and talk right now.  She knows 'danger hot' and that the trash cans & toilets are 'Ew'.  As she gets older we'll start filling in the gaps of why these things are dangerous & yucky, but it doesn't do us a whole lot of good to tell a one and a half year old about germs because even if she could learn the word, she doesn't know what it means.\n\nBringing this concept back to programming, One of the first apps taught outside of CS degrees is building an API with CRUD operations.  The REST routing concepts are pretty much set in stone at this point, and don't require a lot of creativity, so it's pretty easy to give newbies a tutorial and help them through the concepts as they work up the project.\n\n  \n**Yes this is eventually going to cause a learning plateau -** So yes when you get into algorithmic thinking, assignment operators, functions that pass a value, etc. you're going to hit a wall.  This is not easy stuff and you are going to struggle with this as you rewire your brain.  But as you practice, you are going to hit a point where it clicks, and when that happens you're going to be glad you have all of your syntax memorized because it will fall into place easier, rather than having to go back and learn it all at that point.",

Each user can then branch off of the main branch, essentially making a copy of the code in the main branch, that they can edit on their computer. When one person has made good progress on some feature or part of the code, they can then \"merge\" their code into the main branch. The other users can then \"pull\" that code while working on their branches to make sure everything works well together.\n\nThis is a really high level description that misses some of the main features of git, but it's definitely the tool you want to be using for this sort of thing.\n\nAs for designing a game, as with any moderately sized project, the MOST, and I mean MOST, important part is planning. Don't just have each person writing their own bit of code without knowing how the pieces will connect. Literally draw diagrams on paper detailing how different classes will interact, what functions each class will implement, etc. before diving into the code. You don't need to go all the way into the weeds with planning, but make sure you have a good idea of how all of the big pieces will connect before you start coding.",

        "body": "There's a common misconception among those new to the software industry that all code is brand new. Most code is legacy code, that is, code that's been around a while, maybe years and years, and you're fixing bugs or adding features. It's rare for a company to ditch their code, find the next new language, and rewrite the entire codebase. One big reason is lack of documentation.\n\nI worked on software where the customer would want various features added. It had grown over the nearly two decades it existed until no one really knew the full extent of what the code did because, surprise, surprise, it was never documented. But even if it was, rewriting is only nice for the programmer. The end user generally doesn't see much. Rewrites often introduce bugs and leaves out key features because the developers never knew what all the features were.\n\nThis is why certain languages hang around. Many newcomers think the industry is quick to jump on languages like Rust and abandon Java, but it's not just the language, it's the massive amount of code that runs and works. More than that, it's the data. If you switch platforms, is your legacy data compatible with the kind of data the new platform expects? In electrical engineering terms, this is called an *impedance mismatch* (which causes inefficiencies in power flow).\n\nFor PHP, what I heard was it was easy to write, but hard to maintain. That is, people wrote bad code. It was blamed on PHP, more than the coders. It also came when the web was young, so there were still chances for other web frameworks. I'd say the 2010s were the era of these web frameworks. React, for whatever reason, won out over Angular. Vue and Svelte came later, but when a community heads to one framework/library, it creates a critical mass which forces others to join.\n\nFor example, most web devs need to know Javascript. They could use Dart, but Javascript seems more essential, and so Dart (other than through Flutter) didn't come to replace Javascript.\n\nOften, there aren't exactly technical advantages. For example, most people agree Python is a pretty slow language. Despite that, it's become the language used in numerical methods, data visualization, data mining, machine learning, and AI. How did it do that? The main attraction was its simplicity (ish). But also, it allowed for code written in C to look like Python functions. If it were written in native Python, it would be very slow, but because it was optimized in C, a compiled language, these libraries run fast.\n\nPython has a huge set of libraries that do all sorts of things. After Java, Python may be the second most popular language taught in US colleges. It's become the language to use for AI coding, so everyone jumps on that bandwagon.\n\nBut, it could have been Ruby. It could have been Clojure. It could have been a brand new language (unlikely). Python was able to overcome its limitations and be used in more compute-intensive coding.",

        "body": "I recently started using Codefinity to improve my Python skills after going through some free resources, and I think it’s a pretty solid option for beginners. What I liked most about it was how the lessons are broken down into small, manageable steps. This made it much easier to follow along without feeling overwhelmed or lost, which I’ve experienced with some other courses. The platform also includes short projects after each module, which gave me a chance to practice what I learned right away. These projects aren’t huge or super complex, but they help reinforce the concepts and build confidence.  \n  \nOne thing to keep in mind is that the pace can feel a bit slow if you already know some Python basics. I noticed that some parts repeated concepts I was already familiar with, but for someone completely new, I think this level of detail is helpful. It’s better to take time with the fundamentals than rush through and miss important points. If you’re looking for something more challenging or project-heavy, you might need to supplement Codefinity with other resources or personal projects.  \n  \nAnother point is that Codefinity mainly focuses on Python programming itself and doesn’t cover specialized topics like robotics or hardware programming. If you want to get into areas like robotics, you’ll probably need additional tutorials or courses focused on those skills. Still, having a strong foundation in Python is essential, and Codefinity does a good job of building that.  \n  \nOverall, I’d say Codefinity is a good choice if you want a structured, beginner-friendly course that keeps things clear and simple. It might not be perfect for everyone, especially if you prefer fast-paced learning or very in-depth projects, but it’s definitely worth trying if you want a guided approach to learning Python basics.",

        "body": "I think whether Codefinity is worth it really depends on your starting point and learning style. I took Codefinity after dabbling in Python on free platforms like freeCodeCamp and YouTube tutorials, and for me, the biggest value was its structured, hands-on approach. A lot of online courses dump all the theory up front, but Codefinity mixes in small, interactive projects from the start, which kept me engaged and actually helped me remember the concepts better.\n\nOne thing I noticed compared to something like CS50 is that Codefinity feels more guided and less overwhelming. CS50 is amazing, but it can be intense for beginners because it covers a lot of computer science theory. Codefinity, on the other hand, is more focused on practical Python skills — working with data, building mini-apps, and slowly introducing libraries like Pandas or NumPy in context.\n\nIt’s true some lessons can feel repetitive if you already know the basics, but for absolute beginners, that repetition actually builds confidence. The quizzes and small coding tasks at the end of each section made it easier for me to track progress. I also liked that they emphasize applying what you learn — I built a simple web scraper and a basic text-based game during the course, which were huge confidence boosters.\n\nPrice-wise, it’s not the cheapest, but if you compare it to some coding bootcamps or other subscription-based platforms, it’s reasonable — especially if you grab a discount. The key is to actually follow through; no course is “worth it” if you just skim it.\n\nIf your goal is to move from understanding Python syntax to building your own projects, Codefinity can absolutely help bridge that gap. If you’re already at an intermediate level, you might outgrow it quickly, but you could still benefit from its more advanced project modules.\n\nFor me, pairing Codefinity with side projects (like Raspberry Pi experiments in robotics) made it much more valuable. If anyone’s wondering “Is Codefinity legit?” — I’d say yes, it’s a solid, beginner-friendly platform for learning Python in a structured, project-focused way.",

        "body": "Short answer: Yes, but first get an IDE like VS Code set up, learn the basics of navigating a terminal, and then watch the Harvard video AND FOLLOW ALONG.  (You can find tutorials for all of that in this sub's FAQ.) Watching is not the same as coding, and you will get a lot more if you are following along while you watch.\n\nLonger Answer:\n\nCoding is not 'Learn one language and fight about why yours is better for the rest of time'.  There's a very good chance you're going to learn 3+ languages at a basic level and a couple dozen technologies including an IDE or two, as well as multiple frameworks & runtimes over your career.  As a Junior, you probably won't get a job unless you can navigate a terminal, use a debugger, write unit tests, do error handling, test APIs through something like Postman, manage an environment through NPM or Docker or the like.  Honestly there's probably three things I'm forgetting.\n\nI've watched the Harvard video and the professor is very good.  He makes the class easy and fun.  But he's also fast, he assumes his students are Ivy League level and have read the source materials, so he may lose you if you aren't pausing regularly and checking documentation and course materials.\n\nAs for Python or C++; if this is pre-university, I think Python is PERFECT for you.  It'll be much easier and it will set you up well to learn another language and follow along better at Uni.  You'll have plenty of time to switch languages over the next four years.  Keep in mind C++ may not even be the language your game will be built in.  C++ would be for something like Unreal Engine, while C# would be for Unity, and Minecraft was originally in Java. So it's not like you can make any game ever with C++, well you could, but it's not necessarily the best choice.\n\nAnd yes as others have said, make sure you're WRITING code, not just watching videos.",

You can still solve that, because you learned the concept (or algorithm) of multiplying two numbers. And that allows you to solve that task for any given pair of numbers. Programming is the same, it's about solving problems. You see a problem and figure out the steps needed to solve it. And then you look up how exactly each step is done.\n\nExample: you need to find the seller with the best price for a product. You have a file containing the information (all sellers and the prices). The solution will always be something like \"Read the content of the file, iterate over the information and find the seller that has the lowest price\". How exactly you do that depends on the programming language. Once you have solved that, you can solve all similar tasks (find the seller with the worst price, sort the offers by price or seller name, take inputs from a database instead of a text file, ...). The core concept is still the same.\n\nEverybody looks up the details, that's what references are for. I have decades of experience and still look up the signatures of some standard functions on a weekly base. I know they exist and how they can help me solve my problem - I don't need to know the order of the parameters or the exact name for that.",

        "body": "I'll answer w.r.t game dev since that's what you said you wanna get into. You don't gotta pick a language, since the most popular game engine for development among indies is unity. You gotta learn C# for unity.\n\nGo to youtube and type something like: \"C# full course\". You'll get tons of lengthy courses. Pick one and start. Initially, you're gonna learn the following basics which are important:\n\n1. Variables & Data Types\n2. Input / Output\n3. Conditional Statements (If-else & switch) 3.1. Logical & Arithmetic Operators\n4. Loops\n5. Arrays / Advanced Data Types (Dictionary, etc.)\n6. Functions & Function Concepts (Overloading, etc.)\n7. OOP\n\nAbove concepts are pretty much language-agnostic i.e. you can apply the same concepts to other languages depending on their syntax. What you'll be trynna learn at this stage is logical building, and not just programming. After you've learned till \"2\", try making a program that prompts the user to enter their name, and print that with a sort of \"Hello, <username>. How are you?\" message. Make small programs like that after each point. \n\nWhile you're learning coding, you can look into game asset development depending on if you wanna build 3D or 2D games or both. Remember that you don't need to learn this initially. There are free marketplaces where you can download assets from. They'd be great to practice and build up familiarity with game dev projects until you wanna release something completely original.\n\nAfter you've learned programming, you can start with unity. Do the same and look up a full course on unity. Generally, you won't learn everything from these courses, but that's not the point. The point is you'll learn everything you need to make a game. After that, you gotta keep working on projects. Your ambitions will eventually lead you into learning lots of new stuff.\n\nSince you mentioned college, I'll drop some advice for when you're there as well. However, before getting into college, you need to be consistent. Do something every day even if its small. It's not about taking big steps, it's about taking several small ones. This will help you in college as well.\n\nIf you're adept at making games by the time you get into college. Start applying for internships in your 1st year. CS job market is pretty cooked rn, but I don't know about game dev, so you gotta prove your worth from the get-go. Try getting internships at good companies, so it'll look good on your resume. If you live in a 3rd world country, don't let your grades dip below 3.7 for 4-scale. Trust me, scholarships are competitive if you wanna get out of your country. Try getting a part-time job in game dev, so it counts towards your experience. Different universities have different rules, so you gotta look into it if they allow part-time or full-time work. Also, before you graduate, have multiple offers or jobs lined up for yourself.\n\nP.S: If you want any motivation or clarity on the programming part, don't hesitate to DM me. All of this advice comes from a place of experience through suffering, so I understand it can get pretty difficult. If you love this, hang in there and don't give up. I also offer paid tutoring services for programming, if you're interested in that. However, advice / guidance is free XD. Don't hesitate to reach out.",

You may have missed the opportunity to break into the field. The time of being able to finish bootcamps and getting a job is mostly over now. Companies are expecting a lot more experience now than before. The self learning path is still possible, but doing it while having a child and needing to work another job while learning? Sounds very tough, and the needed skill floor being higher now also means it will take much longer than before. \n\nNow, if you are really really interested in it and not just doing it for the money then I would still say without a doubt go for it. The reason why I think this is an important difference for self learners is because the people with actual interest are always going to dive deeper into things. They are going to spend that extra hour or 2 working more when others feel like they have done enough for the day. Although, who knows, maybe in the next years we are going to have yet another boom where there will be so much work that any fresh bootcamp graduate can quickly land a job. For now, understand that this is not how it currently is and it may or may not change for many years so be realistic with yourself.

I learned through codecademy for basics then in my sales role out of college I built a tool for myself to automate some of my role. That became surprisingly successful despite being simple as hell (literally my first project ever). It was just a webscraper with beautiful soup 4. \n\nMy point is more so that the problem here is about hiring and understanding the market data. If you study it in depth (this is actually my educational background ie HR) yes there are less jobs and that has directly led to waaaaaaaay more applicants per posting which means a waaaaay smaller chance of your resume ever being seen by a human and its ultimately just making it clear how awful the entire hiring process always has been ... imo the worst process in the world by far and so companies are often relying on referrals from employees as they tend to work better given that the employees can typically be more trustworthy than a resume and team cohesion and ability to get along with the team is one of the most important things any typical hiring manager is gonna care about (not saying that this should be the case). \n\nSo why i bring up my case is that getting a job is just sales and referrals are a great way to do sales. If they know you and like you they will hire you. Especially at places that aren't truly NASA or OpenAI or FAANG. I personally feel that most job advice in this subreddit feels like its skewed towards those companies because they did truly use to hire 1000s of juniors but there's still millions of 20-50 person companies in non tech intensive industries that cant tell good from bad skill level to begin with and are hiring.\n\nI'll also add that no one told me about the functional programming job route and how surprisingly little competition there is for some of these companies. While some typical job postings will have over 1000 applicants these functional jobs will have less than 50 and even then its not hard to beat out the other 50 \n\nLastly the other nuance to share here is that alllll industries right now to the best of my knowledge are crap for hiring. I dont personally know if I can say that programming is worse for hiring than others? My fiancée for example works in the public sector and there's been 1000s of job cuts",

You will be able to test and demo it without the real integration.\n\nInsulate your code further with a wrapper class that drives your code in response to user input. That way the API interface and potential changes are isolated to a small part of the code instead of being sprinkled everywhere.\n\nGood luck!",

Just not sure what kind of personal projects actually help when applying for junior or entry level roles.\n\nGenerally, I would focus on creating projects that:\n\n- Use the stack / technologies you want to use in practice, or want to get a job in. While not completely necessary, as you can show general software development aptitude by simply creating programs that work, having them also be using the technologies a company you are applying for immediately shows your general skill level to the person doing the interview with you.\n- Write applications that excite or interest you personally. You will find that in an interview just being able to talk about a project that interests you will convey genuine interest in our field of work. Personally as an interviewer, I am always very interested in hearing about projects people have written just because it interests them. \n- Document your projects, and make them representable. I like seeing Github URLs on applicant their CVs, but interviewers are likely not going to check out more than 1-3 projects. Pin or highlight the projects you are most proud of, provide them with good documentation, if possible with screenshots or in case of a web app: a demo website. Make it easy to run. Your goal is to entice the interviewer to check out the code, and maybe even clone your repo in order to do so.\n  - Your Emotion-AiCbot repo is a good example of this. Your custom-domain and medstuff repo's not so much. \n- Try and make your projects non-trivial. I do not get excited by projects like calculator or to-do apps. These are simple applications, and there are a bunch of prebaked tutorials for those on the internet. Created some niche application for your hobby, or which you use in your day-to-day life? Way more interesting.\n\n> I’m more into backend stuff, like APIs and automations, but I can handle some frontend too. Just not sure what kind of personal projects actually help when applying for junior or entry level roles.\n\nKnow that as a junior engineer, my expectation would be that you quickly pick up technologies and are a rapid learner. Try not to limit yourself too early in your development by preferring only certain types of task (e.g. back-end). Certainly do get proficient with at least one front-end technology, or you will not stand out among junior developers that are skilled in multiple domains.\n\nBest of luck.",

If you're using a library and you come across a weird bug or edge case and fix it, then you learned something. You now recognize that bug and that edge case and you can fix it whenever you see it again. If you're building a project with a tool you don't know a lot about and you're not sure whether this library has support for X, well you go to the documentation or you google it and by doing so, you learned something new.\n\nYou will learn a lot more through direct exposure with the tool than watching somebody else use it, because that person will only show you how to use the tool, not very often will they teach you the weird bugs and edge cases to watch out for and how to handle those cases.\n\nFor example, I'm working on a simple project that deals with files. Before this I didn't know anything about working with PDFs and images, but because I started the project and forced myself to do it, then now I'm learning how compression works, how to work with streams and buffers, reading and writing files, converting to other formats etc.. Applying your knowledge and creating things that you know little about is what will help you learn about those things.

As an absolute beginner, start by following a course. Don't try to build a project from zero knowledge. Start with any course that walks you through how to write code.\n\n2. When you're ready to begin a project, start with what kind of project you want to build. Be really, really specific and don't try to do everything at once. A good answer would be \"an Android app\" or \"a website\" or \"a bot that responds on BlueSky\". A bad answer would be \"a program that's always watching everything I do on my phone and my laptop\", that's too much to bite off. Start with one thing.\n\n3. Follow a tutorial on how to build that type of project. If you want to build an Android app, a tutorial will teach you how to get started, how to make the app, how to put it on your phone to try it out, and where to write your code.\n\n4. Once you have an empty application working, start adding things, one at a time. Start small, extremely small. Add one button. Now make that one button do something.\n\n5. From time to time, it might make sense to set your project aside, learn to do something (like how to call a specific API), then go back to your project and apply it.\n\nAs you gain more experience you will get faster at this, but you will never stop learning.\n\nGood luck!",

Getting questions about different projects also requires some context switching and disrupts the \"flow.\" I try to keep a \"developer diary\" about what I have been working on each day; it helps me to quickly remember what I was working on previously when I need to switch between projects (it's really helpful to read on Monday mornings and before going to different meetings).",

You can often do this by having more modules / classes / packages for your code, so it is more like a collection of small projects, than one big one.\n\nAnd use \"patterns\" - you don't have to learn the \"official\" Design Patterns, most of them probably aren't relevant for your projects - but get used to \"doing things in a similar manner\", e.g. when having a UI module, use a similar architecture in every one of your projects, so you don't have to understand everything every time, but only focus on the differences.\n\nFinally, make sure you leave the projects in \"good standing\" - like if you had some real hobby projects in your workshop: clean up around them, put your tools back where they belong, make sure you don't have loose screws lying around, make small notes (TODO) of what you need to do next. Use git to track and document your progress, and make sure that every commit - or at least the last one before leaving the project - is a clean version that you know works, and doesn't have too many loose parts dangling about!",

The brief window where files are accessible before metadata stripping or malware scanning is pretty normal most companies accept that low risk in exchange for smooth UX.\n\nSome common patterns I’ve seen:\n\nSingle bucket, async processing\n\nUser uploads → file is public/private in S3 almost immediately\n\nLambda/SQS/SNS triggers run in the background:\n\nStrip EXIF / metadata\n\nResize or generate thumbnails\n\nOptionally scan with ClamAV or an external scanning service\n\nOnce processed, either overwrite the file or mark it “safe” for serving\n\nTwo‑bucket flow while this is safer, it's slower \n\nTemporary “quarantine” bucket for raw uploads\n\nProcess + scan → copy to “public” bucket → CDN serves only from that bucket\n\nAdds latency but avoids serving unprocessed content\n\n\nHybrid\n\nSingle bucket, but the file is uploaded private by default\n\nProcessing Lambda flips ACL to public or moves it to a processed/ folder only after passing checks\n\nThis avoids serving potentially unsafe files without delaying uploads.",

People learnt way before the internet with its countless tutorials existed.\n\nYour approach is definitely not the very worst one, but you also have some typical misconceptions: just because you can *read and understand* code doesn't automatically mean you could *write* it, just as much as being able to *read and understand* novels won't automatically enable you to *write* a meaningful, fully developed one. You need to *practice yourself*.\n\nFurther, focusing on the code is generally the wrong approach. Code is only the *end product* of a long train of decisions, thoughts, considerations, and planning. What happens *before* the actual code, the design, is what really counts.\n\nSure, you may be able to implement X, but what's the reason to implement X in the way it is done? What are the design decisions and considerations that led to this specific implementation.\n\nYou need to learn to *design*. You need to learn to sit down with a problem and to analyze and break it down into smaller sub-problems that can be solved individually and *then*, finally, be implemented in code (in any language you know).\n\nYou, like way too many people, are trying to fast-track and are focusing too much on the end-product, instead of on the process of getting there.\n\nMy recommendation is to not use AI to give you solutions of any kind (code or not does not matter), only to give deeper explanations, as a glorified \"google\".",

        "body": "BACKEND:\nSince it’s just one restaurant, traffic isn’t going to be huge at first, so the framework you choose isn’t going to make or break things right now. That said, if you’d already sat down with the restaurant owners or whoever’s driving the project, you’d probably have a much clearer idea of what backend features you actually need. For example, if they’re thinking about an online menu, rewards system, or delivery integration, that could steer you toward certain frameworks. Django’s good if you want a lot built in (ORM, authentication, admin dashboard). Flask or FastAPI are nice if you want something lighter. I like Python in general for this type of thing since it’s quick to get running and has good database and data analysis support.\n\nDATABASE:\nThis part’s worth more attention. The database will hold orders, reviews, customer accounts, and probably more, for years to come. Without knowing exactly what data the stakeholders want to track, it’s hard to make the best call. PostgreSQL is solid for structured data, while MongoDB might fit better if the data doesn’t fit that structured pattern. Long term, you’ll want to think about how it can scale, vertical or horizontal. Early planning for indexes, queries, and cleanup processes will save pain later.\n\nDATA ANALYSIS:\nThe kind of analysis you can do comes down to what’s actually being recorded. If you want to recommend dishes, you’ll at least need individual order histories. It gets better if you have reviews, ratings, or seasonal trends. There are existing methods you can adapt, like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering, but you can also start simple with rule-based suggestions until you have enough data for more advanced models. This again circles back to getting clear from the start with what the stakeholders want out of the data. With that being said, this is not a must-have option and your main focus/attention should be on ensuring that your application can function as an ordering platform first.\n\nMODULES/LIBRARIES:\nThere aren’t really any libraries that will give you a specific features out of the box. You’ll need to build those features yourself. What you can do is use libraries and APIs that make certain parts easier. For example, most payment processing companies, like Stripe, Square, and PayPal, can securely handle the payment processing part with a provided API or SDK, but you’ll still have to design how orders flow through your system, how they link to payments, and how the data gets stored for analytics. The same goes for analytics, you might use Pandas, NumPy, or even BI tools to process and visualize data, but the logic for what to analyze and how it’s tied to business goals will be on you to implement.\n\nI wish you the best of luck in this endeavor, and recommend that take what I say with a grain of salt. Do your own research and requirements gathering to determine your needs, using advice from others as guidance, rather than gospel.",

This mental tree is very important to have and is discussed in most Linux Kernel development books  \n\nOnce you have this structure of the project, you should only ever touch a few parts of it in the mature project.  The way you do it is like a detective/scientist, you try to hypothesize where most likely the feature you want to add or modify or fix should be located in the code base.  You locate the code base on your mental model.  You then proceed to modify and prod and test.  \n\nI do not have any experience with reversing from binary but my understanding is you need to understand assembly to do that.  In addition you will need a disassembler/debugger.  I think it is a good idea to learn these too if you want to get serious because not all open source projects disclose their full source codes.  And sometimes they require you to download some pre-compiled binary to link to your code to make everything work.

        "body": "Let's start by noting that not everyone understands the language of a problem description. Sometimes, things written in English still require translation into their native language. This is the first thing you can try.\n\nThen you can try solving the problem from two perspectives. Let's call them top-down and bottom-up.\n\nWhen solving from the top, you try to understand the highest layer of the problem, the business layer, from the solution's perspective, and then break it down into smaller problems, abstraction layer by abstraction layer.\n\nWhen solving from the bottom, you usually find some lowest problem to solve that you know you'll have to solve, and you build on it with successive steps upward. Sometimes you can create more such starting points and combine them into a single whole.\n\nI think solving from the top is easier and clearer, but I've also met people who solve from the bottom-up and were able to write code effectively.\n\nIt's also worth trying to find solutions by analogy to already known solutions and the source code written for them. Here, you can use two sources, provided you can describe and connect the dots to the problem. One is the internet and its resources, and the trick is finding similar solutions. The second is looking at the code and finding similar implementations. For example, if you need to create a button with a message, and you already have another one somewhere in your application, you can see how it can be done, and that's a starting point for your own solutions.\n\nA final, but quite helpful, step is to write the documentation for the problem or function yourself. Not necessarily for the sake of maintaining it, but to understand the essence, clear your mind, and describe the problem. If you can't describe the problem, it's possible that what you're trying to do is intertwined with something else, insufficiently thought out, known, or documented. An example would be writing the documentation for a function before implementing it. If you can't write it, it's likely that you don't fully understand what you want to do. You might not be trying to implement one function, but two (or more) at once, and the problem isn't broken down into manageable components. Writing documentation, if successful, will force you to clarify what needs to be done, and implementation is then more of a detail.\n\nSome solutions also involve trial and error, retrospection, and retry. This happens, and don't be discouraged. Not everything can be built in one go.\n\nSumming up all the above, you'll definitely be trying to break the problem down into smaller components in some way, iteratively, step by step, until you reach a solution.\n\n  \nAlso, occasionally allow yourself to rest and sleep on the problem. Sometimes that helps too.",

There are some automated tools that let you build apps without hiring a developer. However, they're extremely limited. If there's even a single feature you need that it can't do, you might not be able to build on it.\n\nIn my experience, software is never \"done\". If it has users, it will need maintenance.\n\nRequirements change.\n\nUsers will find bugs.\n\nUsers will request new features.\n\nIt will need to integrate with other systems that you use, and those will change / evolve over time.\n\nYou'll want more analytics / dashboards.\n\nYou'll get audited for security and upgrades will be needed.\n\nThe point being: whoever builds your software, you need a long-term relationship with them. It could be an in-house team or an app development company that you contract with, but it won't be a \"one and done\" contract.",

We are seeing k8s clusters, tons of monitoring tooks, managed databases and dockerization. \n\n>Same with setting up different network configurations and switches and firewalls\n\nNot even actual sysadmins nowadays do so. We have moved to the heavenly world among the clouds. It's unironically a serious struggle for any company that wishes to have their own on-site facility instead of relying on AWS to find anyone who can still handle physical switches/firewalls/routers etc configuration.\n\n>is it because it's soo much else to learn, people are not interested in the whole stack experience so to speak or something else? Or is this only my observation?\n\nI think it really boils down to the fact that we have more specializations now and at the same time initial level required to host something >properly< has gone up so there's no real **point** in learning it without going really deep. I most certainly can spin up a VPS and run a basic stack on it, set up a firewall and add some fail2ban + basic logging. But I would not be able to actually run a proper setup with multiple pods, specific levels of permissions, autoscaling, alerts, full CI/CD pipeline with secrets taken from AWS and so on. It's DevOps territory, not Developers. And in some cases it's also InfoSec territory.",

Like anybody, even those with expertise, I could be wrong, and I would change my viewpoint when somebody actually makes a discovery that puts language models on the path to AGI. It could happen tomorrow. The paper could be about to be published right now... but until then, no, language models can do a lot of impressive things, but they are not likely to be AGI (or ASI of course).",

We saw this to varying degrees with VR, 3D screens, blockchain, etc. Dangling the prospect of being able to hire fewer employees and save piles of money to produce the same results had VCs and CEOs rock hard and tossing irresponsible sums of money around, but the use case will settle itself like those other technologies once the high wears off. \n\nYeah, the vibe seems to have shifted.

Reliability is a requirement (though I belive, not sufficient at all) if agentic systems are ever to actually take off as reasoning did.",

Unfortunately, the rate of scientific breakthroughs isn't exactly a function of funding. You can throw all the money you want at a top-tier AI research team, but as the saying goes, nine women can't make a baby in one month. That's why they talk about having AI itself design better AI systems (the AI 2027 predictions assume this), but it remains to be seen how far that can take us.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm skeptical when it comes to a lot of the benchmarks. Not to say that the results aren't impressive in their own right, but if these major AI companies' models were able to independently accomplish complex, economically valuable work, they wouldn't bother with high school math competitions.\n\nPersonally, I think AI will have transformative impacts even if the tech stops developing quickly. There are so many opportunities to build AI-enabled systems that play to their strengths, we could keep ourselves busy for the next 10-15 years. We don't need to have AGI/ASI for that to happen.",

It's easy to face my team and say something like: \"I'm going to work extra to ensure this gets done, it will make a big impact on my review, and you are all welcome to join me\". The idea is that you never directly ask, but align individual rewards with the project getting done sooner. The review stuff is still kind of BS, but it's still in our best interest to do well.\n\nRight now, I don't see what the difference is between you sacrificing family time over the weekend, and not sacrificing it is.

And yes - some of those people are, of their own volition, feeding the AI frenzy by trying to get their teams to do AI stuff just so that they can show off to leadership. But the majority of them are in the opposite situation - they're being told by leadership that they need to make AI happen - with literally about that much context.\n\nSo it could be that your boss came up with this idea on his own. It could also be that his boss told him \"hey, I need everyone on the team to bring me AI ideas so that I can show them off to our CEO\".",

AI isn't replacing entire industries, but companies are so worried about missing out, they are throwing tons of money at it (and likely getting very little return). So, AI is a distraction, but it's drawing lots of investment that could be spent elsewhere like employee salary and investment in non-AI projects. A lot of professional services companies are trying to become AI gurus, because that's what clients are currently looking for. That's part of why I think it's a bubble that has to pop eventually. I've seen lots of non-technical consultants opening up small AI consulting companies, becoming heads of AI practices (mostly sales and management roles), and so many people going nuts on LinkedIn. One or two people who I've worked with in the past, I trust some of what they are posting. Most of the people are just trying to become business world influencers. \n\nThere are certainly other factors contributing to the poor job market.\n\nOne thing that feels unique is the current US administration. It seems to be actively trying to destroy the job market. I'll be blunt, I think there are a lot of unqualified people in the current administration, and I'm not sure what their main motivators outside of personal wealth are. They want to lower interest rates. Well, a weak job market will help with that. And they are actively firing thousands of federal employees, killing grants, and all sorts of other actions putting people out of work. But they don't want people to think the job market is weak, because \"Republicans are supposed to be good for the economy.\" We'll have to see what long-term impact it has and how long it takes to recover. Other countries are also dealing with inflation, but it feels like the US is dealing with inflation and a bunch of other things. I'm no economist, but I've read a few people argue the tariff policy reminds them of the time before the Great Depression. So, things might get really bad and \"it's different this time.\" Or, this is a spot where I can be in the camp that predicted things incorrectly, which has happened plenty of times. \n\nI was originally in the camp that the job market would turn around in a year or two in 2022. Thinking back to working during the dotcom bubble, it might have taken 4 years or so for a recovery. But the government was trying to improve things. Now, it feels like the exact opposite. We're in a weird timeline, but maybe it's my turn to be paranoid.",

They're justifying layoffs as cost-cutting due to AI as they don't want to admit they overhired. Pair that with the huge cultural changes affecting large parts of the industry and this is definitely a pivot point for tech, if not totally unprecedented.\n\n\nThe more important point is that the number of junior roles in the tech industry has crashed in a way that, historically, it never has, and that specifically may be due to (misplaced) confidence that AI can improve the productivity of mid- and senior-level workers to a degree that means junior employees are no longer necessary. It's not that LLMs are yet that capable, it's that executives believe they are.",

They have to constantly try to convince the world that everything is great, profits are up, life is good for shareholders, \"please don't get angry and vote to have me removed from my cushy CEO job\".\n\nThe only factor I would say that AI is going to play with the job market right now is we are going to be seeing companies favor candidates that have some ability with writing prompts and utilizing AI tools for productivity. However, I can also imagine there's going to be companies narrow-mindedly thinking that AI can do a lot more than it lets on, so they could hire some mediocre software engineer that uses AI a lot, thinking they got a deal, and then suddenly the ending code is terrible. It's anyone's guess. \n\nIf I have to lay blame on anything, it's the economy. Things were a mess after the pandemic, they were shaky throughout the Biden years, and in my book they were doing everything they could to keep things from teetering over the edge, but now we have leadership that really doesn't know what they're doing, and won't admit it. Rates, and heavy uncertainty is what I'm thinking is pushing companies to cut people, and hold off on big new projects or anything. Especially now with the tariffs. \n\nI wish I could be optimistic and say everything is going to turn around next year. However, my pessimistic side is starting to set in and believe that it's going to get worse. Maybe if people are angry enough by November of next year, they'll vote in a whole new legislative body that's going to keep the executive body in check and the standoff might make companies a little less scared to put money into anything right now. \n\nMy other fear is that we are further heading towards a freelance society. That we're going to see companies try their hardest to have everybody be contractors that they could fire for any reason at any moment, and especially not have to give benefits to. It'll be some scenario where the workers obviously get paid what they were getting paid for full-time, only no benefits, they are still struggling to make ends meet, but now on top of that, have to pay for their own insurance and retirement planning. \n\nI think if you have a job right now, stay there unless you have a solid good offer from a solid good company asking you to jump ship. If you don't have a job, my heart goes out to you, and all I can tell you is you're going to have to hustle like never before to get in anywhere. Even if it's just freelance so that somebody can know you and perhaps eventually might decide to bring you on permanently.",

That is false.\n\nIn my experience, for being a senior, one needs to hone in on their non-technical skills - how they build trust, how they build alignment, how they lead efforts, etc. For that a different skillset is required, which imo is absolutely crucial if you want to start getting that recognition, and eventually get promoted. I have talked a lot more about that in this post I made recently [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mhmy7l/junior\\_midlevel\\_engineers\\_feeling\\_invisible\\_or/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mhmy7l/junior_midlevel_engineers_feeling_invisible_or/) so hopefully that provides more insight.\n\n  \nFeel free to reach out, happy to help!",

Ultimately, you gotta decide what is it that you want to do. \n\n\nI recommend that you don’t prioritize what you love or are passionate about. Obviously it is amazing if you love/are passionate about your career, but that does not give you much flexibility. It’s fine if you don’t stay in CS/SWE, but I think the answer for leaving should be more nuanced than “it’s not my passion”.\n\nSo to dig into that a bit deeper, why did you get into software development 6 years ago? Have the reasons back then changed? You mentioned that sometimes you wish you never had to look at code again, is there a specific reason why? Are those reasons innate to coding itself or the conditions of your workplace? One way you can test that question is by trying to learn some fundamental computer science theory. TBF this is an assumption, but I strongly suspect your bootcamp set you up to learn programming languages and frameworks and it didn’t teach you the fundamentals and theory of computer science. I think that’s important to learn in order to develop some passion since it makes the field an actual study, not a traded skill.\n\nI’ll use history as an example since that was your major. A lot of people don’t like history because they see it as just the practice of accounting of the events that happened in the past. To them, it feels like there’s “history” and there’s “current events” and the two aren’t connected much in their view. But a historian will understand how history is both a representation of the past and current events. They understand how history gives us a critical basis for evaluating human sociology, economics, politics, etc.\n\nThere’s an analogous experience that a SWE can have with coding and computer science. It’s obviously not going to get nearly into humanities studies like history, but its conceptualizations extend in their own ways in surprising ways.\n\n\nIf you read this and think “I really don’t care about any of that and I have no will to invest my time in that”, that’s totally fair and it would give you important feedback for your dilemma. \n\nAt the end of the day, whether you are passionate about it or not, you gotta have a mind that is curious to explore your professional field. If your mindset is similar to that as a cashier who doesn’t wish to expand their skillset in retail, then you’ll remain stagnant just as a cashier will. It may feel like you shouldn’t be stagnant since you obviously work in a field that requires more skills than being a cashier. But stagnation isn’t about where you are currently. It’s about how you are growing. \n\n\nTL;DR: Try to invest more time in learning CS fundamentals and theory to see if it will give you a  new perspective for finding interests in this field. If it doesn’t or you do not want to do that, then you’ll remain stagnant should consider what would you be willing to do that for and how can you make a career with that.",

Most of us had to jump to different jobs to get a raise. In my first job I was making 80k. One year I got the most laughable raise of 1.5k. I jumped ship to another company shortly after that and increased by base salary by 50k. Had I stayed at that company 5 years ago, I would probably still be under 100k.",

I was a paper millionaire. YEAH BABY I'M RICH!!! Yeah not so fast, lol.\n\nThis happened right as the bubble started to deflate. By the time I had vested 1/4 of my options and could sell anything, the stock price fell 35-40%. And it kept on falling and falling and falling. Layoffs started happening, and by the time my number was called, about 7/8 months later, about 60% of employees had been let go. Stock price was in the toilet. But my strike price was really low, so it was still something. From my several millions on paper, I ended up getting about $75K out of it. Not horrible. That would be worth about $150-160K today. Not life changing money, but enough to put a downpayment on a couple of houses. Which in turn appreciated to where it is life changing money. So indirectly I guess I did get those millions.\n\nOnce I was laid off, I chilled out for about 2 months, I played a lot of golf. I got a pretty good severance package, IIRC 3 months of salary and health insurance for 6 months. Or maybe the other around. It was 20+ years ago I don't remember all the details. I wasn't really worried about money as I had lived fairly frugally and socked away a lot. Plus I had the option money.\n\nI ended up moving to a LCOL mid sized city and got a job there. My salary was much lower than what I had been making before. But accounting for the difference in cost of living as well as taxes (I moved from ultra high tax state to ultra low tax state) I was right about even.\n\nIt was a wild ride and it was exciting. It was a place and time that was special. I loved the experience. Plus I met so many people back then that I am still in touch with today. One of them started a company himself. He asked me to join, I would have bene employee 4 or 5, something like that. I passed thinking, dude no way this will ever become anything, look around you tech is dead. That company was later sold to Microsoft for MUCHO MUCHO money. Oh well, win some lose some.",

I think a lot of it will be changing focus and moving on to non junior work more quickly.\n\nThe shitty juniors who can't code their way out of a paperbag are even more screwed than before. Or maybe AI will let them be halfway useful to someone, as they bridge the role more towards PM and req analysis.\n\nThe regular juniors... the usual experience with interns/juniors is\n\n*  They just sit there waiting for you to tell them what to do.\n* They need clear instructions on what to do\n* They just focus on getting something out that works, not thinking of maintainability, testing, scaling, etc.\n* Try to sneak in their favorite language, library, framework when you aren't watching\n* Always push for a rebuild from scratch rather than understanding the code.\n\nAll of the above is replicated by LLMs. The regular and senior SDEs aren't necessarily better coders, we are just more proactive about what to do, suggesting improvements, watch for the above and know when to do each, ensure things are mantainable, thi k of broader picture etc.\n\nNone of these are difficult, but is hard to explain and normally something you learn by experience. A junior who quickly learns the above and acts more grown up will do well \"overseeing\" LLM coders. How to upskill people like that is a difficult question. One of the most useful classes in my university ended up being our software engineering class where we went through more \"BS\" type stuff like requirements, project planning, etc and built a big project as a class. Universities might need to dedicate another semester to that type of classes including LLM coding as part of building something large and making changes\n\n\nOf course, the next couple of years are going to be rough as companies try to upskill their current juniors, drying up the need for new juniors. \n\nIdeally what would happen is that any efficiency improvements would result in more projects so the labor market would be the same, but we're in this in between where that hasn't materialized, so companies are hedging their bets and holding off hiring until they know if there are efficiency improvements and more projects can be put in their 2026 plans and/or how their HR budgets change.",

I’ll warn that to someone with my level of experience it’s obvious that this sub is full of people who are barely into their career, and people who have done very little research into other careers.\n\nI can get another job easily even in this economy. It would be hard to get a job that pays as much as my current job does, but I’d still be making at least $180k. There’s very, very few other careers that can say something similar short of becoming a doctor. The reality is that becoming a software engineer is still one of your best options.\n\nBreaking into this career is hard. But so is breaking into most careers worth pursuing, and at the end other options will generally offer lower rewards than this one. If you network well, apply seriously and broadly, and do proper interview prep, eventually you’ll land something. I started out in a QA role that paid me less then my pizza delivery job, now I make nearly $300k.\n\nFar too many people in this sub preach about how you have to be passionate about software. That’s bull. The majority of the highly successful engineers I know, I’m talking people making over $300k, are very transparent they are only in it for the money. Passion isn’t a requirement. Being willing to work hard is. If anything the passionate people were the ones who tend to get suckered into longer hours and lower pay.\n\nThe only career people can even try to compare with the perks of software engineering is the trades, and that’s largely coming from people who don’t know much about the trades and are parroting what they’ve heard. The trades, on average, don’t pay nearly as much as software engineering. There are some exceptions, but even those tend to only pay the level of highly skilled senior software engineers, if we compare them to the exceptions for software engineers then engineering pay still generally blows the trades out of the water.\n\nTrade jobs that pay well are also highly competitive, trade jobs are limited to in person job opportunities, they’re incredibly hard on your body, they often require long hours, and they are rampant with sexism such that it’s hardly even a real option for women. Depending on where you live your race might also be a problem for the trades. If it were as easy to make a ton of money in the trades as some people pretend it is then everyone would do it. Yeah things are hard for software engineers now, but things are hard for everyone now. Computer science is still likely the best career for people willing to do the work. I’m not saying computer science will be easy. I’m saying nothing worth pursuing will be.",

You will learn more about the components in college, the earlier you learn this the better. Hellointerview is really good for this. \n\n4. Obviously DSA is critical. You need to be very comfortable with this. You will learn it in college, but getting started early can’t hurt. Lots of resources online. \n\n5. Learn cloud. Again, Microsoft tech isn’t used much. AWS is king, followed by google cloud. I would recommend learning AWS. You don’t have to be an expert but learn how to use it and what the different parts do. \n\n6. Make a GitHub account and work on projects. Especially anything cloud related and/or AI related. \n\n7. Don’t buy CS books (except school books). Everything you need can be found online, for free. \n\n8. I would recommend taking computer engineering instead of computer science, if you can. It’s half CS and half electrical engineering. You will learn how both the software and hardware work together, and if you decide you like hardware better, you can easily pivot to EE.\n\n9. Learn CI/CD fundamentals. Again, you don’t have to be an expert, but understanding how real releases to production work will help you be a more mature software engineer. Be comfortable setting up a build in something like Jenkins or Azure DevOps, for example. \n\n10. Learn version control. Git is by far the most popular. \n\n——\n\n\nMaybe I’ll add more if I think of anything else. But yeah, don’t get discouraged. There are definitely lots of people looking for jobs but it’s a great field and pays very well. You are always learning new things and always challenged, and you get to work with smart people.",

Had I known that it would've been hit as hard as it did, I would've gone into something else (probably medical or another engineering discipline). I will say that I do love coding, and a huge caveat is that I love frontend coding but don't care too much about being hands-on with backend/ML. The market is catered towards backend/ML and honestly wouldn't be surprised if frontend engineers specifically gets hit even more. So, as other people have commented, if you truly are passionate and dedicate yourself to fundamentals (use AI as a TOOL, not a solution!), then it will definitely pay off. I'm someone who is big in the life part of WLB, and I can say that this field doesn't really cater towards those type of people.",

Making it near impossible to solve the leet code - which were on the long side.   The system design interview took 10 minutes to try the app which completely failed until I opened up windows paint to complete.  \n\nI did bad and knew I didn’t pass - but at day 5 they asked me to schedule a meeting which was a Friday.   So I scheduled one thinking - no way did I pass but maybe they want to tell me something else.   Nope on Monday I wasted my day for them to call into the meeting - seemingly from their car to say “you failed try again in 6 months”.   Like I get you want to be polite - but just call me.   I don’t need to schedule anything.   I legit could have gone out Monday but now I was wondering what they wanted to tell me.   Completely wasted my day to “be polite”,  Amazon if you’re listening call people and leave a message if you want to be polite or send a rejection email with the option to talk to the recruiter. \n\nSeriously worst interview process by recruiters I’ve ever seen.   It’s like their recruiters are as over worked as the rest of the company.   \n\nIt legit feels like a terrible place to work - I’m not upset at losing the job opportunity- I could have done much better maybe but it did feel a bit impossible - the last guy wanted a suggestion class by frequency but just typing that in 30 minutes is a lot and he didn’t know what a trie was - also I didn’t know how to write a trie anyway ( my bad ) but I didn’t study it because the amount of code is too high for a question like this. \n\nBasically end to end terrible experience - the study links were nice but the system design links were bad - like those weren’t great answers honestly and in general system design with a mouse is bs.   If I ever do system design in the future I’m buying a touch screen laptop or a touch pad. \n\nEven the Amazon leadership principals just scream terrible place to work - “Amazon devs are right most of the time”,  and some stuff about challenging everything.   These are toxic traits IMO. \n\nAnyway - interview experience is interview experience.   It’s worth doing and you improve every time you go through it.  Learn from your mistakes - this is a good leadership principle.",

        "body": "Having interviewed with them three times, the answer is an unequivocal and resounding **yes**.\n\nFirst, there is little to no communication between recruiters, much less between departments. The first time I interviewed, I got the OA from two different recruiters and the one who had actually reached out had to send the other one an email letting them know I was already working with him. It's absurd that they don't have a system to take care of these issues.\n\nSecond, they have way too many \"leadership principles,\" and they contradict each other - you can't \"dive deep\" and \"insist on the highest standards\" while also having a \"bias for action.\" Their methodology for evaluating them is also extremely flawed, as they ask a question per LP and that is the only data they use to determine how you did. I told a story in one interview about being asked to lead a technical presentation for one of the biggest banks in the world after being with the company 90 days. I then learned (shout out to my recruiter for giving me any feedback) that I scored poorly in \"earns trust.\" Yeah, okay.\n\nThird, they basically abandon the whole \"data-driven\" methodology with their myopic \"raising the bar\" principle. Who decides how good the \"average Amazonian\" is? Through what process? Twice I was told I was \"at the bar but not raising it.\" Another way to say this is that they acknowledged I was better than about half the people there but they will continue to be employed by Amazon but I'm not good enough. Never mind that one of their LPs is \"hire **and develop** the best\" - if you're not one of the best already, you're not \"raising the bar\" and they're not interested.\n\nThere are some things they do well. They leave the qualifications intentionally vague to cast a wide net, and it's not just for show; they do genuinely give interview opportunities to a lot of engineers (like me) who wouldn't get them from someone like Apple or Netflix. They move quickly compared to other big companies and usually give you a definitive answer within a month of applying. But it doesn't matter if your interview process is better at selecting for [good liars](https://www.teamblind.com/post/do-people-lie-in-amazon-leadership-principles-interview-5hsrmdkz) than for good engineers.",

Some things I did:\n\nI slowed down how fast I spoke. This helped me think more before I speak.\n\nI also started getting comfortable with the pauses. You DON'T have to constantly keep speaking. If you feel you are losing track of thought, just slow down, recollect your thoughts and then speak. Most people think you need to keep talking and in such cases use weird filler words which end up sounding less authoritative.\n\nUse these documents that I spoke about in the post. For eg a quick 1-pager doc that highlights what you want to discuss basically acts as a meeting agenda and lays down all the things that need to be discussed - that way you don't have to remember / memorize anything. If that is too much, then just note down the main points that you want to discuss on a sticky note or something. In my experience, if I have a clear structure that helps me navigate from one point to another, I have less chance to lose track of thought.\n\nLmk if that helps.

I wouldn't say it's safe to assume most medium/large companies will offer 20 days of PTO. My new grad company was a F500 and offered 2 weeks. I interviewed with (and declined an offer from over it) a pretty large company that offered 15 days. There's also accrued vs lump-sum PTO to consider. And if it's \"unlimited\", what that means in practice depends heavily on the company/team culture.\n\nI personally don't normally ask about benefits in the first call... so I can't really give you advice on that. The one thing I like to get out of the way in the first call is salary. If our salary expectations aren't aligned it's a non-starter. Things like benefits I can be flexible on, 15 days for the *right company* and *right price* might tempt me, but I won't have a good idea of the company/team until I've actually reverse-interviewed the HM/SWE's.\n\nBut you definitely can't assume anything about 401k/PTO/medical.",

What things do you notice? Or maybe you aren't thinking about these things when you're browsing the internet because you don't want your experience to feel like work.\n\nThis is how I got better at form UX and really tightening up my code before review. In my casual use of the internet I come across forms all the time, and i think about how annoying ABC is because its clunky, or why XYZ is so frustrating to use because it doesn't respond how i would expect a modern form should. I take those real human feelings and use that when I code forms. \n\nA great real-life example is how annoying government web forms are because if you mess up you have to start over; how dated the UX feels and functions when you have to fill out all your HR paperwork online for a new job. How annoying and inconsistent the experience is when applying for jobs holy shit! hhahha\n\nAnd so what that translates to on the job is \"I just know how I want to feel when I use a form\" and in my effort to achieve that UX i just happen to check most if not all the acceptance criteria. I know how this feature should work because this is how I want it to work as a regular user. \n\nWhen you hyper-focus on requirements - often times you're just trying to execute that in your code, and you kinda lose sight of the overall picture",

The only way past it is to make some decision even if it end up being suboptimal. You need to break the tie.\n\nFifth, discipline. I hate it, most people hate it. But the phrase “hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard” still rings true. Whatever you choose to do, stick through it. If you’re an international student I’m sure that alone comes with a fair amount of discipline. Being thousands of miles away and still doing what you’re supposed to do everyday. It doesn’t matter if you join leadership or be an IC. You need consistency and discipline to see results.\n\nLastly, I’ll say is, while learning to keep going is important, learning when to pivot is even more important. Note I didn’t say quit. Pivoting is just redirecting your energy to what makes more sense for you and your interests. You have limited time and limited energy, you can’t do everything heck even Superman can’t. So you need to learn to prioritize and pivot.\n\nFor right now, rest assured that 2 years is a drop in the ocean for a potential pivot to a rewarding 40-45 year career. You’re not a lost cause, you’re just young. I promise you everyone is as confused as you are. Just start something small even if everyone has done it and stay out of your head so you can keep marching forwards with whatever pivot you choose in your life.",

It's very much a class based masters and the majority of students don't do any research. If your goal is to find advisors, ones who can write the type of letters that get you into grad school, you can certainly  do that. I'd ask on r/OMSCS for stories, but I know it's possible.\n\nI was also interested in Type Theory (Haskell programmer at the time) and unfortunately I didn't find any faculty working on that. I wasn't going back to grad school (did that once), though, and my main focus for doing the program was to get a better grip on CS fundamentals and help grow my industry career. For that, it was extremely effective and I got into big tech pretty soon after graduating.  \n  \nI did find this: [https://omscs.gatech.edu/research-opportunities](https://omscs.gatech.edu/research-opportunities)   I'd check that out. All that said, the way I got into a PhD program was by working for a professor as a lab tech, doing good work, and getting into the program hosted by the school. To get into a PhD program, grades and papers help, but what it really comes down to is one professor with influence speaking on your behalf. If you push, that should be possible with OMSCS.",

I mostly want to do the Masters for myself and I assume any reasonable CS Masters probably carries *enough* weight for job market purposes. Juts not sure if maybe OMSCS might actually be the safer route job-wise (I'll probably still just go to Stony Brook but wanted to collect the info).",

I have a biology undergrad, was working as a Haskell programmer at a small start up, and 2 years after graduating I made it to a big tech company with pretty good pay.

You probably have standup in the morning since you are talking about stories and points, is this correct?\n\nIf so, you should be advertising that Senior Dev has requested X / Y  / Z changes and that means the story is going to take longer than initially planned.

Sprints are there to collect data for velocity not some hard deadline.  If you are constantly rolling over stories the solution is for the team to agree to less points in a sprint.\n\nIf anything this pattern should show that you need to agree to less points because you know the Senior Dev is going to drop the hammer late in the sprint.\n\n> I just want to meet the original expectation of my story before going further and doing more work.

Those stories can be added to the next sprint in exchange for other work if they are important enough.\n\nYou should be talking about this like this with your boss in 1-on-1s.

It drags me down in completing the original task that was assigned to me and the story has chance to rollover and nobody wants that.\n\nWhat \"nobody wants\" is not your problem. This is the way the cookie crumbles: More work takes more time. It has to come from somewhere.\n\nAnd you need to say so.\n\n>\"it should be quick\". \n\nSo.... estimate it and see if it's true. Also \"quick\" isn't the same as \"still fits in the sprint\".\n\n>I try not to take it personal, but it's getting harder. It's like he purposefully tries to put me in tight spots to try and get out of it. And it's not like I'm trying to not work. I just want to meet the original expectation of my story before going further and doing more work. The changes he talks about make sense, I just think they can be added in a productive stable manner.\n\nDon't tell us, tell him.\n\nHe might listen, or not. But the main choice you get here is whether you roll over, or stick to well-defined processes, all which tell him that he shouldn't do what he is doing.",

Hearing feedback like no negatives but the other candidate had more experience is a tough pill to swallow, but it’s a reality in competitive hiring at your level.\n\nFocusing your prep on high-impact coding patterns and refining your behavioral storytelling can be the difference between a pass and a miss. Interviewers often look for clear problem-solving and communication, not just raw technical skill. For support, there are strong Discord communities centered on interview prep where you can connect with peers facing the same challenges; if you want, I can share links.
