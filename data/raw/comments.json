I had experience on paper although over time I never really improved.  It goes without saying this was well before the advent of AI and also chemistry is a field where all of the answers aren't on Google.\n\nOne of the reasons I wasn't improving was because I didn't like the field I was in.  I didn't have passion to improve and felt like I was entitled to more than I actually deserved just because I had X years of experience on paper.  In the meanwhile, people who were much younger and less experienced came in and were smashing it purely because they had drive, passion, and a desire to improve.\n\nLost my job during the 'rona pando, attended enough interviews for a chemistry job and didn't get any offers even though I felt the interviews went well.\n\nI thought I was a great chemist who was underappreciated.  In reality, I was discovering in real time that I was a subpar, disgruntled chemist at best.  Thought I was faking my way through the interviews, getting all of the technical questions right, but in hindsight, none of it mattered because even though I knew all of the answers, there's no point hiring somebody who doesn't want to be there which is the energy I gave off subconsciously.\n\nOffering this as an alternative perspective because sometimes the answer isn't necessarily trying harder.\n\nParaphrasing although a famous MMA coach once said that there are a lot parallels between life and your style of fighting.  Loads of people in the martial arts community start trying to emulate their favourite fighters without considering that style might be unsuitable for their physiology, essentially training on \"hard mode\" by doing something they aren't designed to do instead of putting energy into discovering their own style.  Life is similar - people try and obtain success or financial freedom by copying others and wonder why they have to work so hard to achieve so little compared to the person they're trying to emulate, essentially being on hard mode by their own design.\n\nWe are all designed to do something well and it is up to us to find what that is.\n\n>How did you push through? Or did you change direction?\n\nI have always loved computers and technology.  I changed careers to DE.  Much happier now.",

For Python I picked up [Fluent Python](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1492056359/) and that helped me get a deeper understanding of the language beyond just copying code or relying on AI.

You don’t want to make sure your 300 billions records are unique every time you add a new row.\n\nBut the concept of unique identifier should be introduced into almost all tables. That unique identifier is normally a surrogate key. Surrogate key are unique identifier derives from other fields. For example a md5 hash of the concatenation of 4 columns. This give you a unique identifier.\n\nWhat’s great about surrogate keys is that they are not random. You get consistency in any systems, if you migrate to another platform your surrogate keys are still valid and that’s very powerful. \n\nAlso you can reproduce the same results over and over again, which is not possible if you use a UUID generated by another system for example.\n\nThen depending on the tool you use you can validate the uniqueness of the fields yourself. \n\nThere’s some reason you might want to do this yourself and not the system like you would have in a normal db and is that because you can have multiple time the same records or a different version of what you consider the same records.\n\nSince the DW is for analytics you might want to analyze those different records which are not unique in your raw layer but could be in your marts.\n\nSo it’s a powerful thing to let you control de uniqueness of the fields yourself.\n\nObviously if you don’t manage it you’ll probably end up with a lot of duplicates. But since the DW store all your data it’s better to avoid having the constraint on inserts and give the users more flexibility. Because he might need all version for what he is trying to achieve.\n\nTLDR; yep a surrogate key should be something you have in all tables (when possible)",

(~3YoE, more in data space as a non-engineer, so view my comments through that lens however you will).\n\nTesting is a problem, yes. Especially when you work with things that are closer to ML, that have testable behaviours that only manifest when working on a huge dataset with specific patterns. This is not an intractable problem, though. You still can factor your code correctly and cover with unit tests as much as you can, and write queries for ongoing data quality monitoring (a good data analyst will be a very important ally in this activity). For more complex stuff, talk to your platform/infra/governance people about having a \"sandbox\" environment - prod data but all the sensitive parts masked. \n\nNobody understands the complexity? That sounds like your org needs more \"less technical\" people like analysts, not less. And yes, you as a DE need to be in touch with them, because they will be able to tell you what to expect of your data.\n\nPeople questioning numbers when they don't match vibes? Honestly that sounds like something a data product manager/owner has to tackle. As an engineer, all you can do is deliver data quality assurance, and point to that. After this it's with the PM/PO to sell the value of the team's work.\n\nVersion control issues? Yes, that happens when an org has a lot of DAs/DSs with more science/business background. I think the will to do git appears after one or two incidents when someone does a breaking change that nobody had a chance to review, or accidentally deletes some script on some server somewhere. If your data team is subsidary to technical leaders in the org chart, I think they're usually sympathetic to the idea, and you can go through them to push git adoption. You can also smooth things along by writing a \"git for dummies\" document for your DS/DA. No need to deep dive into advanced features, just teaching them commit/push/pull and merge requests should be enough. Do make sure your main is protected in all your repos, though.\n\nStuff outside of your control, but you have to fix it? That exists, yes, but I don't think that's unique to DE. Don't backend devs in microservice-oriented companies deal with the same problem?",

If you really value a connection, give that connection a means to contact you, but don’t give a company more resources that didn’t value your time enough to do the same for you. Give it your best effort to build transition materials in your remaining time, but once you come to your end date, part ways.\n\nIf you worked for a non profit, or something where people’s lives are on the line, maybe make an exception but for anyone else, nah. They got by without you prior to you starting and they will get by without you after you leave, it’s a little egotistical to think otherwise.\n\nETA: Just want to add, if you do make the transition seamless, it may be harming your coworkers more than it would if you just let it fail. The problem you describe is a systemic problem of not prioritizing debt/technical need, and if you give the company an out to have it \"all work out in the end\" they won't address this systemic problem. They need to feel the consequences of their actions, because higher ups only notice the problem when it causes money to be lost, and that's how you actually see change in management/practice.",

As with all dev work there's a fair amount of \"it depends\" to be had in any situation, but I can't see where this level of normalization would ever be useful inside a data warehouse.\n\nI think people pursuing this behavior have lost sight of the \"why.\" The Star Schema model was originally created during an age with storage was the scarce resource so it was important never to store duplicate data. Nowadays, storage is so cheap it's practically free so it's compute that we must optimize for. Having to do dozens of `join`s to gain context on every record certainly doesn't support that. \n\nUsually, I practice some form of what you might call \"Star Schema Light\" in the silver layer where I create tables around business entities. So all the 'user' dimensions would be in one table (and it would probably have a companion SCD table), all the 'session' dimensions in another etc. Then these can be  `join`d and de-normalized in gold to expose to BI tools as needed while analysts can still have some flexibility by using the silver tables. \n\nHaving said all that, be careful.

That's how transactional databases are supposed to be. A star schema is a denormalized schema (it breaks the rules of normalization, 3NF).\n\nYour use case doesn't look very \"star schema\" to me as many to many relationships should be rare. Another way to reword this is that the UserTag entity is a fact table. You could add a date / calendar dimension to this fact and this would allow you to see how many users one tag have, which users have which tags... It also depends on how \"fast\" these tags are attributed. Could they be considered an attribute to the fact? It is hard to decide without having a closer look at your use case and the data.\n\nRegarding the surrogate keys. You don't need them on all dimensions. You need them on SCD2 dimensions, and not all dimensions need to be SCD2. You also need SK when combining data from different sources into one single dimension, and they don't have a common key.\n\nRegarding the project... 20 people working on one single star schema, 2 years. That's insane. Do you work in insurance? It sounds like something massively overengineered which goes against the premises of dimensional modeling: easy to query.",

Assuming your whole team is fundamentally competent, the frequent late nights suggest someone is promising too much and/or failing to manage expectations. The bad news is that can happen anywhere. But if it's the norm, then it's probably time to move on and parlay the recognizable name into a better role.\n\nYou can definitely find consulting companies that take quality of work more seriously. I don't know how to vet them besides just talking to people in similar roles. When you do, ask about the sales process, the role of vendor partnerships (this can almost singlehandedly determine your technical focus!), how they go about scoping, how satisfied clients generally seem, etc. If you get engineers to answer those questions, that will shed a lot of light on the kind of environment you might be stepping into (which is tightly linked to the kinds of clients your sales and marketing people are able to reach).\n\n(Edited to add: If those discussions make it sound like that firm is bent on pitching solely AI everything these days...huge red flag. Obviously I'm speaking from my own biases here, but IMHO it's a recipe for perpetual scope change at best, and completely unrealistic expectations at worst. Too many un-serious people selling to other un-serious people who are spending still other un-serious people's money for no clear reason. Naturally, YMMV.)\n\nBy way of background, my data career has been solely in consulting. It's been about 10 years at a couple of relatively small firms (in the 100–200-person range) so I don't know what things are like at much larger ones. I have worked in-house before but in a very a different field. Overall, I'm satisfied with my career path, but it has its drawbacks, especially if technical learning is your *top* priority.\n\nThere have been long periods where my technical skills stagnated. Once I've reached a certain degree of experience with our bread-and-butter projects, most of the work is on the business logic and requirements side, not the technical side, since I've probably done it a dozen times before.\n\nObviously I'm always keeping up with developments from vendors we typically use (and what's new from others to some extent)...but it's not like I'm frequently taking on entirely new kinds of projects. That's not a bad thing in my book! All those less- or non-technical skills are extremely important. What's more, even if selling the same solution repeatedly isn't the most technically exciting, it's one way to keep increasing your effective hourly rate.\n\nGranted, my favorite clients have been smaller ones (like a few hundred staff members or less) who need all kinds of random data things solved. Sometimes that does require unfamiliar technologies, which are often equal parts fun and frustrating at the same time. But those more open-ended projects, where I'm sort of the \"data guy\" on call, are inherently less specialized, and often less lucrative as a result.",

Workflow orchestration** → tools like Airflow or Prefect help automate pipelines  \n**4. Cloud platforms** → get hands-on with BigQuery, Redshift, or Snowflake  \n**5. Distributed processing** → look at Spark once you’re comfy with batch workflows  \n**6. Streaming** → Kafka or Flink if you’re targeting real-time data jobs\n\nYou don’t need to learn it all upfront.

They can save a ton of boilerplate and handle all kinds of logging and monitoring for you.\n\nBut I seldom recommend them for transformations and usually suggest dbt instead. Plain SQL is both faster and easier to work with, in my experience, once you've ingested the data. (Maybe low-code is still quicker if transformations are trivial, but nobody hires me in that case anyway!)\n\nThe irony is that I always hear vendors pitching the transformation capabilities hard, and suggesting that *that* will make customers faster, more productive, etc...as though the need to write SQL was the real bottleneck. So management buys it on that premise, doesn't get the massive boost they anticipated, burns an insane number of cloud credits in the process, and enthusiasm wanes.\n\n(Bear in mind nobody's calling me when things are going great, so this isn't necessarily representative.)",

I think because:\n\n* They haven't managed to make a good enough transition to the Cloud and distributed computing. The best version of this software still runs on local machines.\n* AI suddenly made programming language solutions “simpler” for business users to create small ETLs and local automations. A few years ago, these users would have made the transition from Excel to Alteryx/KNIME paying for the server and consultants with a smile on their face.\n* They haven't been acquired by industry giants. At the time of the recent acquisition of Alteryx, it was even rumored that Salesforce or Oracle might acquire it. It didn't happen, and fighting Microsoft/AWS/Google alone is a hopeless task.\n* Death of communities. Part of what justified buying Alteryx licenses was how active and helpful the user community was, but just as is happening with Stackoverflow, AI is taking away the relevance of these communities.",

Are you going to write a new pipeline to do that, or edit the existing one and re-run on the same input data?\n\nAnother example I didn't see mentioned is data size. Your pipeline might be written such that it extracts a delta of changes in the input db table and writes them to the output. This is because just copying the whole table every day is too expensive, and the changes are expected to be small, so could instead use a smaller machine. Now what do you do if the processing logic changes?\n\nOf course there are solutions to write a pipeline such that it handles both entire data and deltas, but those solutions always depend on the specifics of the input. It's often much easier (faster) to have a 2nd pipeline for full reloads, configured for a bigger machine, etc.",

But it works more or less the same as those hackthon coding test, it is also easy to cheat, even the question is a well crafted one, as long as the candidate has a very close friend who is a good developer. (Yes we do see cheating in this kind of coding test, basically, the hundsband help the wife). But for hiring a senoir or even intermediate dev, this is ridiculous. All employed seniors have tons of work to do,  no one will spend more than 4 hours on this kind of test, especially, there will be hours of interveiw coming up potentially. Also we will be careful to not helping the hiring company solving their problem. Thus it is more difficult for us to finish an assignment (I assume you will give serious difficult take home assignment in this scenario) without helping the hiring company to solve their problem. I would say, if you are a junior dev, take it, learn the new knowledge, if you are a intermediate to senior dev, just pass by, don't spend time on it. Meaningless, the one who review you result might be even less experience than you and give a false judgement and decide to not move forward with you.",

        "body": "Alright, this post can make good use of additional clarity.\n\n\n- Is primary_hash just a fancy way to say ID?\n\n- I hope you understand the implication of hashing, because in this context it is a trap, and you’re jumping right into it. First, order sensitivity: {a:1, b:2} and {b:2, a:1} can spit out different hashes depending on your algorithm—hope you’re normalizing inputs. Second, collisions: no hash is truly unique, so your primary_hash or payload_hash could, in theory, screw you over with duplicates. Third, compute cost: hashing big payloads (especially JSON blobs) chews up CPU. For large datasets, you’re burning cycles when a simpler key or checksum could do the job. Also, good luck debugging when someone tweaks the algorithm. Do stick to lightweight identifiers or deterministic keys unless you’re solving world hunger.\n\n- Your source system just yeets full or incremental loads at random? You're really telling us is just a coin flip? Scour their docs for a pattern—there’s got to be one. If it’s truly a coin flip, build a check (like record count or metadata flags) to detect load type. Then branch your logic: full load = overwrite or merge, incremental = append or upsert. A simple if-statement saves you from nuking 95% of your data.\n\n- Why the urge to slap a boolean is_current on everything? Your UPSERT logic already yells “this row’s alive!\". Regarding your last_loaded_ts: you just called it business_ts few words before!\n\n- Detecting deletions always come down to one of two. Check if the source emits delete events (docs, again). If not, periodically poll for IDs and just IDs. Another news: although a row is being deleted from the source system, it's not mandatory you have to delete it as well: just flag it (aka soft deletion). Overall, if you can ingest incrementally and poll for just IDs, you are saving money and drastically simplify the process.\n\n- Data retention: S3 (or Fabric’s storage) is dirt cheap for raw data and time travel queries (i.e., SELECT * FROM table VERSION AS OF '2025-01-01') have been invented in the 90s. If storage costs creep up, archive old partitions to cheaper tiers like S3 Glacier. Keep Silver/Gold lean for business logic and aggregates—don’t make them history dumps. Set a retention policy (e.g., 1 year hot, archive the rest) to balance auditability and your wallet.",

        "body": "one of the classic medallion architecture pain points! The delete logic with incremental loads is a nightmare we see all the time.\n\n**For the incremental vs full load problem:** Your boolean flag approach is on the right track. What works for us is having a `load_type` field (FULL/INCREMENTAL) alongside `is_current` and `last_seen_ts`. For incremental loads, we only update records that actually appear in the batch - never delete based on absence.\n\nThe trick is tracking what constitutes a \"complete picture\" at the source level. We usually maintain a separate metadata table that tracks when each source last did a full refresh, so we know our baseline.\n\n**Storage and history management:** Bronze is the wrong place for long term history imo. We keep maybe 30-90 days in Bronze for reprocessing, then archive to cheaper storage. The real historical tracking happens in Silver where you can be more selective about what actually needs versioning.\n\nFor cost control, consider:\n\n* Partition by load date so you can easily drop old data\n* Use Delta's time travel for short term history, separate archive for long term\n* Not everything needs full history - focus on business critical entities\n\n**Quick pattern that works:**\n\n* Bronze: Current state + recent changes (30-90 days)\n* Silver: SCD Type 2 for entities that need history\n* Archive layer: Compressed parquet in cold storage for compliance\n\na reference of 3 tier architecture: Bronze, Silver, Gold layers: [https://cdn-cednl.nitrocdn.com/ZIEpBLjPiSWpOcIdsSTlIdzcQJzKTmWw/assets/images/optimized/rev-21cfb01/www.datatobiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Azure-Medallion-Architecture.png](https://cdn-cednl.nitrocdn.com/ZIEpBLjPiSWpOcIdsSTlIdzcQJzKTmWw/assets/images/optimized/rev-21cfb01/www.datatobiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Azure-Medallion-Architecture.png)\n\nWhat kind of data volumes are you dealing with?

Based on what I've understood so far, this is definitely at least a few weeks of work for my team, because we'll first need to crank the wotsit then analyse the doohickey, before we can build the XYZ itself.\n\nIf applicable, you also need to make the distinction clear between how long _once the project starts_, and the lead time _before you can start the project_. How you do that depends how projects/work items are prioritised at your place, but make sure to set expectations that the work isn't going to start right away, unless of course it can. \n\n**If you do this well, after enough repetitions, the \"easy\" people will learn more about how things work and probably won't say it any more.**\n\n### footnote\n\n(1) Honest doesn't mean as low as possible. Include padding for uncertainties, include time needed for adequate testing, documentation, etc. Honesty does include communicating the error bars on the estimate; I like Uncle Bob's approach of providing three estimates, a worst-case, best-case, and likely middle-ground. Honesty also means not being more precise than justified: eg \"a few weeks\" is better than \"3 weeks\" if you don't have enough information to be really sure it's 3 weeks.",

This year I have seen LLM's are also part of DE's and many bootcamps are including those.",

We have to think differently. \n\nThat pedantic message aside, we can take the concept of unit tests and apply to data engineering. We need three things. \n\n1. Known input state (What data are we reading)\n2. Work (Query, task, function, something that transforms data)\n3. Know expected output state\n\nDbt and SQLMesh do this with their own concept of unit tests. I'm sure other platforms have their own solutions. If you want to roll your own it is fairly simple in theory.... \n\n1. Create known data that shows the characteristics of what you want to test.\n2. Run the portion of your pipeline that you want to test.\n3. Compare the output to the expected output. If it matches you are good. \n\nThis is not that hard in small pipelines, but very difficult to maintain in big pipelines. Imagine a SaaS company with 10 subscription plans and negotiated contracts. New stuff being added every day. 800 data sources. It's really tough to maintain a test suite. \n\nThis problem has not been solved in the industry and whoever solves it will be very rich.

From there you just get better at breaking down these transform functions to make it easier to write unit tests for. You can also write your runtime data validations as functions in the same way and write unit tests for those to make sure they catch bad data.\n\nThis separation of transform code and connecting/reading/writing code makes it easier to abstract and consolidate the latter and write integration tests for those.\n\nSo in your hypothetical “process_data_to_silver.py”, assuming that’s an etl task will likely not need much unit tests of its own. It’s simply importing a dataset processing function, passing it inputs, and then publishing the output. You’ll be confident it’s processing and validating as expected because the function itself is covered.",

One technical project manager I worked with was pursuing one, but he left before he finished it.\n\nThe reality is CFA is an extremely difficult certification, each level has a sub 50% pass rate and the only reason you should pursue one is if you want to become a person who professionally is allowed to give investment advice or directly manage a portfolio.\n\nThe technical problems we solve don’t require that intimate knowledge of investment vehicles and financial planning, so anyone hiring for technical positions would far value technical aptitude over whatever CFA would bring to the table. Even people who worked closer to the business side (product management, business systems analysis) didn’t have CFAs. Some management did, C levels definitely had it, except for technical C-suite who held PhDs instead.\n\nImo spend your time on something else, and working at a place like that is really not as difficult as you expect, but your best path in would be going to a good school, doing well, interviewing well and living nearby. And I really found the work soul draining, you work to make rich people richer and have to wear a tie every day. People there drink heavily after work too.

A lot of folks in data look to deepen their finance knowledge, but the CFA might not be the most direct route if your goal is to stay in data engineering.\n\nCFA is a serious time and energy investment. It’s incredibly valuable if you’re aiming to become a portfolio manager or financial analyst who makes investment decisions—but for a data engineer, the overlap is limited.   \n  \nMost technical roles at places like Citi, JPMorgan, or Bain don’t require or expect a CFA. What they *do* value is domain familiarity: understanding how financial data works, how to build pipelines for it, and how to surface insights that support the business.\n\nA more practical route might be building out your finance knowledge in parallel with your engineering work. Things like:\n\n* Learning how to wrangle financial data (from market feeds, statements, or transactions)\n* Building dashboards for KPIs like revenue, risk, or portfolio performance\n* Working with time-series forecasting or valuation models\n\nThere’s strong demand for data engineers with finance context—it’s just more about hands-on skills than credentials. If you're interested, we’ve got some finance-focused tracks that lean technical: Python for Finance, Financial Modeling in Excel, and Financial Analysis in Power BI. They can give you the right foundation without going all-in on CFA.\n\nThat said, if you’re considering a career shift toward investment roles or product strategy, the CFA might be worth it—but it’s rarely a game-changer on the engineering side.",

Not sure how big the team is but it sounds like a lot of stuff to glue together and maintain.\n\nI have quite a bit of experience working with multi-tenant data architecture, and almost always they benefitted significantly from shared larger data warehouses rather than per-customer instance, so I suggest centralizing. Down the line some new usecases will require cross-client insights, some new developments will benefit all the customers at once, and you'll thank yourself.\n\nIn terms of the architecture, it sounds like SQL-only stuff might not fit the bill here. I would suggest:\n- land the data in your dwh somehow\n- run transformations in SQL as much as possible, go with python where needed.\n- stay off of Spark, I don't see any benefit here for you, it is a complicated piece of software that is not even modern at this point.\n\nFor individual pieces, you can either go bit by bit, e.g. one tool for ingestion, another for transformation, orchestration, etc. There are quite a lot of good alternatives, e.g. Fivetran + dbt + airflow. I suggest taking a look at [ingestr](https://github.com/bruin-data/ingestr) for ingestion stuff.\n\n[Bruin CLI](https://github.com/bruin-data/bruin) could also fit the bill here since it is like dbt, but does ingestion, transformation with SQL and Python, orchestration, quality, and governance. It is open-source, you can run it anywhere you'd like.\n\nHit me up if you'd like to chat, sounds like an interesting problem you are tackling. Good luck!",

The goal here is to make sure you accomplish something, have a defined finish line and don't just resell them back the same used car they were driving with a new coat of paint.\n\n1. Make sure there is total agreement as to WHY you are doing this. You need this before you use any brain cells on the technical or tools side of the house. This needs to be in writing and preferably signed off by all stakeholders. None of these reasons will be technical. They will all be business oriented. This step needs to be very well documented and agreed on. Don't let anyone push you to rush this one. I usually take 3-4 weeks for this. Sometimes it takes longer. These are all of your project success criteria. Why was a decision to replicate what you already have made? The longest path to anywhere is a shortcut.\n\n2. Now that you have that, figure out WHAT they don't have that they need. Every single one of these needs to tie back to a WHY. If it doesn't tie back to one, discard it or update the WHYs and get sign off again. I'm talking reports, dashboards, messaging, etc. Do not start coding yet. This is also where to start to identify if you have the data to achieve these items. Don't limit yourself to the current state of affairs. I cannot emphasize how important it is to tie these back to WHY items. \"Because we've always had them\" is not a reason.  Validate existing data products to see if they are sufficient or even needed. This is where you start to clean house on all the crap that data warehouses collect.  \nThis stage will also start to get you thinking about the relationships between the types of data. Not a data model, but a bit higher than that in conception.\n\nNothing up to now has been technical but these are by far the most important parts of the projects. It will be very tempting to jump into the weeds, don't do it. Your post already suggests you are starting at the wrong place.\n\n3. Now you can start to design the data warehouse. I would start with the data model. Figure out what type of model you need. Don't take what is already there unless it can be heavily justified. An operational data store is not the same as a data warehouse. You don't get too many opportunities to do this in any one company.   \nThrow away all of those marketing terms. They won't help you.  \nA traditional three tier DW has never steered me wrong. Activities, like data cleansing and data standardization, tend to happen as you move the data from one tier to the next. Stage is used for landing data. I tend to make my core in 3NF and any data products (stars, materialized views, etc.) in the semantic layer. You do not need to have everything built out before you start using it but do have as much as possible planned out and written down. \n\nGenerate regular deliverables to the business and be able to show how they address the business needs you identified in step one. If they can't be tied back, ask yourself why you are building them. This is a VERY high description of how you refactor or initially design a data warehouse. It may seem overwhelming but just break it down into chunks and always be thinking about the future. These things stay around a long time.",

Get your view definitions under version control on GitHub then use GitHub actions to push them to postgres when you make updates. If performance starts to become an issue, then look into an orchestrator as you might need to start materialising these into actual tables.\n\n- make sure your view definitions are under version control. Look into dbt to make this easier to manage.\n\n- on data viz, sure you can use tableau but I personally have found it a bit clunky when I've used it in the past and it can get very expensive. Recently started using Sigma computing - less pretty dashboards but I think way easier to use. But honestly if you use one of the usual suspects (Tableau, Power BI etc) management can't really blame you. I don't really know anything about Kibana but if that's working for you why reinvent?\n\n- on natural language querying - your job on this is to NOT implement anything and find a diplomatic way of telling management it's a bad idea. If they insist you try it, look at setting up AI agents where you can constrain their behavior to running queries you predefine, and prompt it to say 'i don't know' if non technical users stray out of those guardrails. I know the Google genai and openai APIs both have functionality to do this kind of workflow.\n\nGood luck",

        "body": "One other thing to consider is that Powerbi premium installs outside of Azure are not straightforward.  If you are on AWS for instance, you need to build a Powerbi gateway to talk to Azure where the dashboards and data will sit, so you are paying probably for a scaling cluster depending on your projected usage.  Then you need to carefully think through your BI architecture because you are paying to move data off AWS to Azure, so you want to minimize that as much as possible.  If you do it by caching on the Azure side for performance, then it requires you to move all the potential data that people could use across to make it available.  You could also use direct query, where it queries every time someone refreshes.  You only pay for the same query compute once a day because Snowflake caches the results, but you still move the data to Azure every time.   So it has an impact on your gold data architecture, how you develop your data products and the extent to which you have decentralized access to a variety of data.  \n\nPersonally after using Powerbi for about  a year after migrating off another platform, I would pick a different one that plays nice with your cloud and is more accessible to the business at large.",

Airflow is more popular, and you would find more people available to work on it, documentation, etc. Secondly, while creating a Medallion Architecture on Snowflake is fine, personally I would keep the bronze/raw layer outside of Snowflake (blob storage) to save costs. In my current project, we are using ADF for ingestion and orchestration. It works well, does the job, and we have fewer tools to maintain. While proposing a solution, in addition to tying tools to requirements, also include the scale, fault tolerance, security, and deployment features of the tools you choose.",

Start with XS warehouses, auto-suspend at 60s, and schedule ingestion windows so you’re not spinning up clusters every time PowerBI refreshes. Incremental Airbyte syncs plus dbt’s stateful models keep data volumes down; full reloads should be the rare exception. Kestra can kick off a Snowflake task that flips the warehouse to Medium only for heavy transforms, then shrinks it back. Use resource monitors with hard fail at 80% of monthly budget and track spend with the Snowflake usage view piped back into PowerBI. For SharePoint pulls, land the files in cheap object storage first and stage into Snowflake external tables to avoid compute on every file read. After trying Fivetran and Matillion for finance data, DualEntry handled multi-entity consolidations without blowing up credit usage. Dial in governance early and the setup will stay affordable as they scale.",

Pick one small goal (like replicating an ETL you’ve already built), and use your credits just for that. Document what you do—it’s great for your portfolio.\n* **Databricks Community Edition** is another solid option—it’s limited, but you can still get a feel for Spark + notebooks in a cloud environment.\n* **Mock cloud architecture projects**: Even if you can’t spin up real services, diagram out what you would build. Treat it like a case study: describe the data flow, tools you'd use, how you'd deploy and monitor it, etc. Interviewers love seeing your thinking.\n* **Volunteer work or open-source projects**: Some nonprofits or small data teams are happy to have help setting up basic pipelines. It’s a longer shot, but worth exploring if you’re on LinkedIn or GitHub.",

Developer/Team/Enterprise are all tiers within dbt Cloud, and yes, the semantic layer for PowerBI is Cloud-only. Fusion is a feature within the Cloud product.\n\nHere's the thing though: we were on the Teams plan and everything was fine until we hit 8+ people. Then dbt Sales basically forced us into Enterprise tier. The initial quote? $300/seat/month on a 3-year contract. Even after heavy negotiation we only got it down to $220/seat/month.\n\nFor context, that's $26,400/year for 10 people, which feels pretty steep for what's essentially a task scheduler running on top of open-source dbt.\n\nIf you're just getting started with the engineering side, I'd honestly suggest sticking with dbt Core + your own orchestration (Airflow, GitHub Actions, whatever). The semantic layer is nice, but probably not worth $20-30k/year for a small team. You could build your own metrics layer or look at alternatives for way less.\n\nJust something to keep in mind as your team grows. The jump from Teams to Enterprise pricing is brutal.",

They also are sort of limited in that you can't build a full model with multiple tables, each semantic model is 1:1 with a dbt model, which is one table or view.  If you use an obt data structure then you are good.  If you have a star schema or something like that that you want to represent semantically then it doesn't work.  We wanted to to do a PBI on top of dbt thing too, but ultimately just built a big model in PBI because it did what we needed it to.

Our tech is oversaturated with buzzwords and abbreviations for no good reason.\n\nSo I've read the article and I find it very interesting. I agree with many points, especially about idempotency. And I also have a few questions:\n\n1. From my experience, layered data platforms aren't made only for the sake of business. Materializing intermediate datasets with pieces of business logic can be necessary to maintain good cost/performance ratio. Especially when the data is big, and your ETL system can only handle data increments in a timely manner. At the same time, proper naming convention and an appropriate architecture (Kimball, DV) makes the data easier to navigate. Does this align with your vision, and if not, why is your way of doing things better? Or is it?\n\n2. Implement all transformations as pure functions - it makes me think you're advocating for ETL process instead of ELT (aka using compute engines like Spark for data transformations). I make this assumption, because implementing pure transformations using sql is much more tricky, and people with expertise in sql, but no expertise in OOP may struggle to do it consistently. Even tools like DBT require careful model design to achieve real idempotency. With this in mind, don't you think having all transformations as pure functions is too costly?",

If the schema changes or more columns are available, *as I remember it* you get a warning/error, that something has changed in your profiling. Not the actual change I think. But again, not sure.\n\nAs for point 4, it generates a report that you manually have to click on and open. Actually quite nice overview in the automatically generated reports with stats on all your metadata in your profiling. It is annoying that you have log in to a different system to see them, but you can extract the metadata through the API if you want to collect it in your regular data warehouse and do your own reports.\n\nBut it is expensive.

Talking about your example, I would split them up, keeping one change per changeset. Also, createTable and createIndex should not be considered a single operation. It is very common to create indexes sometime after the table is created. e.g.. Create the table, ingest the data, then create the indexes.\n\n2. Again, I would not keep them in the same changeset. Having the CREATE OR REPLACE clause helps make the change idempotent, but the function and the trigger are still two different objects.\n\n3. I believe in this case, you should add a rollback for the trigger.\n\nAgain, as I mentioned earlier, I don't have experience with Liquibase, and I'm aware that following the guidelines strictly can make everything more laborious, so please take it with a grain of salt. I don't think you should be so strict if you are creating the database from scratch, for example. In that case, I would develop changesets to create multiple foreign keys and indexes, for example. However, on an already ongoing application, that solution would not be optimal.",

That's really all that's required for dash boards, real-time searches and fast lookups etc.   \n  \nI'd imagine people would output a pre-processed table from a daily pipeline, ingest it into Warp, then query it throughout the day.",

For example, Warp is benefiting greatly from the OS caching disk data:  \n\\- Cold reads (from disk) hit around 5GB/s  \n\\- Warm reads (from cached pages) can hit 200GB/s+\n\nCurious how large you're thinking? If a single column fits within memory (say <32 GB) this should run extremely well on repeat queries on similar data (eg when a dashboard is loaded). The data used so far is \\~100GB per example (individual columns are a fraction of this).\n\nIt's not designed for truly massive datasets (> TBs) yet, that'd require NVME raids and/or distributed nodes. I've tried to keep it small so it's cheap to run (I suspect a lot of cloud users are paying more than they need to for their small/mid data sizes). However, def keen to learn more about what real users expect!",

I suggest reading some database literature; definitely room for innovation and quality of implementation improvements, but no need to reinvent all the theory. \n\nAnd there's different philosophies of design (\"in memory\" or not, distributed or not, etc, etc).\nSome (many) algorithms degrade poorly when the amount of data is larger than the system's available memory. It's not just about the size of data; it's also about whether there's a performance cliff (or a point where you outright start failing).\n\nYou're not wrong, a single machine can do a lot. One of my colleagues posted this recently: https://datamonkeysite.com/2025/07/21/does-a-single-node-python-notebook-scale/\nSingle nodes have gotten very powerful. But then again, smalk workloads don't always stay small. Having room to grow is good too, as is not having it be \"works on my machine\".\nI work on a distributed, autoscaling OLAP database engine (Fabric Warehouse) that's capable of efficient single node execution, or scale out, depending on what the query needs. So I'm not necessarily convinced one really has to choose between small scale efficiency and being capable of going distributed. But at the same time, you've already got a huge project on your hands as it is. \n\nIt's a very interesting space, with lots of hard problems and competition. Good luck!",

There were arguments to be made for separate - the data volume of these use cases is lower than our analytical workloads, and so Azure Functions/Logic Apps could be sufficient. However, then we would need to use a non-Databricks orchestrator, which would be a bit annoying for some of the multi-step operational workflows. Doing it in Databricks meant that all of our data jobs live in one place and are orchestrated through one set of tools, regardless of whether they’re operational or analytical in nature. Databricks Asset Bundles have been great for us in this regard, in terms of allowing us to define our job configurations as code. \n\nOnce we got past that, we came back to the medallion. We landed the operational data in its own schema in our bronze catalog, but rather than moving it to “silver”, we created an operations catalog that serves as the use-case layer for all of these operational pipelines. They’re still sourced from bronze, and in the future, we might source analytical “silver” tables from either the bronze or operational catalogs, but this approach has been working well for us.\n\nWe leverage Databricks secrets (backed by Azure Key Vault) for all of our connection secrets, and give our service principals READ access to the scope in each environment. We have also modularized our code for SFTP/FTP into a helper library so we don’t have to maintain the same logic in each pipeline. We try to stick to asynchronous patterns for our downstream writes (e.g. we drop off a file somewhere and some downstream system picks it up), but if we had to, we could also make a direct API connection and write our data that way. We just haven’t really had to do that for our use cases thus far.",

Do you have any pointers there?\n\nAlso curious what your SFTP code does.

Keep each migration focused on a single, clear purpose (like adding a new role or adjusting privileges for a group). Version control these migrations alongside your schema migrations, but prefix them or organize them in a way that makes their RBAC nature clear (e.g. use filenames like \\`20250724\\_add\\_readonly\\_role.py\\`).

If you can, well placed prints/logs/LED blinks can do the same thing though (bonus for not changing what your code does other than side effects or timing)\n\nAnd really, 500 lines of code should probably be broken up into smaller routines so you shouldn't have to tackle it all at once, anyways.\n\n> 2.

Perhaps having that basic understanding of how the hardware worked helped.\n\nI knew I had to learn C#, and that I would be doing web app development for work, so I just set myself the goal of building a social network site, not one that would be live anywhere or with scalability, just one that technically worked.\n\nI wrote out the list of features I wanted, profiles with personal info, picture uploads with compression, posts with comments and likes/dislikes, a friend list with the ability to add or remove people, and a search to find people on there.\n\nI looked up how entity framework worked, and followed about 30 mins of a tutorial for setting up a code-first database, but made models for my own project instead of copying the tutorial ones. I do remember having a little confusion on how to store and model references for comment chains, but google and a stack overflow post helped with that.\n\nThen I did something similar for authentication, integrating it with the models I had already made. After that there was some googling on how MVC worked, and how to pass models around. I’m pretty sure I went overkill on that, as I didn’t know just how much ‘just worked’ and how much I had to manually implement.\n\nAfter that it just sort of snowballed. I’d move from feature to feature, working on each, and googling very specific things when stuck to find stack overflow or random blog posts, which I could just read through and then implement myself. The second half of that month was a lot of fun seeing everything come together and work. I’m sure if I could find the codebase today, I’d shake my head at the quality, but at the time, I was very proud of it.\n\nHonestly, I never found any struggle at all when it came to learning the basics and putting something together. I didn’t hit a brick wall until I was getting into things like trying to implement algorithms directly from academic papers, and that’s mostly because I don’t always follow the terminology or notation correctly. There’s also usually a couple of times a year I come across some incredibly elusive bug that takes me a week to figure out. I find the hardest part of the job is looking at large projects written by other people with a differeng style, and having to unpick everything and figure out how it works. \n\nI know when I was a teenager, I always wanted to learn, but never did because I wanted to do everything perfectly first time and not waste even a second of time by picking the wrong thing, but as soon as I needed it for work and just had to figure it out look for a new job, it turned out to be so simple I wish I could have gone back and slapped my younger self for all the delaying.\n\nI’m curious, which part in the process is the challenge that makes it harder? This post is interesting, but it definitely feels like there’s a degree of overkill to the process!\n\nIf someone can really verbalise what makes the whole thing a challenge to them, perhaps I can help? I know it sounds weird, but I’ve been doing it for so many hours now that it’s hard for me to imagine not being able to, but I would very much like to help if I can somehow!\n\nAs for your conclusion about shifting mentality, that is one thing I do try to reiterate to people, nobody in tech support or software development really ‘knows’ it all, we just know that if you sit down and do some searching, as well as thinking through each problem step by step, you’ll get there in the end, there’s not much to it. Yes, some stuff gets passively memorised over time, but other than a handful of keywords and simple logic, you don’t need anything else to start working on a project. You’ll be slow, sometimes it takes a while to find the correct answer online, but overall, you can fundamentally do it.\n\nI do think some people believe we’re joking when we say that 50% of the job is figuring out what to google, but it is mostly true. Programming languages are not actual languages, you don’t need to converse in real time, and therefore you don’t need much stored information to do it. It’s far more like a trade skill, like plumbing or carpentry, anyone can do it, the difference between a new learner and an experienced developer is simply how quick and how well polished the result is. \n\nIf I give you some wooden planks, a saw, a hammer, and some nails, you can build a table. It might be a shit table, it might collapse as soon as you put weight on it, but you can do it. After you do it once and find the flaws, you’ll do it again better the next time. The same is true here, if you have an IDE installed, and have a web browser and a list of keywords, you can build an app, it might crash, or be slow, but you can build it, then you go again and you’ll do it better and faster next time.",

        "body": ">I'm completely unable to \"think like a programmer\".\n\nBut it can be learned.\n\n>They're right, thinking like a programmer IS the hard part. \n\nYes, it is, but as said, it can be learned. What you do is make a list of tasks. If you can't think of how to solve the task, you split it up again. If you can't solve the individual parts, you split those up again. And again.\n\nYou wanted a way to 'describe it in English', and this is possible. You distill the core of the problem by focusing on what you want to do and the nouns in the problem description. You must first clearly state your problem. For example:\n\n- Problem: \"I want to know how often a word appears in an array of words and write this to the screen.\"\n\nDistill the core:\n- array of words\n- count how often\n- word\n- write to screen\n\nTo do this, I need:\n- An array of words (so I must define this).\n- A way to keep count (so I must define some data structure for this).\n- A way to look at each word in the array. (Thus I need a loop to pass by each word in the array.)\n- A way to decide if I already counted the word before (if yes: increase counter; else add word and set counter to 1)\n- To Write the result to the screen\n\nSimple code (pseudo; language is not important yet):\n```\ndefine array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana]\ndefine keep_count = object\n\nfor every word in array_of_words {\n\tdecide if you counted the word before\n}\n\nprint_result(keep_count)\n```\n\nNow you have the array of words, and a way to keep count. The thing you didn't work out yet was \"decide if you counted a word before\", so that's what you do next:\n\n```\nif word is in keep_count {\n\tincrease counter for word by 1\n} else {\n\tadd word and set counter to 1\n}\n```\n\nSo now you put that solution into the previous block of code:\n\n```\ndefine array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana];\ndefine keep_count = object\n\nfor every word in array_of_words {\n\tif word is in keep_count {\n\t\tincrease counter for word by 1\n\t} else {\n\t\tadd word and set counter to 1\n\t}\n}\n\nprint_result(keep_count)\n```\n\nThen refine it a bit:\n\n```\ndefine array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana];\ndefine keep_count = object\n\nfor every word in array_of_words {\n\tif word is in keep_count {\n\t\tkeep_count for word: increase by 1\n\t} else {\n\t\tkeep_count add word: set to 1\n\t}\n}\n\nprint_result(keep_count)\n```\n\n\nAnd you're done. You've written your program. Now you only need to translate it into the language you are using. A large part of the starting year of a computer science education is actually learning to do this, starting with small things like this and increasing the scope of the problems you're solving. Alongside this you'd learn about often-used data structures and algorithms.\n\nRepeat this again and again for years and years on end and you'll get good at it.\n\nThis is a skill that can be learned, but not in \"Javascript bootcamp\". The above is programming; \"javascript bootcamp\" is writing code in Javascript. That's trivial compared to actually thinking up the solution.\n\nYou always start with a problem, which you'll break down in smaller and smaller parts (where each part can be a function, which is also broken down into smaller parts), and in the end you'll be left with a (very long) list of tasks to do.",

Making use of tools that are magnifiers are really only going to help experienced software engineers. You can’t amplify nothing and expect that to go well. College assignments are designed to be bite sized and have rails. We design them so most students can figure it out and learn. Of course AI can do an ok job at those. Your classmates are losing the chance to learn how to learn and believe me, look at what tech looked like in 2005 and see if you don’t agree that the one skill you need to get in college more than any other is learning how to learn things on your own so you can adapt.

        "body": "If AI can write code, it can run a company.\n\nIf there's ever a point where you lose your engineering job to AI, everyone in almost every industry that touches a computer will.\n\nCurrently AI writes dog shit code and the people that love it write dog shit code.\n\nThe issue with the job market right now is that the economy is absolutely fucked and particularly the CS industry. A lot of venture capital dried up post covid and the value of the american dollar was cut in half almost overnight.\n\nThere's also billions if not trillions in AI startups that haven't even turned a real profit yet. That money invested in AI isn't going into proven tech like solar, wind, electric cars that are a future trillion dollar industry.\n\nSo it's really convenient for large companies (like amazon, meta, and microsoft who all have gigantic investments in AI) to say they layed off 20k employees because \"AI could do their job.\" If that's true, show me a video of AI doing all the coding and customer service. I don't believe it.\n\nThese companies are probably tightening their belts in a bad economy, pinning it on how awesome their AI investment is doing, framing it as profit and saving money, boosting their stock price. And when interest rates on loans go down, they can hire everyone back.\n\nA lot of these companies were also \"benching\" people. Hiring top talent employees just so that they don't go build a competitor product.\n\nRealistically they probably laid off a ton of benched talent and other people they didn't need. The economy is awful so it will be harder for them to find a job. There's less access to capital so they probably won't be able to find investors. They can blame it on AI, watch their stock price shoot up. Save a ton of money on paying humans, and make their minimum corporate loan payments.\n\nMeanwhile your classmates are drinking the AI kool aid that startups have been pumping out for decades.\n\nIf an LLM can code better than a fresh graduate, there will be no reason to hire young computer scientists. I doubt your friends are thinking this far in advance.\n\nThat said, there are tons of papers on how LLMs and ML are close to the limit on how effective they can be. I think all large AI companies summed together are taking about 1 Great Britains worth of power to run. That's an insane amount of energy. Elon is using coal to power Grok which is mind blowingly stupid. It's causing health problems in the surrounding community near his data centers.\n\nI think every time you want a significant improvement you need an order of magnitude training data increase, as in add another 0. 1b > 10b > 100b > 1t. One trillion is 1 thousand billions. It's not just a big number. It's a number so big that there may arguably not be enough data to train it at a certain point.\n\nWhen AI trains on data that AI generated it fucks itself and starts outputting shit. This is a theory as to why so many giant LLMs like claude and chatgpt are getting worse. One reason might be that the nicer version is behind a paywall, but the other is that these llms might be consuming so much AI generated text that it's degrading them permanently and there's no real way to separate human from AI generated content on a platform that has billions of users.\n\nYou may actually get to watch an entire industry enshittify in under 5 years, which is pretty cool IMO. It might be a once in a lifetime event.\n\nAdvances tend to be S curved in the sense that you logarithmically increase a plateau of improvement, and then you get a material advance in conditions or approaches that allow you to exponentially increase towards another limit. Vaclav Smil's book on growth is basically like reading the back of a screwdriver but it's great at illustrating this point. It's almost a law of progress given enough resources.\n\nRealistically AI will increase, but it's largest limitation is energy consumption and training data requirements. These two things are kind of inherent in ML from what I understand and a lot of what people are doing to improve ML is incrementally improving it.\n\nMy theory is that there will be a new AI paradigm that will be cheaper and require less input. Remember your brain can pitch a baseball, play chopin, cook a 5 star dinner, drive a racecar, and fuck elons mom and it only runs on the amount of power it takes to run a lightbulb.\n\nMy recommendation would be to recognize that your friends are idiots, the hype is a smokescreen, and to just get good at coding and pass your classes. You will more than likely struggle more than your peers in school. As the problems get harder, you will struggle less and they will struggle more. And when it comes time to get a job you will be extremely rare in that you can actually code and your peers cannot. It will probably be easier for you to get a job.",

This is all very valuable.\n\n\\> What can I actually *do* with these skills? Is there any career path that values competitive programming? Or should I just start from scratch with web dev like everyone else?\n\nWell, new flash for you. There are essentially no applications out there that are not fundamentally web applications. Today anything that is user facing is either a mobile app, a game, or a webapp. Every other kind of development are essentially in support of application developers. Why do we make operating systems? So that we can make applications to run on them! Why do we make databases? So that we can make applications better. Why do we make AI models? So that we can use them in applications.\n\nSo should you learn webdev. Yes, you absolutely should. Because most applications will be web apps. Now you don't necessarily need to be extremely good at it. Especially if you are going to work in more inner layers of computing. But no one will take you seriously if you don't seem like you can cobble up some application up.\n\nI personally never really do front end work. I hate it. But the easiest way to share what you do is to set it up as a webserver of some kind. I tend to focus on the back end pieces where most of the interesting computation happens.\n\nWhat should you do? Where should you go? I don't know. It depends on what YOU want to do. But it seems to me that you want to solve deeper problems than making a cute applications. And good for you, I hate that shit too. How are you going to get a ob, well, you are going to need to find  company that does this kind of work. You need to figure out what you care about and what you want to do.\n\nThere are plenty of database companies. There is plenty of work in server administration, cloud, and infrastructure. There are plenty of needs in AI, model, development, optimization. There are plenty of jobs in various kind of data mining. We still need compiler people. I had a student hired to write kernel modules. There are a lot of \"systems jobs\".\n\nTo qualify for them, you need good system understanding.

In 90% of the jobs out, saving 10ms of execution time isn't a goal (unless your in trading software for example).\n\nI'd much rather have someone who writes clear, understandable code and help them understand performance than the other way around.\n\n>I don’t even know where to use the problem-solving and coding skills I built up\n\nThe reason why is the problem solving skills you learned are not the problems you face in the real world. You figured out how to write some algorithm in the fastest execution time possible and out in day to day life people are writing integrations to make 2 systems talk to each other, aggregating data from 3 different databases into one export, building API's with infrastructure that scales based on user load.\n\n>Or should I just start from scratch with web dev like everyone else?\n\nYes, its what is in demand and jobs are looking for. You are more than welcome to say \"well i don't want to learn web dev\" and attempt to land jobs on old stacks no ones taking (like winforms) but if you limit yourself to just c/c++ your options become even smaller (game dev, embedded dev...etc) as a new grad.\n\nThere are backend, front end and full stack roles. Look at whats in demand near you but i imagine you'll see more full stack/backend than just dedicated front end roles these days (At least i do in my area).\n\n>Anyone else been through this? How did you figure it out?\n\nIf you enjoy programming and building stuff, you should stick with it and learn a more marketable skill within the domain.

Here's some of the things I found from students who were in similar situations (1 hour a week schedules).\n\nI saw a comment below that said to teach them ABOUT the world of programming and computing, rather than actual programming, and I think that is the way to go given the constraints. That being said, here are some opinions/advice for IF you have to go through the programming route:\n\n\\- Language Choice: Don't use Unity if they aren't going to be doing things on their own time. I tried with a student once, who specifically asked for it. The result was that nothing got done, and nothing was learned because there isn't enough time to understand concepts without homework / self learning. Sure, he could memorize some scripts, and make something move, but at that point, is that really programming? I eventually convinced him to move to Python.\n\n\\- I would center my approach around the concept of \"how computers work and how to think systematically\". If you make the content of the class enjoyable, and make the learning fun/interesting, then they will want to do more on their own time. Instead of making a curriculum around \"how much can I get them to learn in this time frame?\" (As other users have said, that is no where near enough time), make it be \"How do I get them to learn a few cool stuff and develop an interest in wanting to learn more?\n\n\\- The above point is why I would pick something like python, or even html/css/javascript (yes, 2/3rds of those aren't \"programming\" languages). The reason being the lower hurdle of entry to getting something they can make working, and they can see they made. I used to believe that if someone wanted to learn properly, start them in C. Nowadays, my viewpoint has changed to \"Start them in python so you can hook their interest with a lower bar of entry, and THEN dump them into a language like C#/Unity/Language of choice once they understand the basic concepts and are interested in the next steps\". Heck, if they are interested in AI, staying in python is great.\n\n\\- You said you tried before and it was too confusing for them. I don't know how you explained it, but I'm going to give 2 extreme scenarios as an example. Look at this from a students point of view. \n\n  \\- Scenario 1: You go to class, you need to either learn what int main(int argc, char \\*argv\\[\\]) means, or be told to memorize and learn it later. The former means needing to learn functions, args, arrays, return types, and more. The latter is encouraging not critical thinking. After that, you do printf(\"Hello World\");. Then you need to learn what compiling is, and how to run the program. All that for Hello world.\n\n  \\- Scenario 2: you go to class, you type print(\"Hello World\"), and it shows up on your screen the line below. You made something. Your teacher can now introduce concepts one at a time, each with you making something. For example, maybe you introduce variables next, and create a Hello, name. Then functions, and create a print\\_spam. So on. Since I was tutoring, I was able to tailor projects to each student's interests (Instead of random number generator, I can do random kpop member or something), but for a classroom, it should be more generic, and maybe more open ended as a project.\n\n\\- Going to say this point again: with so little time, The best curriculum in my opinion is one that gets them interested and learning how to think critically, rather than one that dumps as much info as possible that they may or may not retain.",

You’ll be surprised at the opportunities that can come from having these skills, so I like to think of programming as a skill, not a job. \n\nWith a basic understanding and a desire to put it to work, choose your areas of focus carefully. It’s tempting to dive into a little bit of everything, but in my experience, especially with newer people, they offer more to a team when they come in with some capability in a certain role. You can always learn what you need to about other areas on the job, but if you decide you like front end stuff, dive into it and do it strategically. Maybe ask an AI what front end frameworks are in the highest demand right now… pick one, like react, and learn it well. \n\nThe sooner you can start contributing something to a team, the better. Too often we see juniors in our world who are smart and capable but need too much handholding, so coming in with a real understanding of what you’ll be contributing to and you’ll be shocked at how grateful senior people are to skip the handholding phase.",

For example:\n\n    put(stderr, \"x = \");\n    put(stderr, x);\n    put(stderr, \"\\n\");\n\n> The type of the argument determines which \"put function\" will be invoked for each argument. However, this is too verbose. The C++ solution, using an output stream for which `<<` has been defined as a \"put to\" operator, looks like this:\n\n    cerr << \"x = \" << x << \"\\n\";\n\n> [...] The idea of providing an output operator rather than a named output function was suggested by Doug McIlroy by analogy with the I/O redirection operators in the UNIX shell (`>`, `>>`, `|`, etc.). This requires operators that return their left-hand operand for use by further operations.\n\nSo basically, the stream operators exist to allow a convenient and concise way to output multiple values.\n\nIn modern C++ you could accomplish the same goal with a variable-argument function using templates, but early versions of C++ didn't have the advanced template features needed to make that work.",

But on the other hand, I’ve seen quite a few complaints about the pricing being unclear upfront and the content not going deep enough once you get past the basics.

I’ve also been using Codefinity, and I totally agree it’s a solid platform for beginners, especially if you're starting from scratch or looking for a structured way to learn Python and other programming skills. What I appreciate most is that it's very hands-on. You can write and test your code in-browser without needing to install anything, which makes it super convenient for people who don’t want to mess around with IDEs right away.\n\nIn terms of beginner-friendly platforms, Codefinity definitely ranks up there. The lessons are bite-sized, which helps with consistency and reduces the feeling of being overwhelmed. I also found the AI assistant to be surprisingly helpful. It’s great for quick explanations when you're stuck or just need something reworded. That kind of interactive support is something a lot of other platforms don’t offer, especially not at this level of integration.\n\nHowever, the pricing model is a bit of a downside. Like you mentioned, it’s not very transparent upfront. You get into the lessons and then suddenly find out about a subscription. I think they could do better there. And yes, some of the early Python lessons are very basic, which might not be ideal for those with prior experience. But if you push through the first few modules, the content does become more challenging and engaging.\n\nWhat I’d love to see from Codefinity is more intermediate and project-based learning paths especially for things like data analysis, web development with Python, or real-world app building. That would make the platform not just a good starting point but a long-term learning tool too.\n\nFor anyone searching for a Codefinity review, wondering if Codefinity is good for beginners, or looking for online platforms to learn Python, I’d say give it a shot just go in knowing the pros and cons. It’s especially helpful for people who like learning through doing, rather than watching endless tutorial videos.",

I’ve been testing out Codefinity myself, and I think it’s a pretty underrated option for learning to code especially for anyone starting out with Python or just dipping their toes into programming. If you're searching for an honest Codefinity review, here’s my take:\n\n✅ **What I liked**:\n\n* The platform is clean and beginner-friendly. No need to install any software—you can code right in your browser, which saves a ton of setup time.\n* The course structure is well-paced. Lessons are short, interactive, and easy to digest without feeling overwhelming.\n* The built-in AI assistant is a nice touch. It’s not perfect, but when I got stuck or needed something explained in simpler terms, it actually helped me move forward instead of getting discouraged.\n\n🔍 **Things to be aware of**:\n\n* As others have mentioned, the pricing model isn’t super transparent. You’ll probably get into the learning groove and then be hit with a subscription prompt, which can be frustrating.\n* The early lessons might feel *too* simple if you already know the basics. It starts very slow, but it does pick up and get more practical.\n\n🎯 **Why I’m using Codefinity**:\n\nMy goal is to learn Python for data analysis and later move into web development. I’ve tried platforms like Codecademy and Udemy in the past, but Codefinity has been the one that’s helped me stick with a routine. The gamified elements and instant feedback really help with motivation.\n\nOverall, if you're searching for the best platform to learn Python for beginners or wondering is Codefinity worth it, I’d say yes with a few caveats. It’s great for building foundational skills, but you may eventually need to supplement it with more project-based or advanced content from elsewhere.\n\nCurious to hear what others think have you used Codefinity for longer than a few months? Did it help you move into real-world projects or jobs? Are there better alternatives for learning Python step by step?\n\nLet’s make this a helpful thread for anyone researching Codefinity reviews or trying to choose the right coding platform in 2025.",

        "body": ">my brain automatically tells me that I don’t understand what’s going on\n\nThis sounds like what people call a \"mental block\", and I think learning to defuse that involves a lot more learning *how to learn* than it does learning how to do computer science. Heads up, this is probably going to sound more like I'm trying to give you therapy than anything else.\n\n**Step 1:** Validate yourself. *It is totally normal to struggle learning this*. It's a hard fucking topic, half the resources online are dogshit, and significantly more than half the people you meet online trying to talk about it are probably going to call you dumb and/or lazy. You're not. You're allowed to struggle, and in time you'll come to learn that failure is positive; but I full appreciate that it doesn't look that way right now.\n\nI'm a senior dev and data scientist. I've dropped out of multiple degrees. There are some leaderboards on leetcode-esque sites where I'm in the top 100 in the entire world. Sometimes I make mistakes that a child would laugh at.\n\nThe struggle is just part of the journey, and comprehension will come with practice and time.\n\n**Step 2:** When your mind is settled and ready to be curious/compassionate, think back to that feeling of \"my brain automatically tells me that I don’t understand what’s going on\" - what's *actually* going on there?\n\nWhat's going on is your brain throwing up barriers; an anxiety response, not necessarily a cognitive one. \"It's better to stop trying than to risk failure\", or something along those lines. I bet you do know a bit about programming. I bet you could tell me what a variable is, how to make one, probably what a function is, and so on. Remind yourself of the things you *do* understand and try to connect them to what you're currently struggling with.\n\nWe beat anxiety by breaking things down into tiny little pieces until they seem surmountable. We win by starting very very simple, and going very very slow, if we have to. Every time you don't understand something, every time that \"I don't get it\" response pops up, *stop struggling*. Tend to it. Take a breath. Talk it through with yourself - break it down into the smallest, silliest subproblem you can. Address just that one tiny subproblem. Didn't work? Break it down even further. Take a break the moment you feel like you're making negative progress, because that is a real threat in these kinds of situations.\n\n**Step 3:** The real outcome we're looking for here is a mindset change, because (as much as it sucks) coming up against frustrating or overwhelming problems is just a part of doing programming. It's tempting to think \"how do I avoid this?\" but it's more productive to instead think \"how do I process this and learn from it?\" - because it is gonna keep happening.\n\nWhen your brain wants to say \"I don't get it\", try to reframe: you don't understand *yet,* you're still in the process of learning. What tool can I use to get past this obstacle? How have I managed these situations before? Am I hammering my forehead against a wall here; and if so, can I change strategy rather than getting more upset it isn't working?",

Learn the wrong way to do things too, it'll help you figure out the right way to do things. Write shitty spaghetti code. You'll improve over time.\n\nTry something simple like building a number guessing game. Add features to it: make it so you can select a difficulty which sets how wide the range of numbers are. Implement a limited number of guesses. Etc etc.\n\nTake what you learned from that and do something more complicated. Try making a shopkeeper for a fake rpg game. Add items to buy. Make them have descriptions, and a cost. Give yourself an inventory. Give yourself a wallet. Make it so you can list items in the shop. Buy said items. Maybe use CLI-style commands to buy the items. Make it so you can buy multiple at once. Add ways to earn money. Make them more complicated. Eventually turn it into a playable CLI game.\n\nThere's just so many ways to learn how to code that are better than staring at tutorials all day. Learn how to think like a coder first. When you have all these requirements/constraints, sit down and think about how you might write code to make it happen. Look up how to actually do that thing you need. For the guessing game, clearly you need a random number, lets say between 1 and 10. Look up how to generate a number between 1 and 10 and store it. Look up how to get user input. Look up how to compare values. Look up how to let a player guess again if they are wrong (aka how to loop). Etc. Figuring it out yourself is ALWAYS better than following a tutorial.",

        "body": "It's definitely a shift when you go from an intro programming tutorial where you to have a sequence of things to learn to building a project where you learn as you go. I'll give an example:\n\nMy first project was building a game. This wasn't web (I used Python), but the same idea should apply. A bit of Googling led to me learning there was this nice Python library called Pygame. I poked around at tutorials just enough to figure out how to display stuff on the screen, and then I started designing my game - thinking about how I needed a hero, platforms, monsters, etc., how to represent those in classes, and how to draw things on the screen. A bit more Googling revealed that a game typically has a \"main\" loop with a delay at the end where the goal is to get user input, update various things (hitpoints, etc.), and draw the next frame. So I mostly figured out how to do that but had to turn to tutorials for a few things like animation and how to make jumps actually look like jumps.\n\nSo you're still using tutorials, but you're using them **as needed** rather than following a long tutorial beginning to end. I do find when looking at a tutorial to help with a project, it's useful to first try out a few simple examples in a small program before incorporating into your project. So in the example I gave, maybe I'd make a small program to display images or even little filled-in circles on a screen and then try to make them move in some pattern.\n\nIf you want to try full stack, Flask and sqlite are pretty beginner-friendly for the backend if you don't mind picking up Python. (If you want to stick to Javascript, there's NodeJS on the backend, but I've never used it myself.) You could also do something that's pure frontend but still fairly involved like making a single-player game.",

Spending an afternoon learning how to use your IDE's debugger will save you hundreds of hours later.\n* Trace the execution path systematically - step through your code in the order it actually runs, not just how you think it should run. Use the debugger's \"step over/into\" functions or add print statements to follow the flow and catch where logic diverges from your expectations.\n* Use 'Rubber duck debugging': explain your code line by line to someone (or a rubber duck). You'll often catch the issue while explaining.\n\nDebugging - like programming - is systematic. Don't approach it like guesswork, but like a detective or scientist: observe the symptoms, form hypotheses, test them one by one, and let the evidence guide you to the root cause.",

        "body": "That's the wrong approach. Randomly changing things will likely break stuff.\n\nHere's the analogy. Imagine you have a car (and I'm no mechanic), and it's having some issues. You open the hood of the car, and start randomly doing stuff, hoping the problem will go away.\n\nDo you think that's a solid approach to fixing the car? Would a real mechanic do that? No, they would try to figure out what the problem is. Of course, being experienced, they have a series of tests they can do to isolate the problem and the confirm it is the problem, and they have an idea how to solve the problem.\n\nIn a way, you need to do the same. Randomly changing your code is not going to fix it just like randomly doing stuff to a car engine won't fix it. You need to understand your code.\n\nBecause I've taught beginners, I've seen this \"I do random stuff and hope to fix it\" before. Why do beginners try this approach even as they would admit, it won't likely work.\n\nIt's because the code looks daunting. If I say, tell me what each line of code does, one step at a time. Be the computer. Do each step. To a beginner, that seems like crazy slow. It would take forever to do that (even though they wrote the code). Random fixes is a lot quicker. Do something rather than do the right thing which is slow and tedious.\n\nOK, so some steps.\n\n**Determine why you think your program is broken**\n\nI've had students who tell me their program doesn't work. When I press them, and ask \"what's wrong\", they just say it doesn't work.\n\nWhat they really need to say is, \"I think this is wrong because when I put in value X, I get answer Y, when I expect Z\". Those three parts are key. What input (X) did you use? What answer (Y) did you get? And what answer did you expect (Z)? \n\nThis is the first step to debugging. Why do you think it's wrong?\n\n**Try a smaller input**\n\nThe next step is to put in the smallest input that causes the problem. Sometimes, we'd give students some sample inputs that were pretty lengthy. Their code would break, but it was hard for them to figure what was going on because the input was so lengthy, they didn't know what part was causing the problem (imagine the input is an array of numbers).\n\nThe first step is to see if it can handle the smallest input possible (say, an array with one element).\n\n**Test your functions**\n\nA smaller version is to test functions. Determine\n\n* what are the input parameters\n* given certain input values, what are the output values\n\n**Write more small functions**\n\nInstead of writing one big `main()`, break things up into small functions. Then, you can test each function.\n\nWrite a comment for each function and give some sample inputs and expected outputs for that function.\n\n**Test as you go along**\n\nDon't write all the code with no testing, then test after you wrote all that code. This won't help if the code is already written, but can help in future coding.",

I figure that at this point, people will look at the work I've done and what I can do, because I've had a decade to produce things, but perhaps if I hadn't made anything yet, it'd be much more helpful to indicate I had a vague idea of what I was doing at least.\n\nSome members of my family like that I have it for some reason, but personally, if I could go back, I wouldn't bother.

But a lot of companies in bigger cities also started to let their employees work from home. And yes, you can become a developer with no degree. You just have to be very good at it. More than half of my coworkers in tech actually didn’t have any CS or SE degrees.\n\nDegree is always a plus. I also got a degree in SE. But honestly it’s all about how hard you study/code, and how much you know in depth about programming and related topics. I know a guy that has high school diploma, but he started coding since he was 13. He has worked with PayPal, Google, etc. He started from a smaller company. With connection from that small company, he just keeps growing. \n\nYou can get a degree related to it, and it does help imo. I got a degree, but I wasn’t doing the best when I was in college. I switched from business to SE and it was gonna take extra year in college. I ended up trying to do as many credits as I could in each semester, absolutely regret it. I almost failed in every class. Didn’t have time to actually study what’s going on. And yeah, it sucked when I graduated and needed to land a job. I ended up doing online tutorial to refresh my memories before I was able to land an SE job. My degree helps a lot on resume, but I think your projects you will be doing matter more. Companies want to see what kind of things you’re capable of doing. I could be wrong. I’ll wait for sr dev or someone to give some more opinions about it.",

It shows you're not giving up, and that's a mindset you must keep if you really want to become a programmer - especially a good one.\n\nIn general, experience > degree. I'm not a CS graduate myself - I actually studied chemistry - but I've still found my dream job writing code. It's absolutely possible.\n\nBecoming a good programmer is so much more than just hitting keys and shipping code. You'll need to accept the endless grind. In the beginning, everything feels exciting and kind of easy. Then reality hits. And honestly? There's barely any course out there that truly teaches you how to think like a developer - the pattern recognition, the problem-solving mindset, the \"sixth sense\" for asking the right questions.\n\nThat said, not studying at all is a bad idea. You don't want to end up without direction or skills that can support you. But studying doesn't have to mean going to university. I'm from Germany, and here many young people start paid trainee/apprenticeship programs for around 3 years to learn a profession. Maybe something like that exists where you are too?\n\nIf university isn't an option for you - especially if it's expensive or forces you into debt for something you're not passionate about - then yeah, don't rush into it. It could become a trap.\n\nGiven your situation, there's no guaranteed path. But if I were you, I'd try to find a mentor - even if it costs money. Good guidance can save you a lot of wasted time and effort.\n\nAlso: besides programming and avoiding university in your city, what else interests you? Maybe you can find some creative crossover - tech isn't just web apps and games. There's a lot of space to combine different passions.\n\nWhatever you decide, don't just think about the next year. Think in decades. It's your life - build something that lasts.",

No. They could just give you array construction and indexing and leave writing methods like map(), reduce(), join(), forEach(), find(), and so on up to each programmer. And then somebody would write a library that has 50+ methods that do all those things, and everybody would include that library in their code, except that some people would use a different library or no library at all, and you’d be here asking why the language doesn’t just expose all that functionality so that it’s standardized.\n\n> Seems like massive overkill.

I know people can get ROMs from game cartridges by using a special reader that plugs into their PC and lets them insert a cartridge in it and then dump the data from the cartridge (such as [this device](https://www.cartreader.net)).  I haven't really heard about people extracting data and editing the code though, just playing the games with the ROMs..\n\nIn some cases, it sounds like you can save (AKA \"dump\") game cartridge ROMs directly on a console and save them to an SD card.  For instance, for a Nintendo 3DS, I found [this guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide/dumping-titles-and-game-cartridges.html).  For older systems,\n\nTo look at the code though, you could use a disassembler and load the ROM into it - but it would only show you the assembly language instructions; you can't extract the original higher level code (i.e., C) from that.  Reading assembly code and understanding what it's trying to do takes significant effort, as it's about as low-level as you can get.  And if you want to make changes, you'd modify the instructions and re-assemble it (it doesn't get re-compiled like a higher-level language does).",

I don't want to say things aren't bad - they are - but things are **always** bad in one way or another. Tech-related jobs have been in constant flux for at least decades, Your aim should be to make yourself as employable as possible **even as** the world changes around you, which it will continue to do. The best way to do that is to avoid jumping on bandwagons and to learn the solid skills necessary to adapt. You are already doing that with your engineering degree.\n\n>Should I start learning Python just to keep up with everyone?\n\nYou should start learning Python if you're interested in it, and not if you're not. Python is a great tool. But also, not everyone will be a Python dev in the future, and **not** learning Python frees up valuable time for you to do something else. (You can also learn Python later if you want to. What's stopping you picking it up at age 50 if you need to?)\n\n>Any advice or roadmap would mean a lot right now.\n\nMy advice is: everyone's roadmap looks different. Yes, you should work hard - but whether that means \"get a paid job\" or \"aim to get a high grade\" or \"learn Python\" or \"learn French\" or \"brush up on your maths\" or \"do some volunteering\" or \"learn interview skills\" or one of a million other things depends on you. All of those things are good, and different employers will value different skills, and no one person can do them all.\n\nYou also shouldn't forget about the rest of your life - family, friends, relationships, hobbies, rest, eating well, sleeping well, etc. No point in being the most skilled engineer in your company if you burn out at age 30, or have a heart attack at 40, or regret not starting a family at 50, or whatever.\n\nIt's a lot to juggle. You'll drop a few plates here and there. Don't worry about it. It's a marathon, not a sprint.",

And, if you do need it, you can learn it on the job or right before interviews, or just fake it.  Trust me engineering firms do not care, they only care that you understand engineering principles, that you have developed your gut feeling through apprenticeship at various firms.    \n\nEven if you don't become an engineer, there is still no reason to do programming because engineering is where the work will be at in the future, not programming.

The encoding UTF-8 has variable lengths, and some of them are 4 byte long.\n- Unicode is much, _MUCH_ more than just the assigned characters. For each character you also must support all the properties, case foldings, categories, NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD, different collations, sortings, glyphs etc.. Range checks on the codepoints alone are almost always wrong.\n\nAll of the languages with support I know of just implement the actual algorithms and then import the lists from the Unicode standard verbatim each time they do an update to not have to deal with this particular headache.\n\nEdit: In case you don't know it, [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6162484/why-does-modern-perl-avoid-utf-8-by-default/6163129#6163129)'s an old rant about Unicode support in Perl back in 2011 when most browsers couldn't even properly render the rant, including a lot of gotchas.",

Past experience found that the eight position may later be populated when a corresponding syllable is found in a language when it begins using Ethiopic script for its orthography. Accordingly, U+1E7E7 may later be populated with a HHYWA or HHYOA syllable if its availability is later found to be required by another language. The remaining unassigned positions, U+1E7EC, U+1E7EF, and U+1E7FF have correspondence with syllables still in use from the prior orthography that might have otherwise occupied these syllabic and code positions (U+1380, U+1383, and U+138F accordingly).",

This is an important rule because you don't want the code point U+0045 to mean the letter E in Unicode Version 3, but the letter W in Unicode Version 4. Code point reassignments would invalidate all earlier documents.\n\nIf you accept this rule, then the following three desirable properties are incompatible:\n\n1. Related code points are grouped together in sets.\n2. Sets can gain characters in future versions.\n3. All assigned code points are contiguous beginning at 0.\n\nIf you break rule 1, then you lose sets.\n\nIf you break rule 2, then it means that if you need to add a related code point, you have to start a new set (which will probably have just that one code point in it). This basically makes sets pointless\n\nSets are useful because they let you check things like \"Does this code point require a font that supports Cyrillic?\" more conveniently, as well as allowing those checks to continue working even when a new version of Unicode is released. Any new Cyrillic characters will take a previously-unassigned spot in a Cyrillic set. You need to update your code only if a new relevant set is defined, like \"Cyrillic Extended-B\".\n\nSets are also useful for parallel development. If Team A is working on a new Cyrillic character, and Team 1 is working on a new Ethiopian character, they can each choose an unassigned code point from their respective sets and start writing documents with it to see how well it works. If you didn't have sets, then maybe Team A gets unofficial number N and Team 1 gets unofficial number N+1. But Team 1 gets their code point approved first, so now they have official number N, and this disrupts both Team A and Team 1 as they both have to go back and re-encode all their documents. (And we don't like re-encoding documents. See first paragraph.)\n\nRule 3 isn't important. You shouldn't be rejecting unassigned code points anyway (except perhaps for those marked as \"permanently unassigned\"). The Unicode Standard has recommendations for [Unassigned Characters](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L1999/99191.htm), namely, to treat them as generic characters with default properties. This allows your code to continue working when previously-unassigned code points become assigned.\n\nSo the question is based on a false assumption: That it's important to be able to reject unassigned code points.\n\nYou don't want your program to reject a person's name because it uses a newly-assigned CJK character, or to reject a product description because it uses the newly-assigned Rupee symbol *₹*.",

Moreover, If you don't use something, you'll forget it because your brain trims it out. When the time comes for you to use a concept you can simply read up on it to refresh your memory and use what you need. You say you hit a plateau doing LeetCode questions which is definitely to be expected, learning is a bell curve and as difficulty increases the rate at which you progress decreases. This is a good sign that you're at the end of that bell curve, and that you should keep at it even if progress feels minimal. Build pattern recognition.\n\nDo you really think senior engineers or even Comp Sci professors actually remember everything they read? Absolutely not. You are doing perfectly fine.",

Their greatness was born in the gym with repetition.  Find a process that works for you and hammer it in with repetition.   This way, when time comes for you to perform it's automatic and requires little thought.  \n\nSecond, create a cheat sheet for you to easily reference hard to remember concepts.  I would suggest you physically create this sheet to help solidify terms and concepts and/or but it in a spreadsheet for quick referencing.  Once you feel you have a concept, command, and/or process down, remove or archive. \n\nThird, pace yourself.   This is your race.  Your race is different from mine and everyone else's.   Comparison is a thief of joy.  You should be disciplined and motivated in your race to reach your goals, but don't compare my race to yours.

Now, it depends greatly on what your project is, but in a typical project there's just a few scenarios where you'd use recursion. The fundamental one is when you're working with a hierarchical data, especially with arbitrary number of levels (so a tree topography basically). This can happen with stuff like tables (where row can have sub-rows) or file system.\n\nI would personally try implementing a flattening function (i.e. turning a list structure where there's a few top level elements to begin with, but each can have some children, of which each can have some children..) and the output should be a flat list of elements (flat list of all parents and all children, of all levels). When you're done you can move on and you'll probably forget about recursion for a long time. Also, keep in mind that most conventional (i.e. not purely functional, like Haskell) languages are not necessarily built to deal with recursion natively, and using recursion can cause stack overflow (due to every call being put on stack, instead of simplified/ignored, like a language natively supporting tail-call recursion would). In short, you generally don't use recursion unless you have a very good reason to, and you usually don't.",

I'm selling it for low prices, and if you are interested (I am a teen web dev and could use any support I can get to improve my courses), I would really appreciate it. Don't feel pressured, I can't tell you what to do, but I just recommend my course if you want to learn JavaScript anywhere, from basic console.log() to classes and data structures.

Search for alumni in those titles or companies like Nvidia, Siemens, or even startups doing robotics/IoT. For prep, brush up on C++, OS concepts, and maybe RTOS. Also, when you start applying, do as much digging as possible before interviews—dig up old interview reviews, check out \"prepare.sh\" or leetcode.\n\nFull disclosure, I’m a contributor at prepare.sh now, but I used it as a regular user for my own prep long before that, and the questions were spot on for the roles I was targeting. I really recommend giving it a look—it made a huge difference for me.",

And if its the latter, consider thinking about what are you really curious and passionate about. \n\nI spent 7 years studying law and 6 years working with it. It's always been easy for me, I got highest grades in school just by reading a paper 30 minutes before I needed to talk about. Never had my notes with me, it was laying clear in my head, always ready. But law is something you need to be passionate about, always digging and thinking about it, even at home. I on the other hand spent 6 years clocking out at 6pm and it left my brain until the next morning. Everyone thought I was a beast, always coming to me for the advice. I did in couple hours something that other's struggled with for several days. Everyone said I was soon to be a big deal. I was bored out of my mind. And when the opportunity presented itself, I left everything and never looked back. Because the thought about changing career was far less scary than the thought that I have to do this for the rest of my life. \n\nNow I'm getting ready for my first job in tech.

I know plenty of people in the field who did CS and SWE, and similar. It's barely a specialisation really. You will most probably discover that Software Engineering and Cloud Computing undergrad degrees share some kind of \"common first year\" with straight Computer Science degrees and about 10 other \"degree pathways\" at your university, to ensure everyone has the basic knowledge required to move on. After that period, at the beginning of each year, you'll get asked to choose some modules in addition to the core modules totalling the credits for the year. This is the \"specialisation\" aspect. Different degree pathways are just different module choices each subsequent year, which is why many universities allow you to switch between degrees before you get to modules that are only available on certain pathways (essentially change your degree title and pick other modules).\n\nWhether or not you will be ahead or behind your peers depends not solely on your degree pathway, but also on how well the *contents* (what you study) aligns with what you would like to do for work. You don't mention this (even though it should be the biggest factor in your decision) but assuming you want to be a Software Engineer, neither CS nor SWE will give you a large advantage over the other, and the module choices available are likely to be very similar. I've never personally met a Software Engineer with a Cloud Computing degree, but this doesn't mean much, as much of the content is likely to be very relevant.\n\nYou won't save any time, they're the same length. Feel free to skip any work experience years if you're confident in your ability to land a job. Use your best judgement.\n\nNote also that employers rarely care deeply about the exact degree title. \"Computer Science or similar relevant degree\" is common to see on job ads. They do often (not always) care that you get a 2:1/2:2 or above. Nobody regards 3rd well. I'll add from personal experience that I've had certain professional opportunities that were only open to people with 1st at undergrad, a full decade *after* getting the degree. You don't know what the future holds so make the most of it. I'm glad I did and richer for it. If you look at how your university calculates your final classification there's often an alternative formula that counts your first year marks (they award you the best mark using all formulas typically), so don't believe any nonsense like \"first year doesn't count\" etc. It might, depending on specifics.\n\nEdit to add: **A-levels are not 'instead of' a degree.** **No employer is going to pay much attention to your A-levels alone, and having an undergrad degree is preferred but not a hard requirement, to directly answer the title question.** You just need to take the A-levels that meet the requirements for university courses you're looking at. The requirements are listed on their sites. They usually either don't care about specific subjects, or list one subject they require you to have studied at A-level, possibly with grade requirements.",

It's a bit of a complex topic, so I'd suggest watching a YouTube video about it, but here's a short explanation:\n\nImagine you have a library of books. You could store those books in a `list`. If you store those books in a list, though, you have to check every single book to see if you have `Harry Potter` in your collection. Instead, you can put those books in a `set`. Books in a set are stored in piles. Each pile contains all the books starting with the same first two letters. So, to check if you have `Harry Potter`, you go directly to the `Ha` section. You don't have to go through the entire library.\n\nNow, let's say you only want one copy of each book, and you are given another copy of `Harry Potter`. You go to the `Ha` section and check for `Harry Potter`, if it is there, you just toss your new copy. If not, you add that copy to the `Ha` section.",

We call hash(\"Hello World\") and it returns the hash for that string (lets just say it is number like 66457). Then, we use that hash to determine the index the string belongs in, in the list. An easy way to do this for this example is to use the modulo operator. So say, our set implementation has 10 \"buckets\" (each bucket is an element in the underlying list), we can do 66457 % 10 = 7 so we place the string \"Hello world\" in index 7 of the underlying list(i.e. we place it in bucket 7).\n\nThe core idea here is that we never had to iterate through the list of buckets, we derived the index from the value \"Hello world\" itself. We dont have to look at any index other than index 7 for duplicates because (assuming our hash function is deterministic), \"Hello world\" *always* maps to index 7.\n\nHowever, there is a problem. Say there are 10 buckets, but we input 20 elements. Since there are more elements than there are buckets, its inevitable that some buckets will have multiple elements in them. Because of this, it is actually true that we have to do some iteration to find duplicates. If there are multiple elements in bucket 7, then we have to search the bucket to check if \"Hello world\" already exists. I'm not completely sure datastructure python uses to represent buckets though, if its lists then yeah there would be iteration but technically it could be any data structure.",

Python's hash tables use [open addressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_addressing), so the function needs to try multiple slots until it finds either an empty one or an existing object that's equal to the one being inserted. \n\nSets are fast because on average, this loop will terminate after a small number of iterations, *if* the hash function gives random-looking output *and* the fraction of occupied slots in the table is not too large. In order to make sure that second condition holds, the code calls [`set_table_resize`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/setobject.c#L253-L330) to rebuild the table with a larger number of slots whenever the table gets too full.",

I absolutely love Python because it runs in an interpreter and not to hard to prototype something quickly. \n\nTo me, it’s best starting a project in Python, then convert over to C++ or Java once things start coming together.  I wish there was a good way to keep everything in Python and just run it on, say, a mobile app.  Python is the only language I know, and if I were going to move forward with an app for the kinds of things I’m doing, I’d definitely want to go line by line in a target language to convert what I’m doing to something that would run on whatever device.  For example, a friend requested that I make a sound effects app for something she did with a library children’s program, something they could run on an iPhone.  It was easy to pull together in Swift.  For more complex tasks, it’s nothing to work out the logic in Python before switching over to Swift.  \n\nSo…my verdict would be there are things Java does better than Python, such as UI.  Python is a lot friendlier, easy to learn, faster to get up and running.  I’m guessing Java is faster to deploy and easier on memory usage.  I’d say Python first, then learn Java.

A TTF contains curves representing the *outlines* of characters, [like in this example.](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/101761/the-description-and-interpretations-of-truetype-font-points-and-curves) If you click that link and look at the diagram of a lowercase letter `a`, you'll see that it consists of two closed curves: one defining the outer boundary of the letter, and another one for the \"hole\" inside the loop. \n\nThere's no straightforward correspondence between those outlines and the pen strokes a human might use to draw a letter that looks similar. (For instance, a lowercase `t` consists of a single outline but would be drawn with two strokes. A capital `H` has one outline and is drawn with three strokes. An `O` has two outlines, and is drawn with only one stroke.)\n\nFor the kanji diagrams you're talking about, somebody had to manually draw each character's strokes in a vector graphics program. This data was released for free by the [KanjiVG project](https://kanji.sljfaq.org/kanjivg.html) and now lots of other websites and apps use it.\n\nA bit of googling turned up [this project](https://github.com/brownvc/decoupled-style-descriptors) for the Latin alphabet. It includes a dataset with letter strokes from a bunch of actual people's handwriting, plus a data-driven algorithm to generate new variants by interpolating between them. You might find it useful as a starting point.\n\nOnce you have the strokes, animating them is fairly straightforward e.g. by varying the SVG `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` properties over time.\n\nP.S. In principle, you could imagine using various computational geometry algorithms to extract the [\"skeleton\"](https://scikit-image.org/docs/0.25.x/auto_examples/edges/plot_skeleton.html) of a letter in a TTF font, and then try to reconstruct a set of strokes from that. But getting something that works reliably and gives good-quality results would likely be a very challenging project, IMO. Certainly much more difficult and time-consuming than just redrawing the letters by hand.",

You'd then animate the percentage from 0->100%.\n\nYou didn't mention what platform you're on, but on web Snap.svg has the `getSubpath()` method which can perform that operation, and on native, Skia has the `SkTrimPathEffect` API that can do the same.

There is obviously a web server involved, but it only serves front end code (aka static content), it can't run custom Python code or a database or anything like that.\n\nInstead what you need is a web server that supports Python code. Probably using a Python-based web framework like Django. Or at least something that can run Python via CGI, a protocol that allows standard web servers like Apache or Nginx to call external runtimes.

Also, depending on what kind of tools you’re building, you might want to check out Gadget.

A dynamic language like Python, JS, or Ruby will help teach you discipline, while still building skills that are highly marketable.\n\nIf you want to go more esoteric but deep into the world of languages, try going through SICP (a book). It's not immediately practical, but it deep dives into the fundamentals of what programming is.",

Including here.  **This sub has learned nothing from history.**\n\nWhen oil prices are high relative to extraction costs for extended periods of time, petroleum engineering ranks SWELL.  When prices sit at commodity levels above extraction costs, petroleum engineering ranks dwindle fast within 2 years.  The median petroleum engineering graduate becomes UNEMPLOYED.\n\nIn the boom times in the 21st century, petroleum engineering grads were walking out of school to 20 offers in the 195k-225k range with a large bonus potential.  They'd go bust their ass many many hours a week out in some rustic environment somewhere.  There was all kinds of \"what should I specialize in\" conversations like should I do wireline, or logging, or MWD, or be reservoir side, or whatever.\n\nAnd then POOF.  Prices fall... extraction costs rise, and that project you were paying the PE 225k to babysit no longer makes money and STOPS.  STOPS.\n\nPetroleum engineering had 2600 +/- BS grads (and don't forget several hundred MS students too) in 2017.  Less than 600 now, and what looks to be about 600 in 2024.  7 years to fall.  Using the broad numbers you posted, this is like the 100,000 CS grads in 2025 becoming 23,000 by 2032.\n\n**Does this REALLY make petroleum engineering look attractive to you?**  A major that's seen 80% drop in enrollment in 7 years because the industry cannot support its graduates?\n\n> With the massive datacenter boom, this is pretty hot right now.\n\nDatacenters employ so few people once built; you can build 100 more of them, and they're still a minor player.  Design of datacenters is mostly electrical, mechanical, and structural engineering, there might be ONE or TWO IE on a major datacenter design project.  Hell there's going to be more architects than IE's.  If you want to WORK in a datacenter, good luck.  If you want to DESIGN datacenters, electrical, mechanical, or structural.  I literally work for a company that does MANY data centers for companies we've all heard of, and I am a chemical engineer.  I LITERALLY WORK HERE, and for $1,000,000 I couldn't get on a data center project.  Mechanical, electrical, structural, and architects, or GTFO.\n\n> These engineering fields: Nuclear, naval...\n\nGAH... horrible.  Do not study nuclear engineering.  You do NOT do what you think you do.  The nuclear side of the nuclear world is a solved issue and even a large new nuke plant requires very few nuclear engineers.  I do firmly feel that there will be a nuclear renaissance in this country as people figure out that nuclear power is safe and can help with a lot of power issues in this countries, I am very excited for this, and actually personally would love to get in on the action given I live close to one of the major SMR players main office.\n\nHOWEVER, in a new nuke plant... the majority of engineering design hours will be spent by mechanical engineers, structural engineers (which come out of civil), electrical engineers.  If you want to work in that industry, THOSE are target paths.",

And then you’re looking at candidates working at some of the most profitable companies in the world. To get into these companies they’re doing 5-6 rounds of intense interviewing. To even get their resume looked at they are competing with thousands of other candidates many of whom are also from other FAANGS and top tier colleges.\n\nIn America we can be fired for no reason at all without warning, so our salaries have to compensate for our potentially long and unexpected job searches. South America appears to have considerably more protections here.\n\nYou also likely have public healthcare, low cost education, and/or pension plans, none of which we have (we have social security but it’s only for folks who worked and every election there’s talk of getting rid of it). So our salaries have to offset that and other basic social services that we lack. \n\nThe market is horrible right now. Getting interviewed at one of these jobs without connections or a top tier degree is basically impossible. Partially because there are not nearly as many openings now as there used to be, partially because these jobs have always been somewhat like that. Even if you got the interview you’d need near perfect performance to pass as employment shortages mean they can be pickier. And after all of that most of the FAANG companies will be looking to heavily overwork you and then push you out or PIP you within under 3 years. I worked at Amazon, happens all the time.",

I can confidently say that I know when you're cheating. Software Engineers are not Actors, and they ALWAYS make stupid mistakes in how they answer a question when they have the answer as opposed to when they're working it out. In cases where I can't, you probably didn't need the tool anyway because you would've got it eventually. It's also very telling because you don't see it in any other job role. I interviewed a set of executive assistant candidates for a GM, and even in role-skill exercises, the cadence of answer, the breaking down of a problem, all is very similar. If it's a SWE and they're cheating, they're getting it right immediately, are unable to describe a solution (and then immediately turn into a CS professor), or they can explain something perfect, but cannot tell you any other way to do it - even when another approach is taught hand-in-hand and is basically a pair with a given algorithm.\n\nYou would be shocked at how common cheating is. I'd say maybe 5-10%, with more new grads cheating than experienced hires. I've even interviewed people that have so blatantly cheated that they've either quit an interview mid-way despite getting the answer \"right\", because they couldn't explain an if statement or why they've structured a for loop in a specific way (it's a for-each).",

The recruiter said I wouldn’t have to worry about COBOL. Then I got into the interview and the hiring manager asked how I would interpret COBOL code if I needed to on the job. He also gave me a mini-system design exercise and asked if I would use a noSQL or SQL DB. But then he wanted me to drill down and give sample SQL queries. I don’t have any experience writing queries so I couldn’t answer that.\n\nI had another interview with a bank where the recruiter said it would be a call with the manager, and “maybe an engineer” would join, and it ended up being 2 engineers joining and doing a panel-style interview, which didn’t go well. \n\nMost recently, I had another interview interview for a test automation role, and I tried to ask the recruiter for more info about what the team did but she didn’t have any. I thought the role had to do with the tests that run in the CI/CD pipeline but it was a completely different world, I didn’t recognize any of the testing technologies the manager mentioned (because I never worked in testing) and it was awkward when he asked why I wanted to join that team when he hadn’t told me what the team did and neither did the recruiter.",

You network so over time, your \"brand\" (you, your work, etc) increases in value.\n\nThen later, when a company wants to fill a role, employees with connections will typically refer people from those connections first. This gives those candidates a significant advantage in the market.\n\nNetworking also builds a repertoire of trust.\n\nIt's much much easier to land remote jobs with a good network, since the gained trust can be converted in to more flexible working conditions (since companies will have an easier time trusting you to get your work done).",

Whatever process we used to use, you can call it Waterfall or something else, GANTT chart based projects… they had a very different progression.\n\nYou’d have long periods in the beginning of a project where you’d read and write documentation, do planning, research, exploratory code. Then things would ramp up, and you’d start getting the real work done. Towards the end of the project, the deadline would loom, and the real problems would start to appear.\n\nYou’d enter “crunch mode”, which truly sucked, deeply sucked horribly. This could go on for a month or two. Eventually you’d launch and settle back into the beginning phase of a new project. This was a HUGE relief. Then you’d do it all over again.\n\nSounds bad? Well enter Agile which aimed to solve these problems, supposedly. How? By turning everything into a constant drip of 2 week sprints. Every sprint is a deadline. It’s all a micro version of the old way, you never get into the massive crunch time (maybe), instead you trade it for a constant, unrelenting stress. It never lets up, not for a second - and you spend your entire career this way.\n\nIt’s far worse.",

That's why there is constant learning, A/B testing, technical debt, security etc. to deal with. It's easy to burn out when the process of making something is riddled with issues.\n\n\nLike look at this shit: https://old.reddit.com/r/Supabase/comments/1ls31m9/after_three_days_and_15_hours_i_can_finally_log/\n\n\nThree damned days hunting down an oauth issue that was caused by cookies being too long for the default nginx set up. That sort of absolute fuckery is hard to find outside of software. That was mental torture to go through. In how many professions can you spend 15 hours trying to solve something and making absolutely zero progress because you are looking in the wrong place, and then solve it in 5 minutes when you have a lightbulb moment.\n\n\nI have previously worked as a hedge fund accountant and it was a breeze. Just effortless work towards a correct solution every time. The processes worked and there was a known correct solution you had to uncover. Easiest job ever. There is no A/B testing in producing a daily NAV, no trade offs, no technical debt, no performance issues.",

How do you justify your level then?

Try to find a niche that you can learn more about than anyone else. Is there a part of your job processes that feels like toil, or takes a long time, or nobody seems to fully understand? Spend some time trying to improve that thing. Research alternative tools, try to write documentation (the kind you wish were there for you right now), see if you can reverse engineer it.\n\n\nYou will probably get stuck early on, or feel like you're missing some fundamentals, but that's okay. Ask questions when you can, and keep chipping away at it. Eventually, when you have something that you think is an improvement over what's there (probably won't be all that hard to get to that point to be honest) you can let it be known that you've created a new resource or process, and get some people to review it. Chances are good you'll end up being a go-to person for that thing in the future. You'll have very experienced devs coming to you for help/advice/best practices in that domain.\n\n\nFrom there you'll probably incidentally pick up a lot through the process. You'll recognize things in the codebase as being in some ways similar to the thing you took ownership of. You'll get a request to integrate your thing with some other unfamiliar thing, and then you repeat the process until you understand that thing really well too.\n\n\nBit by bit, you'll start feeling pretty confident. \n\n\nSource: my own experience, feeling like a bad developer for many years and then having my confidence grow as a contributor once I figured out this mindset",

The remote work aspect can amplify these feelings since you're hyper-aware of your productivity throughout the day.\n\nThe standup charade is unsustainable and probably contributing to your stress. Consider proactively approaching your manager about taking on additional responsibilities, proposing process improvements, or contributing to other teams' projects. Frame it as professional growth rather than admitting you're underutilized.\n\nStart exploring other opportunities before this situation damages your skills or motivation further. You can use a service like Applyre to passively search while still employed. Look specifically for roles with clear project pipelines and established team structures\n\nRemember that not all tech jobs suffer from this problem. Your fear of repetition is understandable, but asking detailed questions about day-to-day responsibilities and team dynamics during interviews can help you avoid similar situations.",

I would also say if anyone needs help I have some capacity, sometimes that led to more work but sometimes I was just given then good optics of Im getting my work done + remaining available for more work.\n\n\nI think I got away with this bc I was a junior. I could see this working again as a senior doing more deep dive or complex tasks that no one can rly question, but as an aspiring mid level I think I'm just gonna have to get stuff done, maybe delay it by a day or two and be transparent im testing my ticket.\n\n\nI got average/good reviews most of the time. I got a bad performance review twice in a row, that taking it easy caught up during crunch time.I stepped it up and cleared my name, just didn't matter bc we got mass laid off anyway lol. I consider myself successful, because the same boss that gave me the bad review got laid off with me - and ultimately gave me referrals + was a strong testimony to help me get my new job.\n\n\nI would use that free time to up skill now though. I would study whatever it takes to be successful for interviews in devops, or even just see if you have interest in learning any kind of tech in a deeper setting like reading books/documents or building out small little projects (way easier to do that now with AI as a starting point). \n\n\nOtherwise go the company route and start looking around with coworkers, your manager, or even some sister teams and explore what work is out there.

There will be winners, losers, and companies that were just along for the ride during AI. Have you been looking at switching companies rather than switching fields? Not every company has the same view of AI as your current company. You're probably suffering from burnout, from the mix of surviving three rounds of layoffs and how unpleasant your current working environment has become. \n\nOut of curiosity, how much have you been thinking about this switch? \n\nPart of why I mention this is that other fields aren't necessarily better. Nursing comes up often in this sub, but if you ever look at the nursing sub, they are pretty miserable there. They are understaffed, and we're just 5 years off from a pandemic where lots of nurses were dying.\n\nI saw a video recently that said Private Equity firms were buying out plumbers in cities. Once they've bought out enough, they will drop their rates to put the others out of business. Then, they'll drive rates up. There are a lot of fields going through change right now. \n\nI'm personally in the camp that AI will be another tool we use, and there will be blowback when the bubble eventually bursts. It's just not sustainable, and eventually, there will be callout for actual results. Then all that money being invested will have to be invested elsewhere.",

It's not walking into a tech conference, exchanging business cards, and aggressively shaking hands. It's not cold messaging people asking for some awkward \"coffee chat\" even though you both know you're just trying to milk them for a job.\n\nThat feels fake as hell because *it is* fake as hell. But it's also not networking.\n\nOur network is made up of our *friends, family, and colleagues*.\n\nThat's it. So in order to \"network\" you expand upon 1 of those 3 categories. The family category's tough to expand, you're kinda stuck with it. The colleagues one you expand throughout your career as you work with people. The people you've met and worked closely with in college also count as colleagues (even if they're *both* friends and colleagues). The professor you saw weekly in office hours, or the TA you had a good connection with are colleagues.\n\nThe \"friends\" category is by far the easiest to expand. You expand this category by.... making friends. That's it. There's nothing more to it. They don't need to be technical either. Someone working in sales is able to refer someone to SWE. They're character checks for the company, not skill checks, that's why they still interview you. Hiring unknowns off the street is risky for companies, because character-red-flags are easily hidden and don't come out for months. Hiring someone that an employee they already like is vouching for is significantly safer.\n\nThe reason meetups are so commonly suggested is because getting into a room with a bunch of people that all have a shared interest is a great way to *make friends.* If you go to those thinking you're gonna get a LinkedIn connection, you're not going to make any friends *or* connections. Go into those because you're interested in X, and the friends will follow. Doesn't need to be technical either. Go to a rock climbing meetup, go to a model train meetup, hell, go to your local dive bar and buy a stranger a drink and get to chatting. I've made life-long friends that way.\n\nThe bad news is none of this is a quick fix. Making friends takes time. We're not disposable one-time use napkins that you toss in the bin as soon as you get what you want from us. If you form a *genuine* connection with us, over the course of months, we'll refer each other because we want to, and we're doing so becaues we're friends, not because we're using each other.",

I'd go so far as to say it's only a matter of time at every company.\n\nIt's a very common pattern for management/upper-management to get replaced, and for a company to tighten the belt and shift their culture to the toxic-side.\n\nThat part's out of our control.\n\nWhat's in our control is how we react to it.\n\nWLB is my #1 priority. Even if a company tries to turn up the heat, and introduce toxic expectations.... I don't let it alter my WLB. I do the best work I can from 9-5, M-F. That's non-negotiable. Management can scream about deadlines, ping me after hours, etc all they want. Doesn't change anything about how I behave. At most a 5:30pm text will get is a \"OK, will take a look tomorrow morning\".\n\nThere's an extremely clear divide between my work life and my personal life. This divide lets me disconnect after 5pm, no matter how much BS is going on during the work day, no matter how stressful it gets. That stress waits around for 9am the following work day.\n\nI've had companies \"tighten the belt\" before, but I've always stood my ground. If they fired me over it? Oh well, the culture was toxic anyways and I was already looking for another job. But in reality they never did. The last time this happened I even got a pretty massive *raise*.\n\nToxic management *loves* to take advantage of people that don't establish any sort of boundaries. Really they'd be stupid not to, it's free labor. But when you establish boundaries as the employee, more often than not, nothing's going to happen.\n\nSo whenever this happens to your company's culture, firstly establish boundaries and stick to them in the short-term to keep yourself sane. In the medium/long term find another job ASAP. It's a sinking ship culture-wise.",

He sold his house here and went all in. On the down side, he has to worry about paying farm labourers and making sure the ends meet and he's pretty much spent what he sold the house in England for. They're in it now, they have to make it work. On the plus side, apart from a few initial bad starts which cost them a good few quid, the last time he came back to visit in the UK, he had a brand new Toyota. OK it's not an Audi or a BMW, but a brand new Toyota in Ireland is roughly equivalent. Especially a diesel with a Dublin plate! Seriously, in Ireland, that's doing pretty well!\n\n\\- Another bought a van, a bunch of cleaning equipment and became a carpet cleaner. On the plus side, the amount of hotels and function rooms that immediately gave him business and even rolling appointments is definitely helping to pay off the equipment he bought through hire purchase. On the downside, he's cleaning carpets at 55 years old with a 55 year old back. He likes the work but it's obviously a lot more physical than he really thought.\n\n\\- The last one now works three days a week doing minor admin stuff for an office. Filing, sending stuff out, packaging, doing the odd excel sheet stuff, fixing printers, any odd jobs. It doesn't pay well. But the mortgage was paid a while ago, no real debts, kids are off to university, his wages pay for the monthly bills easily, the wife's wages pay for the family holiday every year though kids may or may not come. If you have no heavy outgoings, you sort of don't need to chase the wage anymore.\n\n  \nSo yeah, none of that is helpful or answers your question. Or does it?",

My last two jobs (both very large companies) were both offshored. Not just me, but my entire team. I’m friends with a lot of former co-workers struggling right now.\n\nFor me, I just realized I want a field of work where I don’t have to be around Indians anymore. I know it sounds racist, but I’ve come to terms with it. Watching them slowly suffocate the IT industry since I joined it in 2013 has been like watching a family member slowly dying to cancer.\n\nI’m considering everything from digital forensics to trades work to just finally pulling the trigger and angling to move into product mgmt or architect. Tired of the dev rat race and companies building generic APIs but wanting to do Google interviews. Tired of grinding leetcode problems every few years after another layoff. I just like building and integrating stuff and seeing it all work, like finishing a painting.\n\nReady to be accused of being bad at my job or not passionate enough or something by people who want to virtue signal about the reality of things. Some people, especially younger people, will feel a knee-jerk reaction to what I said, but I feel bad for you. You don’t remember how enjoyable this work was before Cognizant took over and every remote job posting had 7,000 applicants from India within the first week. Before COVID killed socialization.

You can and should get involved in research because that’s such a low bar to get involved in and will immediately add experience to resume and will be a good bonus if you get published and graduate level internships will like this. \n\nThere is a lot of good paying science based computer science jobs (especially in defense since you are domestic) that will see that as a big plus. Also I think finance also likes people with a more academic background since they do a lot of advanced mathematical analysis for trading strategies. \n\nSo if you just want to be building apps then maybe drop it? If you want to do something that requires at least a masters like ML/AI, data science or something more math focused then it could be worth it. \n\nIf you decide to stick with it you should apply to national labs for internships and you can probably get those internships pretty easily as a domestic graduate level student.

Also in your practice you need to sort of streamline the thought process along with the toolset.\n\nThink of it like branch prediction in computers.

If you are doing it cause you heard you can make a ton of money or its an easy gig you can skate by in because you watched some dork's day in the life of a SWE where they worked 45 minutes out of an 8 hour day, I'd look for something else.\n\nDon't buy into the AI hype train. AI has a lot of flaws but if used properly, its a tool to augment a developer...not replace. People hyping AI like its going to replace people either have a vested interest in seeing AI succeed (and we are using AI loosely here, they are hyping up LLLMs), parroting the hot takes they see online for engagement, or haven't really ever coded anything beyond a basic todo list app.\n\nAlso, my advice is to not utilize AI while you learn. Just like lifting weights, your brain is a muscle and if you never learn how to learn, and AI can't figure out the problem, your going to be SOL. Utilize your time in college to learn how to figure things out and think critically, don't let AI do that for you. \n\nI tutored online for 3 years and the number of students that utilized AI for their learning but had no clue what was going on was huge, they are likely now running into issues finding work because if they manage to land an interview, they certainly aren't passing them.\n\nMy view, there is going to be a lot of work in 5-10 years fixing applications built utilizing AI because everyones mandating it be used in the work place to make devs more effective. Theres already been studies where usage of AI has been a net negative in productivity. \n\nPersonal annecdoate, worked on an application where a guy vibe coded an integration into sales force in c#, in order to find a patients next appt date, it had to look back through all 35 years of patient data (all patients) in order to find one patients future appt date. Took 10 minutes to run 150 patients worth of data because it was churning millions of row for each patient because chat gpt coded the query.",

I had a recruiter start harassing me on LinkedIn because I was being considered for a contract-to-hire role at Chase that was a higher rate than she was used to seeing. She kept trying to insist I was lying. I just blocked her. \n\nNo good advice on how to network. You need to find people willing to talk to someone, effectively a stranger, for very little in return. It’s a challenge. I recently accepted some LinkedIn invites from random new grads from my college, but I had too many personal things come up to follow up with them. \n\nIt’s a very hard market right now. You know that. It just takes more time and effort than normally. \n\nOne thing I’d encourage you to do more of is learning and expanding your skillset. You say it’s been 7 months. You can learn quite a bit in time like that. Maybe you should try learning some things to make yourself a stronger candidate. AWS had a free tier. You could get exposure to cloud services that will help you grow. I encounter a lot of experienced people who still don’t have a lot of cloud experience. ",

Also, there truly are people who want to help, and feel sympathy for people like us. Also, they admire the dedication we have to keep going.\n\nWell first, take some time to take care of your mental health. We need money to survive, but this career path should not determine the embodiment of your soul. Balance hobbies and hanging out with friends, forgetting about anything career related during those times. This should give you a boost of confidence. \n\nAlso, you have to attend networking events in your area. The point of building your network is to get connected to people in the industry, ask them questions about their career and get advice, and share what you’re currently working on / your experience. Not necessarily asking them for referrals right away. \n\nJobs for people like us are very scarce now, but in the meantime, practice interview / technical skills, work on projects, build your network through the advice above, always be on the lookout for open positions, etc. \n\nThe most important thing right now is to stay consistent, but also have a life. Get a coffee shop job to be around people and pay the bills while you do these things. It’s really hard I know, and I’m proud of you for still working at it / searching for advice after 7 months. But after taking my life back and following the advice above, I feel more confident now in my 14 months of post grad to find opportunities, then I did many many months ago. \n\nSorry for the ramble but we will prevail!! Keep going and most importantly, take care of your mental health, and soon you will find people who want to help you.",

Many people are socially inept, constantly rude, and horrible at explaining anything. \n\n\nAt every company you work for there will be people who answer your questions in one of the following ways\n\n\n1. They make up a different question in their head that is tangentially related to yours and give you that answer\n\n\n2. They answer with as few words as possible, giving no context, because they think it makes them look smart. \n\n\n3. A mix of 1 and 2.\n\n\nJust learn everything you can. Apply to other places if you want. But do not quit under any circumstances until the day before you start a new job. Offers are rescinded all the time. No one you work with or for cares about you. If you care about them you allow them to exploit you.\n\n\nGood luck",

It was more or less a dead-end job since there wasn't a lot of room for advancement/salary increase. Mentorship was non-existent as was training and pretty much everything else. Things were siloed and if you did what you were told you would get the job. I'm thankful I had the job because at least it was a foot in the door into IT. \n\nThe second job I'm at is better in some ways and worse in others. We're very understaffed and are on a hiring freeze with a lot of technical debt that is overdue by years. Like a lot of organizations we want to be proactive by reacting to the latest trends in IT-- if you guessed AI, you'd be correct. We have a Github that's there more or less for some kind of version control, but it's used kind of rarely. Yes, the technical debt is to that degree. However, I'm lucky to have someone that's at least willing to work with me, and help me out and provides me some advice of things I should be doing-- that's when I buy a book on that topic and read it. I try to do a book a month when I have the time. \n\nMy advice would be to do that, talk with someone you trust or who is willing to help a little and research on your own. People will take notice and be happy you cared. If there's other IT departments you work with, I'd also ask some questions what they do, their responsibilities and at least understand them from a cursory glance so if you know of something is their responsibility you can articulate yourself in a manner where people will at least see you're taking yourself seriously as a professional.",

Others, you need leverage in the form of another job offer, which they can match or give you a signing bonus instead or maybe 1 extra week of vacation. They just aren't going to give you more for the sake of it. That looks bad. Your pay was set from experience, job title, work unit and pay bands. No one rolled a d20.\n\nOther thing in negotiation, standard time to accept or refuse the offer is 1 or 2 weeks.

Basically only if it's more outside of the city and you also live outside the city (on that same side and don't need to commute around/through the center of it). \n\nLike *maybe* if the commute was something like Moorpark to Santa Monica and the commute is mostly through the mountains/on PCH. But even then, it'll probably be a little dicey on a lot of days. Depending on where the second job is (assuming it isn't downtown or anything), I'd definitely take that, personally.",

With today's market, you got to be pretty competitive (4-5 years ago, you had a better chance of \"getting lucky\"). Working full-time is a pain, and even putting just 10 hours a week into transitioning into SWE can be hard. All-in-all, I wouldn't be surprised if it took you over a year to line up your first job.\n\nI will say though, as a self taught dev with no degree, you got some strengths here: You have a CS degree and you've been working a job that will generally look respectable on a resume. I do think you have a pretty healthy shot at transitioning into SWE, but the market is bad and it's pretty rough out there.\n\nI'll assume you have some rough experience with programming (how to reasonably use classes, functions, if statements, for loops), or at the very least, all that will come back to you pretty quickly.\n\nIf you want to get into fullstack, I would start off by focusing on Java / Springboot for backend, JavaScript / React for frontend, and use Git. I would ***probably*** recommend taking a Udemy course (I never personally tried Udemy, but I often hear good things) for both React and Springboot. You can just watch a YouTube tutorial for Git. Try to get to a point where you can work on a project pretty consistently. Just have one project you're pretty committed to.\n\nAfter that, there's interview prep. Go through the roadmap on https://neetcode.io (mainly focus on the video explanations, don't waste a ton of time trying to solve questions yourself at this stage). After the roadmap, do some random questions LeetCode, and try to get to a spot where you have like an 80% chance of solving an unfamiliar medium-level problem in under 60 minutes (if you haven't solved it after 2 hours, just look up the answer and try to think where you went wrong).\n\nMore than anything else though ***talk through the problems***. You wanna be good at \"solving\" problems because sometimes you get \"assessments\" (basically you have to solve a LeetCode problem before getting to interview anybody), but for \"interviews\" you need to be good at talking technical. You should look up \"mock coding interviews\" on YouTube interviews to see what mean here.\n\nYou should start applying before you're 100% confident with anything though (you're never going to be 100% ready to start applying). In fact, I would honestly recommend you just start sending out like 3 applications a week ***right now***. Just half ass it, get it out of the way, and get used to it. Don't waste too much time \"waiting to feel ready\" (I wasted a lot of time on this back in 2021).\n\nFor your resume, skim through the wiki on r/EngineeringResumes. You'll have to adjust a bit though because of your background, but do what you can to leverage your current work experience (be detailed), and mainly try to sell yourself as \"an important team member that holds some key responsibilities and/or accomplishments\". I know that can be really awkward, but again, I think you got quite a respectable role.\n\nAnd finally, as far as applying goes, apply to any role that looks reasonably relevant, doesn't look too \"specialized\", and asks for less than 5 years of experience. Don't be too picky, just focus on playing the numbers game more than anything else.",

Python, SQL (start writing your own soon!), Power BI/Tableau are great tools, and healthcare companies are constantly hiring analysts who can work with lab or patient data. Bonus: you can build portfolio projects using synthetic healthcare datasets to show immediate relevance.\n\nThat said, if you’re more drawn to building things end-to-end, **full-stack with Java + JS** is solid—but it’ll take longer to ramp up, especially if your coding muscles are rusty. One middle path: try backend-focused roles or automation scripting in Python to bridge between the two.\n\nYou don’t need to “catch up” on everything just pick a direction, build 2–3 focused projects, and you’ll have a strong story. Feel free to ask if you’d like free beginner-friendly project ideas or a platform where you can find study buddies to stay consistent.",

Maybe I'm taking the wrong courses. \n\nBut yeah, I just started learning Java with Spring Boot tonight. Decided to do a common project (Making a Letterboxd \"clone\") , but rather than watch a video tutorial, I'm using chatGPT to learn. At first, it's been giving me a bunch of code snippets to paste and I'm going through with that to learn the process in how to make a project from start to finish with a backend and frontend, but I think moving forward, I'll ask it to give me less code snippets and more just explain concepts and theories with examples without the code directly related to the project I'm working on. \n\nPerhaps I'll try to get the fundamentals down again, maybe make a solid project or two (Nothing too crazy) and then start applying within the next week or two. Thanks for being encouraging about my chances. I'll try to leverage my science/healthcare background and maybe look for more niche roles in the biopharmaceutical industry related to tech/SWE. Obviously, they won't pay as big as tech or finance companies, but I'm just trying to learn and get my foot in the door ASAP to gain more relevant experience. Thanks again for the advice :)",

Contact them directly and ask them for advice. If you don’t have drive or ambition going to a top tier school won’t get you hired for long. \n\nMy suggestion is that you figure out an area of focus that’s likely close to the tech stack you’re doing for work as a test engineer ( if possible but if it’s cobol or some old spaghetti just take the mulligan )and then use that to jump into a dev role.",

Unless there's a compelling reason for you to leave your job and attend school full-time, I'd consider a part-time graduate program, perhaps even an online program from a reputable university. Expanding to online programs could expand the number of schools and specializations that you can consider, and keeping your job means you don't have to worry as much about the job market and it reduces financial risk after you finish the program.\n\nIf being in an academic setting is important, you may not have to leave your current job for a part-time in-person or hybrid program at a local university. Depending on your current company's policies, you may be able to do a flex schedule at work that lets you attend at least some of your classes in person, and you should still get access to other campus resources.\n\nThe state of the job market in 1-3 years, after you finish a graduate program, is probably the biggest question. This is especially true if you specialize in something your current company doesn't currently need. It's not clear how long it would take you to find a job using your new degree and specialized knowledge. It's common advice that it's easier to find a job when you already have one.",

If you're getting 0 interviews now, job hunting \"full time\" will continue to get you 0 interviews. When you're not even getting *interviews*, that's not a problem you can solve by just buckling down and committing more time to the search.\n\nIf you were struggling with leetcode, or performing well in interviews, that argument would hold more weight. More interview practice means better performance. But you're not even getting the interview. That's not something that'll get better if you \"practice\" 8 hours a day.

It's always easier to find a job while you're employed with an income. An important consideration a lot of people don't think about is because you have an income you have the power to reject job offers that aren't good fits. Imagine you get another offer for a role *just like* the one you're currently in. Obviously you wouldn't want to accept that, right? That's the whole reason you're job searching, to get away from this kind of role.\n\nWhen you're employed, you just turn down the offer, and you continue the job search. There's no rush.\n\nWhen you're unemployed, you feel an intense pressure to accept *anything* because you need to put food on the table. So you accept a bad offer, and inadvertently end up back at square one.\n\nHold onto this job, and job search on the side. This is how most people change jobs.",

They'll likely ask about challenges you've faced in your research, how you approach ambiguous problems, and what excites you most about applying your skills in a startup environment.\n\nThe key is showing intellectual curiosity and demonstrating that you can think beyond just executing tasks. Be ready to discuss specific projects from your research background in detail, but frame them in terms of business impact or real-world applications. VPs care about ROI and strategic thinking, even from juniors, so connect your technical work to broader outcomes. They might also probe your adaptability since startups move fast and priorities shift quickly compared to academic research environments.\n\nI'm on the team that built [AI interview helper](http://interviews.chat), and it's designed exactly for situations like this where you need to navigate senior-level conversations and think through how to position your experience effectively during high-stakes interviews.",

I would recommend masters if you are potentially interested in research route otherwise if you want to continue with regular SWE, then your position, salary etc will solely depend on your interview performance and if an undergrad does better than you, they will end up with a better salary. So imo masters won’t be a good bet. \n\nWould highly recommend reading technical books to work on your fundamentals and get them strong and in parallel work on your soft skills (this is a game changer that most engineers don’t focus on and allows one to stand out). Doing this catapulted my career to senior from new grad in under 2 years over other engineers with 3-4x the amount of experience.The books you read will depend on what you want to focus on. For eg, my area of work was distributed systems so the main books I read were around that but the general ones I recommend are the following 2: DDIA, philosophy of software design. Then also diving into design patterns, pragmatic programmer, etc\nBased on what you are curious to learn and specialize in (FE, BE, DE, DS etc) you pick up relevant books there and start diving in. Also you don't have to read books cover to cover (though the previous 2 I mentioned, do read cover to cover) unless they excite you or you think you are learning from them. I usually use books as a frame of reference so when I get stuck I know where to look (tbh AI like ChatGPT has made that much easier now).\nFor soft-skills (the real game changer), I would recommend focusing on good documentation (and I don't mean writing docs that no one reads, but being strategic with it) like writing summary docs to summarize complex discussions, writing well-thought-out design discussion tradeoff analysis docs to promote healthy, structured discussions and building alignment, etc. Speech is equally important - the phrasings used, the tonality used etc can immediately set an authority apart from a noob - this also translates 1:1 into slack threads, and code reviews as well. Small tweaks like that can instantly make someone come off as authoritative and knowledgeable.",

Research their products thoroughly, understand their mission in the education space, and be ready to discuss how technology can improve learning outcomes. They'll likely ask behavioral questions about working in teams, handling feedback, and dealing with ambiguity since you'll be working on products that real people depend on.\n\nBeyond the standard technical prep, focus on demonstrating your curiosity and growth mindset since you're coming from a conversion program. Be prepared to walk through any projects you've built, explaining your decision-making process and what you learned from challenges you faced. They know you're new to this field, so they're looking for someone who can learn quickly and contribute to their team culture. The technical questions will probably be more practical than the hardest LeetCode problems, so practice explaining your thought process clearly as you code.\n\nI'm actually on the team that built [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat), and it's been really helpful for people preparing for these kinds of interviews where you need to balance technical skills with company-specific knowledge and behavioral questions.",
