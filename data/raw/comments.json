The new tools built in rust, and with interoperability in mind via open formats - both storage with parquet+deltalake/iceberg and in memory with arrow - that work natively in-process with python bindings and even out-of-process, are going to be much easier to work.\n\nI've been plugging away at using daft, which can run in-process with python, or out of process on a single machine, or across a ray cluster. You can take the same code and run it in something super lightweight and then scale it out to a huge cluster. No need to change processing engines.\n\nI can see more being built around duckdb for the same purpose.\n\nI've seen someone benchmark running daft distributed within a databricks cluster and it being *faster*. That is you start up a Databricks cluster, install daft and ray, and you get better performance than the spark instances you're running alongside. At that point Databricks is just a glorified cluster manager and notebook provider.\n\nSpark is just too cumbersome and too awkard to deal with. It isn't suitable for small use-cases, and in very large ones it can be arcane to figure out what is going on. People just can't develop skills with it until they are working at a huge scale, so they get chucked in the deep end with issues.\n\nThese new tools will let people get experience on their own machine, it will let DS and DA roles grapple with things directly, and let everyone get essentially the same experience when they work at scale.",

Thanks for the shoutout, really heartening to see so much of the community resonating with the same frustrations that we had when we first started the project…\n\nHere are some key guiding principles which I hold dear to the data software that we want to build for the future:\n\n1. Python-first, with native wheels that don’t require external dependencies\n\n2. Works on ANY scale — effective both for a 60MB CSV as well as 100TB of Parquet/Iceberg. This means having best-in-class local as well as distributed engines\n\n3. Works on ANY modality — data today is more than just JOINs and GROUPBYs. The reality is that data is messy and unstructured!! Sometimes my UDF fails but I don’t want it to kill my entire job…\n\nWe’re trying to be more public with our roadmap and stuff too so please let us know if there is interest. For instance, we will be working to reduce reliance on Ray as a hard dependency soon and enable raw Kubernetes deployments (which seems to be a common ask), and we have a Dashboard in the works (we call this Spark UI++). \n\nAppreciate the support here ❤️keep plumbing away r/dataengineering the daft team will be here to make things with less oom and more zoom.",

You can process arbitrarily large datasets using a standard declarative  syntax and not have to worry about running out of memory. DuckDB works well for single user / single node otherwise there is a plethora of other databases available if you need distributed processing or to share amongst multiple users.\n\nSpark is overkill for most situations and even for the situations it isn't overkill for you still have to question whether you actually want to deal with it. Its slow and bloated like anything JVM based.

In terms of performance... it's a mixed bag.\n\nI would use it over SQLite with WORM or OLAP data for its more expressive SQL dialect and the duckdb REPL is just a bit nicer... The default of limiting output to a small number of rows also makes it feel fast. The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` is extremely beautiful. The aesthetics and marketing are best-in-class. But SQLite in WAL mode can be much faster at updating or inserting records--especially for any real-world non-trivial tables. \n\nI don't think DuckDB can ever completely replace SQLite for all use cases but it can often be the best tool for the job--even when querying SQLite files. For example, the `format_bytes()` function is very convenient...\n\nDuckDB has gotten a lot better in recent years there are still a few sharp edges. For example, one such query that blocked me from moving from SQLite to DuckDB looked like this:\n\n    SELECT\n        m.id AS id\n        , SUM(CASE WHEN h.done = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS play_count\n        , MIN(h.time_played) AS time_first_played\n        , MAX(h.time_played) AS time_last_played\n        , FIRST_VALUE(h.playhead) OVER (PARTITION BY h.media_id ORDER BY h.time_played DESC) AS playhead\n        -- , *  -- SQLite even lets you do this... but I concede that is a bit extreme...\n    FROM media m\n    JOIN history h ON h.media_id = m.id\n    GROUP BY m.id;\n\nIt would give me this error:\n\n    Error: column \"playhead\" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or must be part of an aggregate function.\n    Either add it to the GROUP BY list, or use \"ANY_VALUE(playhead)\" if the exact value of \"playhead\" is not important.\n    LINE 6:     FIRST_VALUE(h.playhead) OVER (PARTITION BY h.media_id ORDER BY h.time_played DESC) AS playhead\n\nIf I changed the last line to\n\n    GROUP BY m.id, h.media_id, h.time_played, h.playhead;\n\nI wouldn't get an error but that query is not asking for the same thing as the original query which is selecting the most recent playhead value instead.\n\nSQLite also supports non-UTF8 data which is [handy when dealing with arbitrary file paths](https://dwheeler.com/essays/filenames-in-shell.html) and other pre-sanitized data... even Full-Text Search works for the UTF-8 encode-able bytes.

It's genuinely good to see someone mapping out what they've learned with this much clarity, especially the enthusiasm for the core DE work – debugging, building, improving infrastructure. You've definitely hit on some crucial points that many take years to internalize.\n\nThings like focusing on pipeline resilience, code quality, and the importance of documentation are spot on. That’s the stuff that separates okay pipelines from robust, maintainable systems. The emphasis on CI/CD, templates, and understanding SQL fundamentals alongside frameworks like Spark/Pandas shows you're building a really well-rounded technical base. Keep that momentum going – the learning curve is steep, but you're clearly navigating it well.\n\nJust a couple of thoughts to add from experience:\n\n- You're right that physical presence can boost visibility and make ad-hoc collaboration easier, especially in certain environments or client-facing roles. However, it's worth developing the skills to achieve similar communication effectiveness and relationship building remotely. Mastering clear documentation (which you already value!), proactive updates, and strong asynchronous communication is vital, as many teams are distributed or hybrid. The core skill is effective collaboration, whatever the medium - so don't view remote work as inherently having fewer opportunities; it just requires different strengths.\n\n- Regarding DRY and OOP, I have no doubt they are good principles. Just remember the other side: sometimes abstracting too early or creating overly complex OOP structures can hurt readability more than duplicated code, especially for simpler tasks. Finding that balance between avoiding repetition and maintaining simplicity/clarity comes with practice. You're right to question when not to use OOP though!\n\n- You've got the right idea with watermarks and parameterization for the pipeline self-healing process. Also think about idempotency – ensuring your tasks can run multiple times with the same input and produce the same outcome. It’s key for reliable reruns and recovery. And as you mature your pipelines, layer in dedicated data quality testing on top of unit/integration tests.\n\n- Definitely keep that volunteering spirit intact to improve things. Just learn to balance it strategically cuz it's easy to get pulled into fixing everything legacy, so make sure those efforts align with broader team goals and don't consistently derail your primary project responsibilities.\n\n- This is more of a personal ick, but I generally don't emphasize too much on documenting the finer details of a codebase, since things change and us devs can spend more time documenting things instead of focusing on what matters to our stakeholders.\n\nOverall, your reflections show a great attitude and a solid understanding of what makes a good DE. You're focusing on the right areas – technical depth, process improvement, and collaboration. Keep learning, stay curious, and continue refining that craft. You're well on your way :)",

Consistent naming conventions and packages is critical. Our consultants did neither and it is a shit show. \n\nOOP can be helpful in some regards, but I'm with you that FP is more than sufficient for the bulk of jobs. OOP overcomplicates, makes debugging more difficult and time consuming, and is rather rigid. It's worth it if it is scalable, but if it takes the same level of effort to cram all the SQL and configs into an OOP approach as just coding it from scratch in FP, you might as well use FP. \n\nI'm coming up on my 1 year as well. My biggest lessons have been think in terms of frameworks (how can you organize your code, how can you automate or parameterize development, etc.), that you simply can't learn everything and delegation is critical, knowledge of the business data is extremely important, that InfoSec is a PITA, and think through things before implementing anything (nothing is ever as simple as it first seems).",

You can define columns without reference to dataframes, so you can make a list of column expressions *before* you work with the dataframes.\n\nedit: I shouldn't do this at 2am. ~~Your slice [] of the map column based on a key means spark is creating a column expressions mapping every key:value in mapping, then throwing it all away to pick a single key from the map.~~\n\nAll of this requires communication between spark and pyspark, which takes time. When you do it 600 times it takes a while.\n\nEvery time you chain dataframe defining functions pyspark calls out to spark to build a plan. Time spent on the plan increases exponentially as you have more steps as each step takes longer as it builds on the last. 600 dataframe definitions is a lot.\n\nDo the `json.loads` once for each mapping, not for each variable for each model. \n\nedit: I shouldn't do this at 2am. ~~Don't create a full map column just to select one key out of it, just get the value from the original mappings dict. Don't chain withColumn, generate all the column definitions into a list then do `df.select(\"*\",*listofcols)`~~ \n\nedit: fixing 2am mistakes...\n\nEven though the key you pull from the map is the value in column 'v', you are parsing and defining the same map dtype column multiple times -- 150 times if it is the 10 models and 15 variables looping over the same 4 mappings. Think of the size and complexity of this query as it gets built out, where spark is generating 600 chained 'views' with hundreds of mapping objects, and every mapping gets used so cannot be discarded before processing.\n\nIn pandas you don't have this because the mapping object is available in the same process directly and doesn't need to be duplicated data per row. It also processes the dataframe in full at each step, so it can discard any previously used map as it goes. Whereas spark can't access your dict directly and has lazy evaluation, so it has to 'remember' every single generation of every map field all at once when it finally runs, and will be duplicating the data into each row in its behind-the-scenes rdd.\n\nYou want to only parse each model once, and only generate its map once, and reuse that.

Have I found an “algorithm” to solve problems in a digestible way that scales to pretty much every scenario that I can just do repetitiously and get super good at? I like to think so.",

It's quite efficient at reading just the data needed in parquet. But there is still room for improvement on making better use of page-level stats, and improved push-down predicates from the iceberg side. Contributions are most welcome!\n\nIt works with surprisingly large datasets in my experience. But there are obviously worst-case scenarios like tables with a large volume of frequently-changing data will be hard to efficiently pull into the browser.\n\nThe only other real way to do this until now would be duckdb-wasm as you mentioned. Duckdb is awesome! But it is very heavyweight in the browser. Nearly 40mb of WASM. And bundling wasm files is always a pain. Whereas hyparquet is 10kb and trivial to deploy.

UnityCatalog doesn't really address that at all.\n\n- It doesn't support S3-compatible object storage like MinIO for credential vending.\n\n- As far as I know, it requires tying Iceberg tables to Delta Lake metadata via \"UniForms\" instead of supporting Iceberg independently.\n\n- It doesn't use open standards like OPA or OpenFGA for authorization.\n\nAll that said, UnityCatalog OSS is high on my list of things to try more seriously!",

If you have automatic retries enabled on the thing running your dbt model, then you'll retry it after its timed out on the higher warehouse. So lots of options..\n\nThe chunking may be easier to handle dynamically by parameterising stored procedures in snowflake too :)",

        "body": "I was very successful on my project with customer matching, exactly what you are talking about. We wound up buying a tool. Biggest single take away is that it’s not “can you do this” but rather “how accurately can you do this”. There are so many tools/techniques that can do this - but the accuracy levels vary. As you pay more, or get more sophisticated, your match accuracy and speed goes up. For example, on the easy end would be to compare address line 1, city, state, and zip from multiple data sources against each other and make the match. There are so many problems with this, so it’s not very accurate. Examples of higher end algorithms include:\n\n- Typo detection with various string compare/character distance algorithms\n- Phonetic representation (matching on how words are spoken not spelled to account for typos)\n- Address tokenization (not matching 123 4th ave. To 4 123rd ave, because you parse an address into what it represents (house number and street)\n- Nickname substitution (Tom matches Thomas)\n- Abbreviation matching (CIA matches Central Intelligence Agency)\n- Address validation - comparing an address to the US Postal Service to see if it’s real (don’t try matching fictitious addresses)\n- Understanding name titles - (Mrs, Miss, Sir, Jr, III, II, etc. John Thomas can match Mr. John Thomas, or John Thomas II is different from John Thomas III)\n\nEtc…. You get the point…\n\nUltimately, there are two big things:  match accuracy and match speed. Accuracy evaluates two records against each other using all the different rules, scores each one, and then this is where you come in — you set weights on the different rules to “tune” the algorithm. Essentially, you are optimizing either overmatching or undermatching — you will never be perfect. In some cases you want to overmatch (say you are sending direct mail promotions and are fine accidentally grouping father and son as same person). In some cases you prefer to undermatch (say you are grouping medial records/data and don’t want to give a child the medication his father is prescribed because you incorrectly linked the two as the same entity). Second big thing is speed. Ultimately, you are comparing each record against each record - do the math…. It’s too long to actually compute. So, these tools take short cuts - they actually only compare subsets of data against each other (important- this means some rows will never be evaluated for a potential match). For example if record 1 is “123 1st St, NM USA” I don’t actually need to compare this one against any data that isn’t from the state of New Mexico (NM). HOWEVER, what if I’m wrong about the original record being in NM? If I am, then I have no hope of making a match (let’s say it’s actually in MN - typo) so my accuracy is compromised because of my speed algorithm. So, again, this is why you pay more as features go up. Can you have speed and accuracy - sure, but it will cost you.\n\nNOTE: As an interesting aside, I was also on a Material Matching project. Materials are very different from customers, it’s actually not a data problem but an image recognition problem. Our first approach was to treat it like customer and look at attributes we stored in data (length, width, etc.) and perform the match. It was terrible. Poor data quality, and you can’t capture enough data - for example, you might have same H,W,D and weight, but you don’t capture “right hand” or “left hand” part (which makes them different). The answer is software that matches visually looking at the CAD drawings in 3d. Very cool, and very expensive. Really isn’t a BI problem at this point, but an Engineering problem since it’s in the CAD world.\n\nEDIT:  you will need a manual method to override matches, and fix them. In my project our software matched 95% of the data correctly!!!! The business had to use 5 full time head count for 1 year to perform the additional 5% match. So - this should tell you how valuable the software is, and how difficult it is to manually match millions of rows of data. \n\nEDIT: I didn’t state this, but the process is to create “groups” of data (entities). So, your target data is [group id or entity id], [record id], [attribute columns:  name, address 1, city, state…]. The group id/entity id field is just the master record, record id. This can be set as the first record that forms the group/entity (group id=record id) or you can use logic to ensure this is your “golden record”. You have many matching rules, each rule matches rows using the various match algorithms above (think of it as sub-matching) - we had 3 big ones. Highest weight rule was where all attributes matched between two records (name + address), rule 2: name + zip matched, rule 3 - address only matched. First step of the process was a data quality phase - ensure all records have these fields populated - ie: if zip is blank or wrong, we look up address to populate the zip. \n\nEDIT: What exactly is a “entity”?  You’ll find really interesting situations in your data. For example, for us an entity was a customer/account. We found situations where a customer has multiple buildings, each on different roads (close to each other on their property) which made the addresses very different, requiring manual matching override. Think of a large corporate campus, university, or government facility (military base). All those buildings are on different roads, with different addresses - but are the same entity. It’s very unlikely the tool will match them, since it matches addresses.. so manual overrides are needed (unless you can work in reference data and additional rules about all the various streets on the campus…)\n\nEDIT: you’ll also get matching logical problems where record A matches record B, and record B matches record C, so that means A=C. But it shouldn’t…so you have this huge blob of over matched records you need to manually split up. The incorrect matching is coming from data quality problems. Essentially, you have 1 bad address row causing two entities to be incorrectly linked. This can happen when businesses use central billing locations - like a corporate headquarters, or a state/city office. For example, the city cemetery and the city water treatment, and the city transportation service all get linked because their data comes to you via the cities single administrative building with a single address.\n\nEDIT:  I really liked this book. Data Matching, by Peter Christen\n\nEDIT: Think about what you are going to do with the data. If it’s data warehousing only, you might want to build a “reference style Master Data Management database”. This essentially is only used for data warehouse/analytics, and consumes data from systems but does not push data to source systems (or claim to own customer). But if you need to create the enterprise definition of the truth, and your job is to “own” the definition of customer for the enterprise — then you need to catch customer data being entered in various source systems, master it quickly, and push it back to those systems. There are different styles of MDM architecture/tools. Same matching principles - but speed and integration becomes a more important requirement.",

Definitely be an expert in Python, SQL and either Snowflake or Pyspark. This can be your core. It is a quite wide stack that will certainly get interview calls and this can become your strengths when you talk about yourself in interviews.\n\n2. DBT and Airflow can be next to master. By mastery I mean you should know what are real bugs/limitations you encountered, how you migrated across versions, how you managed deployments of 1000s of models or pipelines, etc. What works for 10 jobs rarely works for 1000s.\n\n3. For good companies data structures and algo will most likely come in picture. Be good at fundamentals around data warehousing, data modeling, data architectures. DDIA is a must read. General system design can become relevant.\n\n4. Streamlit is a very nice to have feature, not sure about job interviews but once you are in a role it will help you shine if you can demonstrate good insights from the data that you are engineering. Same applies for ML engineering.\n\n5. A good background in a database technology can also be a good thing. Postgresql has emerged as a standard but that again is going to take quite some time to master.\n\n  \nAll the best!",

I feel the advice is pretty straightforward here.  You just need to plough on and actually back yourself.  If you can't even be confident of your own skills or at least hungry enough to understand that you need to fake confidence in the application stage, it's not going to be very fun in the interview.",

But normally, I wouldn't say a data engineer needs to understand EA or TOGAF at all. I mean, it doesn't hurt but really shouldn’t be a requirement. In your case, it may help you liase more effectively with your EA function. \n\nPersonally, as an enterprise architect, I don't think the rest of the organization should be exposed to framework jargon. Who outside the EA function cares about TOGAF and all that anyway? Most sane people cares about outcomes, not frameworks.",

I would however advise you to consider that what your stakeholders consider to be current data and what you consider to be current data may not be the same thing. So, for example, if you're doing dimensional modeling and you're choosing to only use current data in your dim tables, you're missing out on what could be critical information for each fact line in the time that it was loaded. For example, if they want to track customer activations and deactivations, you would use a historical dim customer table for that. So as long as you have this in mind and are prepared to shift to historical dim tables when these requests come up, you should be fine. \n\nRegardless, because you are retaining that history at the raw source layer, you'll be fine. It just might be extra work later on.\n\nI think I've said you'll be fine enough times here :)",

Why don't my managers recognise how great I am?\" In women forums particularly (I can't speak to how men feel about it), this will usually dovetail into a lot of self-doubt around how much value you're actually bringing.  \nThe key to being promoted anywhere is knowing how to talk to the next levels up in a way they can relate to and feel reassured by. And particularly when dealing with non-technical leaders, they don't want to be bogged down by a lot of technical detail, it's scary and confusing to them. You think you're showing them your great technical acumen but you're just convincing them they would rather work with the other guy. He may be dumb but they don't realise that, they just know he speaks their language.  \nMy lifelong frustration with tech in a nutshell, but too late to change fields now!  \nETA your post has some solid advice OP, even if it has me grinding my teeth.

More often than not, we get so caught up under the hubris of achieving technical excellence that we forget who it's being developed for. \n\nMy only thought was that it maybe slightly oversimplifies why some engineers get overlooked. The \"myth\" of focusing only on technical excellence felt a bit like a strawman – most engineers I know realize communication matters, even if they don't prioritize it enough. And promotions often involve more complex factors than just technical skill vs. relationships (like scope, leadership potential, strategic impact).\n\nBut overall, a valuable perspective on needing more than just coding chops.

That's why I was thinking of **starting small**, with \"localized feedback loops\" (e.g., just chunk sizing or retry policies first) instead of trying to self-optimize everything globally.\n\nAlso, love the reference to SQL Server's Intelligent Query Processing,  hadn't thought of drawing that parallel before. Now that you mention it, adapting those \"micro-optimizations\" ideas into ETL runtime behavior makes a lot of sense.\n\nWould love to brainstorm further, especially how to better \"normalize\" feedback signals over time despite different ingestion profiles. Maybe a lightweight baseline sampling strategy?\n\nThanks again — this really made me think deeper about the implementation side!",

Coalesce is built for tech and non-tech users that want to quickly build data transformation, machine learning, and/or Cortex pipelines by means of an intuitive point & click interface. Documentation is automatically generated in Coalesce as you create nodes. There are so many other features about Coalesce that I love. \n\nBut your question is about version control, so I'll stop rambling about my love for Coalesce. Within Coalesce, each project is assigned a Git repo and branch. Every single change can be committed or rolled back. There is also a nifty AI commit message generator that saves several seconds when checking in changes. The change control window in Coalesce is similar to Git - it has two panels that show your modifications vs the last committed version and the changes are highlighted. \n\nAs for committing all changes or line item, it really depends on how frequently you commit. In my experience, I typically commit every time I make a considerable change to a node (dimension, stage, fact, etc.). I don't commit if I change a single column because that is a bunch of overhead in my opinion.",

It's fully integrated with git and is a low code tool specifically for data modelling. You will not find you don't have enough flexibility - you're writing SQL not python remember. The other thing to consider is CI?CD -- Coalesce automatically handles the rendering of the downstream DAG based on what models you update. It works out the box, whereas with dbt you need to setup \"slim CI\" or set something up in your orchestrator or whatever\n\nAs someone who runs a company in data and works with both (we run dbt core and work with the Coalesce folks) the difference in outcomes we see is crazy. There are folks that are orders of magnitude faster with Coalesce than dbt +Airflow. There are folks whose full time job it now is to manage 2,000 badly designed dbt models on a redshift cluster. Equally there are folks using dbt with really robust data modelling principles that move super fast too.\n\nCannot overstate the importance of modelling the data properly here and hence depending on your team's skills Coalesce is worth considering",

And while PySpark is fine, unless you already feel very comfortable in SQL, I’d suggest devoting more time to it as that is the one language all Data Engineers need to know very well and you can even use it in PySpark. Also you may want to consider DuckDB as it could also just be an easier way to accomplish transforming your data.\n\nWhile NoSQL is definitely useful, it isn’t something I’d suggest anyone just getting started to even consider. Stick with CSV or even better, parquet.\n\nAlso if you do BI, I’d suggest streamlit as it is Python based and they have free hosting to show off your project.\n\nLastly and I know I’m being nit picky, but Scala isn’t dying, it is just the use cases where you need to use it over Python are only at massive scale. I’d steer most new people away from it just because it isn’t as marketable of a skill.\n\nEdit: fixed wording",

Sets and set theory are your best friends (remember 2nd grade?).\n\nAfter that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1iw9pe4/comment/mec9u94/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) is a previous post that covers a good start. A second, more focused on data warehousing is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1j9lyg8/comment/mheoy1h/?context=3).\n\nUnderstand the difference between operational data (where flows are important, the data sizes smaller and response time is critical) and analytic data (large to huge dataset sizes, storage costs become a factor). Most of the analytic data in the cloud is in 1NF(-ish) style and as such limits what can be done with it without starting over. Most cloud tools have a sweet spot that is in the operational spectrum.\n\nSorry for all the links, but data is a huge subject. It is far bigger than the nuances of any programming language. It is very rare for screwing up in a program gets you fined or thrown in jail. Getting fired is the low end of the scale. Data screwups have the potential for all of them.",

Don’t trust AI. If you are not confident in your abilities, don’t even use AI, because it can lead you astray",

It’s more like a really good assistant, but they can only muster up what you can properly describe… so the results are still limited by a lowest common denominator— You.\n\nI am a firm believer tho, that someday, technical syntax will become highly abstracted away from us as AI tooling becomes more fixated on doing absolutely everything between pre and post conditions. Very likely, we’ll end up with a more friendly language to describe the semantics for end-users, and the syntax used by AI will be at a low enough level as to effectively build what the user requests. Anyways, dreams for the future.. for the next decade or two, honing a strong foundation in how to program/query/architect solutions will be be very beneficial to everything else you do, including using AI tooling its fullest.",

I'd take that guaranteed offer as a backup but still apply for 2026 internships at companies with strong DE teams.

What data products you support require real time. This can usually reduce the scope of the streaming data you need to manage in real time.\n2. For your data products that don’t require real time, you can instead land the streaming data in an object store like s3 and point ClickHouse at that. If you efficiently partition the data, you could easily maybe run hourly (or however frequent you need to add data to your historical analytics) batches to bring in new data.",

I agree LLMs aren't the perfect solutions, but the thing is I already have extracted text and ordered to the bext of my ability, now I will do a first pass and cleanup with regex and case matching, but for the final sorting I think I will need LLM to crunch through the text. Which also isn't expensive and hard, it's just a matter of choosing proper model and proper promt. Do you have any ideas which models would be good for this (text crunching and proper sorting and spitting out json output, while being smart to realize the context of what is message and what is not) haha. I will check out Kaggle too thank you!",

In case 1 (copy on write) all the parquet files containing the deleted rows are rewritten in a new file to omit those rows,  and then the metadata json files are updated to point at the new parquet files. In the second case (merge on read), a special metadata file called a deletion vector is written that identifies which rows in which parquet files to ignore on read. For performance, every so often you do the steps of the first method and produce rewritten compacted parquet files. Stale parquet files that are no longer referenced by any current metadata files can be deleted via an operation called \"Vacuuming\".most of this happens automatically with the \"DELETE...\" or \"VACUUM\" Spark SQL operations.",

In a parquet table, the files are directly replaced (no time travel). This is handled for you based on the type of write operation you choose (overwrite, merge). Appends of course happen with no data deletion. \n\nFile organization is abstracted as well. Each table has a directory based on its name (or a location you assign). This is why hierarchical namespace (in azure terms) is required over the storage account. If you determine there is a need to partition the data on some column, in which case a directory structure is created for you, with files generated in those directories containing only the data matching a column value to directory partition.",

This allows for more efficient filtering at the file level. It is slightly more complex than this when it comes to a Data Warehouse like BigQuery, but generally when you “merge” a record into columnar storage, you can think about the operation like this:\n\n1. Search for the file your data is potentially in based on file metadata\n2. If the record could be in a file based on the metadata, read the existing data in to memory\n3. Find the matching rows in each column\n4. Update them if they exist\n5. Overwrite the existing file in storage and update the file metadata if a record was inserted\n\nClustering improves look up speed in this process by making it more efficient to find the right file to operate on. \n\nFor instance, let’s say you have a table of product purchases with a reference to the customer who made the purchase. This table has mutable attributes like product delivery date (NULL until it has been delivered) that need to be updated on delivery of the product. \n\nAn appropriate clustering field for this table might be customer_id, which would logically group all purchases by the associated customer_id when writing to a file. This way, instead of needing to read potentially every file in the table in to memory to try and find a purchase to update, it is able to read in only a select file or two. In order to take advantage of this, you would need to use the customer_id in the merge predicate.",

In fact, I would look to see if there are any companies trying to migrate from on-prem Oracle stacks to cloud based ones and see which cloud provider they tend to go for (I would guess Azure but that’s just a guess) and then get a cert in that.

Yes it might be crowded but it's not as bad as many people say it is. I'm not saying this as Upwork is the best place but 90% of people don't have a strategy and endurance to figure out how the platform works. I actually landed Unilever as a client and did 3 projects with them through the platform as a data analyst.\n\n\\- Large / corporates hire freelancers through recruiting firms. That's called contracting. Those project usually last 3-18 months and are almost always full-time. They are great to get started as a freelancer as they pay very well but you will depend on just one client.  \n  \nI have a community of data freelancers so I can testify that yes it's a viable career path. \n\nEnough talk.

For this SAP has a tool called MDG.\nIn this new work mode employees create data entries via the MDG Platform and are guided through a workflow. This is mostly for Material Master Data, Procurement Info Records and Business Partners or other Master Data. The tool also includes automated flows to check and update data and ensure compliance. SAP MDG pushes these entries to the ERP System.\n\nFor Passive Data Governance (data cleansing) we extract SAP ERP, CRM, EWM Data via \"SAP Data Services\" (classic RFC connection) and bring it into \"SAP information Steward\". Within this tool you can create Data Quality Rules with an SAP Script (kind of SQL like). Then we automatically distribute these generated cleansing files to the required business owners according to the scheduler.\n\nOn Top of that we have a PowerBI monitoring the progress of data quality for these data quality rules.\n\nAs you see we are rather SAP heavy. On one hand it's SAP which sometimes can be \"special\" on the other hand the integration works well.",

Having a dedicated sensitive development environment with controlled access to that sensitive data lake is a solid practice many organizations follow.\n\nFor employee data, workers comp, and other sensitive non-health information, there are different regulatory considerations than HIPAA (like GDPR, CCPA, or industry-specific regulations depending on your sector). The separation approach you described is similar to what I've seen at companies with mature data governance. It balances the need for developers to work with realistic data while maintaining appropriate controls around sensitive information.",

Languages are tools, concepts translate between them. If you master one, then you'll stand out vs. others who mastered none, and you'll pick up any language required of you on the job in weeks.\n- DSA classes & Leetcode. Most important part of CS due to how interviews are structured. Do 250 most common LC problems and focus on easy/medium unless targetting FAANG for first job.\n- Build practical projects. Initially start simple, like that easy react page you created. You learn by doing 10x faster than tutorial hell. You need to learn how to structure your own projects and build something from A to Z, from having an idea to breaking it down in small parts and building it out (without guidance provided in tutorials).\n- Project structure for bigger applications, everything has its own place and the quicker you start modulating projects the way they do in production the faster you'll grow.\n- Find a specialization and focus on it. Try simple projects: react frontend page you did, then try building a backend API with CRUD, try building a simple ETL pipeline for data, then try a simple github CI/CD with github actions and dockerize one of the apps. Nothing complex. Cover basics of each, build them in a few days, and then ask yourself: which one seems most interesting to you, which one seems like something you'd like to pursue?\n\nSpecialization matters heavily. Everyone spreads themselves thin, and if your goal is to achieve what CS grads do in 4 years, you should pick something early on and master one area. Become employable in it asap, enter the field and learn rest on the job.\n\nI went for full-stack Python+TypeScript React. Docker & Github Actions. Learning Next.js and Kubernetes now.",

        "body": "I've won hackathons before. Best tip is to practice with an existing team, as a team, and do mock hackathons.  \n\nIf you know react, and what packages to download, you can build something in less than 12 hours.  \n\nFirst 4 hours might be planning and reading the docs, 4 hours of sleep, 4 hours to clean up and submit. 12 hours of productive coding.  \n\nWe can break down the 12 hours even further if you want, but assume also each team member knows what they are doing and we can do it in parallel.  \n\nInitialize the git repo, frontend, backend and database on local host with a decided framework. Database can be hosted on the cloud. Frontend is probably react, or vue, with tailwind css or bootstrap as the UI framework or use another one with copy and paste components. Backend can be flask or django, or if you want, ignore backend completely and just connect frontend to the database directly. (don't do this with real production code). (takes around 1-2 hours)  \n  \nYour team of four starts splitting up work. One or two guys start working on frontend with the UI framework. One guy working on util libraries and business logic as well as api and webhooks. Another guy working on the database. You may have a floater or a guy that finished early to do merges and resolving merge conflicts. (3-6 hours)\nWorking in parallel will require constantly preplanning what tasks are important that have a lot of other tasks dependent on it and which tasks have a lot of dependencies itself. (but at this point you should be polishing up) (3-6 hours)  \n  \nCloud hosting is quick and easy nowadays, should only take 1-2 hours. It might take a while to figure out the dockerfile and which cloud hosting platform will help the most.\nIf you know what you are doing, and use existing open source frameworks and solutions, you can cut down the time spent writing boilerplate code and just focus on connecting API calls and endpoints.  \n\n----\n# Just a few tips\n  \n1. Already find your team of four and practice with them before the competition. Treat it like a war game if you want. Go into what if scenarios and try and build real projects together.  \n  \n2. Look into the hackathons previous winners and losers from previous hackathons. Try and figure out how the judges pick the winners.  \nDo the judges really care about ML technologies? or do they just care about fancy UI? Some judges care about how many microservices you used and/or how big your techstack us. Do a lot of preplanning to figure out what the judges like.  \n  \n3. As the competition gets near, usually company names start appearing, judges names start appearing, as well as the challenge names. Do a lot of research on the companies and judges.  \n  \nIf you wanna score points from a company, look into what API libraries they might want you to use. If you want to score points with a judges, and they are industry or professor, do a challenge that they can relate to.  \n  \n4. Never rebuild the wheel. Use other people's code. Use open source frameworks and code from github.\nNo hackathon winner will ever build their entire stack. The use frameworks and existing solutions. The only thing they will build themselves are the connections between the frontend and the backend as well as the business logic.  \n  \n5. Add as much techstack and bloat as you can. Host it on a bunch of microservices, use OAuth, host it on the cloud. Add infinite horizontal scaling. Judges for some reason like that, even if it does nothing for your app.  \n  \n6. The app doesn't even have to work. It only needs to seem like it works.\n   \n---\n  \nWinning hackathons is a specific skill, and only some of it is transferable to actual industry. Over representing your app to judges probably isn't something you will do in industry, and hard coding stuff is probably something you won't do.  \n  \nBut the best tip is to just practice and get good at using other people's code.",

If you know anything about cars there are stick shift cars and automatic right? \n\nThese days automatic transmissions are faster than humans can shift and nearly as reliable with less and less horsepower loss as the years go by. \n\nWhat your instructors are getting at is similar. C and Rust are cars with manual transmissions or in computer terms manual memory management. C#, Java, and the node.js platform are automated memory management languages. \n\nManually controlling gears, downshifting into a corner, clutch kicking when you want the ass end of your car to slide, and dumping the clutch for a nasty burnout are things you can only do in a stickshift. \n\nSimilarly, manually allocating heap (and stack) memory, directly accessing processor register information, running online assembly and other features are only possible in systems languages like C and Rust. \n\nMost people just want to get to work and back safely which is why most cars these days are automatic. Business software (and jobs) are the exact same. Businesses don't want to hire you to write a compiler or window manager. They probably want a crud app that is fast enough and doesnt look awful. \n\nYou can do a lot, these days most, types of serious software development in memory managed languages (automatic) like c# and Java. If you don't believe me ask Microsoft who uses one of the most hated languages of all time (javascript) to power their most important communications app (Teams).\n\nBuild things with the tools you have and know and then if you actually can't build something you need using the tools you already have then you pickup and learn a new tool.",

Or that the code was incomplete, because I hadn't finished writing it.\n\nAlso, one time we had a miscommunication and someone pushed that dev code to prod while I was on my lunch break.\n\nOnce, I was told to push something we were still revising the DB schema on to dev, and then that same manager gave a client a URL to test it on our dev server, and suddenly we had to work around maintaining that clients (easily replaceable) data, and even had to write a conversion for it later.\n\nSo, to summarize (my personal experience in hell), any code that leaves your computer should be complete and tested before it hits a dev server, because some non-technical stakeholders don't understand what dev servers are for. Nobody will remember that you delivered something 3 days late, but it'll harm your reputation and add more work for you if someone else sees it too early.",

Generating code is easy, maintaining and extending it is the hard part.\n\nI got a bachelor of computer science in my earlier 30s, so it's not too late.

In many ways I have been lucky due to my autonomy at work, but the actual coding part is like 10% of the time many cases. \n\nTasks won't be well defined. Communication is extra overall including meetings. You'll work on code made by others that is weird. You'll work with people that might not share your views on coding standards. \n\nMy worry is that you don't know anywhere near what a developer job would encompass and it wouldn't be nowhere near as fun as personal projects. \n\nWhat I would possible do in your case is to extend and improve your current work by automation with code, and not just no-code tools, but actual coding as well. Python would be great for this for example. When you have some real-world coding projects and experience, maybe then you can go further.\n\nI'd hesitate making the jump before you have done a side-gig of coding, or getting to know it much more than what you know now.

Without those skills, you can't get any experience, so it's a necessary part of the puzzle! But the tech boom of the last decade or so has meant a **lot** of people have learnt some coding skills, so jobs increasingly require both skills **and** experience.\n\n>how the heck does programming even work? What the hell is happening?\n\nThink about a simple circuit, with a battery, a push button and a lightbulb: you press the button, the lightbulb switches on; you unpress the button, it switches off.\n\nNow imagine you have a 7-segment LCD display (like the ones on digital clocks that display numbers): that's just 7 versions of the same thing, so in order to display the number \"5\" on your screen, you need to press and unpress the right combinations of 7 buttons. But that's really annoying, so instead, you create a mega-button labelled \"5\", and just wire it so that when you press the \"5\" button, it press and unpresses all the right buttons for you. Congratulations: you have abstracted away the electronics, and now you have a simpler interface.\n\nProgramming is just that: abstractions upon abstractions. You can't write a \"hello world\" program by interfacing with the monitor directly - mapping each key on your keyboard to the setting and unsetting of individual pixels - primarily because that would be insane. It would be like my 7-button example above, but trillions of buttons. Computers would be utterly unusable without abstractions to handle all that for us.\n\n>I know I could probably just import a GUI library and use it, but I don't want to just use a library, I want to understand how this technical stuff (that my school didn't teach) works.\n\nFirstly, don't blame your school for not teaching you how to build a computer from scratch out of transistors and diodes. That's like complaining that your school allowed you to buy pens and notebooks, rather than teaching you how to grind your own ink, whittle your own quill, fell your own tree and process it into paper. If you're really, deeply interested in that, then you **can** work towards it: it's not a bad thing to do, it's just a very niche thing to do. For most people, as they transition from school to work, they should really be focusing on what they need to do / learn / practise to make their skills **productive**. That means learn to use common, widely-supported, easy libraries, and delve behind the scenes when they stop being able to do what you need them to do.",

I'd done a lot of professional programming before I got my degree (decades ago, when one could more easily get work without a degree). I didn't start on my degree until I was 30. To me, nearly every class-required programming project until my senior year looked like a toy project to me.\n\n*(The one project that wasn't a toy project was insanely big and complex, most people dropped out of the class doing that project, myself included, and the three people who did finish the class had to spend an extra semester beyond the one semester the class was supposed to take to get the classwork done.)*\n\nNot to brag (okay, yes, very clearly to brag) I graduated at the top of my class in Computer Science. I couldn't help but feel my classmates were in for a rude shock when they had to do real-world coding projects.\n\nWhat helped me feel more prepared is that programming had been a hobby of mine since high school. Even before I got my first programming job I had already, just for fun, done stuff much more complicated than I had to do to get a Bachelor's degree in college.\n\nThis is not to say I didn't learn anything useful in college. I most certainly did. I gained a lot more discipline and perspective on coding than I had hacking away on my own.\n\nIt helps if you actually enjoy creating software and aren't just after a degree because it seems like a good way to make money. If you've got that kind of interest, I'd suggest jumping in to help on some open-source project that interests you, or just come up with your own projects that pique your interest. Challenge yourself. Find things that keep pushing the edge of what you know how to do so you're always learning something new as you go along.\n\nThis is not to say you won't be able to get a job and work your way up while learning on the job. Clearly many people with your same educational background get jobs at companies prepared to train fresh graduates.  \n  \nThen again, if AI starts to take over some of the more basic, routine work, those opportunities might begin to shrink.\n\nI retired just a couple of years ago, but I'm still coding away.

With modern frameworks and development methodologies, and especially the advancements PHP itself has made over the years, it has improved, and it's definitely possible to write perfectly fine programs with it, no doubt about it. But it still remains a mess at its core. I'm saying this as someone who has worked with it for decades, wrote articles defending it, and who's still the top answerer of all time in the Stack Overflow PHP tag.\n\nIf you compare it to properly designed languages which are internally consistent and not full of pitfalls, everything in PHP just feels like a dirty hack. Again, while you _can_ build perfectly fine stuff with it… why not use a better language?\n\nIMO, the only thing PHP does better than any other language is the seamless integration into HTML pages. Which is how it got started anyway, and why it's so easy to pick up, and why it's become so popular. Because the progression from dicking around with HTML to adding some programming to said HTML is seamless and easy and likely a natural gateway drug for many. But even modern PHP frameworks don't use this strength of PHP anymore, they use separate template engines like any other language does too. So I see little reason to choose PHP for any new project; except if it's the only language you know.",

Have a function that's not returning what you expect it to, but you have no idea why? Place a break point there and run the debugger. Execution will stop at that break point and then you can advance it line by line while you check the state of all the variables and see what path your code takes.",

So for example if a project builds with gcc, clang, and MSVC they might wait until all three support all of the syntax, but if the project only needs to run on one platform with one toolchain they might upgrade sooner.\n\nAllowing features from a newer C++ rarely means updating all existing code. Parts of the code that are stable and haven't changed in a while might still be written in an older style, including a pre-C++11 style.\n\nSo if you joined a company today and got put on a C++ project, my expectation would be that it supports and allows C++20 (which has been stable in all compilers for a while), does not support C++23 (most compilers have incomplete support, the average project doesn't want to be bleeding-edge), but that lots of the code doesn't take advantage of newer features where it could because nobody has bothered to rewrite it.\n\nNewer versions of C++ standardize things like networking and threading that were previously only available from third-party libraries. I think use of those in existing projects is low, because most existing projects already use a different library that works fine, so why change something that works?",

How often the code changes, how solid your requirements are, what your dependencies look like, etc. During development it's a huge boon to already have tests written that you can use to exercise your code path. If not TDD just as an assist to get your debugger to hit while you're sorting out the quirks. If your shipping an SDK or package especially unit tests are important.\n\nI have a personal preference to dislike unit style tests for applications. My experience with them is that you end up with a lot of test cases, that's a lot of code to maintain. Most if it is repeated and exercising the same part of a function dozens of times. I often find unit tests that aren't testing anything at all, but rather validating assumptions of the language or platform, which is completely inappropriate and a waste of time. I've read plenty of great unit tests too, I've just grown exhausted pruning and curating them.\n\nWhat people don't often account for is that tests aren't just expensive to write, but they can be expensive to maintain too. Because of this, I prefer a smaller curated set of tests that cover larger scenarios than a 'code unit'. Not integration tests, but something that exercises the actual intent of the application as thoroughly as possible while not requiring real dependencies to be set up. Then I use a comprehensive monitoring solution to detect when edge cases occur in our production environment.\n\nEverything is a trade off. What I think gets missed in discussions about QA is how a poor ROI on one QA solution can eat time that would otherwise be spent on a different one.",

I was advised by someone I trust to not rely on that stuff while learning, and not to copy paste either, since directly typing everything out helps a lot with remembering it all too.\n\nBut to be honest, just use anything.

Also consider your definition of a \"project\".\n\nA project does not have to be large. And if you do have a larger project in mind, you can probably break it down into smaller ones. When I was writing file parsers as part of an automated test tool (it took in a file describing expected values and various data recording files), I studied parsing techniques. I wrote a variety of one-off programs that parsed the various input file formats and then turned them into libraries that could be used by the actual target program. Each one of these took me 1-5 days (some formats were simple, others were not, by the end I was able to reuse code as well for similar formats), then I integrated them into my main program and glued it all together and had a beta version for my colleagues.\n\nWhat I didn't do was try to implement all the parsers all at once (context switching between each task) or only write them as part of the main program with no way to evaluate my partially working system. By setting them up as these one-offs I was able to stay focused, generate some tests, and figure out if I really was parsing the data correctly (mostly taking the parsed data and regenerating the original files and comparing the two).\n\nIf you have multiple projects that you want to complete, set deadlines. Decide that \"By 15 May I want project X to have features A, B, and C.\" Then do it. If there's no external driver of priority (no work or school objective, all personal) you declare your priorities. Otherwise everything is the same priority and no progress is ever made. Even for work I do this. If I have a 12-month project with no one deciding which features needed to be done by a particular date, I just set them myself. If the customer/user didn't like my ordering I'd ask for their priorities and if they still didn't give them (or everything was #1) then I stuck to my plan. Having deadlines and desired partial states for the project work very well to keep things moving along.",

That means every single language your company uses, every single tool, framework, or library - all of it needs to be secure, and the security team is ultimately responsible for it.\n\nNow, if you work on a security team then you might specialize. One person might focus on web security, another on SQL injections, and another on mobile. But in my experience that's not very common unless you have a very large company. At most smaller companies, everyone in security has to know a little bit about everything.\n\nRemember, security is only as strong as its weakest link. Let's say your company has a mobile app, a web app, and a backend running in AWS with a Postgres database. All of them need to be secure. If just a single one is insecure and can be hacked, that brings the whole company down and it doesn't matter how secure everything else was.\n\nHonestly that's one of the things that makes security fun. You don't stay in your small lane, you get to work on literally everything. Your job is to catch any potential vulnerabilities wherever they might be, before hackers do first.",

Unless your goal is to research new algorithms, then those are indeed all of the steps - and yet there's an enormous amount of nuance and complexity hidden there.\n\n1. Bring in the data - this part is easy if someone else has already done the hard work of collecting the data, but in many real-world scenarios the data hasn't been collected yet, so this might involve building apps, sites, custom tools, scrapers, whatever is necessary to collect the data for your particular application.\n\n2. Clean and prepare - this can be quite subtle and nuanced. If you accidentally bring in any features that are biased or correlated with the class you're trying to predict, your model will overfit and you might not realize it until months later when it fails to work in production.\n\n3. Call the class of algorithm and fit - this seems easy when all of your data fits in RAM, but once you start trying to train on hundreds of terabytes worth of data, this is no longer simple. Also, when you have to wait days to train instead of minutes or hours, it becomes far more important to figure out how to validate your approach on smaller subsets first before trying to train on everything.\n\n4. Predict - in most real-world scenarios you're not just calling predict once, you're trying to take that model and embed it into an app so that it can do real-time predictions. This means figuring out how to take a lot of the cleaning and preparing steps from training and recreating them in some other environment, plus dealing with all sorts of other error cases.",

Congrats!\n\nIf you are enjoying frontend development, I say keep at it!  There will always be work for it as long as the internet exists, the role will just continue to evolve over time and like any sort of software development you have to keep up with the latest changes and advancements in the technology to stay on top of your game - but it's all still built on the same foundations.\n\nYou could learn some frontend frameworks next to make your skills more marketable, if frontend development is what interests you most.  Or you could spend time learning javascript/typescript properly instead of relying on a framework, which will prime you for backend or full stack development if you want to go that direction.",

Spending a whole year faffing about with HTML and CSS is not going to work. This is a challenging field to find work in with a lot of competition. So to make it here you're going to need to shift your expectations, and really commit to learning properly and at pace.\n\nIt can be done. But it's not going to work if your learning is spending the occasional hour doing a Udemy course.\n\nTo be clear, I am not trying to discourage you. I am trying to align your expectations to be more realistic so you have a better chance of success if you're actually serious about this being more than a fun hobby.\n\nThe level you are at now (know the basics of HTML and CSS, and a little bit of interaction from JS) is where I would expect someone to be after a few weeks. Not a year. You are nowhere near being ready for work. So have a serious think about if you want to do this, and if you do commit and set yourself up for success.\n\nFor a junior role you will need: \n\n\\- A solid understanding of TypeScript\n\n\\- A solid understanding of some front end frameworks / libraries (React & MUI/Mantine/Shad-CN)\n\n\\- A solid understanding of some backend framework (Express/Hono/etc)\n\n\\- A solid understanding of testing\n\n\\- A solid understanding of databases and ORMs\n\n\\- A solid understanding of surrounding tech such as GitHub & Actions etc.\n\n  \nNobody, in 2025, is building websites with basic HTML and CSS. That is how we did it back in 1999. And commercial work is going to require that you have the skills and understanding necessary to work in a modern way. \n\nThe bar to entry is high. That's why the pay is also good.\n\nYou can do this. But understand that you are currently on step one of a one-hundred step journey.",

It makes the actual changes hard to trace due to all the noise, though I think it may be configured to ignore the formatting changes your repo and admin may not be up to dealing with that.\n\nMy advice is to have the conversation... tell them you want to apply THIS style (pick a standard one you like) to the code as you are working, and that you will do TWO check ins -- the first one will be format fixing the files you are working with, and the second one the changes to the code.   See if they are open to this sort of thing... a blanket \"THIS UPDATE ONLY CHANGES CODE FORMATTING\" on the check-in merge should prevent anyone from needing to look at that entire commit, and your code changes can be evaluated without fuss.  Show them a sample of the code formatted and unformatted, the worst piece you have worked on and can lay to hand, and walk them through why formatting helps you work on it easier.  Let them know that the reformatting is done by a tool in seconds and won't cut into your productivity at all (if possible, demonstrate it).   Make the hard sell, defend it, convince them.",

That being said, low code environs can be massively helpful in niche fields like computational geometry where having visual feedback for geometry manipulation is - I'd say - almost mandatory.\n\nFrom what I've seen so far - no-code or low code tech seems to thrive in cases where (a) the majority of the users aren't programmers, and (b) outputs from these technologies aren't the deliverables in and of themselves.\n\nBy deliverables I mean the end product being shipped/deployed/put into production.\n\nFor example, in the construction industry - architects and engineers will frequently use no-code solutions to build quick and dirty prototypes for their projects. But these prototypes aren't the deliverable, the drawings and 3d models are. They'll use the prototypes as seeds/base for building mode complex models sure, but the direct output from a no-code or low code solution is rarely ever passed on as the actual deliverable.\n\nTo sum it all up - For a typical career in programming, I feel you don't really need it (outside of cases where using them speeds up the feedback loop). But if you go into niche fields like game development and/or 3d modelling, then you'll encounter them sooner or later, but you don't need to know them beforehand to get used to them.",

Cyber you can get in to on your own by doing online courses and certifications but this is less programming and more just security information. \n\nPython is generally recommended for beginners. \n\nI would look at JS especially the fancy frameworks like next and react and some new one that came out that probably came out as I am typing this. \n\nIf you want low level stuff I think rust is pretty cool.

I may not yet know exactly how to correctly calculate that... but figuring out the exact contract I want for handing that work off to a function is pretty trivial:\n\n    func calculateDistance(from: Coordinate, to: Coordinate) -> Distance {\n        return 0\n    }\n\n(for whatever syntax you need for your language)\n\n  \nIf I chunk my application up in this way, I can write the main flow of `main` or whatever into this smaller bites and start with an organized structure of code that I just need to go back and fill in little chunks bit by bit.\n\nIf it's easier for you to implement all the logic first *then* slice chunks off to move into functions, I think that's *also* fine.... but it also means the contracts, the interface, becomes kind of an afterthought *and* it means your first pass likely has you non-obviously duplicating some code.",

Modern games use an \"engine,\" which is really a collection of software components to pre-write all of the above. \n\nHere it is in Python: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-pong-game-using-python-turtle/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-pong-game-using-python-turtle/) .\n\nStudy the code, understand the code, make a better one.\n\nnext, move up to Doom. Doom is a \"2 1/2d\" game. It looks 3d, but it uses clever tricks and is really not.\n\nThis repository has code for one [https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/DOOM-style-Game](https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/DOOM-style-Game) .\n\nThat said, this is an order of magnitude more complex so google Doom in Python and do a good amount of reading. \n\nIf you make it through both of those projects you will be ready to start looking at real 3d games. Keep in mind while you can do 3D in Python, it will be slow. 3D games use some form of C. or a related compiled language. Full on game development environments like Unreal Engine have optimized libraries and allow you to create at a very high level and then build the game executable. \n\nGame development is a long road.

Don't ever think you will know everything about a language either. It is constantly changing and it is quite vast. \n\nYou also don't need to be a full on python wizard to get into AI. Learn a few basic ideas about AI concepts like models, tokenization, how AI reasons and plug them into what you are learning from Python. Remember that much of the AI landscape is built with the idea that it will work with Python and all you lack right now is the practice to merge the two. Find a free online course for AI for beginners and make sure it is paired up with some project work using Python and you will be well on your way.",

Yes, examples in video tutorials tend to me very mindless or useless stuff like that. It is something that the book format handles much better. A well designed book will have examples (often they are of the \"useless\" variety but often will be more practical), explanations, and then at the end of each chapter an \"exercises\" part to practice what you learned. And working those \"exercises\" on your own is critical to learning something like this.\n\nIn this respect it's kind of like maths -- yes, you can ask your symbolic calculator to solve integrals for you, but unless you actually do the examples yourself using the techniques shown in the chapter, you won't understand how it \"really\" works. You'll just be feeding in answers from your machine (from your symbolic calculator, for example).",

Both remove certain features from C++, although they have their own complications. Either language would be a good stepping stone to C++.",

You are stepping into a global market where you will be competing with people who have years of experience, full portfolios, and plenty of client reviews. Platforms like Upwork are crowded, and getting your first job there can take a long time unless you already have something that makes you stand out.\n\nIn your case, it might be smarter to focus on getting a regular full-time developer job first. That gives you some structure, experience, and something real to put on your resume. And if your long-term goal is to work remotely, you can still work toward that in parallel.\n\nThat is the path I ended up taking. I spent months applying to \"remote\" jobs that seemed like a perfect fit, only to find out they were limited to one country, or I got automatically rejected because of my location. Eventually, I realized I had to take a different approach and decided to get an on-site job first. Then, I started researching companies that actually hire globally. After over 200 hours of research and trying to apply to hundreds of jobs, I ended up building a list of 300 truly remote-first companies. \n\nIn a nutshell, it sounds like you are taking a smart approach already, and just getting started with real experience is most likely the best first step.",

FizzBuzz is just an easy, dumb problem [to see if a candidate knows enough to at least solve an easy, dumb problem](https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/). We all have our favorite little solutions, but if you can write a function with a loop and a few \\`if\\` statements, you're done.\n\n>However, the above link doesn't explain why the hashmap solution is more efficient.\n\nHashmaps trade space for time. They offer O(1) time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions, which is to say that you can find, add, or remove an element in constant time regardless of whether it contains 5 elements, 5 thousand, or 5 million. But they get that speed by using enough space to avoid collisions (where different keys hash to the same location) most of the time, so they're very efficient in time, much less so in space.\n\n>I've heard that in technical job interview problems, if you can use a hashmap, then you should. Would you agree with this?\n\nCertainly not. Use the right data structure for the job. Hashmaps are often a great choice, because if you can get constant-time access to every element, that's pretty appealing. But hashmaps are unordered, so a poor choice if you want to access elements in order. They use a ton of space, so not great if there's a space constraint or if the number of elements is huge. And they don't handle multiple values for a single key. Maybe those are reasons that you \"can't\" use a hashmap, but I'd still turn it around and say that if you *need* what a hashmap offers, then you should use it; if a different structure offers a better combination of features, you should use that instead.",

In that case, just using hashmaps everywhere is probably better than not knowing what to do at all. In the end, you'll probably do better by learning some basic data structures and writing programs with them, then using your own brain to decide what is easier, nicer, and more efficient.",

It is truly a misunderstanding of epic proportions that everyone thinks they should \"learn\" how to solve FizzBuzz to prepare for an interview ...\n\nAnyways, the third solution with the hashmap, is **NOT a solution for the FizzBuzz problem**, but a generic \"engine\" that can solve any kind of similar problems where you have some specific value, and if a number is divisible by that value, it should print a specific word instead - combining all the words to one compound word, if the number is divisible by all of them. None of the code will change if you add Jazz for divisible by 7, only the datastructure (the hashmap).\n\n*And it is poorly written, violates the \"single source of truth\" and ironically makes the code harder to maintain, which was the exact point of using a hashmap in the first place.*\n\nPlease don't write ultra-generic code in your interview or in your professional life - I had a colleague once, that wrote some code to handle which days of the week some system should be active. He made it flexible enough to handle if a week ever had more than 7 days, or if there were by chance two Thursdays ...\n\n\n\nAlso, don't trust Geeksforgeeks - their code and article-text often don't match, in this example the text mentions Jazz for 7, but none of the code examples implement it. Also, the C-code doesn't follow the same pattern as the other languages. I've seen even worse examples, where they simply invent wrong explanations, and use libraries that don't exist.

Its perfectly normal for them to stop when they find one such example: you didn't respect their time by vetting your code well, so why would you expect them to do the same for you? 'Ad nauseum' would point to a you problem, not a them problem.\n\nIf they're important, but not critical you can ask them to defer their requested change in a follow-up ticket/PR/MR, whatever is appropriate for your organization. This is a judgement call on how important the issue is and they may disagree with you and how that gets handled is a different issue.\n\nTheres also the notion of Work In Progress \\[WIP\\] reviews that some organizations use. These can circumvent CI systems since they cant/wont/shouldnt be merged and can help get feedback early and often. I always encourage juniors/new hires to do this; its lower stakes and gets ppl up to speed faster, IMHO.\n\nNow, if they're nitpicking \"bugs\" that don't matter or are just otherwise blocking merge on a single style nitpick or somesuch without completing the review thats another story: those can and should be grouped. Similar for minor bugs. If your organization is forcing you to move too quickly to do your due diligence to meet your team's standards, thats a different problem.\n\n\\> Do you speak to colleagues that do reviews this way and try to change their approach?\n\nThis is another organizational problem. More something to mention to a lead/manager/etc than something to confront on an individual level. The team should be relatively aligned on the workflow and top-down is usually going to be a more effective resolution. This is especially true the more junior you are: you may not have these experience to know that its an issue with your work.",

Most of the time, the code should be good quality and well-tested already, and the purpose of the code review should be to make sure it's readable and clear.\n\nNow, if by \"bug\" you mean that the reviewer is complaining about tiny things like an accidental log line left in, or a typo in a comment, or a single line in isolation that could be written better, then that's different.

There's always things that seem like they should work, that don't seem to conflict with anything else, that simply don't work.\n\nFor example, in JS we have what's called \"optional chaining\". We can use optional chaining to access an existing property's value, but we can't use it to assign values to an existing property, nor to create properties w/ assignments (if the property doesn't already exist). Why not? Seems like it'd work.\n\nBut it doesn't, it isn't that simple, and making it work would short-circuit all sorts of other things JS does.

There are two important facts they seem to be missing:\n\n- Not accepting \"MOV AX, var\" is a quirk of your assembler.  \"MOV AX, var\" works fine in my preferred assembler, [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/).\n- \"LEA AX, [var]\" is semantically equivalent [1] to \"MOV AX, var\" but they are actually different instructions! [2]\n\nYou can prove LEA and MOV are different by looking at their binary representation (for example if you use a disassembler, or check into your assembler's command-line syntax to discover how to make a listing file).  The bytes for each instruction are:\n\n    8D063412                   LEA AX,[0x1234]\n    B83412                     MOV AX,0x1234\n\nMy personal opinion is that your assembler sucks.  If you're doing this for a class, you probably have to live with the professor's choice of tooling.  For your own projects, I recommend looking into NASM.  (I hear the cool people are using [yasm](https://github.com/yasm/yasm) these days, but I've never used it so I have no personal opinion on it.)\n\nOut of curiosity, what assembler are you using?\n\n[1] By \"semantically equivalent\" I mean they have the same effects on the registers and flags.\n\n[2] The reason LEA exists is to let programmers use indexed addressing modes for calculations instead of memory access.  `LEA AX,[0x1234]` and `LEA AX,[BX]` are functionally equivalent to MOV instructions, but `LEA AX,[BX+DI+0x1234]` does a calculation that can't be accomplished with any other single instruction.\n\nExperimenting with LEA can be maddening if you don't understand it.  That's because 16-bit LEA will only let you use certain register combinations, you can only combine one of {BX, BP} with one of {SI, DI}.  (This was a hardware decision of the chip designers, and applies to all address arguments.)  With 32-bit assembly in the [386](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386), they added a whole extra byte to the encoding of indexed addressing modes (SIB, scale-index-base).  So in 32-bit 386 assembly you can use any registers, and they even added the ability to multiply one of the registers by a constant factor of 2, 4, or 8.  So the 32-bit instruction `LEA EAX,[ECX+4*EDX+0x1234]` is legal, but its 16-bit equivalent `LEA AX,[CX+4*DX+0x1234]` is not.",

When I was exploring different ways to learn coding from scratch, I stumbled across Hyperskill (https://hyperskill.org). It's powered by JetBrains, which is neat because they make professional dev tools. What I found really helpful there was how they structure the learning around building actual projects step-by-step. It felt more practical than just theory and really helped connect the dots. Might be worth checking out as another resource to see how they approach learning paths for beginners.

Do this a few times (as new employees join) and the docs will get better with each pass.\n\nOf course, the code itself may have comments, but docs also encompass much more than that -- e.g. how do you set up the dev environment? How do deployments work? How do you use source control? Is there a glossary of terms that are used by the codebase? Are there links to auxiliary tools like a bug tracker, wiki, etc?\n\nYou can also look at popular open source projects to see what kind of docs other projects write, although some projects have bad documentation (but maybe they can still serve as examples of what not to do).",

Opinions vary on whether or not using \"interfaces\" is a good way to go, both sides have good arguments IMO.\n\nStepping back, *why* do you need runtime polymorphism? Is there a design that doesn't require it? In this case, you can probably get away with instantiating each importer you want, and selecting a concrete implementation to be used based on file type, something like this:\n\n```\n// No virtual\nclass AssimpImporter { void importByFile(); };\nclass StbImporter { void importByFile(); };\n\n// Top-level \"importer\" facade\nclass Importer {\n  public:\n    void importByFile() {\n      if (assimp_importer_.supports(file_type)) assimp_importer_.importByFile();\n      else if (stb_importer_.supports(file_type)) stb_importer_.importByFile();\n      // ...\n    }\n  \n  private:\n    AssimpImporter assimp_importer_;\n    StbImporter stb_importer_;\n};\n```\n\nIf you need some compile-time polymorphism, C++ concepts are a sort of weird duck-type-y tool you can use too:\n\n```\ntemplate<typename T>\nconcept MeshImporter = requires(T a)\n{\n    { a.importByFile() } -> std::same_as<void>;\n};\n\nclass AssimpImporter {\n  public:\n    void importByFile() {}\n};\nstatic_assert(MeshImporter<AssimpImporter>);\n\ntemplate<MeshImporter T>\nvoid doFancyMeshImportThings(T* importer, File file) {\n  importer.importByFile();\n}\n```",

I don't think you can say that you really know any language until you can at least solve most problems in that language without needing to switch to something else.\n\nPick a language and challenge yourself to do an interesting project and solve whatever problems you run into *in that language.* That's how you're really going to learn the language.",

This will confuse the statemachine.\n\nAlso, the customer isn't in \"a state\" of being a LOW or MEDIUM buyer, a state would be used for something that goes through a short process, like placing an order. An order can be PLACED, it can be VERIFIED, it can be SENT, it can be PAYED, it can be CLOSED, and the like.\n\nThe calculation of being a LOW, MEDIUM or HEAVY buyer, shouldn't be in the database, as it depends on other values in the database as well as the current date, so it should be re-calculated by the business logic whenever needed!",

A lot of us have been stuck in that phase — jumping from one tutorial to another, thinking we're making progress, but actually just going in circles.\n\nWhat really helped me break out of that \"tutorial hell\" was setting a clear, simple goal: build a project from start to finish. It doesn’t have to be big or original.the point is to create something on your own. It could be a clone of an existing app, a small personal tool, or even a project inspired by a tutorial, but coded entirely by you.\n\nThe key is active practice. You’ll run into real problems, you’ll have to debug, research, and figure things out. and that’s where true learning happens.\n\nSo pick a project, set a realistic deadline, and try to complete it. You’ll learn way more than you ever could just watching hours of tutorials.",

This can often stem from feeling overwhelmed with too many commitments and feeling like you're struggling to keep up.  It can creep up on performance driven people who push through hard circumstances not fully realizing the toll taken on their own mind and body at the time, until it chips away at them and they just can't handle the stress anymore and break down, usually in spectacular fashion.  Speaking from my own experience.\n\nStart with introspection, and learning to have more respect and care for your own self.  If your mind and body are not functioning optimally because you have been neglecting or overly stressing them in ways, you are consequently reducing your performance in all other areas over time.  So think about taking better care of yourself as an investment towards doing everything else you are trying to accomplish to the best of your abilities.\n\nNext, learn when you need to slow down.  Recognize when your mental state is \"redlining\" and figure out where you need to back off to restore your sanity.  For me, this meant recognizing my work environment was unhealthy and finding a new job.  For you, this doesn't have to mean dropping out of school, but maybe it means you drop a class or two right now if they are causing you undue stress, and you end up graduating a semester later.  There's no shame in that.",

Then she did some research and found out all those other writers went through the same process of having to do dozens of drafts as they expanded and refined their stories.  \n\nAnyway, the point is that you shouldn't judge your programming or your prototype based on all the stuff that's out there, or even what's in your head-- instead, just accept that you're now one module, function or subroutine closer to your end goal,  Each week, you will add a bit more to the coding of your program, and you'll add a bit more to your prototype.  Maybe the end goal is 10 weeks away instead of next week, but that doesn't matter.  You've taken a great first step, and if you simply persist, you will eventually succeed.  \n\nI know because my friend, she became a published writer and I have her book on my bookshelf.

Even though the tool absolutely was tracking stats at the individual-level, they just said they weren't gonna use it.\n\nEveryone knew they were gonna use it. We're not stupid.\n\nThat company used to have an amazing WLB, and then there were a couple C-suite changes and a bunch of upper management changes and not long after those changes this tool was introduced, and the culture went to shit.\n\nI found another job by mid-2024.\n\nIt's nothing inherently wrong with my previous company, or with Microsoft. It's just a culture shift. They went from chill, to micromanagey-PIP-culture. Different strokes, I'm not gonna demand they keep a culture that I like.\n\nI always say culture shifts are the *only* inevitable thing in this industry. It's why I recommend if you're at a good employer, you hold onto that employer for as long as they stay good. They *will* change at some point, so cash in while you can. Then when they change, you jump ship, and your salary gets re-adjusted to market rate.\n\nI found another company with a great culture/WLB in 2024, and it's still great now. I'm praying it stays good for the long-run. If the culture/WLB stays like it is now I will happily stay here the rest of my career. I'm just not naive enough to think that's very likely.\n\nAll that's to say.... I'm just not surprised.",

Step two was to disable `@channel` and `@here` notifications in channels where people like to abuse that. Even a channel that you need to pay attention to, you can often treat it more like email and check in every hour or two instead of getting instant notifications.\n\n> ...unexpected urgent meetings...\n\nIf it's an actual production emergency, sure. Short of that, most of this urgency is false. Having to constantly push back is exhausting, but you can, for example, start scheduling blocks of no-meeting time, and start actively declining surprise meetings, until people get the message.\n\n> ...late-night pings...\n\nGo into Slack and set a notification schedule. If your employer has a separate work phone, give it a Do Not Disturb schedule. If it's your personal phone, you may still have options -- I know on Android, I've had work apps be confined to a \"Work Profile\" where you can push one button to *turn off* all work apps, such that you need a password to turn them back on.\n\nIf you're oncall, the *only* exception is PagerDuty (or whatever paging app you're using). If it's not enough of an emergency to page you, it can wait. Encourage people to page you if they really need you -- if you need to highlight this as a problem, it'll help to have stats on how much you got paged for non-emergencies.\n\nAgain, YMMV, but FAANG and FAANG-adjacent shops ultimately care about how you show up when you are working, and how much you actually get done, not how many late-night pings you responded to.\n\nThat said, I see the appeal of working in a place where the norms *already* value WLB, instead of a place where you have to define and defend it for yourself.",

The issue is that the boost in \"productivity\" has come from scrum masters mandating that every dev split their Stories into a PR for every Task so that their performance telemetry indicates a 10x increase in productivity to upper management that coincided with adopting AI. That in turn scores the middle managers a bonus for meeting performance goals, but it never took more than 6 weeks before the additional PRs were coming primarily from trying to **fix the problems in the AI generated code**.\n\nThat was only an issue because the senior devs were terrible at PR reviews and refused to admit it, opting to instead just blanket approve everything after a token pause for \"consideration\" while they listlessly browsed the internet. They made me a PR reviewer, but because I was rejecting code that failed unit tests, well- Didn't last long. The way it was going when I saw the door was they were keeping the \"1 PR per task\" scheme, but swapping off of using AI while the lower management were stealthily canceling the new hires' PRs and re-PRing the new guys' work as their own and approving their PRs themselves to make themselves look productive while they were doggedly trying to find *some way* to get functional whole project code out of chatGPT. The poor bastard who figured out they were doing it was fired summarily for bringing it up.\n\nI don't know if anyone has had a positive experience with AI development integration, but if I had to guess, it'd be with the tools that are making library suggestions/ autocompleting your lines to improve your typing speed and decrease your dependency on cross referencing syntax for multi-language code bases. (I.e. having the AI help the back end Python guy work with the Javascript/HTML that the front end guys made and vice versa). Once the model is generating blocks of code they tend to fall apart quickly. Its best to use them for writing singular lines and having the developer piece them together intelligently.",

Some people will not be able to find work in this field and will transition out. Most will find work and the people at the top won't experience it at all.\n\nThere are a number of factors that make the the next few years look especially bleak. After three decades of demand exceeding supply in tech, the market is caught with a sudden drop in demand at the absolute peak capacity of producing new engineering talent both domestically and globally. This is worse than fields where supply has generally matched demand and production pipelines weren't greatly increasing.\n\nBig tech recently ended their decades long practice of hiring talent to keep it off the market and instead is firing employees (across all functions, not just tech) to boost profits. Downstream, companies are copying this. The trend is to run lean on engineering. Even the most well funded startups are no longer focusing much on users or other growth metrics and are instead looking at ARR/headcount. Today, capital isn't looking for growth without outsized margins. This further reduces forward looking demand.\n\nIts unclear how AI, tariffs and economic instability will affect most jobs in 5 years, not just tech. As a consequence companies are dramatically scaling back capital expenditures and focusing on operations. That's further softening the job market overall. This hits tech harder than other roles because tech jobs lean heavy towards capex.\n\nPeople with 5-10 years of experience are mostly fine. It's just taking a lot more time and effort to find roles. It's an absolutely awful time to be in or just out of college, no matter the career path.\n\nThe days of tech being the easiest path to a high salary and stable career might be over but it's hard to know for sure.\n\nEvery college kid needs to be told that they will enter the workforce in a period of change, uncertainty and instability most people have not experienced and can't even conceive of unless they are from countries like Venezuela, Argentina, Russia (that turned out bad), Brazil South Africa (that turned out mixed), South Korea or China (that turned out mostly good).\n\nIf you want to steer your kid to a career with stability, tell them to be a doctor. The supply of medical schools is artificially constrained. The work requires a license by law. It's a field where coming changes like AI will augment but doesn't look capable of softening demand.",

Say something like \"Hey, our company really sucks, you're getting 2%, wish I could've gotten you more but that's not a thing here\"?\n\nProbably not a statement that's gonna fly at any large organization.\n\nSo he does what he can. You're a good performer, he was told good performers get 2%, so he thanked you for your hard work and gave you the exact amount his overlords said he could give you.\n\nDon't blame your EM. Blame the corporation. Your EM is just playing the cards they've been dealt.",

If I need to catch up with work after bedtime, I am not a dead log yet because I had no exhausting commute - and I am able to power through another 1-2 hours, if necessary.\n\nI am indeed more productive from home - and I do feel like I actually work longer - but at the same time, I am less exhausted and less resentful. Feels like a win-win for employee and employer, so I have no idea why other companies are forcing RTO.",

Idgaf about recycling, and the CEO asked me directly, \"so tell me how recycling and climate are important to you\". I basically told him I'm interested in doing great engineering work. Jokes on him, now I make 3x the salary they were offering me!\n\nThese small companies tend to go way too far with hiring on \"alignment\", and think they aren't employers, but facilitating employees to fufil a higher level calling to service that is exactly the same as their. It's such BS. Trust me, you dodged a huge bullet: these guys have no idea what they are doing, and nothing is worse than working with a bunch of incompetents whose biggest credential is \"they care\". It sounds like you care about software, care about leading, and care about building things. If that's not enough, fuck 'em!",

I would always compare other people's lows to my highs and was always surprised at the end result. That being, they ended up much further than I did at the end no matter how well they did GPA/knowledgeable they were about coding etc.\n\nIn hindsight, my mentality contributed to two major detriments in my first job search:\n\n1 -- I unknowingly built a moat around myself and classmates who could've been a resource, ended up becoming competition or inaccessible instead. In your story, it sounds like you have plenty of classmates who got into F500 or FAANG, yet it sounds like you never reached out for help or built enough connections to avoid applying 400/600 times per cycle. Assuming you carry the same mindset of reducing a company to traits like “in the middle of nowhere,\" you might fall into the same trap of I did in evaluating everyone in a new environment as beneath you and not building the correct connections, or at least practicing, to get to where you want to go.\n\nOne of my early jobs was in a small private company that I've never heard anyone mention in this sub in a random state in the South. From my time there, I knew a few data scientists and engineers who ended up going to great companies 2-3 years after their tenure to places such as LinkedIn, Meta, Paramount, etc. Had I went in with the same energy as I did in college, I would've never made friends and been able to reach out to them for help when it came to career advice or referrals. Instead of coming in with the expectation of getting something out of every interaction, I just became the person people want to work with -- be there for when they need help or talk about the project or life in general. All the \"small talk\" that you think is a waste of time makes you personable and they'll remember you when time comes.\n\n2 -- That mentality carries over into how you present yourself as a person and affects you in ways you probably didn't notice before. For me, it caused mismatched expectations and actually set me back from learning to my fullest potential. I always told myself that I should've gotten a better offer or shouldn't have struggled for as long as I did due to my capabilities; my worldview was shattered over and over again, once someone I deemed \"dumber\" got a more coveted position or had breezed through their job search. And this mentality doesn't really stop, there's always someone luckier or someone better than you in some way, that got an opportunity that you wanted and it looms in the back of your mind on every task that you do. I don't have much advice here aside from realization; getting hit with reality and coming to terms with having weaknesses in certain areas or unlucky in others actually helped me become open to learning a ton and that honest acceptance of my capabilities and circumstance got me more opportunities and help from others than I had gotten previously.\n\nInadvertently this also helped in interviews and building connections, at least at the entry level as no interviewer or coworker wants to work with a new grad/mid-level with a pompous or fake persona even if they do mostly know their stuff. At the end of the day, we all want is someone human to work with and one of the most human traits you can exhibit in an interview is that you make mistakes, can learn and are competent/graceful enough to pivot with a team to come to a solution.",

The work is mentally taxing and not for everyone.\n\nObviously not all of them, I have worked with many new grads that were amazing.

What might be a 1 liner to you, could be days of digging through code, running the app locally, and building up the context around the issue before I can finally land on that one line.\n\nIf I'm just handed answers, I'll never be able to develop those skills or that context myself, so I'll never get to your level.\n\nGenerally the way mentorship goes is you should treat it as pair programming, and *guide* them towards the solution. As opposed to giving them answers, or even lecturing / dumping similar solutions on them.\n\nIf the change is as easy as you say, it should be super easy to sit with this dev for an hour and arrive at the solution together. Let them flounder a little and explain their thought process to you, if they get stuck, ask leading questions that nudges them in the right direction.

You just want to be their safety net that helps them reach that point.\n\nA simple \"Hey, how's X going?

When working remote you tend to be a bit more siloed so you need to be much more deliberate with your teamwork and collaboration efforts. If your expectation is to just pass tickets off and forget about it you aren't going to have a very effective team. \n\nMy suggestion would be to set up a 30 minuet working session and go over the fix, but also why the fix works.",

This is a biggie, because it's not uncommon for Amazon to hire people in one location and then tell them to move in 60-90 days or lose their job.\n* What's the ops load like?\n* What is the make-up of their team? How many L4's has your manager promoted? Are there opportunities for growth up to L6?\n* Where is your office? Is it Seattle or Bellevue? What's the rent situation like, and is Seattle somewhere you want to live for years? Transfers are tricky at Amazon since 2022, so you'd be waiting a while for L5 before you can transfer - and even then you'll be up against hundreds of others.\n* Do you want to join in what is essentially a new grad role, or would you prefer to wait and join as a new L5 in a few years? Amazon has started downlevelling people lately, and it really fucks with URA as you have some L4's with years of experience making newer engineers look bad (and eventually up for the chop). The \"hire to fire\" culture is also still there in some teams.\n\nMost importantly, if you choose to join Amazon you should have a contingency plan in place in case you end up in Focus/Pivot. Speak to your current boss and see what their boomerang policy is. If you can bounce back in a year, great! If two, even better! There's little to lose.\n\nAt face value, I would say that joining as an \"experienced\" L4 isn't a great idea, unless you're going to drastically improve your income by joining Amazon. Even then, layoffs are still occurring, and PIP is always looming, so you might not even see that salary. If despite all the warnings you're still sold, absolutely go for it. It *can* be a good place to work if you're really lucky, and you find a team that's both good, does interesting work, and has a manager that's invested in your growth - while also great at fighting your corner to help you stay above the dreaded URA curve.",

        "body": "Do you know what team? This matters a lot. I'm assuming, since you're being hired at SDE I with < 1 YOE, that you'll get assigned to a random team like all New Grads do. Technically, you still qualify as a \"New Grad\".\n\nWhether this is the case or not, hear me out, you should take the Amazon offer, but keep your F500 job for the first month while you figure out if Amazon is the right place for you.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. It is actually difficult to switch teams at Amazon. You will have to do a full loop and they may ask you for meaningful code reviews that you've authored. If you haven't been on the team for long OR if it's too ops heavy OR if there's just not enough scope, then HMs may not be interested in you.\n2. You might be a hire to fire. If you're put on focus, then you can't switch teams.\n3. Your manager/team/org might suck. If your manager isn't keen on your growth, then you won't get the scope to grow to the next level. You may also face issues if your team isn't balanced levels wise (e.g., no L6s or 0-2 L5s -> overworked L4s). EnderMB's comment is golden, esp \"What is the make-up of their team? How many L4's has your manager promoted? Are there opportunities for growth up to L6?\"\n4. You might hate the work your team is doing (esp if you're randomly placed). You could be a frontend wiz, but get placed on a team working on compilers. Or your team might be a KTLO team where all you're doing is ops and bug fixes (zero feature work).\n\nTake PTO or a leave of absence from your F500 job, scope out Amazon, and then make your decision. Best Case: you're a great fit for your role at Amazon and you're happy. Worst Case: you have to leave Amazon and go back to your fully remote job.\n\nFWIW: I worked at Amazon as a new grad SDE I and fell into a team of no L6s, only 1 L5, and rest L4s. I had to put in over \\~70 hrs per week to keep up with expectations. I burned out in 1 year and quit without having anything lined up. Luckily, the market was fire back then so I was able to take a few months off and get a job elsewhere.\n\nAmazon on your resume will open a lot of doors, but tread carefully.",

There's more and more university graduates majoring in CS, on top of all those who did bootcamps or are entering the field with other degrees/backgrounds.\n\nAt the same time, it's a field prone to periodic off-shoring/outsourcing attempts. The remote work trend only accelerated the current drive of some companies to replace domestic devs/engineers with foreign ones.\n\nUnderstandably, there is a lot of doom and gloom surrounding CS. Some of it warranted. Gone are the times where you apply to 5 companies and get 3 offers. Not that it was ever the rule. But it's certainly more difficult to land *attractive* offers straight from uni.\n\nOn the flip side, computers are the backbone of practically any modern endeavor. Every year there are more and more CS/IT jobs and the demand steadily rises.\n\nI'd recommend doing some research about the field, what kind of jobs are in demand, what kind of jobs attract thousands of applicants vs just a handful, what kind of technologies/languages/CS-adjacent aspects you find interesting.\n\nThere's also value in subject-matter expertise in combination with CS. And each domain & industry has their own preferred technologies. So keep your eyes open and if so inclined, don't be afraid to look for projects at the intersection of CS and other fields, or focusing on niche domains.",

We came out of a huge hiring spree in 2021-22 and when things normalized it forced the market to produce mass layoffs and slowly reduce hiring. \n\nIn CS there are a few types of people. There are the ones who love it with a passion, will spend 50-60 hours working each week and creating new tasks for themselves. These are the overachievers who likely will end up working st faang or will dominate their mid-level company because they are the one employee everybody goes to. \n\nThere are the types who like it but dont want to spend more than 40 hours unless it’s crunch time to finish their stuff. They do what their asked and sometimes they will look for things to do to show some motivation. They will do what the role entails. \n\nThen there are the types who also kind of like it but it’s clear it’s mostly for the money. They wont overacheive but theyll try to not underperform. They wont be front and center. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with being either of the 3. But id say the 3rd person should never be in a job thats too demanding because this person wont have the motivation to do it. \n\nNow what i tell people about to start college is that if it’s bad now, the likely hood of it still being this bad in 4 years is low. I dont know how it will look like but is put my money on in that 4 yesrs hiring eill be back, the market will have regulsted and this wont be a big issue in that time. I could be wishful thinking but usually when this has hapoened it tskes a few yesrs to bounce back. I dont think we will be in pre- covid days but we will be on our way back there.",

Consider the fact that, on Stalin’s birthday, prisoners would send him congratulatory telegrams from the darkest gulags: it isn’t possible to imagine a Jew in Auschwitz sending Hitler such a telegram. \n\n> It is a tasteless distinction, but it supports the contention that under Stalin, the ruling ideology presupposed a space in which the leader and his subjects could meet as servants of Historical Reason. Under Stalin, all people were, theoretically, equal.\n\n...\n\n> But why a master at all? The other way to deal with the decline of traditional authority is the anarchist way, and anarchism is having a revival today, from Noam Chomsky to David Graeber. Anarchism \r\nis not against public power—Catherine Malabou, another neo-anarchist, refers to Jacques Rancière, who asserts “radical equality between citizens who are considered able to both command and \r\nobey.” (Catherine Malabou’s words in: Malabou and Balibar 2022, p. 179) There is an essential relationship between the lot and democratic expression: there is public power, but “true democracy would rely on the contingency of who governs and who is governed because governing does not require any particular skill.” (Ibid.)\n\n...\n\n> Consequently, a paradox I argue for is that false opposition is to be left behind: we do not overcome alienation by disalienation, we do not overcome the master by eliminating it, and we do not overcome public power by limiting it to useful public services.\\\nThe non-alienated autonomous liberal individual is itself a product of alienation in capitalist society; a master effectively serving the people, taking care of them, is a fetish created to prevent the possibility that individuals will themselves take care of themselves; the idea of power serving society justifies power and thus obfuscates its constitutive excess.",

Have a straightforward explanation ready for interviews: \"I joined eager to contribute, but the expectation of 70+ hour weeks without compensation adjustment isn't sustainable long-term.\" Most reasonable hiring managers will understand.\n\n3. Target companies known for better work-life balance. Look at Glassdoor reviews and ask direct questions about typical hours during interviews.\n\nThe market is tough but not impossible.

For software, that's often means hearing some news or getting more information (observe), putting that in context of the team and the rest of the metrics (orient), deciding and building an action plan to address the issue in the context of what we are currently working on (Decide), and brining it to the team (act).  \n  \nI like the eisenhower/OODA stuff becuase it's both a framework for planning/doing, and a way to respond when those assumptions and priorities which determine the plan change.",

WLB became my #1 priority in my career. That, and I started forming a very thick barrier between work and my personal life. Work stress stayed at work. After 5pm, I stopped letting my brain think about anything career/work-related. Aftetr 5pm is me time.\n\nAnd you know what happened at work after I started sticking to a strictly 40 hours or less schedule? After I stopped letting deadlines, prod issues, etc follow me into my personal life?\n\nAbsolutely nothing. I kept getting great performance reviews, and kept getting good raises.\n\nThat was a very formative moment for me. It happened probably around 6-12 months into my career. And that lesson has been a vital point of the rest of my life. It's *why* WLB is my #1 priority. Seeing how a very simple change in behavior can take me from awful headaches and an inability to sleep, to feeling great outside of work, was a wake up call.\n\nSo I got there eventually, but 6-12 months of my life could've been a lot better if someone had just told me that lesson versus having to learn it myself.

One is that you have better WLB as you can't really work at home with a laptop since most of your work has to be done on a clearance computer, so after your 8 hours you just check out which you can't really do at big tech because your laptop is basically expected to be always with you. The second is your job can't be outsourced and you won't be H1B'd either.\n\nThe disadvantage is that your pay reflects that. Another disadvantage, although this is team based, is that the work we were doing also reflected that - we were using JavaFX in 2022. Like what. \n\nIMO, if you have on call or if your WLB is ever compromised in defense, flat out no, definitely not worth it. If you don't, it depends on what you prioritize - do you prefer better job security, but lower pay, or do you prefer less job security, higher pay? \n\nI will say that defense as a stepping stone is very good. Getting a clearance is super helpful because it's possible to leverage that into a high tech job which requires a clearance, so you have the higher pay and higher job security.",

I do a lot of Appsec and/or cloud security automations and rely heavily on AI to do a lot of the grunt work. I'm spending less time now having to double check work with higher context windows + default OCR capability to analyze diagrams. I can get through a 3500 file three tier web app, build a CI/CD pipeline and use agentic AI to conduct thousands of checks and parse SAST results and do it in hours instead of weeks. Especially in Risk management/compliance (think HIPAA, NIST, etc.) which leans heavy towards documentation and spreadsheets which an agentic workflow rips through. If I had to do it all over again I would have aimed towards Full Stack development. But a pentesting skillset + builder + compliance mix has paid dividends for me. What interests you the most?

It would be nice for them to recognize that you're performing at the next level and automatically give you a promotion. But at a larger company, there's usually red tape and committees that they'll need to make a case to; if you seem happy at your current level and there's no growth expectation on your team they're happy to not have to put any further work in. This is different from consulting and finance, for example, where you have no input into your own promotion and it's assumed that everyone wants a promotion. \n\nIf there is a growth expectation to the next level,  your performance reviews will start getting dinged if you haven't been promoted in a certain amount of time (even if you're otherwise performing at the next level). Which makes it even more urgent you get a timeline for when it's feasible to be promoted.\n\nIf you get an \"I don't know when you'll be promoted\" without actionable steps or \"just keep doing what you're doing\" without a timeline that's a sign to leave.",

Frontend interviews (not that I've attended many of them) also seem to focus mostly on whether you understand `#selector` or what a particular React or JS construct does, and very little on how to communicate with the backend team on APIs you need.\n\n\nI guess my point is, if you're pure frontend, you're both viewing the world (and being viewed in) a similar light. If you can do some backend, at least, you're much better positioned to talk about how the data gets to the FE. That seems to be called a \"Full stack with FE lean\" in job descriptions these days.\n\n\nThat it pays more IMO reflects this aspect of the full stack role. It's worth being able to work on the backend at least a bit, so my recommendation would to be to get into the FS role. (I won't necessarily call it a \"switch\" because a lot of full stack roles do end up being primarily BE or FE)",

IOW, maybe the people do have interest in the subject, but what they really want is to show they have a degree. Really for working professionals like yourself. \n\nDue to it being asynchronous, it’s simply not going to have the same rigor as an on campus program. Example: exam is proctored online and must be done within 24 hours. Why not have teams of students where one goes first and feeds the questions to everyone else? This is obviously not a concern in a synchronous exam. I know for my online masters program, there’s a huge de-emphasis on testing, and I suspect it’s because it’s impossible to police. Instead, it’s a lot of research papers and deep dives, which can obviously be useful, but can also be a constant exercise in simply going back through course material to find the relevant topic and answering. Thus far, I’m about to finish course 6 and 7 of 13 (prerequisites included) and I’m tracking to be sitting at a 3.9 minimum, and I’ve been slack on readings. \n\nBalance, it can be hard. You should probably expect to spend at least 9 hours per class per week. Obviously you can try to coast and do the bare minimum, but then why would you pay for that?\n\nI’d look towards certifications after the masters degree. That’s a logical step to take as you get more senior, and need more differentiation to land those prestigious jobs.",

They're the responsibility of management.\n\nWe're IC's, we're responsible for doing the best work we can during our 40 hour work week. It doesn't matter if we get assigned 20 peoples-worth of responsibility. All that means is we will work to prioritize, and accurately communicate progress and ***timelines*** (independent of \"deadlines\") spread across 1 persons-worth of work weeks. That's how the exchange of labor works. Don't scale your hours.\n\nManagement has tools in their toolbelt to account for at-risk deadlines. It's literally project management 101, shit interns learn, shit that's like on page 1 of any sort of guide to PM. They can dial back scope, they can hire more resources, or they can push back the deadline.\n\nForcing their resources to work more than 40 hours isn't a (healthy) option. But if the SWE's *let them*, they'd be crazy to not take advantage of it. So don't let them. Work your 40 hours. Communicate everything based on those 40 hours. \"We need it done by X\" doesn't matter, because based on your 40 hour work week your job is to communicate the *realistic* estimate. \"Ok... well if I drop A, B, C, D, E, and F, I can get G done by X\", or \"If we take an MVP approach and get rid of H, I, J,  and K requirements we can get the MVP done by X\".\n\nEverything you're describing is a failure of management, not of you. Deadlines, staffing, prioritization, scope, etc. It's all in *their* job description. Will your management like you establishing and sticking to your professional boundaries?\n\nProbably not. But you know what their options are? Fire you, and set their timeline back by *bare minimum* another 6-12 months across the board (probably more). Does that sound like a smart option? Call their bluff.\n\nPut in your 40, be realistic, be communicative, don't fall victim to \"deadlines\", and if your management ignores your very reasonable professional boundaries, start looking for another job.

Going from the former to the latter is much easier in my experience than the reverse. You at least have a standard base to go off of when implementing proprietary solutions. With the reverse youll find yourself fighting with the standard, trying to translate the proprietary logic properly.\n\n> Am I the only one to be unhappy with Protobuf and do I get something wrong about it?\n\nThere is a github issue complaining about the lack of inheritance in protobuf so you're definitely not the only one unhappy in this regard. The suggestion there was to use composition over inheritance but I don't think that will solve your code size issue.\n\n --\n\nOverall I think what's happening here is a case of premature optimization. You're worrying about code size and performance too soon without seeing the performance impact here. It's normal for performance for applications to be tested. You shouldn't waste time reinventing the wheel when it's unnecessary.\n\n There's a couple factors you should consider. How much time will it take to implement, onboard, and document your protocol? What if you need to change tech stacks? How much does the code size affect your performance? What is the ACTUAL performance? Take into account what I said before. It's easier to go from off the shelf to proprietary than the reverse. Start with off-the-shelf, evaluate the performance, and THEN shift.",

The \"So you just wrote some Java?\" comment seems like classic insecurity from the interviewer.\n\nDon't remove it from your resume though - that would create weird gaps and honestly most places still see it as valuable. Maybe try addressing these concerns proactively in your cover letters or early interviews by emphasizing why you're specifically interested in their company size/culture.

I was in engineering prep classes and met some engineers from a local company, who pointed me at a high school internship program. I was able to translate that into a scholarship and return internship offer.\n\nA standard career path starts with getting internships in college. At those internships, you do a reasonable enough job at your actual job to maybe get a return offer, but you prioritize meeting people and establishing a reputation as someone useful.\n\nDepending on the school you go to, there may be useful connections to be had through advisers or professors.\n\nParticipating in open source projects or engaging in programming events is also a good source of connections.",

I plan on saving money currently and looking around the job market when I hit the 2 year mark but another thing you could do is keep applying and keeping you channels open if you hear or see anything on LinkedIn that appeals to you.

There’s really no telling what’s going to happen in the next 3 years and as contractors, we can just be let go without severance. \n\nIt’s a really tough choice to make, but if you feel like your position isn’t safe, pursue other opportunities. I don’t know if you’re feeling this like I am, but after this last wave of DRP/VERA, morale is at an all time low at my agency. We lost quite a few people and those of us that are left are picking up their workload.",

At this stage you should be pretty solid technically, so you should be able to speak to complex subjects.\n\nEach company will look for different things too.

Data in PE can be useful, sure, but they already know how to use excel, there isn't \"big\" data to crunch in PE, the team is small... and whatever full stack stuff you're working on is likely to be internal tools. Schwab might be similar, but more people will be using the tools, you'll get more mentorship, you won't deal with the sometimes capricious bullshit that comes with working for a small company (especially run by finance guys), and if you don't like your job at Schwab, well, at least you'll have the rest of your life to fall back on.",

Where 20 minutes is not enough (it usually is), I and other managers have skipped scheduled meetings to ensure viable candidates have 100% of their questions answered. You can ask about comp -- I and our HRBPs/recruiters will happily tell you the min/target/max for the req once interviews are happening. We're not going to send you a full spreadsheet of every comp band for every role/level, but can talk about the specific req you've applied for. If the candidate shared their compensation requirements on the application, they're talking to us right now because their comp requirements align with the min/target/max for the req.\n\nSharing comp requirements are optional, but if I have 100 viable applicants, and 50 of them stated their compensation requirements in the application, and we can afford 25 of them based on their stated comp requirements, those are the 25 resumes hitting my desk as the hiring manager. For budgeting purposes I and my CFO need to know if we're buying a Toyota Corolla or a Porsche 911. Again, managers are busy people and can't spend infinite time on hiring. It's ~4 lost hours, plus the opportunity cost of \"things the manager isn't doing\", if the candidate needs $100k/yr and we've only budgeted up to $80k/yr.",

Here’s how it works:  \n  \nInvite top candidates (after an initial screen, which includes a reference check) to a paid half-day session—remote or onsite—where you both get to evaluate fit by working together on a realistic, bounded, non-critical task. Example: \"Here’s a simplified version of a real challenge we’ve faced. Let’s pair for a bit, and then you take the lead while we stay available for questions.\"  \n  \nSet a 2–4 hour timebox. Pay candidates for their time. Respect their calendar.\n\nProvide transparent, upfront documentation with role expectations, compensation and equity ranges, work style, tech stack, and team values. Make it clear who they will work with, how decisions are made, and what the first 90 days might look like. I recognize this isn't easy in a startup, but do the best you can.\n\n  \nFollow this with a candid debrief discussion, not a quiz:  \n  \n\\- What did they enjoy?  \n  \n\\- What would they do differently?  \n  \n\\- What questions do they have about the problem, the product, or the team?\n\n  \nSet and honor a clear timeline with a known decision date. Don’t ghost.\n\n  \n  \nWhy this works:  \n\\- Filters for initiative, pragmatism, and curiosity—you see how they think and how they collaborate.  \n  \n\\- Respects candidate time—you’re not asking for free labor or arbitrary leetcode.  \n  \n\\- Signals honesty and care—you’re willing to invest in them before they work for you.  \n  \n\\- Mutual fit—they’re evaluating you, too, and this gives them real data.\n\n  \n  \nIf you want to find software engineers who’ll solve real problems with you, this builds trust from day one.",

        "body": "Hey I can somewhat answer this as I went from a STEM bachelors 12 years ago to doing the WGU BSCS program and now I’m currently in the OMSCS program at Georgia tech.\n\nThere ARE people who do the gtech program without a CS background but it’s painful for them. Gtech lets you in but then it’s sink or swim as you get thrown into the rough seas. You get to decide if you e got the stomach for it. There is A LOT of coding and it happens very quickly and there’s little to no support if you don’t already know how to code proficiently. It’s sort of expected that you either already know how to code or that you’ll pick it up on your own.\n\nWGU on the other hand will teach you from the beginning and if it’s too easy for you at first, then the magic of the WGU program that makes it unique is that you can accelerate through the program right up to the point where it gets hard for you. That’s why for some people who are already experienced software engineers, they can blaze through that program in 6 months if they were self taught years ago. On the other hand, people might take 3+ years to finish it similar to a typical bachelors because the WGU program, despite the elitism from a lot of people, is still a legit program that requires you to know your stuff.\n\nYou seem like a decently smart person having done aerospace engineering, so maybe you’ll connect with my experience. My first bachelors (biology at UCI, moderately prestigious for premed) was tough but I finished with a 3.2 gpa. WGU was a cakewalk for me BUT I did learn a ton and finished in a little over two years. I learned how to code Hello World approximately 3 months before I started at WGU and feel proficient by the end of the program (can code decently sized programs from scratch in three different languages with minimal assistance). WGU tells students to expect 15-20 hours of work per week but realistically I was only doing 5-10 and still accelerating at a fast pace. The first half of the program I blazed through since I’m good at math and still remembered a lot of calculus. Discrete math was very intuitive for me.\n\nNow at OMSCS, when course reviews say that a class takes 20 hours per week… it actually takes 20 hours per week for people who have a strong CS background. People without that background are reporting 25-30 hours per week in order to learn all the stuff on the side that they need to learn.\n\nThe average time per week per course is 15 hours per week and it’s a very accurate estimate for most people. Few people put in less time than that. Without a CS background, you should expect to spend an extra 25%-50% of your time learning all the things you need to code all the projects.\n\nUltimately it’s how you want to break up the time. Doing WGU first means you won’t get to the really cool stuff like ML for another two-ish years and will also spend some time doing typical bachelors stuff that you don’t want to do, but the ramp up in difficulty will be much smoother and you can just passively do this on the side without too much disruption to your life.\n\nOr you can jump feet first into OMSCS, get to the end goal faster, but your life might be hell for the next 3 years straight.",

Professors are generally more accessible at community colleges, too. Good vibes there. \n\nI was admitted for the Fall term for OMSCS and I come from a non CS background(English Education BS / English MA). I was originally working towards a second bachelors (only required to take courses within the major), but I applied to OMSCS, got in, and decided to switch. \n\nIn preparation I took Discrete Math, Discrete Structures, Intro to Programming, Object Oriented Programming in C++, Object Oriented Programming in Java, Computer Organization and Assembly, Computer Architecture, Data Structures and PreCalc/Calc1/Calc2. My experience is likely not the norm and I’ve seen people admitted to the program with fewer classes taken. \n\nI think OMSCS would be a more rigorous program with better name recognition, compared to WGU.\n\nOne note is that if you’re applying for next Spring, classes in-progress aren’t really considered for your acceptance. So if you end up taking these classes in the Fall, with a Spring application deadline of August 15, that could be problematic for a Spring admission. More info on that here: https://omscs.gatech.edu/deadlines-decisions-requirements-and-guidelines and from the link: \n\n> Please note that any academic work completed after the application deadline will not be considered for the purposes of evaluating your application. For example, academic coursework which is in progress and not completed before the application deadline will not be considered; an updated transcript showing coursework completed AFTER the deadline will NOT be considered.",

I would lean on not doing it. \n\nBut I will also say, will your pay change? Because many companies base pay on where you live if you are remote. If you go back to office and the office is in a much lower COL area, they may be inclined to drop your pay too. Id speak with HR or the manager over that as well and if you decide to do it, have in writing that your pay can not go down for returning to office..",
