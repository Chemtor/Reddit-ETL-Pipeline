There are perhaps three, at most five, major players in the data warehouse space. Many vendors have started to just build push-type integrations with each of them; this isn't that difficult to maintain and has numerous advantages over some external service running big extractions on a schedule. They can point to what Fivetran would charge to shift that data and make it a selling point.\n\nWhere does Fivetran fit into this? They don't. They're being cut out.\n\nWorse, they've got much cheaper, open core competitors with cloud offerings whose main disadvantage is that they don't have the long tail of connectors. But this advantage is constantly being eroded, and the long tail is, by definition, less marginally lucrative the further you push into it.\n\nSo what's the play? Seems to me that their plan is to\n\n- take advantage of existing lock-in: jack up prices\n- accept the resulting churn; it'll happen anyway if nothing changes\n- use the windfall to power a set of acquisitions that amount to a land-grab of other, more defensible parts of the data stack\n\nThoughts?",

Managers shouldn't be the best coders, they should be the ones that are best at protecting and supporting their team and create a structure that allows their team members to do their best work.",

At some point, I was also praised by my manager that I have a knack for explaining technical jargon into layman's terms with non-technical stakeholders.\n\nBecause of my background as a data & BI analyst, I consider myself fairly decent in business understanding & communication but in reality, I'm just trying to wing it lol as business isn't really my strong suit. I have to try really hard to make sense of everything business related as my brain is really naturally wired for technical stuff.\n\nWhat made me decide to switch to data engineering is that I just find it more interesting and this is where I see myself growing. As I've mentioned, my brain is also naturally wired for being technical than being business oriented. I also dislike building dashboards and would rather write automation scripts and ETL pipelines. I also find talking + presenting to business stakeholders rewarding but very draining so I prefer just being left alone coding. I guess being a DE is just a perfect alignment of what I'm naturally good at and what I'm interested doing which make it a good fit for me.\n\nI don't know why but I sense that you want to do something else that's not exactly DE related with the way you describe yourself as mediocre and not being able to build pipelines like the others. If you really want to be a DE, by all means work hard for you to get the right skills or maybe you just need to find the right environment that'll support your growth.\n\nThe more important question is that, is that what you really want to do and where you want to grow? No one started as a good DE because the skillset required to be a good one is something that you can learn over the years as long as you have a learning mindset.\n\nThe others already answered what possible paths to take but of course you have to identify first what you want to do. Just ask yourself: What am I interested at? What sparks my curiosity? Where do I see myself growing? What do I like/dislike about this role? What kind of projects/output interests me? What problems do I want to solve? What kind of hardships/challenges would I rather face?\n\nGo out there and explore. You might find the path that's the right fit for you. You define your own career.",

Did you talk to stakeholders? Did you dive into the data? These things are often the hardest to teach. You know what it looks like when customers have the data they need, you know what questions to ask, and some of the subtle ways things can be wrong. This is very valuable.\n\n  \n2) You mentioned trying to keep up with standard practices at your previous job, this will likely have gotten you much farther than you think. A lot of folks don't really think about these things or appreciate why they are used. Beyond just that, it also demonstrates curiosity, which is very valuable. I'd actually say it's one of the main things I look for when interviewing junior to mid-level candidates. IMO that curiosity will take you farther than anything else.\n\n  \nAs far as not having a degree goes, the biggest challenge imo is convincing someone to take a chance on you, and you've just done that. That's not to say it's all downhill from here, but the degree no longer matters. I would be surprised if it even comes up the next time you're applying for a job.\n\n  \nKeep asking questions, keep reading about best practices, keep trying your best. You'll go far.",

Lock down cloud basics: IAM roles/policies, VPC/subnets/security groups, storage semantics (S3/GCS), and how your orchestrator deploys code. Pick one broken or flaky job, add tests, alerts, and retries, then harden it end to end. For data modeling, define grain and primary keys first, keep naming consistent, and handle change with clear SCD rules before you chase “perfect” designs.\n\nWorking in a new codebase: learn repo layout, run the full test suite, add tests around any bug you fix, and aim for frequent small PRs.

But the rest of the org is still a shit show. Like, I work in healthcare, and my piece of it looks great, imo. Not perfect, and I'm limited by the tools the company pays for, but it's neat, and clean, and makes sense. And I could present that to you and you'd think \"wow it's not so bad there.\" But you'd be wrong. Because I don't control every pipeline. I can't, healthcare is too complicated and too big. Tons of special rules and regulations. And a lot of the other functional areas look like what you're describing. And they look like that despite some legitimate good effort on some DEs parts. \n\nAnd be careful what you insult or call bad practice.

What does this meannnnn?\n\n> Is this kind of challenge (analyzing and documenting undocumented databases) something you often encounter in data engineering / data science work?\n\nYep. That's a significant portion of the job at most places. Especially in healthcare and especially in hospital / clinical settings.\n\n> If you’ve faced this situation before, how did you approach it? Did you have strategies or tools that made the process more efficient than just manual exploration?\n\nPretty much what you did. Break down the problem, isolate the problems one-by-one, and clearly document them.  \n\nIn one of Kimball's books, he talks about the concept of a \"bus matrix.\"  It's not totally what you're after, but the idea is very similar.  Come up with whatever standard concepts you are looking for, indicate the potential sources that semantically mean that thing, and then indicate how you map from a -> b, c -> b, etc. etc. \n\nIt's paintstaking and laborious for sure!",

Connectors is the biggest gap: there’s no magic “one lib fits all.” It’s usually case by case, pyodbc or sqlalchemy for relational, boto3 for S3, azure-storage-blob for ADLS, google-cloud libs for GCS, requests for SaaS APIs, etc. I haven’t seen a universal package that matches ADF’s connector library.\n\nFor orchestration, Airflow and Dagster are the go-tos. Prefect is nice if you want something lighter with better DX.\n\nHonestly, even GitHub Actions or cron works fine for simpler setups if you’re disciplined with retries/alerts. Hosting wise, containers on ECS/Kubernetes give flexibility, but I’ve also seen folks run Python EL pipelines on Azure Functions or AWS Lambda when workloads are small enough.\n\nThe headache is always secure on-prem access. ADF’s IR is very convenient, and replacing that usually means standing up VPN, jump hosts, or agents that your orchestrator can reach. That’s the bit most people underestimate.\n\nI used to burn days wiring retries and metadata logging until I made it part of the design from the start. You probably already know, but building a little audit table for run\\_ts/run\\_id helps a ton when debugging.\n\nCurious are you mostly moving SaaS/db data or do you also have on-prem sources in the mix?

The coding there is also just not something I excel at. Maybe others are better at coding in ADF but it just feels so…niche I guess? It’s like an off spec that doesn’t match up with other patterns.\n\nIt seems more GUI driven, which slows down and even becomes really hard to read once things go over a certain complexity level.\n\nWith on-prem, I can bring to the table absolutely any tool I want to get the job done. Stuff like DuckDB and nu shell are really improving the game and are a joy to work with. \n\nAnd if I need a connector outside of my competency, I can use an AI tool to help me skill up and get it done. There’s always some interface that needs some specific setup or language I’m not familiar with.\n\nAlso on-prem has way less cost pressure so the same operation runs at a fraction of the cost. It just has a lot more freedom of design. I can just go for it. I don’t need to worry about blowing up the CPU or RAM on my first prototype. I can just get the functional work done and then tune for performance on the next iteration. That seems more natural and rapid than trying to get it perfect the first time.

What would be the point of having different \"modes\" if you're writing to the same prod tables? If you're testing in prod you're not actually testing\n\n>How many times do you guys test ETL pipelines\n\nMore than zero but less than or equal to the number of times required for me to prove to myself and others that it is working as expected\n\nNow, for the big hurrah:   \n\n\n>!&#x200B;!<How do you test ETL pipelines?\n\nCase to case. I don't think unit tests apply to data eng/ETL like elsewhere in software engineering. I think you would be really surprised how far you can get with QA when you pick a record in the source, dump it to excel then look at the target and see if it matches the expected behavior (and then repeat for a few records). And then find records in your source that have certain edge cases and confirm your pipeline handled them correctly by looking at the exact records in the target",

Partition by date/hour; cluster/z-order by `event_name`, `user_id` (and optionally `session_id`). Only break out separate tables for dimensional models or specific serving use-cases (e.g., a narrow “page\\_views” mart), not for raw ingestion.\n* Identity & causality: require source-side IDs. Minimum viable set: `event_id` (UUID), `user_id` (or `user_pseudo_id`), `device_id`, `session_id`, and a `trace_id`/`parent_event_id` for linking (think W3C Trace Context / OpenTelemetry). If long-lived cookies aren’t allowed, do deterministic or probabilistic sessionization early in the pipeline (sliding time windows, inactivity thresholds). Also emit join keys for common patterns (e.g., `impression_id` on view + `click` carries that id).\n* At your scale (hundreds of millions/day): append-only raw, dedupe on `(event_id)`; compact small files; enforce a schema registry; backfill via streaming + incremental merge; materialize derived marts for sessions, funnels, and attribution. This avoids N-way unions at read time.\n* Trade-offs: you can’t max scalability, usability, and simplicity simultaneously.

You could do a inmon style data model, data vault or directly into a kimball structure. Inmon and Eata vault give more flexibility but require a lot more work in building them. While straight to Kimball is the simplest and quickest way of building data. It depends on your businesses skill sets and time constraints. \n\n\n- gold layer - kimball data models with surrogate keys\n\n\nIn terms of pipelines youre main aim is to have the easiest estate to maintain and manage. This to me means having minimal pipelines. This can be done by building a metadata driven ETL making your pipelines parametised and driven by configuration tables. \n\n\nIn my experience its best to have configuration tables stored in an Azure SQL DB to allow easy transactional data changes, and ease of inserts and updates. \n\n\nWith Azure pipelines you can typically do one extract pipeline (or a couple of parent child pipelines) per source system type and authentication type (e.g. Oracle and Windows auth).\n\n\nEnterprise/Silver pipelines you can have one pipeline.\n\n\nPresentations a pair of parent and child pipelines. ",

Use ADF to schedule and parameterize ingestion (Copy to ADLS Gen2 bronze), store schema in metadata, and handle schema drift. Do transforms in Databricks: one notebook per domain or stage, promote to silver (cleaned, conformed) and gold (query-ready), with expectations/tests and job clusters via Databricks Workflows. Bronze is 1:1 with source objects; silver models business entities; gold is per analytic use case-add tables only when a concrete question needs it.\n\nExpose to Synapse via serverless SQL views over Delta in the lake; publish a curated schema, add row-level security, and document lineage. For dev/test/prod: separate workspaces/storage, Key Vault, Git + CI/CD (params per env), synthetic data, data quality gates, and monitoring to Log Analytics with alerts.

In cloud stacks you trade that GUI clarity for scalability, and sometimes the trade doesn’t feel worth it.\n\nIf you want something closest to that old-school feel, Coalesce is probably the best “modern PowerCenter” I’ve seen. You still end up with SQL under the hood, but the GUI gives you traceability that’s hard to replicate in pure PySpark. Matillion works too but the lock-in stories are real, and Informatica Cloud is… still Informatica, so you know what comes with that. Apache Hop is worth a look if you want open source with a GUI—less polished, but flexible.\n\nThe reason folks keep pushing dbt is because it hits the sweet spot of modularization + lineage + testing in SQL. Add dbt’s semantic layer or a canvas-style GUI (dbt Cloud if you’ve got budget) and you get part of that PowerCenter experience without losing code discipline.\n\nIf your gold models are the bottleneck, I’d maybe pilot Coalesce on a hairy one and compare cycle time + auditability against your current PySpark/dbt flows. Sometimes just seeing the impact analysis in a GUI saves hours of detective work.\n\nCurious, are you leaning toward vendor-backed tools (Coalesce, Matillion, Informatica) or would you consider open source like Hop or even something hybrid? We hit the same frustration with lineage when syncing ERPs/CRMs into warehouses, and it’s one of the reasons we built [Stacksync ](https://www.stacksync.com/)with audit trails baked in otherwise you lose days explaining how a field was derived.",

It is especially useful for scenarios where the database does not have timestamps, and you don't have other application-level events.\n\nDatabases store every change that happen to them in some form of a changelog, roughly a file that has the changes applied to a row, sth like this:\n\n* table: `users`\n* operation: \\`UPDATE\\`\n* id: 42\n* email: [`old@example.com`](mailto:old@example.com) → [`alice@example.com`](mailto:alice@example.com)\n\nCDC is the idea of using this change dataset and replicate the same events for analytical purposes in other places, e.g. your BigQuery or Snowflake.\n\nThere are various ways CDC can be implemented, the most common open-source software for that being Debezium, which reads these events from the database changelog and publishes them to other destinations such as Kafka. This allows people to start consuming the changes even if there's no domain events being published from the application.\n\nThis way of retrieving the data is especially useful when you do not have reliable timestamp columns, which is very common in enterprise settings. CDC allows avoiding any changes to the applications themselves and still replicate the data into the destination in an efficient way.",

At the simplest level, it just means capturing row-level changes (inserts/updates/deletes) from a source system and pushing them somewhere else.\n\nHow it’s done depends on the tech. Some databases expose their transaction logs (Postgres logical decoding, MySQL binlog, etc.), and CDC tools read from those. Others use triggers or periodic queries. So you’ll see CDC as both a *concept* (keep downstream systems in sync with source changes) and a set of *implementations* (Debezium, Oracle GoldenGate, Fivetran, Estuary, etc.).\n\nCompared to microbatches: microbatching polls the DB every X minutes and compares timestamps, which is simpler but usually heavier load and not real-time. Event streaming is closer in spirit, but those events are usually app-generated, not DB-level changes. CDC is nice when you want the “truth” from the database itself rather than relying on apps emitting events.",

Each persons changes remain separated (in their own branch) until they are reviewed and merged to Prod. \n\nFor #2, it doesn't work that way for our environment. As soon as a dev tests and passes their code to stage/uat it's in a singular branch. So, if three different devs have merged their code to stage, but only two of their changes have been reviewed by a UAT resource (let's say the 3rd devs code needs to be reviewed by a different UAT resource), we still can't merge the code to prod because there's a pending change in the branch that hasn't been reviewed yet. Make sense?\n\nThis wouldn't be an issue if the team was smaller. But since this dbt project covers multiple business applications, sometimes one UAT resource approves changes but another hasn't had time to look over remaining code changes in the stage branch.",

Is all my logic idempotent?\n\nWhile writing, force yourself into different situation, how can your current scenario evolves?\n\nIn the paper everything is possible, so make use of that to lay down details of how the data should land in the erp and how people will use it.\n\nDefine criticality of each part and what can happen if they fail.\n\nLastly, consider using established technologies for that: airflow, dragster, etc as they will bring lots of basic benefits you don’t have to implement yourself.",

Ideally you want to choose a system that has built in connectivity and allows you to do your data manipulation along the way. If it does not have built in connectivity then look for systems that you can drop your own connectivity into. \n\nIf data manipulation is not a concern, you could use a system like airbyte. If however, data manipulation is important, then use a system like tabsdata. Either way, choose the system that you feel comfortable with. Bottomline is to resist the urge to create hand-made solution that is taking care of connectivity, manipulation, reporting and job scheduling. Doing that is absolutely not the right approach due to the complexity and maintainability challenges it will eventually lead to. Besides, if you use popular systems you will add that skill to your resume, so it is a win-win.",

What if the API is not available or taking too long to respond?  What if the ETL assumptions you make are no longer valid? While none of these issues may immediately prop up, they invariably eventually will. Unless you are building a product that can be widely deployed for such use cases (which would require significant over engineering), you will end up making assumptions one after the other that eventually become invalid and cause failures. The solution will eventually lead to more patchwork etc.\n\nAnother example - what if the requirements, which are arguably very simple now, change down the line. At that time, you may not see it as your problem but your employer will unfortunately.\n\nHope you see the point. Given you have simple connectivity and you are comfortable with python, I strongly suggest looking at tabsdata as a possible open source solution that will help you focus on your domain/ETL logic and can use the connectivity you provide. Most other systems will split the ingest and transform into different layers unless the transform logic is trivial.",

Do a two-step flow: validate/transform first, then post. Add retries with backoff, timeouts, and a circuit breaker; failed records go to a dead-letter table so the run can keep going. Version your transform with Pydantic models so schema drift blows up loudly. Log a correlation\\_id end to end and ship structured logs. Do a daily reconciliation: counts and a checksum/hash by vendor to catch silent misses.\n\nIf you don’t have native connectors, tabsdata is a decent middle ground to keep your transforms in one place; otherwise a light orchestrator like Prefect beats Task Scheduler for retries and alerts. I’ve used Airbyte and tabsdata, but DreamFactory helped when I needed to expose legacy ERP tables as clean REST endpoints without writing glue code.\n\nPoint is: make it idempotent, add state + retries, and use a lightweight orchestrator so maintenance stays sane.",

If it's an official API, then it just wasn't designed with bulk data loading in mind.\n\nIn any case, if you decide to go forward with this you will have to do as you describe: query stuff, cache whatever you can (like product categories which change less often) and create the relationships yourself. So take your time to model *everything*, create proper relationships between entities, build a proper request throttling mechanism for each entity (maybe by using queues) along with a retry mechanism (just check for http error 429 and do exponential backoff for example), write some tests and go with that.\n\nA dumb example where let's say the entities are \"product\\_summarized\", \"product\", \"region\", \"category\":\n\n1. Take note of the rate limits of each entity to configure the request throttling for your script.\n2. Query the categories & regions once a day to cache their values. \n3. Fetch a list of product\\_summarized using all the combinations of region and category.\n4. Fetch one product for each product\\_summarized using it's id property.\n5. Stich up everything together in a main function and run it.\n\nSteps 3 & 4 are to be executed under a request throttling mechanism so you don't get rate limited. And if you do, the retry mechanism will resume the operation.\n\nWill it be slow? Yeah it will. That's why you need a proper API in the first place.\n\nI've been through this a few times and I feel you. It's indeed a PITA.\n\nLet me know how it goes :)",

The tricks that saved me:\n\n* Treat every fetch as a task in a queue. One queue for “list pages,” another for “details.” Workers pull off the queue, respect per-endpoint rate limits (token bucket or leaky bucket), and checkpoint state after success. Retries become natural instead of spaghetti sleeps.\n* Cache slow-changing stuff (categories, regions) once a day so you’re not burning calls on them.\n* Never trust “lastModified” blindly. Keep your own watermarks per param set in a state table, and overlap a little so you can replay if needed. Idempotent upserts are your friend.\n* For pagination, hash params+page and store raw JSON as bronze layer, then transform later. That way ingestion just moves bytes; your data model can evolve separately.\n\nAirbyte *does* have parent/child stream patterns, but once you’ve got this many dependencies you’ll still need some glue logic for when A must finish before B starts.\n\nIf you’re tired of touching scripts, look at event-driven patterns (SQS/Step Functions style) or frameworks like dlt that handle dependencies and cursors out of the box.\n\nI lost a week once because a retry loop kept hammering the same page without checkpointing… learned to always persist progress after each page, not at the end of the run. We ran into this a lot, and funny enough it’s the reason at Stacksync we built our sync engine around idempotent upserts and dependency-aware scheduling. It was the only way to stop drowning in brittle scripts when APIs paginated + throttled + changed every week.",

Example uses AWS, but this also works on other cloud providers or on-prem.\n\n* **Write side (commands)**: Treat *every unit of work* as a message. One SQS queue for list pages, another for detail fetches. A planner Lambda just enqueues “fetch page X with params Y” messages. Each worker Lambda consumes, respects rate limits via a token bucket in DynamoDB, and writes raw JSON to S3. Everything is idempotent (hash of params/page) so retries don’t hurt.\n* **Dependencies**: If endpoint B depends on A, you gate it with Step Functions or EventBridge rules. Basically, B’s planner only runs once A’s sync run has emitted a “complete” event. No spaghetti.\n* **Read side (queries)**: Raw dumps go into S3 (bronze), then batch jobs (Glue/EMR) turn that into Delta/Iceberg tables (silver). From there, Athena/Redshift is your query layer. You never couple ingestion logic with analytics logic.\n* **Watermarks**: A DynamoDB table stores “last successful sync cursor/updated\\_since” per param set. The planner reads it to only fetch new/changed data.\n\nThis split means your ingestion system only cares about *moving data in under the rules of the API* (rate limits, pagination, retries, dependencies). Your analytics/consumers only care about *clean queryable tables*.\n\nIt sounds heavyweight but it’s way saner than endless scripts. Once everything is “a message + an event”, you stop crying over pagination hell.",

Storage pricing is loss leader to lock customers into their compute layer where the real margin lives. Most customers spend 3-10x more on compute than storage anyway.\n\nFile size economics work because Snowflake controls the write path. They write large columnar files optimized for S3 GET efficiency, not millions of small objects that would destroy economics with API call overhead.\n\nThe flat rate hides the variability underneath. Heavy metadata operations still cost them more, but averaging across customer mix makes pricing predictable.

As somebody reading your github, as soon as I saw the dataset I immediately though \"this person has followed a course to make this\" which may, or may not, be true although, in my opinion, that's the effect of using a common dataset has after reading your 10 CV of the day.\n\n>I'd love to know what to learn / implement for my next project to get it at a level which would get recognised by potential employee.\n\nIn my opinion, if you're going to make a project, it's about making something which interests you rather than making a project for the sake of making one.  Speaking with, what I think anyway, is reasonable knowledge about the UK DE market, people will have a flick through your Github and a competency style interview is more likely than anything else for your first job. So, you should have something to talk about.\n\nThe easiest way to do that is build something which is interesting to you.  Being able to build and solve problems independently by far the biggest and most difficult step, although it's the most important and rewarding.\n\n>Also, since I don't have a qualification in the field, I have been looking into the 'Microsoft Certified: Fabric Data Engineer Associate' course and wondered if its something I should look at doing to boost my CV/ potential hire-ability ?\n\nCertifications are for people with experience rather than people who are new.  If you are new, having strong fundamentals is a lot more important because somebody who can quickly pick up how things work is a lot more likely to be somebody who is a valuable contributor than somebody who is sleepwalking through certificates and courses, not really being sure what to do.\n\nOnly ones I do recommend is do the free AWS cloud course.\n\nThe next question is - well, how do I stand out? Get on the phone and speak to recruiters.  Go and build rapport and sell your experience that way by showing you know more than your CV lets on.  At the end of the day, everybody needs each other.  They're the gatekeeper who wants to let people in so they can get paid, so it's in their best interest to place you provided you meet the criteria.\n\nMore often than not, it's giving the recruiter confidence to put you forward more than being 100% qualified for the job.  Nobody in the job advert will ever say \"Will take somebody who can program, lives in the UK, and isn't an utter bellend\" although sometimes that's exactly what they're looking for.  Only the person in the hiring process will tell you that.",

Explicit flattening and managing columns yourself; the solution you started with is the most traditional and verbose. Makes most benefit of columnar indexing for performance \n\n2.

This has the benefit of displaying as a dictionary (represented close to a nested JSON structure), but you must define a fixed structure (schema on write), thus you lose some flexibility. Performance is expected to be good though, as BigQuery anyway implements this as if they were separate columns behind the scenes, at a physical level.\n\n3. Storing a JSON. Even if you use the JSON type, it's still a string. This is not indexed at all, and would be insanely bad for performance without at least some partitioning keys (like the Firebase replicated data naturally has).\n\nThe choice is yours and depends on your requirements, but I would stay away from #3 if you care about data modeling at all.",

Add tests that fail on uncontracted keys. Avoid storing hot-path params as JSON; use JSON only for edge cases. Cluster the long table by event\\_name, key to cut scans.\n\nWe’ve paired Segment Protocols for contracts and dbt for models, and used DreamFactory to quickly expose cleaned lookup dims as REST APIs for product teams without building services from scratch.\n\nKeep raw nested, model a long table, and selectively pivot only what matters.",

If you’ve locked things into fixed columns, you’ll eventually have to deal with schema drift and painful backfills.\n\nThat’s why I prefer keeping the materialized layer in JSON. It’s still stored columnar in BigQuery, so you don’t lose efficiency, but you gain flexibility for evolving event structures. Then, if you need “wide” representations for certain use cases, you can always build views on top of the JSON (and even automate those views from your parameters table if you want).\n\nOne other thing: I’d avoid using a dedicated “parameters table” as the system of record for what keys exist. That approach tends to push business logic into data tables instead of code, and since tables aren’t version-controlled like your dbt models, it makes changes harder to track or roll back.\n\nSo in short:  \n\\- JSON gives you resilience against schema changes and type mismatches.  \n\\- Views let you expose wide tables when needed, without locking into a brittle schema.  \n\\- Keeping the logic in dbt models (instead of a parameters table) makes it easier to track history and review changes.\n\nThis way you’re balancing efficiency with long-term maintainability.",

Once you put LLM/vision calls into the table itself, you need clear semantics for “this call failed, retry only this cell” vs “model version changed, recompute everything downstream.” If you nail that, you avoid the “oh crap, we just re-ran 3M API calls because a column changed” problem.\n\nStorage/export matters too. Folks will want to hit outputs with Trino/DuckDB or hydrate back into a lakehouse. Saw you support Parquet/Lance already Iceberg/Delta connectors would make it play nice with existing ecosystemss\n\nAlso, cost guardrails: per-function budgets and rate limiting help keep a runaway pipeline from torching credits. I like the declarative idea because it’s close to how we think about sync at Stacksync, we ended up building dependency-aware scheduling and idempotent upserts to keep API + DB sync sane. Feels like the same pain, just with heavier multimodal payloads\n\nCurious: how do you handle long-lived context updates say, embeddings that need periodic reindex when the model shifts?",

        "body": "On retries and lineage: This is where the declarative approach pays off. We have precise semantics for what gets recomputed:\n\n\\- Cell-level granularity: When an LLM/vision call fails, only that specific cell retries (up to 10 attempts with exponential backoff). The retry logic respects provider rate limits automatically.\n\n\\- Selective recomputation with \\`where\\`\\*\\*: You can recompute specific rows using predicates:\n\n  \\# Only recompute rows where the call failed\n\n  table.recompute\\_columns('....', errors\\_only=True)\n\n  etc.\n\n\\- Cascade control: \\`cascade=True\\` (default) automatically recomputes all downstream dependencies; \\`cascade=False\\` updates only the target column. Our planner traces the full dependency graph, so when you change something, only affected columns get updated, not the entire table.\n\nOn embedding indices: They're first-class and auto-maintained:\n\ntable.add\\_embedding\\_index('content', embedding=sentence\\_transformer(...))\n\n\\# Index updates automatically on inserts/updates\n\ntable.insert(\\[{'content': 'new document'}\\])  # embedding computed & indexed\n\n\\# Replace the model - index rebuilds automatically\n\ntable.add\\_embedding\\_index('content', embedding=new\\_model, if\\_exists='replace')\n\nThe indices stay consistent with your data because they're part of the table schema, not bolted-on externally.\n\nOn rate limiting: Provider rate limits are handled transparently. For OpenAI, Anthropic, etc., we parse rate limit headers from responses and throttle requests to stay within both request and token quotas. No runaway API calls torching your credits from the execution side. (We don't have \"stop at $X budget\" guardrails yet, but that should be handled over there)\n\nOn storage/export: Fully agree! Iceberg will be an easy addition.",

The Dev environment needs to have prod data.  My team uses dbt for our sql models, and we configure our dev environment to pull in prod data\n\n\nOkay, so now you have a dev and a prod SSIS environment.  You need to configure your environment variables in the SSIS project. This will allow GitHub later to switch between environments based on the git branch.\n\nYou can use Github actions to build the ci/cd.  The action is just a yaml file that gives github a list of instructions to perform.  \n\nHere is the workflow. You push code for your local repo, les call it ticket SSIS-001.  The ticket changed the column name in a table.  When you push the local changes to the remote branch, aka SSIS-001, on the remote server.  The Github actions will kick off the instructions.  The goal of the instructions is to confirm of the deployment is worked as expected.   You will probably want to run some test that check if any of your transformations fail.  If any transformation fails, the entire pipeline will fail. When this happens, the ci/cd will stop.  This means you can't merge SSIS-001 into prod.\n\nSo, now you go back on your local branch and fix the issue and push the changed back to the remote SSIS-001  branch.  The pipeline passed, and now you merge into master branch.   The master branch will run a pipeline that is the same and then push the dtsx package to ssis server and done.\n\nCheckout Azure DevOps that might where you want to handle the ci/cd.  But if you google github actions or Azure dev ops for ssis you will get a yaml file that will look exactly like how you deploy manually today",

Use Influx Tasks to downsample 30s raw into 1m and 5m buckets, plus materialized views (per building/sensor groups) that your dashboard queries by default. Only hit raw for drilldowns. For tags, keep low-cardinality: orgid/buildingid, beamid, heightlevel, sensor\\_id; store temp/humidity/battery/rssi as fields. Avoid tags for anything that changes often.\n\nLive view: Durable Object broadcasts websocket updates from the latest aggregate point (not raw) at a fixed tick (e.g., 5s) to cap reads. Alerts: compute thresholds in Tasks and persist open/closed state in Cloudflare D1 or KV; you likely don’t need Redis. Long retention: dump raw to R2 daily as Parquet for cheap storage; analyze later with DuckDB/Spark if needed.

        "body": "Off the bat there really aren’t universal “best practices” - Data Engineering has historically been a very “dirty” area in IT. You will need to be able to adapt to kind of whatever your company throws at you/wants from you. It’s definitely getting better, tools like Dagster, dlt, dbt (R.I.P. this open source project…) together with [PEP 318](https://peps.python.org/pep-0318/) (and associated RFP) have really helped to push DE closer towards SE in design and implementation. As such you are best looking at best practices around software engineering principles and adapting to your work.\n\nTo answer your questions, please see below:\n1. This VERY much up to you as the DE to decide. The OLTP -> HDFS/S3(-like) storage is a very common use case and as such has a lot of choice for you as the DE. In saying that it’s easiest to usually use what you have on hand/in production already. Have SSIS - you can start with that, only have Python - use that. What you are really asking here is how do I ETL - just google ETL OLTP to storage etc.\n2. For you (or your architects/plats guys if you have them) to decide, but I personally would want separation of services since I’m not trying to deal with noisy neighbours etc. You really don’t want to add more ways for your Production OLTP server to crash/underperform IMO. So I would recommend a seperate VM/dedicated file server/service with proper subnetting etc.\n3. Will once again depend on use case, but almost always will be read-replica if they exist in your corp. (You can take this as - Yes, use your read replica(e).\n4. You will need a VPN gateway (unless you are running some ExpressRoute etc). Also you will need to give the cloud storage a Private IP address (and check subnetting/peering etc) Your network guy(s) will know what to do/should really be doing this for you.\n5. Just more ETL - this time file system to cloud storage. Once again you decide.\n6. 🤷 Up to you. I personally don’t use them as they quite expensive and don’t seem worth it to me and my practice, but if your company is on board and you feel more comfortable using them go for it.\n\nEdit: I want to point out that it entirely possible to this all on-premise (and open sourced 😊) if you need/the cloud aspect is the most frustrating portion.",

Depending upon what the data stored in the cloud is used for, you may need a different strategy altogether (snapshots, append, replication, etc).\n\n> Would I extract files from the database through custom scripts (Python, shell) which access the production database and copy data to a dedicated file system?\n\nBetter to use a system that can query your database and send that data to destination system. Commercial solutions like fivetran or open source systems like tabsdata could be used. Try not to have your own managed staging area as that creates complications and management overhead.\n\n> Would the file system be on the same server as the database or on a separate server?\n\nIf you still do that, don't put data on the system where the db is, use a spearate system.\n\n> Is it better to extract the data from a replica or would it also be acceptable to access the production database?\n\nDepends upon on the db load profile. Use the replica if it is readily available unless the load on the production database is low enough that you can query it directly for data extraction.\n\n> How do I connect an on-premise server with cloud storage?\n\nThere are data movement systems you can and should use for this. No point in reinventing the wheel as it will get complicated very fast.\n\n> How do I transfer the extracted data that is now on the file system to cloud storage? Again custom scripts?\n\nAgain, if you insist on going this route, I would still suggest using a data movement system to pick it up from local file system and sending it to cloud.\n\n> What about tools like Fivetran and Airbyte?\n\nThat is a good idea. Use them. Other open source tools to consider - apahe camel and tabsdata.",

But from a management point of view, there is an idea that the person who writes the code is actually responsible for the quality of the results.

I want to move things forward without getting stuck in the same place for too long or burning out trying to do everything at once.\n\nSounds like you are burning out already.\n\nFinish your degree.  This is paramount.  Aim to complete things already in play before you start new things.\n\nI'd drop the product.  Unless it's already got legs and you have actual commercial interest, putting your time into something which, by the sounds of it, already exists may not be optimal for your current mental health.  If you burn out, you risk not finishing your degree.\n\n>Career progression - I don’t want to stay as a junior any longer and its so low priority for the company currently. I want to keep build towards something bigger but feel like times not on my side\n\nI have no idea how old you are, but you sound young.  The idea of time not being on your side is absolutely insane.  You probably have a lot more time than you think, you're just giving yourself a million things to do and wondering where the fuck all your time goes.\n\nDo less.  It's okay.\n\n> Feels like a lot to juggle and I don’t want to get stuck.\n\nReal talk here: sounds like you are already stuck.  The good news is there's a reason - you aren't aiming for anything in particular and you are trying to do everything.  This is like one of those things when at work everybody says \"I need this tomorrow!\" so you bust it out and then it turns out they didn't need it tomorrow.\n\nPrioritise what's important.  Finish your degree.  Have a think about what you really really want to do for a couple of weeks instead of putting time into time consuming things.  You can't contract, progress your career, and build a product at the same time.",

Let's say they get 2000 applications for an open posting. They need to cut it down to, say, 10 to call in for an interview. If half of those 2000 don't have a B.Sc. in Comp Sci on their resume, it is easy to toss them in a bin and cut your search space in half. Will you throw away some applications from great candidates? Absolutely. But their priority will be whittling down the pile of resumes to a more manageable number as fast as possible so anything they can filter on is great.\n\nNext to that hurdle, there's just that university comes with lots of networking skills. You'll make contacts - especially if you do an internship, but even if you don't if you have a good reputation in your program the other good students are going to remember you. And might give you a recommendation if you try to get in where they work. The whole \"it isn't what you know, it is who you know\" is at least partially true in every field.\n\nOkay, social/employment considerations aside, what actual learning advantages does University have? There's a few.\n\nFirst is time. Between classes and studying and assignments, you'll probably spend 5000 hours over 4 years on comp sci as you go through the degree, which I think is probably the bare minimum you need to get competent. A lot of self-taught people are trying to cram in all their learning into just a couple hundred hours and that's super unrealistic.\n\nIn addition, when your work is being evaluated by others it helps you figure out if you're actually learning anything. Good professors (and they aren't all good) will design assessments that are really testing if you understand the material deeply. Whereas I see so many people \"self-teach\" themselves and learn *nothing* because their knowledge is never put to the test and they never realize they've just been copying tutorials and never actually internalized anything.\n\nIn terms of actual subject matter, yeah, fundamentals, data structures and algorithms, that type of thing self-taught people tend to miss out on. But there's like a *million* books you can pick up that'll teach you those. The employment angle and the \"actually forcing you to spend the time and effort instead of just convincing yourself you're learning\" parts are the far more important aspects for most people.",

CS grads may have more theoretical knowledge but they may not have \"industry-ready\" knowledge such as knowing Git, knowing PostgreSQL, building a rest apt, etc. Autodidacts will have a lot of holes in what they know and without proper fundamental knowledge, they may get stuck.\n\nHowever, this is just a generalization: \n\n* Not every CS degree holder are the same. Believe me, I've seen some who, all they did throughout their 4-5 years in college was just coasting, only studying in preparation for an exam but never actually grasped what they've learned. Also, there are CS degree holders, in addition to having solid grasp of the fundamentals, also know important software engineering tools such as git, know multiple languages in depth and software engineering principles.\n* Not every self-taught programmer just knows basic web dev stuff. Some even learn other languages, some learn in depth. And there are self-taught devs who learn the fundamental knowledge (such as Data structures and algorithms, computer architecture, software design, etc). Any serious developer, regardless of their background, will eventually have to learn the fundamentals if they want to stay relevant, and not just someone learning a new hot technology each month only for it to be deprecated the next month)",

So I’m sorry you’re going through that. It’s especially hard when it’s something you thought you’d like. Try and see what school resources you have, sometimes they have free support systems for people who want to help struggling students. Sometimes it takes in-person help to really wrap our head around complex subjects. Programming can take shaping your brain to think differently for those who don’t already think like a robot.",

Theory of code is great. It’s nice to understand concepts. But truly understanding code comes from writing it. Seeing the same error and then eventually clicking “oh it’s because I put this here, or oh, I see how to refactor this into less spaghetti”\nAdditionally, while C is a backbone language it is considered low level, and you might benefit from taking what you know and applying it to another language. Some are much easier to learn than others. For example, writing a webpage with basic functions (like say writing a blog post) is significantly easier in my opinion than the majority of things you could build in C. Not only is the syntax easier to understand and master, but you get immediate gratification in seeing what you’re doing as you work and change things. E.g. changing the size of text or a container can be immediately seen when you reload the page or even faster if you use a plugin like Live Server. (Refreshes page every save so you don’t have to manually reload the page). Anyway, my point is don’t fret on not understanding all of the conceptual stuff. Some of it will come in time. There’s still theory far beyond me and I’ve been employed and coding projects for about five years now and again I need to note I didn’t return to college and pick coding back up until my mid twenties. However, I started with Python and then quickly moved into data cleaning with python libraries like NumPy and Pandas. Then web development, then swiftUI, and now I actually mostly use react (JS library), and for personal projects a lot of godot so gdscript.",

You are still very young compared to retirement, so don't worry about age.\n\n>and I won't have any official programming degrees\n\nThis is what you should be worried about. If you can get one, do, if it's not possible, you can still make it, but it will be harder. Everything after is just my opinion, I am self taught, but joined in a much nicer job market, but what worked for me and what all my interviewers talked about was:\n\nA) My Github was clean, I followed the basic rules, you don't need green square every day but 3-6 days a week shows you're learning your ass off. Every repo has only one project. Every repo has a README.md that explains what it is, why you built it, how you built it, is it done, where can they see it, and anything else you want. The only repo that breaks these rules is one called \"Practice\" where all your code goes when doing small tutorials, practicing stuff, or just playing around. This folder has a readme that says \"Please Ignore this Repo\" or something so interviewers who check know not to bother. You should also be using proper git branching techniques, create feature branches with good names and good commit messages. Show whoever looks that you know how to work on a team and already know the basics, if you don't know them, learn them. \n\nB) My portfolio was nice. I didn't make the standard layer cake design, I also made sure to make it really easy to use, I used very clearly labeled sliding drawers to put all the data they could want on one splash page. I got lots of compliments about it. \n\nC) My project was a Recipe app that also included a shopping list and meal planner. Most of the functionality was there, that which wasn't was clearly shown in the readme, the design was terrible as I'm not a designer, but almost every interview talked about it in depth about why I built it, what tech I used, and why. \n\nUnfortunately now you also need to get past the AI gatekeepers, this is mostly a \"Stuffing your resume with keywords\" game. If it's in the job ad and you can honestly say you've used it, it should be in your resume and cover letter (if used) somewhere. Don't lie about what you can do, but if your roles have all been Angular, but the ad wants React and you work with React at home sometimes, maybe one of your roles was React...\n\nThe last thing I'll say that helped me a lot is \"Make a story\". Why are you doing this now instead of earlier. Look at your work history and, true or not, make a story about why you've finally realized Coding is your dream passion, because that's what you need interviewers to believe. You were amazing and doing great but \"lost\", then one day something happened that helped put you on this path to your true dream of becoming a coder. Make a story and build everything around it, your portfolio, your projects, whatever you can, the more the better. Practice answers to the obvious interview questions that explore and explain the story. Humans LOVE stories, especially coherent ones with growth where someone is finally achieving their dream. You need someone to take a chance on you, so you have to appear not to just be the best choice, but to be such an amazing choice that the lack of degree doesn't matter as your code is clean, your github is impeccable, your project shows the knowledge needed, and coding is your dream that you're finally realizing.\n\nSorry for length, you **can** do it, but it will be hard. Even for those with diplomas it can take 6-12 months of looking if they're not lucky... it's VERY much a numbers game though, just keep firing out resumes for any job that asks for less than 5 years of experience and isn't specifically a senior role. If you have any other questions or anything, just message.",

In fact, the guy who wrote the book on design patterns has since shifted into appreciating functional programming implementations. \n\nBut remember the principles of OOP: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism. \n\nWhen you are writing code you know everything about what you’ve written, but you gotta think on the next person who might have to extend or use your code in some way. \n\nE.g.: I am implementing some logic where the variable “car_speed” should ONLY change when the operation “accelerate()” is executed. If I had them exposed then an ill advised user (coworker extending my code) might change car_speed directly and break my logic. \n\nOOP lets me abstract and encapsulate the logic and values. You have a class. It’s very explicit the values that it is concerned with and it exposes only the things others should be concerned. \n\nThen you have inheritance and polymorphism, those have to do with how blocks of logic usually repeat. Ideally you don’t want to copy and paste the same code many times, so it’s nice to have a framework on how the same logic can be repeated slightly differently many times",

        "body": "There are two ways I think you can tackle this with. First is that designing software in an “object oriented” way makes a lot of intuitive sense. Imagine designing a course registration system for a college, or something similarly large. Where do you even start? Well, you can start with just thinking about all the nouns and verbs of the situation. There are students, courses, rooms, programs, professors, departments, and so on. You want students to be able to Register or Drop classes, and so on. The first approximation of the design of your system is to treat every noun as a class, and every verb as a method of that class. It’s a very natural way of organizing code, especially for large enterprise applications which deal with a ton of Nouns and Verbs, and naturally you’ll find most of those applications are written in the two biggest OOP languages, Java or C#. When you think about trying to design a system like that purely in terms of functions, it’s absolutely *possible* to do this, but you’ll find thinking through the problem much much more difficult, especially once you start to get into enforcing all your rules business rules like “students can only take 5 courses, unless they are in the ENG department in which case they can take 6”. \n\nIn my mind classes are a tool for managing your code when you work on something very large, especially when you have to work with other people. For our school example you will need to deal with many types of accounts. Classes can be used to make a base User class which will contain all your fundamental login capacity, and then you can inherit this to make a Student class and a Staff class, which would be further inherited to make a Faculty and Admin class. You can then make classroom info available to Faculty, but Pay information available to all Staff. \n\nSomebody else who’s working in the payroll page wouldn’t need to know anything about the specifics of faulty or admin, they can work it all out in the Staff class, and you can do your work in the Faculty class, and so on.\n\nNow all this said, you can do all this with just functions, and “Functional Programming” (FP) is the other major paradigm of programming other than OOP. FP does have a lot going for it, the main one being that a highly disciplined FPer is far far less likely to introduce bugs. The trade-off is that the coding can often be much more.. *abstract*, especially the deeper you get into that way of coding. \n\nMy advice would just be to try to make a little text based RPG game where there are different enemies, items, moves, characters etc purely with functions and with classes. I think you’ll find that using classes really suits making video games very well. On the other hand if you were writing a program which processed a stream of stock market data to build a dashboard, where correctness was paramount, a purely functional approach might be better suited.",

A class made the most sense here because I could create a new instance of the class for every submission from the user, sanitize all input, build all the HTML, and do many other tasks, all very easily. If I were to accomplish that without using a class, it would probably involve a lot of spaghetti code and be difficult to understand.

A board that is a procedural loop of tiles where events happen as you land on them, kind of like Mario party. \n\n\"Practice\" doesn't need to be boring or pointless, you can improve your skills by making something fun. You can even use coding to make math fun - visualize or sample a random math function.

It gets into an \"operations\" problem.\n\nThe short answer: just make a file on a Local Area Network (LAN), (usually just on your home network somewhere), and then access it by that local network's IP address.\n\nLong answer: By _default_, nothing has a domain name on the internet.  You have to apply to get one of those if you want it to be public, and it's a whole process.\n\nBy _default_, everything on the internet has an IP address.  This address allows the computer to figure out what other computer to talk to.\n\nMost (home network) LANs have an NAT (network address translator), which takes all the requests sent to it that are destined for the WWW, and translates them so the data gets sent back to said NAT, and translates it back to the LAN address.  This NAT is usually in a Router (a connection between two different networks.)\n\nWithout this router, you cannot connect to the LAN from the internet, so it is not public.\n\nWith this router, the stuff on your network is only public if you change the router settings to allow incoming connections (usually with Port Forwarding/Triggering)\n\nThus, routers have two different IP addresses.  One for \"the internet\" to communicate with it, and one for the LAN, to communicate with the LAN.\n\nAny computer connected to the LAN can talk to any other device on the LAN with its IP address.  This LAN address usually starts with 10., or 192.168., depending on how the router is set up.\n\nSo if you save the website on a local computer, then use the computers LAN IP as the URL on any other computer in that LAN, you get what you want.",

Nobody's going to accidentally discover that, but copying IPv6 addresses around is kind of a pain and the people you're sharing it with may not even have IPv6 access.\n\nThe easiest thing to do is just to not worry about any of that.  Get a domain name, run a server to serve your web page, and put a password on it.  Practically every web server will allow you to require a username & password to access a page, so you can just set that and then also give those out to anybody you want to access it.",

And repeat this rule for every branch of the tree...\n\nWell then, for any given ID, starting from the `root`, you've either A) found the product, B) went down the `left` branch, or C) went down the `right` branch. Now as we established, we start with the middle ID, and we divide the inventory in HALF by both sides of the tree.\n\nWhat this means is you immediately determine which half the ID must be contained in, and you have thus cut your search space IN HALF. We don't have to check N elements, we instead check only O\\(log N\\) elements. The more elements you have, the more efficient the search. Each iteration cuts the remaining search field by half, every time.\n\nOf course, you get this in:\n\n    std::map<id_type, product_type> inventory;\n\n    //...\n\n    use(inventory[id]);\n\nYou can go faster still with a hash table.\n\n---\n\nMost of the job is searching, sorting, and transforming data. How you store the data and the algorithms you write to access that storage are intertwined. In C++, we get a few standard data structures, a few standard algorithms that are common, typical. Using a vector, or a map, or a hash table... It's easy to forget that these are both data structures AND algorithms hidden behind some convenient syntax; but a `map` implements a binary tree, and binary search! All you see is `inventory[id]`, and the rest is taken for granted. The structure and algorithms you use are decided when you are designing your solution, what best fits the problem you're trying to solve.",

        "body": "Besides AI, nothing much changed in these 8 years.\n\nYes, Java 8 is kind of deprecated now (yes, it is LTS version and will get some updates up to 2030, but still) and if possible, then look into newer Java versions. The current LTS are Java 21 and Java 25.\n\nAnd similar version changes have happened also to Spring Boot and other things.\n\nBut as we know, the real life shows that companies are still using old versions because most of the development funds go to adding new features and fixing bugs. Infrastructure upgrades are of lower priority for the management level.\n\nMaybe somehow big thing was Log4Shell vulnerability that affects Log4J versions between 2.0 and 2.15. If you have any projects using Log4J from these versions then update your stuff. That Log4Shell was a catastrophe level vulnerability. Or, just learn to use vulnerability checking tools like OWASP Dependencycheck or Trivy scanner if you are not doing it already.\n\nOther than that, the world is quite same in 2025 as it was in 2017.\n\nWhen it comes to an AI then that is what you need to learn to use. Everything else is just version upgrades.\n\nThere is free ChatGPT tier you can use. Also Google AI Studio is free to use (better than free ChatGPT tier). Just try it out. See what it can do and what it can't do. I would say that the current AI is on a Bachelor student's level. So, imagine working with a Junior developer. Sure, it is a helpful tool when it comes to debugging stuff, brainstorming, etc. Also when it comes to automating simple things. But do not fully trust its output. Be critical about its answers. Imagine doing a code review to a Junior developer. Like that.\n\nMore often than not, then current AI that is available to us, is lazy, forgets things (due to a context window and due to an unoptimized focus), sometimes ignores your instructions. Many of the AI tools can access the Internet. BUT it does not mean it will do it. It is lazy. Unless you demand from it to look up information from the Internet it will not do it. It tries to rely mainly on its training data (which can be outdated). It also hallucinates when it does not have an exact answer to something. It starts generalizing stuff and making up answers.\n\nSo, be critical with what the AI is telling you. It is a useful tool but do not fully trust it. The same way how you do not fully trust Google Search results. Verify over, when possible.\n\nYou can also use Claude Code that can work with your projects in your own machine. But all the pros and cons of AI apply also to Claude Code. You will tell it to do things and it will then display code changes with a git diff. Then you will either approve, reject, or correct it with your own input on this.\n\nEdit: That answer is based on what concerns backend development. Can't give much input about how did the frontend development changed or not, in these 8 years.",

Only one packet can be sent by one host at any given time, since there’s only one wire to talk on.\n\nRather than send EVERY packet on your local lan to EVERY host on your local lan, a switch pays attention to the traffic (including some special packets) and figures out who’s on which physical outgoing cable, and sends packets only to their recipients.  But that’s just an optimization.  It does the same *job* as twisting 8 sets of wires together, like the hub was doing.  Purely a local-network thing.\n\nYou can see how this is totally different than inspecting packet headers, consulting routing tables, and forwarding a packet along on its way to who knows where.\n\n[I guess that’s a long way of saying that a router routes IP packets on the global network , and a switch “routes” Ethernet packets on the local network.

This isn't talking about some real physical router, **this is talking about the abstract concept of a router's core function**. The network layer is where packets are moved around between separate 'local' network segments.\n\nA 'switch' is a layer 2 device, because that core functionality of a 'switch' belongs on the OSI model. Layer 2 is about connecting the physical devices together on the local network.\n\nReal, physical devices that you actually use, almost always operates at ALL layers.  A router will have a physical connection to other devices, it will will have to be using something like Ethernet to connect, it will have a networking protocol like IP, IPX or something obscure for its primary functionality.  But it will also have a management interface, and often it will have some support for network services like ntp, dhcp, dns, etc, meaning it will operate in layer 4-7.\n\nMany of the devices called 'switches' you will have access these days also can operate as routers, have packet filtering and so on. Many devices that are called 'routers' and used for home networks include a switch.  I could take a random computer and put in a few network interfaces in it, and with Linux turn it into a router, or switch.  What something is called is more about what you believe the primary function of the device is.\n\n> even though switch comes after router. \n\nWhen looking at the OSI model, you must evaluate it individual for every single device between the source and destination.  A computer L1-7 will be often be connected to something acting as a switch L1-2, which will be connected to a router L1-3, which which may be connected to another switch L1-2, which may be connected to another computer L1-7.\n\nOn a typical wired network you will have some kind of physical connection, your Ethernet frames between nodes are happening at layer 2, the Ethernet frames contain Internet Packets, Internet packets will often be TCP or UDP, Your TCP or UDP packet will often contain some kind of application playload.\n\n>  Im confused on why the architecture was designed in a way so router have to look into higher layer just for it to encapsulate it again and pass it to lower level device.\n\nThough it is mostly used everywhere these days, it is very important to remember, that the world isn't just Ethernet.  A router can connect different types of networks. A 'switch' is basically an Ethernet only thing.\n\nIt used to be very common to have a T1 (serial), or frame-relay, or some other type layer 2 network connect to the router, and maybe a token ring network on the 'local' segment.\n\nFor people with a cable internet connection (DOCSIS) they will have a router with a cable interface and an ethernet interfaces. Or maybe you'll could have a DSL connection so you'll have a router with a DSL interface.\n\nDSL, DOCSIS, frame relay, fddi, token ring and many more are not Ethernet. They operate differently at layers 1-2.",

Ethernet is what most of us think about and is extremely common in home and business networks.  But there are many more.  High capacity fiber links, satellite networks, cellular networks, even USB and Bluetooth, all have their own implementations and their own particular way of sending data between devices on those networks.  \n\nThe Internet Protocol accepts the fact that network operators won’t always agree on what devices and protocols to use, and that new network innovations might occur in the future.  The Ethernet protocol is actually younger than the IP protocol.  There were other types of networks in use when IP was developed, some still in use and others not.  \n\nWith IP, as long as devices are able to send an ordered sequence of bytes over a network they can handle IP traffic, and a lot of details necessary for how those bytes are moved in the network are left to the lower layers.",

Maths and logic make some of the algorithmic work seem very easy - for every computation, simply select the result from the real numbers - it's easy!\n\nBut when dealing with actual physical devices that need to exploit electrons to get you that answer, you have to concede a wee tiny bit to that - like for example that numbers don't have infinite precision. That part used to be a lot bigger (with directly programming assembly instructions or managing memory), but it's still there, hidden under layers of compilers that translate your code to stuff the machine can work with.\n\nOne thing you can do is to flip your mental switch and not treat programming as something goal oriented, but with the mathematicians curiosity of: okay, I have this set of primitives (your language and the idealised computer it runs on) - what can I do with this? What interesting stuff can be found in the set of all possible programs - and how does that change if I use a different idealised machine (for example with an ARM chip vs an x86-64 chip) or with a GPU.",

Once you know the basics, use AI to speed up work (scaffolding, tests, explanations).\n\nIf you want to learn frontend connection and use AI in development, a practical way is to build a small, deployable app end-to-end. You may or may not follow a course for the app idea. Utilize platforms such as Replit or Lovable or similar, to prototype a frontend for your backend. Those platforms provide code for the generated frontend prototype. Use ChatGPT (or another model) to clarify each generated code block and how it could integrate into your backend application. Write the code(implement it yourself, not copy) in your backend developed application. Reading, running, and editing the code is how you learn. Use AI as an assistant to make your app better.

All the tutorials online are beginners tutorial and cover everything I already know, but everything else is just \"build a project\" and requires knowledge of frameworks \n\nNothing ever requires a framework… You can do most things from first principles and be just fine (only area where this might be a bit iffy is cryptography and encryption since you actually have to be sort of domain expert to understand all the constant time hacks etc…)\n\n> I have never seen and I don't know where to even start gaining that knowledge.

Use a secure, unique password, with 2FA if possible. Don't fall for phishing attacks that seem like they're coming from your registrar but aren't really.\n\nThe other is the privacy of your registration information. ICANN requires that all domains have valid contact information, including a mailing address, and that information is made public through the \"Whois\" database system. If you don't want your details to be public, you may want to use whatever privacy forwarding service that your registrar provides. (If you just provide fake info, it's possible that you'll lose access to the domain when the contact info can't be validated.)\n\n----\n\nEverything else depends not on the domain itself, but what server you're pointing its DNS records at.\n\nIf you're using a static file host such as GitHub Pages, then there's not much to be concerned with. Any attacks would go to GitHub's servers, not yours, and there's not much risk of a security problem affecting your data specifically. All you really have to worry about is inadvertently publishing information that you want to keep private, but that's true of literally any digital communications.\n\nIf you were to have your own webapp running on your own server, then you would have to be a lot more careful with security, but that's true whether or not there's a domain name pointing to your server.",

For email, add SPF, confirm DKIM (iCloud does this once MX is set), and publish a DMARC record (start with p=quarantine and monitor reports).\n\nOn GitHub Pages, enforce HTTPS, consider HSTS via Cloudflare, don’t commit secrets, and enable secret scanning and Dependabot. If you proxy through Cloudflare, turn on basic WAF rules and rate limiting. I’ve used Cloudflare Workers and Supabase for simple backend needs; DreamFactory was handy when I had to expose a legacy SQL DB as secure REST without shipping keys to the frontend.\n\nBottom line: strong 2FA, DNSSEC, and SPF/DKIM/DMARC cover most risks here.",

Take 2 equations: f(x) = 100x + 10, g(x) = x (the simplest function we can represent with the same degree as f(x)).\n\nThe largest exponent for both of these equations is 1, so we can apply the above rule. Let's choose a constant of 105 for c.\n\nFor some values of x, f(x) > c * g(x). Take x == 1 for example. F would be 110 and g would be 1. 110 > 105 (1 * C). However, at larger values of x, this doesn't stay true. At x == 10 we get f is 1,010 and g is 10. So, for these values, f(x) < g(x) * c, since 10 * 105 is 1,050 and 1,050 > 1,010.\n\nBasically, this just sums down to the idea that a functions growth is capped to its largest exponent, which is why Big O notation always ignores constants (except for O(1)). So, even something like f(x) = 1,000,000,000x, the Big O notation would be O(x), because there exists a constant C and a value of x X0 that f(x) < c * g(x).",

Stick to it until you have a good grip and you’re able to build a fairly robust app. \n\nAfter you can look into other languages and specify into what you want. It’s not crazy hard to change later once you know what you want to do with the new language. \n\nPersonal recommendation:\n\nIf you want to build mobile apps go with Java and Android Studio. It’ll do a lot of the heavy lifting for you and it has a drag and drop GUI builder. \n\nIf you want to go the longer route and get the basics down start with C. Try CS50x (Harvard’s free course), that’ll bringing you through C fairly well (to start) and cover a bit of html and Python, I think it uses flask towards the end but I can’t remember. \n\nI like Python alright but I wouldn’t recommend starting there, you don’t need to define types and it’s an interpreted language so you don’t compile to find errors which is a big lesson in learning early on. Also it is a bit different from how key features work (tuples, indentation, for loops). I’d stick with a more traditional one to start. \n\nJavaScript unless you want to go full web-dev I wouldn’t go there either (not really a fan). Again like Python it’s interpreted. It will run on any browser but I’ve only done the bare minimum when I’ve had to use it. \n\nMost importantly check back in 2 years when I’ll be advising you that JS is the only way to go, after getting out of bed on the other side or something. \n\nBut really getting a start on any of them and sticking out the hard parts is the way to go. C/C# for .Net or Java take your pick.",

If you can represent the data in a way that makes sense and start with that, it becomes easier to do the rest. \"Great programmers worry about data, not code.\"\n\nAn example might be, if you want to make a picture editor. The data you want to manipulate is an image. So you think about how you might want to store the image in memory. Maybe as an x/y grid (a 2d array)?\n\nMaybe start there, and get it showing on the screen immediately so you know it's working as expected. Then you can start adding other stuff. Don't try to plan and write it all out at once.. get your data on the screen so it's easy to manipulate, and work from there.\n\nThis can be applied to most kinds of programs.\n\nFor me, there is a strong connection between computing and humanities. A computer is probably the most powerful artistic medium ever created. Programming itself is a creative medium. But just as you can't write ideas without first learning an alphabet, you have to learn some basics about manipulating bits to wield the power of programming.

Something that I see a lot of beginners do is they will want to learn to program and they will jump to a Python course on YouTube and then they're confused as to why they can't code anything after learning the language.\n\nBecause learning the language isn't actually doing much of anything for you. Syntax isn't difficult, what is difficult is problem solving and that's what programming is at it's core. If you pick up a good book or a good course, that course will not just teach you the technology but how it works and why it works and how to use it. For example, I did CS50 and it's great, it's really good. It doesn't just teach you C and Python and SQL, it teaches you why those tools are useful, how to use them, how to solve problems with them. The course focuses more on what programming is, other than what language are we using this week.\n\nI believe that learning how to problem solve and how to write code will teach you so much more than just doing a Python course and moving on. Once you learn the fundamentals of programming and the concepts every other mainstream language will look pretty much the same, of course some of them will have differences big or small but most of the concepts carry over. After learning JavaScript and solving a bunch of problems with it I then noticed that I can easily learn whatever I want now, I had no issues using C++ in college because I already knew the core concepts they were just a bit more low-level.",

It’s hard to see what’s actually going on and fair it was more frequent towards the end of summer but it’s still not great. Having someone physically beside you where you can see and more freely chat about what’s going on would be a lot better. \n\nA lot of the internships advertised around me are hybrid, 2 days in the office and 3 remote. They’re advertised exclusively to college student going to Uni in my city (supporting the local Uni’s). So while there is competition for them it’s a much better chance of securing something. \n\nHow I got my remote internships:\n1) I joined the local GDG group (I actually joined the 3 nearest, within a 2 hour drive) and spoke with people nearly any chance I got. Not just about coding but open conversation during intervals or asked what they thought of the talks after. \n\n2) I got lucky and met someone from the same area I’m from, I think it was at a careers event not directly tech focused. He went to school with one of my uncles 20-30 years ago and we had a brief convo about back home. \n\n3) the next time I met him I mentioned it’d be great to just see “What it’s like day to day or the general flow of what devs do? how the online meetings go? What their day is actually like?”. He takes my number and said he’d ask if I could join a meeting with them some time. He’s in management so not directly linked but sat in on some meetings. \n\n4) 2 months mass with no response and out of the blue I get a text asking if I’d like to join an update meeting. \n\n5) from there one of the devs offered to wait on the call and have a chat after. To be honest that’s all I expected to get from it and it was nice just to get that introduction. A week later he offered me some unpaid work just to get a taste of it, I jumped at the opportunity. \n\n6) that was 3 months ago and now they’re on about maybe being able to offer me a paid internship. It wouldn’t be amazing money but roughly equivalent to part time work so I could probably quit my other job and get some real experience. \n\n.\n\nIt’s not easy and I still have another job alongside Uni and the remote work currently. \n1) I’m in college 30hr per week. \n\n2) I work 20-30hr per week. \n\n3) and the internship is 16-20hr per week\n\nIt doesn’t give a lot of time off for anything else but ya the experience is invaluable right now. \n\nI’d aim for getting directly into a paid hybrid role if at all possible but ya I wouldn’t turn down the Unpaid remote work if it played out that way either. \n\nBit long of a story but hope that helps😅",

Even with 3+ years in software, revisiting CS fundamentals isn’t about re-learning the basics, it’s about connecting theory with these more mathematically heavy AI frameworks.

If you're a pleb like me, odds are you'll forget about many of those things without practical application.  \n\n\n\n\nBuilding stuff would be that application, no? \n\n\nThe knowledge you're learning now will always be freely accessible on the internet. Those recourses may even be better than your current curriculum. Your time, however, is limited. \n\n\nTry to cut back a little on the study time and allow for 30min or so of project time a day. Don't stress about perfect grades unless you...only want to pursue academia? \n\n\nYour perfect score, while impressive, is only a small aspect towards your overall growth as a programmer. Why focus *all* of your attention on that?\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nWith that said, you're already doing great and are probably farther along than I am with a fraction of the time. \n\n\nAs long as you keep your passion and curiosity, it doesn't matter how inefficient your process is or how dumb you think you are. You'll get to where you want to be in time. ",

If one of the modules becomes too big and starts having way too many that-module-specific-only functionalities, then you can take that module out from the monolith into a separate microservice.\n\nYou can have your monolith running from inside a Docker container and be maintained by Kubernetes. You do not need multiple microservices for that. \n\nMQs or Kafka are needed when you are having separate microservices/monoliths. Although, by an idea, you can set up these also between your modules within one monolith.\n\ngRPC is not always needed. It is much less needed than the other things you mentioned. You are more likely to use REST and then SOAP (with older systems).\n\nIn terms of what you should learn, then pick all but gRPC. And use MQ only when you need it. You can have your senior project running as a monolith inside a Docker container and be managed by Kubernetes and you'll do fine.\n\nThere is a good likelihood that you will be using Docker. It is a must to have. Kubernetes is also a good pick because even with older systems these can be migrated over to Kubernetes when the client is willing to put money in it. With multiple microservices/monoliths and/or multimodal monolith, you are also likely to encounter either some of the MQ tools or Kafka.

Freedom which could be abused.\n\nThe point of something like Flash is to run code from external third-party sources, which are by definition potentially untrustworthy. Abuse prevention is part of the bare minimum requirements.\n\nIf I go to a website, and a plugin automatically loads some content, and the plugin gives too much \"freedom\" to **some other developer's** code to do what it wants with **my** computer, then the plugin is not fit for purpose.\n\nModern browsers like Chrome and Firefox have put a lot of work into sandboxing HTML/JS code so that it can run *safely* even if the code is untrustworthy. Modern HTML-based webapps give just as much \"freedom\" to developers to make actual content as Flash did -- the existence of [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) is proof of this. But that freedom is kept safely within a high-quality sandbox.\n\nThe difference is in the implementation, not the overall architecture. Macromedia/Adobe *could* have put as much careful work into sandboxing as the browser developers did. And then they would have had an equally high-quality, secure system. But they didn't, and that's why their product sucked.",

Doesn't matter whether I'm installing cable from the telephone pole, cleaning toilets, coding scheduling apps for sports venues.\n\nI still love coding flash/animate/air though. Been exclusively in C# now for 4 or 5 years. My impression is that Adobe did a friggin amazing job of the rework from AS2 to AS3, but that was another nail in the coffin, because all the old AS2 programs could not be converted. I coded some things to convert from AS2 to AS3 and it was a nightmare.\n\n(C# seems to suffer from the problem AS2 had where there was not enough uniformity with web service calls and event handler delegates.)\n\nAdobe Flash through AIR did work on the iPad as an app, so it did have its little security sandbox there. It had terrible performance on the iPad 1, but it was totally fixed on the iPad 2. I made many apps with it including a 10 point touch app that was on a floor to ceiling monitor where multiple people could interact with it. A heart rate monitor app in a fitness studio with time synced looping video on 16+ iPads displaying the composite heart rates on a 70\" screen all timed with music programs that the owners made on the server.\n\nI made about $100,000 from that job. So, not good at man negotiating. I'm a trans woman and my masculine behaving first wife was the only female in the 18 piece Memphis Jazz Orchestra. She would sit on my left playing bass trombone and the amazing leader trombonist on my right. We made $25-$50 a night playing on Beale St.\n\nThat scheduling app was about a $100,000 thing too. Yes, security would have been an ongoing thing with it. That StripeJS implementation seems like it changes every 5 months and my career was certainly going in a direction where I wouldn't be around forever to maintain it. My doctors tend to retire too.\n\nAlso coded a CNC machine. Arduino, stepper motors, pump switch, scale. Used a wireless Adobe AIR tablet to calibrate and control it. Made less than $20,000 on that gig.\n\nAlso a js audio podcast recorder/editor for less than $10,000. I could never find anyone to handle the negotiating end of it. What is the trade? Where is work in the world headed? Do we need more hydro electric more than new software?Have you called your electric provider and asked them how the grid would handle increasing backflow from solar panels? I did back in like 2014.\n\nQ: Can you cook a steak with a solar panel without the grid, a battery or a flux capacitor?",

And then, just like with Apple, I got frustrated with all the subscription fees I was paying for a software that I considered to be end state mature software. Since I couldn't make money with it anymore, it became a hobby, so I became interested in actually coding a clone of Flash itself. It's certainly too much work for one person to do, but I enjoy it as a hobby activity. It keeps my mind creative and in the software engineering mindset.\n\nSo my C# WinForms projects are a blog tool with a PHP to HTML compiler and image resizing features, a picture viewing and snipping app, a camera app and a hard disc music recording app. I also have a web scraper tool I made a year ago.\n\nI had started the flash clone project a year and a half ago before I sold my house and lost the computer and code. It had an MDI (multiple document interface) like web browsers or Photoshop. Now my picture viewing tool has a paste into new app instance option and a paste in place option. There is a bug in the drag after paste in place right now and I'll get around to that in a few months.\n\nOh yeah, that clone had an action history that I coded for an unlimited undo and redo feature. First time I coded such a thing and it was working great! I used a List object and model to save the data and accessed it with LINQ. Then saved it to a file using Newtonsoft.

I got my first internship in game development right after my final year. At that time, my skillset in game dev wasn’t very strong , even though I had been learning it on my own for almost a year and had even taken a course at university.\n\n\n\nAnyway, once I was surrounded by senior developers during my internship (which later turned into a job), my skills started improving rapidly. I’m a passionate person, and having great seniors around me helped a lot. I took their mentorship seriously, never hesitated to ask questions, and treated projects personally. I often worked after hours on related stuff to improve myself.\n\n\n\nAfter just a few months, I cleared interview for another good job, not only better in terms of pay, but also because of the senior developers I got to work with. Being around skilled people and working on the same projects as they do gives you a huge jump. I even managed to handle the responsibilities of a senior with 5 years of experience who had resigned.\n\n\n\nSo in your case, I can see that you’re passionate but you just need the right environment. I realized that about myself too: I’m passionate, and I need a place that helps me grow. Even though I received another higher-paying offer, I didn’t leave, because I want to focus on building my skillset in these early years.\n\n\n\nWhen you work with brilliant people, you grow much faster , no tutorial or course can give you that. Starting from scratch alone can easily frustrate you because you don’t get that sense of achievement. Seniors usually have strong foundations, so when you learn from them, you learn the right way.",

From my understanding, this would put you in competition with people with 4-year degrees, and even the fresh grads here are facing friction.\n\n3. The general consensus I've noticed is that pre-2020, these were good, but they aren't as competitive anymore. While yes, people make it work, the tech workforce is still largely made up of 4-year degree holders.\n\n4. Again pre 2020, this was more viable. I would make the caveat that with this you can make your own luck freelancing on sites like Upwork. If you're persistent and lucky, this could pan out in the long term.\n\nIn short, optics aren't great atm for entry. If a good friend asked me what you are, my gut feeling is pescimism and feeling tired just thinking about the time it took me and people I know to break in.  \n  \nHope this helps.",

There are no perks left in this industry like how it was a decade ago. Job security is bad. Over saturated, hyper competitive. Corporatism killed it, AI killed it even further. Everyone is just making slop, everything is a scam.\n\nSomething like law is much more in demand I believe, and you can pursue all different kinds of sub-career paths in law, you can work for a corporation, the government, yourself a small firm. There is always gonna be demand. You can do actual meaningful work. I'm sure it's very difficult, more difficult than software in a way, but much more fulfilling if you do it right. Just my 2c.",

It's SUPPOSED TO hint the compiler that call elision is preferred (don't generate a function call, just instead integrate the inline function body directly into the point of the call), but the compiler absolutely does not have to honor that. Hell, even non-standard compiler extensions like `__forceinline` STILL won't guarantee call elision, simply because it's not always possible.\n\nIn practice, the compiler internally maintains a list of the two different function types, and when using heuristics to determine if a call should be elided, it will pick either a more conservative or more ambitious value. These values are always adjustable as a compiler parameter, so you could just set both of them the same, so that EVERYTHING is elided just as aggressively as everything else.\n\nYes, this implies that even normal functions ARE candidates for call elision, `inline` doesn't grant that like a special power.\n\nI should also point out that a shitload of function types are all implicitly inlined, so an `inline` decorator is strictly redundant. Template functions and methods, for example.\n\nSo why do you want an ODR exception? Because C and thus C++ do not have whole-program compilation. Every Translation Unit is an island, wholly isolated from all others. If you want the COMPILER to elide a function, then the COMPILER needs the function definition visible IN THAT TU, in order to decide whether to elide it or not, and also just to HAVE the statements that it is eliding there and then at compile time.\n\nIn order to get the function definition into every TU, you need an ODR exception.\n\nAnd suddenly templates make a hell of a lot of sense, because when you `std::vector<int>`, or whatever, you implicitly instantiate that template in every TU as a concrete type - it's compiled into object code into every object file - how else could you do that without an ODR exception? (Hint: there are ways - advanced programming techniques that also cut down compile times.)\n\n---\n\nSo normal functions are considered for call elision, too, and you can fuck with the heuristics without fucking with the source code.\n\nAlso - since C++ doesn't have whole-program compilation, that means we don't get TYPICAL Whole Program Optimization. But we DO get A version of WPO, and it's called Link-Time Optimization. It's strictly inferior. What the compiler does is it decides to bundle the compiler flags and source code in the object file. When the linker comes across these bundles, it invokes the compiler. With the linker's perspective, the compiler can decide whether to elide a call or not.\n\nSo now you don't even NEED an ODR exception to get the benefit of call elision, even across TUs.\n\nBut I can do you one better: unity builds. Basically, you configure your build system so that ALL your source files are included into ONE source file, thus making a SINGLE TU. This has the effect of putting all the source code in the same scope at once. The compiler can do a much better job at compilation, heuristics, dead code elimination, and reduction than you can get with a link step. The machine code and object code is superior to an incremental build with LTO, and less error prone. Unity builds are preferred for smaller projects ~20k LOC or less, and that number grows with faster hardware, and they're preferred for release builds, since you're always going to build a release from scratch - no cached object files. Incremental builds are ONLY useful for dev cycles on large code bases.\n\nSo this basically renders `inline` useless. For every reason you would want it, there are always better ways to leverage first. Always configure a unity build - and in 30 years I've never seen a reason not to. Do prefer to fine-tune the compiler from the configuration, not the source code - what is good for one compiler is bad for another. Let the optimizer do its job and don't assume you're smarter. If the optimizer can't figure it out, your code is more likely bad than the optimizer is dumb. Don't be hinting the compiler from the source code. YOU don't know WHAT compiler I'm using, so get outta here with that shit.\n\nOh, and we have profiler driven builds, where performance is measured from a test build and the heuristics is catered per function. At that point `inline` heuristics are irrelevant.\n\nSo the only thing we can guarantee about `inline`, the only thing we know it's good for, is an ODR exception, and so you have to ask yourself why do you want that? What technical problem are you solving for by turning off safety, that's better than being protected? So far, I've never seen a use case.\n\nIf you see `inline` in source code, you've got some developers with some dogmatic beliefs, because indeed, there was a time - in the 80s and 90s from which I hail from, that compilers and optimizers were indeed FUCKING TERRIBLE, and YOU WERE smarter than the algorithms. But that's just not the case anymore. Even new developers come up incorporating what they're being told without EVER critically thinking about it or reading about it or looking into it whatsoever.\n\nAnd yet people are attracted to C++ because they \"really care about performance\" but cannot accept that this belief in particular is dated and wrong. Yeah, dogma won't get you there.",

It's mostly about what kind of job you want.\n\nIn general:\n\n* Python -> Data Science, AI application, Web Backend, Automation\n* C#/Java -> Desktop and mobile dev, game dev, Web Backend\n* JavaScript -> WebFrontend, Mobile Frontend (Technically Web Backend, but everytime I see that, it's a mess, so... I suggest you don't)\n* C++ -> low level stuff\n* PHP -> Web Backend\n\nThere are a lot of other languages, but in my experience, those are pretty common examples. So yeah, Python is a good choice, if you are interested in one of it's applications.\n\nVideo game modding is heavily dependent on the game. You can probably, technically, mod any game you want in C... but that's beside the point. Most games have a modding API, either officially, or inofficially. Most often, those APIs are meant to be used in the same language as the game was written and/or scripted in. C++ is the most common, as most major enginges are written in C++ under the hood. C# works for Unity modding, iirc, and some smaller game engines use lua or GdScript (Godot specifically).\n\nSo, in both cases, freelancing and modding:\n\nIt's not about one language being better than all others. That's just not how it works. That's like saying \"The saw is the best tool ever!\" and then attempting to drive a nail into wood using it. If you want to do a job, there are tools that are better suited for that specific job. But, as I said above: If you really want to, you can probbaly mod any game using C (after copious and unnecessary amounts of reverse engineering), just as you COULD use C for Data Science, Web Frontends (WASM), App Development, Automation, etc. It's just not the most ergonomic tool to use, and that's understating it.\n\nEDIT: \n\nAlso, don't fall into the wrong assumption most people have, that programming languages are hard to learn. They are in fact, not. If I (or any developer with only a little experience) want to learn a new language today, it will literally take me a weekend. They all pretty much work the same, and once you understand all key concepts, you can switch langauges as you please. Sure, the tooling will be unfamiliar, and some conventions will be too, and you will take a little longer to get into a groove, and the first few weeks your code quality might suffer a little, but it's really not hard. \n\nThe reasons most people assume it's hard (I think), is because they think it will be like learning their first programming language(s). When in reality, the first langueage(s) you are learning are not hard, because languages are inherently hard to learn; It's because you are learning to program. And programming is hard. It's problem solving, a lot of theory and background knowledge. You can spend multiple lifetimes learning non stop, and still not know everything there is to know.",

I would never want to get stuck working in development for Microsoft, though, and there are some really nice languages on the JDK, like Kotlin, Scala, and Clojure, for example, so while I'm glad I did try out C# and was able to get programming surprisingly well on it in a short time using JetBrains Rider using .NET technologies, Kotlin is my primary love.\n\nI feel it was the right call for me. I work in science research, and Java or other languages that run on the JDK or Python are common choices in my line of work. I've never seen nor heard of anyone using .NET. Scientists like their Unix.",

For those not familiar with shell scripting, this course provides an overview of common Linux Shell Commands and shell scripting basics.\n\nIt sounds like it will cover the basics, but it will also go deep into using Bash as a full-fledged programming language, which is probably overkill for what you need. And, after you finish it, you will probably still be left confused about some of the Python- or application-specific commands for running different repositories, which are probably not built-in Linux commands.\n\nIf you'd like to focus on the problem that you mentioned, I'd recommend simply Googling the specific commands that you're confused with, and spending a few minutes learning about each of them.

Then came the mouse.\n\nOn a modern computer, you can open virtual terminals. You can type in them, use the mouse to select text in them, but it’s basically a text thing.\n\nInside the terminal, you are usually discussing with a shell. That is a program that takes your input and acts on it. The form you give to that input, the language, is characteristic of the shell.\n\nOn Windows, the shell today is PowerShell. You get a terminal with that by clicking on the >_ icon somewhere. You can write scripts to be executed with PowerShell, so that you can use its power without having to type everything repeatedly.\n\nOn Linux, there are a number of different shells, but most resemble the original “sh”, and “bash” is indeed one of the best known. As with PowerShell, you can write scripts, and learning to do so is quite worth the effort if you are going to study CS.\n\nYou can certainly also use bash on Windows, but I think you have to install it.\n\nI hope this helped to clear up the basics.",

In my experience, I / you're usually relying on whatever platform you're using to handle payment for you (WordPress, Shopify, etc etc.). If you're embedding HTML, you're not going to be using those built-in payment processors so you need to make sure you know what you're doing and what you implement is secure. There do seem to be some embedded payment processors out there (for example looks like Stripe and PayPal have their own flavors, which you mentioned) so could be an avenue, just do your research.\n\nIf your site is relatively small, I recommend trying to find a platform that takes care of this for you and has integration for your payment processor baked in. If it's a NSFW website, there's probably website platforms built for this purpose & have a good handle on the legal issues surrounding it.\n\nJust my 2c, I'd just research and see what you can find",

Syntax is just the tool we use to bring our solutions to life.\n\nSo, you want to build a workout routine app? Perfect. What’s the big problem here? It’s something like, “Creating a program that allows you to track your workouts and even generates workouts for you.”\n\nBut that sounds pretty overwhelming. Where do you even start?\n\nThat’s where breaking things down comes in!!!!\n\n\n1. Creating the Program\n\nAlright, now we’re getting somewhere. Fire up your IDE and create a new project folder. Maybe call it WorkoutSmart, or whatever the heck makes you happy.\n\n2. Tracking Workouts\n\nOkay, so how do we track workouts? Are we taking user input? Sure thing! Let’s build a simple flow.\n\nUser flow example:\n\n1. The user types a workout into the input field (for example, “Push-ups”) and clicks Submit.\n\n⬇️\n\n2. The workout is added to the program, either in the background for now or visually on the user interface.\n\n⬇️\n\n3. Add buttons for Sets and Reps, each with an increment counter.\n\n\n\nNice! Step two is coming together well. Push your progress to GitHub and call it a night. 💤\n\n\n3. Keeping Workouts on Refresh\n\nThe next day, you might notice something. When you refresh the page, all the workouts disappear. ☹️\n\nBingo. That’s your next problem to solve.\n\nNow it’s time to make the data persistent.\nYou might start Googling something like “how to keep data after page refresh JavaScript” and build from there.\n\nAs you gain more experience, things start to click. You’ll begin to recognize patterns and might even plan out an entire project in Notion or on paper before writing any code. The plan will change as you go, but it gives you a solid blueprint to follow.\n\nI hope that all made sense.\n\nHonestly, I think this approach is a beautiful metaphor for life itself. When things feel overwhelming or anxiety creeps in, break your problems into small, manageable pieces, and calmly tackle each one.\n\nHappy coding!",

It gives us the semantics of a `weight`. The definition of a `weight` is not itself an instance of any one particular `weight`.\n\n    class weight_extractor: std::variant<std::monostate, weight> {\n      friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &is, weight_extractor &we) {\n        if(is.tie()) {\n          *is.tie() << \"Enter a weight: \";\n        }\n\n        if(int v; is >> v) {\n          try {\n            we = weight{v};\n          } catch(const std::invalid_argument &e) {\n            is.setstate(std::ios_base::failbit);\n            if(is.exceptions() | std::ios_base::failbit) {\n              throw;\n            }\n          }\n        }\n\n        return is;\n      }\n\n      friend std::istream_iterator<weight_extractor>;\n\n      weight_extractor() noexcept = default;\n\n    public:\n      weight_extractor(const weight &) = delete;\n      weight_extractor(weight &&) = delete;\n\n      weight_extractor &operator =(const weight &) = delete;\n      weight_extractor &operator =(weight &&) = delete;\n      \n      operator weight() const { return std::get<weight>(*this); }\n    };\n\n    static_assert(sizeof(weight_extractor) == sizeof(weight));\n    static_assert(alignof(weight_extractor) == alignof(weight));\n\nThe semantics of a `weight` describes all that it can do - you can add weights, you can multiply scalars, you can insert weights into a stream. But extracting weights directly from a stream is problematic; if extraction fails, you can have an invalid weight. This extractor helper class cannot be instantiated by you directly - only the `std::istream_iterator` has access to the only valid - default, ctor.\n\nThe `weight_extractor` is an example of \"encapsulation\", aka \"complexity hiding\" - we hide the complexity of extracting and validating a `weight` behind a simple type. \"Data hiding\" is a different idiom not demonstrated here - that the class members are `private` is NOT data hiding.\n\n\n    weight operator +(weight l, const weight &r) noexcept {\n      return l += r;\n    }\n\n    int main() {\n      weight my_fat_ass(190);\n\nSee? Now we're talking about a specific `weight`, `my_fat_ass`, as opposed to anyone else's... Let's get your fat ass into the picture here, too.\n\n      if(std::input_iterator<weight_extractor> iter{std::cin}, end{}; iter != end) {\n        weight your_fat_ass = *iter;\n\nYou will likely never have to use a raw stream iterator in your life. Instead, the standard library has views, like `std::views::istream<weight_extractor>`, which itself is implemented in terms of stream iterators. You can `std::views::take` 1 or you can use `std::views::single` to get just one value.\n\n        auto a_whole_lotta_ass = my_fat_ass + your_fat_ass;\n\n        std::cout << a_whole_lotta_ass << \"lbs.\\n\";\n      }\n\n      return std::cin && std::cout << std::flush ? EXIT_SUCCESS : EXIT_FAILURE;\n    }\n\nIn C++, we don't use primitive types directly - they are there so we can describe our own types and their semantics. We make types and behaviors and implement algorithms to create a lexicon that describes our problem domain, and then we describe our solution in terms of that. An `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`.\n\nSo to address your question directly - you need to distinguish between your phone book vs. my phone book vs. any other phone book. If the whole program is to have just one phone book, you'd make it `static`, but often that is a very poor design decision.",

If you're using C++ in an object oriented way, the memory for those objects will need to be allocated somewhere.

That might initially look like taking on more backend tickets as a full stack developer but it could also mean focusing solely as a backend developer if you're on a larger team that segments work that way.\n\nIf you decide to become a backend engineer, it's unlikely that you'll forget everything you knew about frontend development.

It's kind of hard to track what is actually running in production with your current setup. You don't have any kind of versioning, immutable artifacts. You can't really roll back since you can't really be sure the build is reproducible. Your server is doing multiple things, not running stable artifacts. \n\nSo obviously your setup isn't really something that would be used in production/professional settings. But if it's enough for you that let's say once a day your server might be updated with new code assuming there is something new in the repo, the cronjob doesn't fail etc. then cronjob keeps it simple, so why not if some or none of the concerns with the setup really matter to you. \n\nI'd probably at least consider doing it properly, for experience and learning purposes if nothing else. But if that's not something you are interested in, do it quick and dirty with cron.",

Some thoughts:\n\n>a cron job that checks out the repo, say, once a day, and if there's anything new, pull and build.\n\nNot a good idea, to be honest. Deployment should be a purposeful, manual action. Automation here should be about making deployments a push-button exercise, not actually automatic. You want merges to a (often protected) master/main branch (or whatever) to kick off builds (of containers), tests, etc, but stop right before touching your actual deployment. If everything is good, you push the button. The cron job idea is a recipe for disaster in real environments.\n\n>I just want to `git pull` and `docker compose up --build` when I cut a new release.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with just doing this manually via ssh. You can script it via ssh too so that it's a one-liner. Or have a GH Actions flow do it when you manually run a flow. Usually you'd have automations (pipelines) build your images and put them in a registry, then deployment automation can pull them from there to get containers.",

That said, if this is a production project, it will eventually be a good idea to run tests before deploying and proper workflows will scale to that more easily than an ad-hoc script.\n\nI would not recommend the cron approach, because it bundles multiple changes together into a single unmonitored deploy. Usually people will either do continuous deployment, where every merged commit is automatically verified and then deployed immediately, or they will do manual deployments where post-release validation can be performed. Opinions differ, but I’m in the camp that says continuous deployment is better if you have the level of automated testing and monitoring needed to make it safe. Deploying one change at a time makes it easier to determine what caused breakage when it occurs.\n\nWith a cron job deployment you’d get the worst of both worlds. A bunch of changes would bet bundled together, making error tracing harder. You probably won’t be verifying the deployment after it occurs, because it’s on a schedule. And it won’t be immediately clear what changes are deployed or not at any given point in time, which can be very frustrating in practice.",

Basic idea is to just create a sufficient data type yourself that handles arbitrary precision, using integers.  Might just take two bigintegers and treat them as a numerator and a denominator for your bigdecimal.  Might be a questionable approach, though.  At some point your process will take years to run the higher you go, I’m guessing.  There’s a reason these things get approximated.",

        "body": "Edit: I want to be clear, a few of the best students I've ever had I've had in the last 5 years. People who will basically be revered legendary developers at some company someday. This post is not saying \"all young kids suck\", but rather explaining how so many people completely unable to do any CS work are getting degrees. They aren't slipping through the cracks, admins chiseled out a crack and swept them towards it.\n\nBy the way, those great students? To a T, all of them were eager and hard working. Not all of them were obvious geniuses - they just worked really hard on a lot of things because of the love of the craft.\n\n---\n\nCollege CS professor here.\n\nIn the last 10 years, we've seen an absurd increase in the amount of pressure put on us to just pass students by admins chasing retention and graduation statistics. I had a student who literally never showed up to either of my two classes he enrolled in a semester, never turned in a single assignment.\n\nSo I failed him. \n\nSo he filed a civil rights complaint. \n\nI then had to spend a total of roughly 60 hours defending myself from this, having meetings, collecting every email I ever had with the student and their advisors (plural), recalling dates of the two conversations we had, and rebutting outright laughably obvious lies like the student claiming that I locked them in my office and said they weren't allowed to leave until they did their work (the student didn't even know where my office was) - work that was never completed and he couldn't produce.\n\nMore than a few professors, would I relay these stories, tell me , \"just don't fight these battles, give them what they want\". Which is even more frustrating because it means when those professor students get into my class, they can't write a for loop by themselves in an advanced software design class.\n\nAlso, (noting I'm teaching faculty and not research faculty), teaching evaluation is almost entirely boiled down to student evaluations and student evaluations are negatively correlated with the difficulty of the final exam. And let me tell you, they put no effort into this analysis. They just look at in a 30 question survey, the average of one question. And my 700 person undergraduate class is treated as apples to apples to a 12-person grad level research team course. They only look at above average or below average, nothing else. So, your incentivized to make the class as easy as possible so the students give you five stars. It is the yelpification of America, and it creates the worst possible incentives. Like, my student evals can average to 4.1 out of 5, But the average for the entire department is 4.3, so therefore I'm a bad teacher. My average being brought down by a very large number of one-star reviews from shock of all shocks people failing the class.\n\nSo we've created an entire incentive structure where students seek out the easiest classes they can to get the piece of paper that says they're entitled to a job, and faculty are pushed towards making those classes as easy as possible rather than actually teaching, and anyone who bucks that trend will have an admin ride their ass at the end of every semester because their student evaluation score is .02 less than last year, and \" maybe you could try bringing cookies to class\" (serious suggestion made by someone with a six-figure salary)\n\nBasically, goodhart's law remains undefeated.",

        "body": "Part of the issue, I believe, is a lack of understanding of shifts in technology. If you’ve been working in technology for long time you’ve been exposed to lots of things, lots of languages, lots of libraries, lots of methodologies, etc. and then you zoom in on one very, admittedly simple thing like basic understandings of JS for someone who has been working in JS or any arbitrary simple thing that isn’t necessarily cross cutting between technology implementations.\n\nOn the surface that seems simple: why doesn’t this person understand this thing when they’re working in that space? In reality, you’re looking at it from a biased view. You have a huge repository of internal knowledge and experience. Meanwhile on the daily basis, they may be doing their best to understand baseline assumptions across dozens of technologies and implementations they’ve never been exposed to. Things you take for granted likely, maybe they need to deal with managing certificates, or connecting to a remote Linux system, or something else. Everyone’s going to have varied levels of exposure over their education and careers to certain things. There’s a good chance they have a *firehose* of things they’re trying to understand that they’ve never dealt with before.\n\nIn addition to that, if you’ve been in tech for say 15+ years or longer, software wasn’t a huge space the further you go back. There was a point in time in the 90s and early 00’s where pretty much everyone alive used Apache HTTPD. Fast forward today and there’s all sorts of HTTP server implementations, but during that period of time simply knowing Apaches HTTPd server in and out gave you baseline knowledge almost anywhere you went, which was learned experience, so new problems you had in that work environment could get more focus vs having to understand a layer of some service on-top of understanding the actual unique problem at the workspace (I’m just using this as an example, there are lots of domains where some almost monopolistic technology reigned supreme, and things didn’t shift that often).\n\nToday I can think of probably a dozen popular implementations out there people use, sometimes even library based services, SaaS options, so on just for HTTP hosting, all of which with all their own little idiosyncrasies and domain specific knowledge around them. Again this shift is true in many (most?) technology spaces (e.g. databases, etc.). Software variety and knowledge surrounding those popular concrete implementations has exploded.\n\nAs a result, all sorts of businesses out there are likely to use some unique mixture of “base” (to them) services “the whole world should understand.” Someone experienced these days may even struggle shifting between environments because of variation in tech. You know some things, but there’s some variety of tech you simply have to learn, in addition to doing your actual job, which isn’t accounted for, it’s just assumed you know it. It’s a very common bias in tech I’ve seen.\n\nIf you’ve also been working a long time you’re picked up a lot of these things and expanded your pool of knowledge. You’ve seen and used several database systems and services, you’ve seen and used several http servers, front end libraries, so on. You had the benefit, to some degree, of watching these things grow in popularity and catching up as they became popular. None the less, it’s not possible to know all these systems anymore due to the growth rate of tech implementations. So even experienced engineers have issues with these now.\n\nI see this bias often with people who tend to work in one or two technology spaces and have the luxury of garnering deep understanding of something. You tend to forget that things that come “simple” or should be “basic” to you aren’t inherently as simple or basic to other people. These kids have little to no experience and are jumping in a pool that doesn’t have good discrete skill specialization (software engineers should be broken up into multiple disciplines when you consider the range of knowledge assumptions, in my opinion).\n\nSo all this is to say, give the kids a break. It’s like they just finished med school and are applying for open medical speciality positions ranging from cardiologist, to neurosurgeon, to dentist, etc. and being judged as if they had “base” specialized knowledge and experience around each profession yet they have to apply to all of them just to attempt to get employed and hope for the best. It’s especially true in today’s market where you cast a wide net (they’re applying to anything and everything, they need to eat). Thankfully medicine isn’t like that or your dentist may be like “oh I usually do hearts but let’s get this root canal underway, should be similar, veins n such!” Maybe all their past experience was on embedded systems work and all of the sudden, they need money to eat, so they’re now doing their very best to do React frontend work. In software businesses do this in an attempt to reduce labor costs (there’s also practical reasons specializing doesn’t work, your specialty may be dead in a year) and because the impact usually isn’t someone’s life… it’s some not so life threatening feature or service being unavailable, so whatever. But the challenge is somewhat similar (obviously in software we’re more tolerant of failure to some degree).",

The government ([source: bls.gov](https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2025/article/fastest-growing-industry-sector.htm)) itself has been projecting over the last 15 years that software is one of the fastest growing job categories. It wasn’t big tech telling kids to code, it was everyone, and at least during the entire 2010s - and really before just the last couple of years - it was good advice. Tech was the only industry where new grads could make six figures right out of college. The comparison with biology is also dumb; I came from that industry, and while unemployment may be low, _underemployment_ is sky high. I’ve seen PhDs spend their entire careers as postdocs and lab techs making five- or (at best) low-six-figure salaries. I’m making more in tech right now than I could have dreamed of in molecular biology.\n\nOne more thing; the NYT has, ever since Cambridge Analytica, taken a stridently anti-tech narrative slant, to the point of sometimes distorting things. I’d be careful about believing anything they say about the industry.",

All the work has moved up an abstraction layer, so to speak.\n\n- There is a huge skill differential between programmers, and people were erroneously claiming that anyone who could fizzbuzz or write a select statement could get a job, even though this hasn't been true for years. You actually need to be pretty good and be ready to hit the ground running to consistently find work these days.\n\nAnyways, all the students that have graduated from CS programs or bootcamps over the past couple years, or will graduate in the near future, are preparing for jobs that no longer exist and aren't coming back. Tech will continue to flourish as a sector, but unless you are a real gold star candidate (right connections, right school, highly technically capable, etc.) the path is only going to become more bleak for individual developers, and if you're just starting in the industry, it'd be wise to get out now.",

People were being paid to write simple code that business people found magical and now the bubble has popped. At my company, we had code from mid 2010s that was something a 6 month bootcamp grad could write better, but it was done by a long time employee with a CS degree (so please don't use that as an excuse). This guy is considered a highly experienced person at our company, but he writes atrocious code. Even dumbasses were getting hired and to the business person it looked like complicated magic. A lot of bad workers got easy jobs. Sorry you missed out. That's the truth of it. Now that shit doesn't cut it and isn't even necessary with some of the low level stuff being easily automated with AI.\n\nThe problem is that you can't truly differentiate yourself from the really stupid Cs get degrees type of CS student (and with grade inflation so big now at places like Ass State University, even poor programmers can be a 4.0 grad). Everyone has the same resources and the expectations at interviews have become ridiculous. There are easier ways of making a living (trades, nursing, accounting).",

All the references were also employees who’d give glowing reviews or pretend to be managers from the companies we never worked for.\n\nThey billed at 120+ dollars an hour but, talking to the other guys, our pay ranged from 22 to 31 dollars an hour",

Where do the authors of the publication you cited in your dissertation work? Are there consortiums relevant to your specialization? What does your advisor think?\n\nIt naively sounds to me like universities, government, nonprofits, foundations, think tanks, news publications, international development, intelligence services, market research, etc. would be the sort of places an expert like you would be able to work on societal impact. Some companies have OSINT intelligence analyst types that might have some crossover. This really does sound more social science centric. I’d expect you to be publishing reports, not pushing code.\n\nIf you are looking for a more traditional computer science or developer path, you’ll probably have to reframe everything.

A couple thoughts that may help from what I’ve seen:\n\nNeed to look at companies that are solving macro problems such as smart mobility, health insurance, public utilities or even large consulting that operate at a large city/state/country scale.  \n\nThe tasks that you excel at are typically handled by “data scientists” in the research or engineering subteams of the broader product team. Most of the time it’s run through a platform like snowflake with some basic trendy algos applied and then call it a day, with little interpretation or understanding of the results.\n\nAs strange as this sounds you may want to hunt for UX Researcher roles.  If you dig into the requirements a lot of what they are asking for there is a lot of overlap and it at least is adjacent to your skill set.  \n\nOne of the hardest things, as this thread has shown, will be articulating your value.  Most hiring managers for these roles will have come up through a more vanilla CS background so having a paragraph ready about what the current state of the industry is, why it’s leading teams and products astray and how your deeper understanding makes a difference will be critical.  You are a PhD level data scientist who looks at the world through a sociology lens and that brings inherent value.\n\nLastly, the job market actually is pure ass right now.  It’s all of us and not just you.  If you have any folks from your cohort that went private sector they probably have some good advice on how to modify message for what folks are looking for now. Sadly keywords matter more than concepts in the initial stages.\n\nGood luck and you got this. Hope all this helps.",

This has happened multiple times, good feedback, good relationships, good work ethic and productivity, it’s just market shifts and the company trying to be strategic.  \n\nI had to get clear about what I wanted… and that’s stability. I started looking for opportunities in stable, but growing sectors, i stopped taking interviews with small companies or companies known for their leanness or competitive firing practices. I reached out to people at the company to know what type of culture I was signing up for. During the interviews, when they asked me what I was looking for, I told them… a stable place to grow in my skill and to develop a long-term relationship with a company.  \n\nThis may sound sexist, but I looked for companies that had a lot of women and parents on their team and good paternity leave… to me, this is a signal that the company cares about investing in people rather than the bottom line. If they’re willing to hire women (who may be out an extended period after/around pregnancy) or parents (who have stricter schedules and can’t do the 9-9 grind), they believe in investing in people rather than the short term setback of human life being inconvenient.  \n\nI looked for companies that didn’t do boom/bust hiring waves. How long have jobs been posted? How many jobs are posted? How frequently do they post? Does this company have a history of downsizing?  \n\nI think the world has definitely changed a ton since Covid.

You kinda remind me of myself, so I get how this can be disappointing, but ultimately \"I'm just an antisocial introvert\" and showing stubbornness isn't actually valid justification for being a bad colleague. Understanding that you're working with other people and how they feel can matter just as much as the work you're producing (if you're like me you'll think that sounds ridiculous, but it's just a fact unfortunately) is a big part of working on a team. You've gotta choose your battles more wisely and learn how to compromise for your own good. \n\nIt may not even be a case where you've done anything wrong in particular, but more about what you don't do, and how that makes people feel while communicating with you, ultimately that responsibility falls on you, even though if you're like me you won't think it \"should\", but it does, which is where choosing your battles more wisely comes into play.",

I wouldn't say it's your GH right away, professional experience outweighs anything you could possibly put on your GH. It might just be how you're portraying your professional experience, in which case, study up on how to write strong technical resumes. Don't just ask people to review yours and give you feedback. Actually study how to write one so *you* know what makes a good/bad resume. Give a man a fish vs. teach a man to fish.\n\nBut if you start applying, and you're getting some bites, great. You don't really need to pad your github, or pad your resume. Your current resume is working for you. Once you're in the interviewing stages it should be pretty easy to see where things are breaking down and work on improving those things. If you're not making it past HR/HM, you're probably pretty weak in behavioral interviewing. If you're not making it past technical rounds, you probably need to work on leetcode/system design. Etc.",

Maybe they haven’t gotten the PIP yet, but they see the future work drying up, and they know the stack ranking is probably coming for them next. You don’t seriously believe just because they’re extremely talented that they could never be PIPed, right? PIP is not based on merit.

PIP is based on bean counters setting quotas to meet quarterly cost cutting targets to pump the stock, without triggering the WARN Act.\n\n- Some people are genuinely, deeply unhappy at large companies, and enjoy the startup chaos.

Mental stress is no laughing matter. Just because you never experienced it does not mean it is not real.\n\nAt the most stressful time, I literally woke up at night and could not even feel my legs let alone move them for a few minutes. And that happened twice. Shits scary as f. Suddenly the world view changes and you care nothing else at all when your legs might stop functioning. Your body actually breaks down from stress itself. You tell me if money is worth losing your legs.\n\nPeople vastly underestimate how scary extreme mental stress is. I know in one of the startup talks one of the founders stated that he had a period of time in which suddenly his eyes stopped working and he had trouble seeing with his left eye from all the stress. And that's when he stopped everything because anymore stress and he would lose his left eye functionality.\n\nSo yes. People leave stressful jobs all the time. Stressful jobs can legitimately destroy your body. Just because stress is mental does not make it any different. Human body will legit break down after a longer period of extreme stress.\n\nWhen you are a college student and never actually worked these stressful jobs all you see is numbers. You have this delusional belief it's high pay or basically homeless (wtf?). That's not how reality works.\n\nYou only live your life once. Don't waste your life chasing solely money. Money is important to function in life but once you are in comfortable means of being able to provide yourself, food/healthcare/shelter/etc, then other things take priority. It's great if your job pays a lot and you enjoy it and all but that's not the case for everyone. For others, the high paying jobs are legitimately destroying their happiness. And ask yourself is this the life journey you want to take? Something you would be proud of doing looking back a decade from now?",

Everyone feels like they have a good handle on the requirements and tasks that need to be done. You have a clear map of what needs to happen, and the dimensions the code needs to be flexible in. Maybe you've even been around on enough projects to know that if you invest time upfront, you'll be set up for success later when it's a time crunch, so you might work a little more to keep everything nice and clean and documented. \n\n  \nThen, the inevitable comes. Either some requirement changes, or maybe there was a miscommunication - but whatever the case, that nice timeline and architecture you had in your head gets absolutely wrecked. All the time you spent making sure the code was flexible in X, Y, Z directions ends up just being more refactoring, and undoing to get the code into the state it needs to be in to pass unit tests, or meet requirements. Now, it's not about writing good code, you have like X time to do an assignment that should take 2-4x time. You just need to get it done ASAP and ship it. \n\n  \nSometimes you get things cleaned up, but the code looks inflexible, and like it's just duct taped together, which it usually is. Sometimes you don't even get everything cleaned up from what you thought the project was going to be. You do stuff in weird, unintuitive ways, because when you built the framework/foundation, you thought it was going in a different direction, but it's too much effort to rebuild the foundational code from scratch 70% of the way into a project without having to start from scratch.\n\n  \nBut anyway - that's usually how it happens in my experience. It's just that when you start out on a project, especially with a lot of people/teams involved what you think the project is going to be, and what it ends up being can look very different.",

My first month they had me doing BS work before i met the team and then my 2nd month they had me updating comments. This was the most chill job i ever had but i was also a jr.\n\n\\- 2nd job was big tech (mag7 company). They had me learning shit before i even started at the company. Like my manager sent me videos of the new system they were trying to integrate and asking me to watch the videos. I should've known how that was going to be the second he sent me 10 hour long videos and i hadnt even started. That job was so stressful that within month 1 it was like they wanted me to be an expert at things already as a mid-level.\n\n\\- current job is also big tech but not as big as 2nd company. They have been super chill. Like another commenter said, it took me 2 weeks to even get credentials enoguh to build and they were telling me to slow down that i should take my time before i really got into the code. 6 months in this job has been super chill but challenging tat the same time\n\n  \nedit: forgot to add. I this company is already expecting you to be a high level person, especially if you are a mid-level or below (maybe even a senior) then this job sounds like it will be stressful. At most if you were a principal i could see why because you are being paid expecting that you already know things but you dont sound like you are that far in your career.",

She actually makes it look very good. \n\nThen it linked leetcode study guides that included practice questions to better udnerstand how to code it. Honestly was a great study guide, not sure why they took it out. \n\nThe videos are still there write in youtube \"hacker rank data structures\". Here is one of them: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njTh\\_OwMljA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njTh_OwMljA) \n\nIn my opinion do not fall into the \"grind leetcode for 200 hours\". You might get a job that way, but i have found many interviewers can tell when you dont understand the problem and are just copying what similar leetcode problems did. Because they dont mind changing up the problem halfway through if they noticed you got there too quickly. They'll change one little thing in the problem and ask you to re-do it and the way you did it wont work. So there is a lot of having to understand DSA to get the job. \n\nLearn how to think outloud because that's what most of them expect. They dont care if you get it right, just how you think. Ive gotten jobs and havent gottent their questions right. \n\nAlso, tackle problems piece by piece. I have found that once i write one line of code, i am less stressed and tackle the problem better. So usually the first thing i do is tackle the base cases. Let's say I have to re-arrange an array. First line i write is \"if(array.empty())\". Then i tackle the next base case and i ahve found that once you go through it the asnwer kind of starts resolving itself as you tackle the base cases.",

Heard back from many places. LinkedIn claims I applied 28 places (many of which are the same companies like 6 on Roblox, etc). So 15 different companies for the 28 positions. + outside LinkedIn like DataDog, Coinbase.\n\nOut of the 15+2 companies, had recruiter calls from 13 companies. The 4 companies that did not reply were Roblox (sucks cause I got interview there before), Affirm (sucks cause I got interview there before), ~~MongoDB (my experience is completely irrelevant to work there)~~, Pinterest (sucks cause I got interview there before), DataDog (my experience is completely irrelevant to work there).\n\nIn my inbox, have many dozens of recruiters requesting to do an interview. Many well paying desperate firms like Carta, Decagon, Vanta, Valon, TikTok, Meta, DE Shaw, Stubhub, Lyft, Anduril, DoorDash, Ramp, Amazon, etc. And crap ton of AI grift startups/firms which constantly clog up my inbox daily.\n\nI got rejected from OpenAI at phone screen this time but I blame the interviewer. System design question was infra side when I have zero understanding of infra. Sucks because I was able to get an offer almost 2 years ago there but thought non-profit + Scam Altman == shares are worth nothing + don't want to deal with insane work hours. Who knew valuations would explode and non-profits become for-profits so easily. I thought Elon Musk would have done something there.\n\nIt's honestly very difficult from the start to even apply as senior because most jobs are not going to be on the field I work in.\n\nIn the fields I work in, I get basically 100% response rate. Since I work in the financial side, so jobs like Uber for Financial team, trading firms (absolutely 0 thoughts), etc all respond quick. Pigeonhole life :/. Honestly not interested in the WLB and have no thoughts moving to NYC when I have made my life here right now (maybe in the future).\n\nI'm sure if I spray and prayed full stack, infra, databases, etc. roles then my response rate would be garbage as well. But then again, I'm sure if I applied mid level roles for those I would get calls left and right but then why would I?\n\nAnd no. I don't bother with referrals, connections, etc. Not my thing. Never needed to. I was able to get interviews at Netflix, Google, OpenAI, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Snap, Databricks, Citadel, etc in the past without any problems anyway. Ivy League degree helps.\n\nDefinitely worse than covid era. During covid era, I essentially had 90% response rate at tech firms and near 100% response rate at non tech firms. But then again, I'm not applying for mid level roles so to be expected. Plus, I am a lazy individual who has no thoughts min-maxing my career so that plays a part as well. I've let my experience rot my skills for job market but I don't care. I value life outside work a lot.\n\n>Curious if there are any suggestions or comments on day to day learning and interview prep?\n\nJust take life chill. Don't overthink. Life is too short to stress these stuff too much.\n\nThat said, be good at Leetcode. Try to aim for 95% pass rate on coding interviews.\n\nAnd spend time on studying System Design. That's the most important once you are out of new grad.\n\n\\-\n\nUpdate: MongoDB just replied to start process. Perfect timing. LOL. But I won't be starting the process anyways.",

Granted I was not in a tech hub like Seattle is. Go to some in person events and network a bit before you commit to leaving your company. Build up a small network if you can. And as for burn out, taking time off and relaxing helps some but really therapy has been amazing for me. There are therapists that specialize in whatever types of issues you are having like work stress, adhd, isolation, etc. If you've never done therapy before and want to know more about how to get started on that just message me. I started in my second year of unemployment when really I should have signed up as soon as I quit my job, probably even before that",

I’ve had a good career so far, and it’s been fun and interesting and I’ve learned a lot (mostly interpersonal stuff and management skills), but in retrospect if I’d had a real option to continue the phd and go into   academia, I would have.

I am in a significantly more collaborative environment. The flavor of research is quite different though, but turns out I find math-circlejerk research (theory-heavy) and simple-at-scale research (experiment-heavy) equally fulfilling. There's a certain joy to pulling out a seemingly random idea in literature that, with the right clever modifications, ends up working well in practice at O(10k) GPU scale.\n\n\\- The main downside to industry, imo, is politics/drama. The AI industry is rife with them at the moment. You'll also sometimes look at what your company is releasing product-wise and question whether you're on the right side of history.\n\n\\- You definitely lose out on the mentoring/teaching aspect in industry. You will meet the occasional brilliant researcher fresh out of undergrad/masters that you can take under your wing. But it's significantly less frequent than as an actual advisor.\n\n\\- Are you sure you'll enjoy being a research professor?

I don't know about your finances, but when I was in academia, I basically didn't take regular vacations; my \"vacations\" were always tacked onto conferences and involved me blowing off one day of talks and/or staying a day longer before flying back.\n   * It is also much easier to change jobs in industry, which affords its own flexibility; I know people keep moaning about the industry job market, but it's still way easier to jump jobs than to jump institutions if you happen to hate where you're forced to live. TT positions are not a dime a dozen, and you may need to take what you can get; if you don't like the location, then you're likely gonna be shit out of luck for at least a few years. (This is assuming you don't have to do the postdoc hazing ritual that involves moving every 1-3 years.)\n   * WLB in industry is much better than in academia, and at the end of the work day, you can disengage from the work. Even if you're on-call, you don't really need to waste brainpower on it. In some ways, I feel that while I have lost some flexibility during the weekdays, my time off is much more my own. Being able to spend time guilt-free on my hobbies has improved both my physical mental well-being tremendously, which itself feels like freedom; I honestly didn't even really know how unhappy I was in academia until I left.\n   * At $400k-500k, a high savings rate, a smart investment strategy, you will have the option to retire in less than a decade, which would afford you the maximum flexibility.\n* On being able to work on what you're interested in:\n   * I won't lie. Some of the work can be **very dull**. However, as you get promoted, you'll hopefully find yourself in a position where you'll be addressing larger business questions and architecting solutions, which I have found to be relatively engaging. I mean, I don't really *care* about the subject deep-down, but I also can't say it's boring.\n   * With a CS PhD and a specialty in a hot field, you can keep applying to jobs and try to pivot to a research-focused industry position, which may be more up your alley.\n* On teaching and mentoring:\n   * Not gonna lie. I really miss teaching. Mentoring new hires doesn't scratch the same itch. With your degree, you do have the option to pick up an adjuncting gig, and I've considered it, but I'd feel bad about taking a job away from some poor sucker who actually needs it. I've thought about going back into teaching once I have enough FU money. But another option might be teaching or tutoring folks for free at local libraries if you've a mind to do it and don't mind teaching basics.\n\nI have many friends and a sibling who have remained in academia in TT or postdoctoral positions. I chat with them regularly. Academia does have its pros, but having spoken with them, I don't think I would've been happy even at a TT position. Happy to speak more, but this post is getting long, so feel free to just DM me if interested.",

Think about it you can be the engineer who gets good reviews from other Jrs. Or the engineer who gets good reviews from Jrs and Srs/Principals. Guess who is getting the promotion if they only have enough for 1 more person\n\n\\- Find out the go to people and ask them questions. Your first few months should be figuring otu the right teams to ask questions, maybe you have a mentor who helps you find those people. Once you figure it out, cut the umbilical cord yourself and just go to those teams and ask those questions. Dont go striaght to the mentor anymore so he/she can baby sit you.\n\n\\- Take as much shitty tasks as you can. If a principal is working on somethign that sounds cool, ask him for even small tasks about it. Let him know that if there is anything you can do even if it's small and tedious youll do it. You want to dip your toes in everything you can.\n\n\\- Make sure you are known by other people on other teams. One of the biggest things managers appreciate is hearing someone's name in another team that has nothing to do with you. because it says you have become a go to person for your own team. If upper management keeps hearing your name from other teams or how they went to you and you helped, that goes a long way. Basically the key is making sure your name is always mentioned when your boss has meetings with his bosses.\n\n\\- Be good at getting yourself unstuck from situations. The biggest issue Jrs have is they get stuck and just sit at their desk for 2 days and say nothing. Dont fall in that trap, you get stuck, give yourself an hour to figure it out and if you still dont have it ask even a small question. In stand up, bring it up from the start and expalin it well.\n\n\\- If you work on something learn it back and forth. You can become an unoffical SME of your part of the codebase. The larger the section you master the more irreplaceable you become.\n\n\\- Make up your own work if you have to. Find something in the code that could use refactoring but nobody had time to do it. Suggest it to your manager like \"hey i saw this in the code and i felt it could use a bit of refactoring, mind if i work on that on the side?\".\n\n\\-Dont just get good at coding, get good at leading meetings. This is probably one of the bigger ones. Because JRs tend to be in the background and wait to be told what to do. if you want to move up quickly, start making meetings and presentations to display to your teammates. One advice i got was, if you complete something ask for 10 minutes post-standup to display it to the team. Because if you want to be a senior or principal that's what they will look for.",

Since you are a junior, the expectation is that you can pick up well defined low to medium complexity work and finish it with high quality. It doesn't matter what stack you use, a lot of concepts end up converging at some point.\n\nLearn one thing really well (e.g. your team's service) and understand why it is designed that way, start coming up with proposals to improve it operationally, understand how it fits into the scope of the company (how it benefits the business and how other teams consume/use it). Get to the point where you are PoC/owner of one subject area.\n\nFrom there you can be a little bit more senior and start influencing your team's success and at some point you will be able to mentor juniors who are new to the stack.\n\nOnce you stick your nose in the right places I think FAANG HMs will start to get a sense that you can not only join but excel in that type of environment.",

It's so bad that this sub has auto-modding to keep the posts from overwhelming everything. I see FAANG-adjacent and you're using FAANG level. It's so silly. You can say Big Tech, at least that's definable. Also land of the biggest layoffs.\n\n>I also leetcode on the side for an hour a day as a long term plan for FAANG interviews.\n\nIf you apply to the 5 out of the 495 Fortune 500 companies that want you to know algorithms you'll never code on the job then okay. Else you're wasting your time. In fact, stay in your current job if you don't hate it and don't get 2% raises 2 years in a row. Moving is a risk and not being a job hopper makes you less of a hiring risk.\n\n>DSA feels like a skill I’ll need regardless and I want to be able to ace OAs / coding rounds in the future.\n\nIt is not. I'm mid-level and half my interviews have zero coding. It's talking through business challenges, tech stacks and maybe a design problem I draw on a real or virtual whiteboard. I don't know what \"OA\" is and I didn't know \"DSA\" meant when I got to this sub. I learned all data structures and algorithms I've ever needed from the classroom. My coworkers don't know what FAANG or Blind or Leetcode are. Coding tests are practical.\n\n>For those of you who’ve seen juniors rise fast:\n\nI saw one junior rise fast because he took smoke breaks with the senior manager. All of a sudden he became our manager. I saw another junior gradually move through the ranks. Stayed at the same employer for over 10 years. She was an average programmer but good at office politics and being well-liked.\n\nAll you got to be is average at coding. You can be an excellent problem solver which for me comes from work experience. You can be very well liked which is also insurance against layoffs. You can drink the company Kool-Aid and embody stockholder ideals. Like be married to your job. Those are all paths upward. Interviewing skill / soft skills carry you further the higher you go.\n\nProblem is, getting paid 20% more to work 50-55 hours a week sucks, on top being responsible for work intake and training of new hires. I had 12-15 hours of meetings a week and my manager had 30. Doesn't include 1:1 mentoring sessions.\n\nOh and promotion track is real. You will be told if you are on it. I was, once, then my manager got transferred and the replacement one didn't really like me.",

Being able to lead the UX charge to create genuine good UX for the public to access services they need, rather than designing and developing flows for \"UX\" where the true end goal is to sell products/services, has been a career shift I never knew I needed.  \n  \nI took this job when I got laid off, and had planned it as a brief stepping stone, but being here has allowed me to do a lot of good that's really needed for the public we serve, and I don't want to leave all my hard work half finished with no one to get it over the finish line.",

Generally rule of thumb is higher paying the job the worse the company culture is. However, my experience in tech and finance is there are a lot of high paying chill jobs out there its just a matter of landing in one. I am a risk quant (kinda like data sciencE) so I straddle the line of both industries.\n2. Do you have a visa problem, given the current political environment in U.S. it might be hard to get a work visa.\n3. People will talk about health care and other benefits possibly being better. These people are usually talking out of their ass and have not lived in multiple countries.  Generally health care in U.S. is through the employer and most corporate a jobs have reasonably good health insurance and often better many ways in Europe i.e. specialist visits and the like. What America's problem is the the quality of health insurance is entirely a function of where you work and what plans they offer and generally poorer people do not have access to high quality health insurance either due to it beign cross probhibitive  and for small businesses they may not offer it (for example a small restauarnt does not have to offer health insurance to their workers if they employ fewer than 50 people). What you will find in America is if you are in teh top 1/3rd you are substantially better off than anywhere in Europe or Canada, and if your in the bottom 1/3rd you are substantially worse off. The middle 1/3rd is ???. Software engineering is one of thsoe occupations where you are generally in the top 10 percent.\n4. For salaried jobs for mid career professional the normal vaction in software engineering, data science, ML would be something like 4 to 6 weeks of vacation.\n5. Atlanta is a boring city relative to London or NYC. Just keep that in mind. I've lived there.

I don't mind a doom and gloom post if it discourages people from majoring in CS when they have other aspirations.\n\nLeetCode isn't helpful applying to 495 companies in the Fortune 500. My coworkers don't even know what it is. I never got design interviews at entry level but I do now and 50% have no coding at all.\n\nIf I get a job, it's because I interviewed well. Questions went my way, I sounded smart and interested in the position and knew the tech stack and didn't need training. My personality meshed with the team culture. I would fit in. That's not usually the case.\n\nYou don't need high skill, you just need average skill. I got a job offer in banking with below 500 out of 600 on the CodeSignal exam. Was just pass/fail, over-passing did nothing. The design question with no coding, I kicked ass thanks to my past work experience in a similar situation.\n\nLuck is always a factor. I got a job once by looking in the room, seeing an equestrian picture, the interviewer said she rode horses, we talked about horse riding for 45 minutes. Hired.\n\nI got an internship because I attended Tier 1 where over 200 companies pay for a career booth to attend. Still took at least 5 interviews. I interviewed better as I gained experience.

There might be a lot of people applying to a position but that doesn't mean there is actually that much competition for said position. You're not just writing one application so on paper you're more than one person others are competing for that position. Let's take a hypothetical scenario where there are 50 people looking for a job and there are 50 positions open. Everyone applied to every position. On paper this means you are competing with 49 other people but just because you aren't the best in those 50 people doesn't mean there is no job for you. Of course this is a scenario where demand and supply is equal but even if you are the exact median, the demand would have to be more than twice the supply for you to be left out. Do your best, write a lot of applications, learn in demand skills and you'll probably be fine. Right now the market is tough but it'll (hopefully) get better soon.",

Turn resume bullets into results with numbers, keep it clean and scannable, link to a live demo and PRs. That’s what pulls you out of the pile. You’re not trying to be perfect for everyone, just undeniable for a few.\n\nFor interviews, aim for above-bar consistency, not brilliance. Do 45-60 minutes a day on a tight set of patterns until mediums feel routine, and talk through problems with a simple loop - clarify constraints, propose baseline, optimize, test - recording yourself to fix pacing and signal. For systems design, use a repeatable template and practice one scenario a day. Ditch spray-and-pray: send concise, specific cold emails to engineers and hiring managers at focused targets, reference a pain they have, share a tiny artifact or plan, ask for a quick chat, then the referral; say yes to contract-to-hire or smaller teams to get momentum.

People like to work with people they like to work with.  This is where a *lot* of tech folks get tripped up: They vastly overweight the importance of their tech skills and all but completely dismiss interpersonal relationship skills.  No one cares if you're the best coder on the team if you're an asshole.  It's often shorthanded as \"networking\" or \"soft\" skills, but really it's just about being that likable guy at the party.  You don't have to be the life of the party (probably not even a good idea), but you do need to at least be getting invited to the parties.\n\n3) Integrity matters, a *lot.*  Sell your accomplishments sure, but experienced IT folks have a very attuned bullshit meter.  Be forthright, accurate, specific, *humble.*  If you did X and Jack handled Y, don't try and BS when interviewing about how X was all you.  When you screw up, as we *all* do, step up and take responsibility before anyone even thinks to ask.  How you *respond* to failures is vastly more important than your rate of failure. -Some of my most engaging stories to pull out for interviews focus around what I did to recover from mistakes.\n\nRemember that anyone hiring you is agreeing to spending *almost half their waking hours* with you for the foreseeable future.

As a DevOps engineer you build natural buy-in by understanding the stack and making developers lives' easier and velocity faster.\n\nMy particular company is a dinosaur in tech years (been around since the 70s in some form or another -- 5+ name changes over the decades). We are a tech company, and yet we're relatively unknown. There are people that have been here 30-40 years. There are still moments where it's difficult to break old patterns of monoliths and shared dev environments. Tools like Git and Docker are sometimes difficult to get them to use properly -- while Cloud lives and breathes containers, I introduced them to Dev just 5 years ago. Dev only just moved to git around that same time (from SVN and before that MKS).\n\nThese days transformation is key. We're seeing the transformation with AI, now anyone can be an SWE or DevOps engineer. Real SWEs are problem solvers and evolve and adapt to the problem to be solved.",

If so then tasks should stop being assigned to you or broken up and better redistributed.\n\nIn terms of moving to a new framework you need to make sure you actually know the underlying programming language first.  As they are not quick switch to another one type setups.  Are you good at Java, Python, Go, etc? if not put that time in to learn it.  You should always keep a few in your belt so you can roll out if needed.  Your understanding of integration is probably great, but you will need to ramp up on the language, frameworks, workflows, etc. and you'll be good to go.\n\nEither way if you feel that feeling and are not progressing in your career it is time to look at new things.",

I think I've seen this question just about once per month, every month, for all 10 years, and I think I posted it myself 10  years ago.\n\nThe answer is: nobody knows. However, I can say that today, every Salesforce developer I know has no problem getting a job, even in this shitty job market. When Google lays off 1,000 people from their engineering teams, 998 of them are software engineers and 2 of them are salesforce developers. You're competing with the 2, not the 998 that everyone else is competing with. Those 998 do not want to go anywhere near Salesforce, they see it as a downgrade that is below them.\n\nAdditionally, the Salesforce development talent in India / overseas is notoriously horrible and you'll interview literally 100 people before you find one that isn't a net negative for your business, so there's not much overseas happening (also, Sales people want to talk to onshore, english-speaking Salesforce developers, they don't want to be talking to Indian developers at 2am). AI models are really mediocre with Salesforce concepts because Salesforce codebases are very rarely public and are not often represented in training data, so AI is not a big job risk either. Salesforce themselves can't even produce good AI tools for their own product. \n\nBut again, nobody knows, that's the reality. Salesforce *could* go poof and disappear somehow.",

I got the LEO idea from reading a post on here about a guy who went on a ride-along and quit his tech job because he loved it. Haven't completely ruled it out, I might go on a ride-along next year if I'm still unemployed.  \n  \nAlso thought about various masters degrees- therapist / counselor, physical therapist, law school (maybe patent law). The debt from those is a deterrent for now. \n\nTeaching math keeps coming up- maybe next year I'll try shadowing a teacher and then try subbing and go from there if I like it. Pay's shit which sucks but there is a pension. \n\nTattooing, I have friends who do it, but the social media self marketing doesn't appeal to me and I'd need to dust off my drawing skills big time. The hustle involved as well as the learning curve are daunting but it seems like a really fun job. \n\nTrades are meh. I used to do them and I'm physically a little beat up. Worst case scenario I could probably pick up some carpentry work but I'm not excited about it because I know my back and knees will be killing me. \n\n  \nIdeally I'll land a swe role or some kind of analyst / data position. I've been applying for everything i can find but my god it's tough as hell to find entry level swe work right now.",

FEED, as I understand it, is simply a very thorough form of project planning done prior to beginning implementation/providing a quote. It's not *specific* to those things you listed. Those were just examples. \"Project Scope\" is the important bit of that section, along with timeline, quotes, project organization, etc.\n\nEspecially if the company you applied to builds things for customers, and bids on projects, rather than building/running their own product, it seems pretty reasonable that they would be legitimately doing FEED, and the SWE's would be heavily involved since it's a software project they're planning/selling.\n\nI have 12 YOE, and I don't recall ever hearing that acronym before... but there's lots of acronyms I haven't heard of. There is a ton of variety in the industry. After looking up what FEED is, I can safely say I've never been involved in such a rigid and thorough project planning stage. I've worked mostly in agile shops where we're fast and loose with timelines, planning, and costs. Joining a company where their planning stage can potentially last months, *or years*, would certainly be a new experience to me. So it's good that they made it clear on the job posting that that's the project planning methodology they follow, because that's a pretty major culture indicator.",

Most fin-techs operate more like tech companies, but as they've grown they are starting to build out some of those risk and compliance functions. Some of them act as vendors to banks and are effected by bank regulations due to having to provide turn key solutions, so they are effected by model risk functions. For that reason they are familiar with banking background and more likely to also employ people from the banking space.\n\nAlso as someone whose been in quant model development at large banks, its very common to exit from mid-tier banks into Big Tech. You just need to brand yourself more in the tech lingo and bank acts. Certain banks wear the tech company cosplay like capital one and its relatively easy to move from those places. I've seen people of all levels move from banking to tech from model validation or quantitative model development, usually in some kind of data science role.\n\nI also think some of this is how you sell your self. I mean lets be real what is teh difference between model risk and AI risk conceptually?",

You are willing to leave the company if they force you to do so...\n\nSecond, you can accept the QA work but start asking around on that team like do people actually move into dev roles or onto other teams? If the answer is no, then chances are you’ll be stuck in QA. At the same time, make it super clear to your manager, like every other meeting, what your career goal is (to become a dev). Don’t let them forget.\n\nI went through something similar myself. I was hired as a new grad software developer, but they threw me on a IT support team where the tasks were just SQL ticket work. I told them no, I was hired as a developer. My manager was mad, my lead was mad, leadership was mad, I honestly thought they’d fire me. Eventually I found a frontend role on another team, and they let me switch, but it was pure luck.\n\nThen it happened again because I wanted to do backend or at least full stack work. So I started telling my manager I could handle and i know backend too. For a few months, I worked 11–12 hours a day, but telling my manager that i finshed my frontend tasks in 6, and then asked for backend tasks. Slowly, they let me help on a Spring Boot app, then Django, and eventually they trusted me to do backend and fullstack work\n\nSo yeah… if you’re not planning to just straight up tell them no, then you’ll have to do the QA work for now...because a job is a job...but still keep asking for dev work whenever you can (and continuing looking for outside opportunities)",

For banks and insurance companies, look up their local branches or regional offices and find the IT managers on LinkedIn - they're usually more responsive than corporate recruiters. Credit unions are actually goldmines for this stuff, way less bureaucratic than big banks and they're always looking for people who can modernize their systems. Manufacturing companies are another sleeper hit, especially if you can stomach learning some legacy systems - places like John Deere, Caterpillar, even local manufacturing firms need people who can bridge the gap between old school operations and modern tech. The key is positioning yourself as someone who can work with existing infrastructure rather than someone who wants to tear it all down and rebuild it. Also don't sleep on government contractors - they move slow but once you're in the ecosystem it's pretty stable. For getting past the portals, try reaching out to people with titles like \"IT Manager\" or \"Systems Administrator\" at these companies, they're usually buried in work and would love to have someone competent join their team. The certification thing depends on what you want to do but honestly your startup experience is probably more valuable than any cert, you just need to frame it right.",

Most companies out there hire SWE's. People working at those companies, even if they aren't SWE's, can refer you to a SWE position.\n\nReferrals aren't insta-job tickets. That's why they still give you technical interviews. Referrals are *character references*. It's somebody the company already likes, saying another person isn't crazy and will be a good fit for the company. That's a *huge* benefit for the company over hiring a rando off the street.",

Entering into business partnership is like a marriage, and there is a non-trivial chance that the friendship will end if things with the company go sideways (which they likely will given startup failure rates) \n2. Do you care about the equity? Usually if you get 200k+ in base salary, you’re not going to get the kind of equity you would if you started for minimum wage and lived off ramen for a year. Even in the best case exit, the equity may not be life-changing unless your friend is naive enough to give you both generous salary and generous equity \n3. Are you willing to devote your entire life to this project for at least a year? Six months isn’t enough to get anything done, and being a founding engineer is all-consuming. I did it as a young man, but after I got married, I started turning down early-stage startup roles because I can’t afford to make work my entire life \n\nIf you’re ok with the downsides that come with all of these questions, then yeah, take a risk and do it!",

Some basic functions will be the front page, inventory page, how you do filtering, sorting, etc. How do you build login page for users, authentication, etc.\n\nWith the help of AI I think you can do that under an hour, but here's the thing: You have to understand what's your code is doing, because people will drill you about that in your interview. \n\nNow you can do all of that through a public repo, where you can create pull requests, write tests, setup CI to run tests if possible, and deploy them to a public site where others can see it.\n\nI guarantee if you can do that, the chance of getting an interview is significantly higher",

He said we are not looking for programmers, we want IT customer service but I will write your name down and get back to you as soon as we need programmers. \n\nNo way of knowing for sure why they passed, it might be something totally unrelated, maybe you were giving off bad vibes, but here it sounds fairly straightforward: the job was IT customer service, and you said you wanted to do programming. You also seem to have given off mixed messages: \"I don't know what I want to do, except I sort of do, but I also don't really care.\"\n\nWhat you do instead: you figure out what the recruiter wants to hear, and match that unless it's a complete lie or dealbreaker. If the recruiter wants someone to do customer service, and you're open to whatever, then you tell them you also want to do customer service listing XYZ reasons. If you have a slight preference for programming but are OK with customer service, you tell them you want to do customer service, with the understanding that that's what you're signing up for. If you don't really want to do customer service but will do it if you have to, you still tell them you want to do customer service, leaving out the \"because I have to\" part. If you absolutely don't want to do customer service, then the role wasn't a fit anyway.\n\nBased on this post it sounds like you might have missed some signs that the recruiter wanted to hear customer service stuff, and you could probably have pushed for more details on the job, if only to stall for time.",

When I've applied to companies, the initial outreach is always an email from an HR person asking to setup a call with me. Just calling me out of the blue would be crazy.\n\nThe only unsolicited calls I've ever gotten are from random 3rd party recruiters that are spray & praying phone calls in the hopes that someone bites. Same as they do with emails. I don't bother with 3rd party recruiters at all, I don't answer phone numbers I don't know, unless they're calling specifically around the time I already have a scheduled interview at.\n\nSo that's who I would assume you were talking to. A 3rd party recruiter that didn't have a single specific job they were calling you about, or that you had applied to. You didn't miss out on getting hired, you just missed out on getting picked up by a 3rd party recruiter.\n\nBut to directly answer your question, it wouldn't be unusual or rude at all to immediately ask: \"Hi! Thanks for reaching out. I don't recall having a call scheduled for right now, could you remind me who you are?\".\n\nAs for a mistake... I don't think you made a mistake per se. You were just honest about your preference for programming over IT customer service, even though you said \"both\" your preference was still clear.

Surely I'm going to fail, surely I'm only in that position by mistake, surely its a matter of time until I'm found out.\n\nBut time and time again, I nail it, and I get nothing but praise.\n\nSo why would this time be any different?

Work visa abuse doesn't help.\n\nThe way it works these days is over 100 CS majors apply for every entry level CS job the day it's posted. Lazy HR filters by degree to get some sane amount to read. Math major, you get filtered out. The most important thing for your resume is CS work experience through an internship or co-op. Those are arguably even more competitive and again you'll get filtered out.\n\nI'm not saying CS job is impossible but you can read all the doom and gloom threads you want here of CS majors applying to 500-1000 jobs and not getting a single offer. Before CS was overcrowded, I had a coworker in consulting with a PhD in Math. I think consulting is your only feasible way in and still difficult.\n\nMath doesn't have a lot jobs sorry to say. What jobs you do qualify for, there's a more relevant degree that takes priority. Analyst jobs like CS and engineering degrees. You could be an actuary.\n\nIf you like practical math, see how far behind you are for electrical or computer engineering. Sometimes they're hired in CS, with computer being better. Electrical is the most math-intensive engineering degree.",
