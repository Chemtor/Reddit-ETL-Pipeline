And I'm likely to get downvoted for a practical non-theory answer, I know.\n\nBUT...\n\nData engineering and software engineering are two different disciplines, so you can only draw parallels so far. \n\nAnd within data engineering, there's a huge difference between (1) a pipeline that supports a piece of software used by millions, or on which lives (any number, small or large) might depend, and (2) a pipeline that just ensures Sally from accounts payable can see the latest invoices in her report, which she only looks at once a month anyway, and occasionally forgets to look without anything bad happening.\n\nThe same difference exists within software engineering, between that million-user piece of software and a script running on a server in a medium sized business to do something useful but not business critical, and that hasn't had a code change in 4 years. Those two things won't (or at least shouldn't) have the same amount of testing effort even if the same software engineer did both. \n\nDitto for the two data pipelines. Ultimately, testing of any sort takes time that could be spent on other things, so for a business, it needs to provide more value than it costs, or you shouldn't do it. I see people forgetting this sometimes. Nobody should do testing purely dogmatically, except perhaps for FOSS projects, and any kind of libraries, which are a very different story. \n\nAnother angle is that user-facing software typically has lots of code branches, conditionally-executed code, and complex object interactions. Data software _might_ have that too (in which case it has the same potential for testing), but it might be very simple and linear. If running a pipeline executes every line of code in the project - isn't running it an adequate test for a reasonable swathe of test conditions?",

Nobody can really disagree with that without sounding bad themselves. \n\nSo in specifics, I expect every ticket to give me an idea of how much time it's going to save someone, or how much revenue it'll bring in, or what revenue we'll lose if it's not done by a certain date, etc. If the ticket doesn't, I ask for this info via the ticketing system and it goes on hold until I have it.",

I thought you were saying that when using duckdb you had to attach to the Postgres, then write the metadata query, then use that info to write your main data query. So what I was saying was that you just attach duckdb to the Postgres db and then you can start writing queries in duckdb as if the Postgres db actually contained the data.\n\nBut yes even that might be too much for less tech savvy users. Plus other db formats that are able to read parquet files could implement the ducklake format more natively so that they are both the repository and the query planner.

Anyone who tells you they know what's going to happen in the industry over the next 5-10 years is probably wrong.  AI will be a disruptor. How significant that disruption will be and what form it takes is still very much a question mark. Turning towards more soft skills with job titles like \"Data Architect\" may insulate you somewhat from that disruption, but as I said, predicting the next few years is very difficult. \n3. If you want a masters, do it because you like the subject area and you want to learn about it. If it costs too much then get a hold of the syllabi and read the materials. As someone who hires engineers, masters degrees mean very little to me.

Here's a  couple of things that have worked for me in the past (does not always work, but you can always try)\n\n1. Making them feel the pain - when pipelines break, make it known. Send an incident report email to everyone hen it happens. As you're fixing it, give updates, even if the update is still investigating. If they ask why its taking so long, let them know about the \"right\" work we have chosen not to do, and why it is making things slower to fix. This is especially important on data that is used in highly used reports. Connect these \"best practices\" to things that they care about.\n2. Insisting on specific practices - sometimes you just need to stand your ground and say THIS IS THE WAY WE ARE DOING THINGS. This is tough to do, especially if you don't have a high position in the company, but from the sound of things, you are the only data engineer, and you are the subject matter expert on the engineering pipelines. You will most likely not be able to say to them that you'll spend a month to \"fix\" the pipelines and make sure they are following best practices, but at the very least, for newer pipelines, you can insist on a few practices. Maybe automated data quality checks and alerts.\n3. Do things that bring value. While us engineers want to take the time and effort to design things well, and to make sure things are running well, what business cares about is always value - can I get my report in time? Can I trust the data that I see? Any best practice you want to do, or introduce into your work, should always be connected to something that matters to them. There is no use in doing medallion architecture  if it means we will need to stall everything for months, without new reports, or fixing current issues. People will be more willing to go with you if they can see that what you want to do will fix issues that they care about. In this case, your lead seems to be focused on the powerBI reports - ask him, what things about the reports are bugging him? what does he think we need to fix in those reports? Can he think of things that will make it easier to build reports? Any dataset that would be commonly used? What issues in the data do they constantly see? If you can connect your practices to these items, it will increase the likelihood of them agreeing with you.\n\nFinally though, there is a limit to what you can do. I think a lot of people of this thread has basically said - time to give up, and look for a different job. And there is truth to this - sometimes people just don't know what the best thing to do is, and isn't willing to listen, even to subject matter experts. OR sometimes, they don't care about the long term, and only care about the short term. If your values don't align with theirs - leave. Find a company that cares about what you care about. You can't change everyone.",

One Dataflow Gen2 per table?! That’s rough and you are building up tech debt fast, unmaintainable pipelines, and debugging nightmares might become a way of life. The only winners here are cloud providers raking in cash for unnecessary resources.\n\n**A few thoughts:**\n\n1. **This isn’t “just” consulting.** You’ll see it in product companies too, but consulting *magnifies* the chaos. **Speed > Quality** every time. The “default tool” is often whatever the least-technical person understands, not what scales. You’re not crazy or missing anything; what you’re seeing is just bad design, period.\n2. **You** ***can*** **find real data engineering work.** Look for companies that actually value automation, code quality, and actual engineering best practices. Hint: If they use Databricks, Airflow, or even just ADF (with dynamic patterns and metadata logging), you’re more likely to find serious teams. **In interviews,** ask how they handle orchestration, monitoring, and tech debt. If they can’t answer, that’s a red flag... share how you’d do it instead and see how they respond.\n3. **With your current team:** Quantify the pain. Estimate hours lost to debugging, tech debt, slow refreshes, and cloud spend. Reference stats (e.g., Gartner: bad data/processes cost orgs \\~$13M/year). **Write it up**! Put it in an email, a slide deck, or a doc, so the business impact is clear and visible. Propose practical alternatives: dynamic pipelines, metadata logging, or just consolidating flows so you’re not maintaining 100+ separately. Sometimes, seeing wasted hours or dollars is what finally gets through to non-technical leads.\n4. **If they won’t listen?** You’ve done your best, don’t let their lack of vision drag you down. There *are* companies that do this right. Weed out the ones stuck in low-code, quick-fix hell.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* *You’re not broken, the system is.*\n* Don’t settle for shoddy, low-code “data engineering” if you love automation and code.\n* Use quantifiable pain points to make your case, but start looking for roles at companies with real data engineering maturity.\n\nIf you want to chat about specific job types or interview questions to weed out the bad fits, DM me. I’ve been there, and you can absolutely find a better situation.\n\n(And yes, as a Microsoft Partner, I’ve seen some shockingly poor Fabric implementations. The stack is fine... when it’s used *right.*)",

You'll find yourself a lot just fixing juniors problems but not solving the underlying issue. The teach a man to fish anecdote is so applicable and you'll feel less uncomfortable with them struggling. Failure is a part of learning so treat it like that for them.\n\n- Be informally formal. Imposter syndrome at your age is always rife and I too had the same issue. I ended up on a training course for working at an enterprise level and raised the same challenge with the trainer. The main learning was reading the situation and being yourself where applicable. The imposter syndrome is hard to shake but it'll get easier with time.\n\n- Most importantly, make time for yourself and your own development. You'll find yourself putting more time on others and taking a leading role. However don't forget to take your training days and learn. \n\nGood luck!",

If you can define success and measure it, you can reliably hit it. You can also quantify your success to your stakeholders and increase the trust. \n\nGood things to measure are: \n\n* SLA availability/uptime\n* MTTA/MTTR for any pipeline failures\n* reconciliation (are all records captured from point A present at point Z)\n* number of errors \n* cost\n\nif you can measure these few things, you can describe to your stakeholders the value that you add. It's really transformational to measure yourself. Even if you are consistently shit and not hitting appropriate benchmarks, you can highlight to management that you need more resources. As long as you are well meaning and semi-competent, measurement is your friend.",

Without their participation, it would be an exercise in futility, if not a tremendous waste of time, trying to find the metaphorical \"one piece\" treasure, without any knowledge of what and where it is. Debugging would also be a nightmare too. That said, often only money talks when dealing with these (cost centre type) stakeholders. Without which, things tend to be stalemated when there are insufficient carrots given.\n\nAlso being able to convince your managers to invest the time and effort to document your work and knowledge is a vital life skill. Documentation is often in short supply, and recommiting the original sin of insufficient documentation is an act of self sabotage. This also makes onboarding any new staff and creates a key man risk problem which makes leave coverage more challenging than it already is too.\n\nBottom line: Organisational management and people skills are vital.\n\nBest of luck out there.",

This usually when a DE is needed for delivering this data.\n\nComing to the engineering part. You are a DE who needs to bring that data in. You need to design the workflow, test it, deploy it, expose the data and of course maintain it. This is more or less what a typical DE does. \nNow, depending on the business, the volume of data, the stack etc data engineering might be from code less till fully open source. During the early days, a business will usually go for a managed service to set up the data platform. If the volume increases they usually switch to open source solutions(spark on emr, airflow, hive metastore, etc) for cost cutting reasons. As you understand there are cases where data engineering might involve more than data related tasks such us managing infra, setting up permissions/vpc/etc, modeling, database administration, unit testing, scripting etc. Do these tasks fall under the DE's responsibilities? Big discussion so not sure. Is it common for DE's to do these? Yes (I'd like to say it is something common but not sure either). There have been cases where I did some swe tasks like api in js.\n\nThe tasks themselves tend to be \"boring\" compared to swe since they are less \"creative\" and more \"engineering\". You are trying to build something robust and resilient so you have as less maintenance as possible. It's more puzzle solving than creating.",

I use Iceberg with Spark, Trino, Snowflake at work. Iceberg works really well with Spark, other client drivers usually are behind.\n\n5. Maintanance of small files, compaction, etc [see these docs](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/maintenance/#delete-orphan-files)\n\nI haven't used Singlestore but do not expect OLTP(or clickhouse like speeds from Iceberg.\n\nIMO its helpful to avoid vendor lock in (althought I am usually doubtful of these claims, since most vendor data can be dumped out into parquet, or some common standard).\n\nAs for time travel, its definitely helpful. I've also used SCD2 and kept fact table entries as non immutable past certain lookback time with an etl_inserted column to eseential do time travel (think processing ts column).\n\nI'd really nail down the requirements, what does time travel mean to your use case, why do you need it, any other way to easily get what you are looking for? And what is fast mean (under 10s, under subsecond) can you optimize your query to make current system faster; Iceberg will not magically make your queries faster.\n\nHope this helps, lmk if you have any questions.",

I really love their branch based development where you can tested your code with production datasets as input (fall back option) to your current dataset under development. I personally am a huge fan of their data lineage tool. Unlike other data platforms creating a pipeline or a DAG can be done in a few mins. They have thought through all these concepts way ahead and in my opinion their platform is way ahead of other solutions. Foundry had this concept of table format way before Iceberg or delta got popular. \n\nOne take away I have is if your organization needs a data platform that needs traditional data warehousing alot Foundry sucks in that area. This is a great solution for Extraction and Transformation but if your organization depends on datasets mostly for creating charts and dashboards with strict SLAs. Foundry can only be used as compute layer and then load this data back into snowflake or other data warehouses.",

Extracting data from an RDS instance\n\n2. Extracting data from an external API endpoint\n\n  \nYou have to give permissions to the orchestrator (most likely ECS task) to access the RDS instance and also secrets such as API key and RDS password. \n\nBut let us say the ETL logic lives outside (separate ECS tasks) then the orchestrator essentially only needs permissions to kickoff those tasks. The individual tasks get separate permissions to access their specific instances. This is in line with the least privilege principle often recommended for defining permissions.\n\nGiving the orchestrator too much permissions is exposing you to a lot of risk. There are some newer approaches like the ETL logic is defined in the orchestrator but the flow/task itself runs in a specific pre-defined compute which seems like a better balance. So if you do want to put it all in the orchestrator make sure you leverage such an approach.",

Right now I'm taking an entrepreneurial class that's helping me refine my pitch in my financial forecasting models and stuff like that. \n\nMy idea much like your own is that analyst team still spend a lot of time doing data prep writing connectors. I've been doing it for so long that I can pretty much do it with my eyes closed so I would love to build a system you know that's managed version controlled it's got row level security, everything is a description attached to it easy to use for anybody including non-technical people. \n\nSo far I've got one client, but they are a bit more involved it's helping me keep afloat in the meantime. They pay 5,000 usd monthly and do a lot of things manually have a lot of data sources that are pretty complicated Don't have API connector stuff like that. \n\nI've got lots of insights but no diamonds yet. At first I tried really small businesses like Mom and Pop shops around town, it was really hard to educate them and also they have no money. Some other key things I learned is that in person referrals are worth their weight in gold if someone else can sing your praises then the person that they're singing to doesn't really need to do any further validation that you will be able to solve their problems. This is hand in hand with finding complimentary businesses that might need to outsource their work. So if you can meet with as many people who do similar work they may eventually have work for you. The other thing is social media if you can manage to figure out what your customers paying points are specifically and then regularly make content around it that may produce leads for years to come. \n\nI suppose alternatively completely cold outreach has not worked for me yet. I tried messaging on LinkedIn I've tried to emailing people, mind you not in the hundreds but rather and let's say the tens. But still 0% response rate on any of that and most of the time you just get ignored. \n\nAfter a lot of talking and thinking I realized that I'm really trying to solve my own problem as an analyst for so many years. So I'm doing a micro pivot and trying to focus on helping maybe slightly technical marketing teams or analyst and scientist teams that struggle with disconnected data sources and they would like a modeled data warehouse as a service. Including all of the business metrics reports dashboards The whole works. \n\nMy pricing is pretty similar to yours, depending on the number of data sources I was thinking somewhere in the ballpark of 4,000 to $10,000 for a setup, and then a retainer feed to manage everything going forwards anywhere from you know 500 to $5,000. \n\nIf you or anyone else would be interested in talking virtually or even starting a discord or something that could be cool! \n\nMy website is DataSeed.ca, but fyi it still reflects my soft launch and hasn't been updated in a while.",

In ODesk times and the earlier days of Upwork it was way easier to find quality clients. I worked for a very large well known production studio after slogging through lower quality clients in the beginning. \n\nOnce you find clients you can start to build relationships with the good ones, and you'll start to get referrals from them to others. \n\nPricing:  \n Don't do flat pricing with new clients. Charge per hour and then once a relationship is built you can discuss flat pricing. Overall most clients think of things in terms of \"If I pay X, I get Y\". As engineers/analysts we know it doesn't work that way (bugs come up, requirements change mid-project etc.) but when you have discussions around pricing try to build in this uncertainty when you make hourly estimates. Anything longer than a 30 min intro discussion gets billed. \n\nPitfalls:  \n\\-\"I don't have a budget\" does not mean they have no budget, it means they don't have enough technical background to know what something takes and haven't done any due diligence to try to ballpark it.  \n\\-Intense technical grilling at the onset of the discussion. I've found that clients that do this are the opposite of the above client. You will never appease them because they think they've figured it all out and if you deviate from their plan they'll get upset. \n\n\\-\"Ideas\" clients. Sometimes a client will come with some vague idea of what they want. They won't be able to answer even the most basic questions because they want you to fill in the gap. Again they haven't done the due diligence to know what they need and if you contract with them they'll expect you to build their business and get mad when you don't do things that are out of scope. \n\nHope this helps.",

I think the easiest way to approach this project is to post on this subreddit, and the businessintelligence subreddit asking if anyone is willing to mentor you on building out this project, and make sure to mention what sport industry you are in.

You can do this cheaply in Azure or AWS (or any cloud provider). I recommend sticking with Azure if that’s where your organization already has its IT centre of gravity. Otherwise you’ll pay money transferring data between the two providers. \n\nBut if you reply with some additional detail about your requirements, I can help you out more. In other words: what does the team want to do with this data? What capabilities are you expected to provide on top of it?

You are interacting with Databricks and the lakehouse architecture, which many companies are still trying to implement. This means you're in a strong position to understand modern data workflows from the inside.\n\nIf you're concerned about limited learning opportunities, try exploring what surrounds your current tasks. Ask about the scheduling systems they use for ingestion, whether it's something like Airflow or another orchestration tool. Learn how they handle data quality and transformation. These areas can give you new learning opportunities without needing to change your role immediately.\n\nFor self learning, continue strengthening your Python and SQL skills. Then branch out by focusing on the tech you're already exposed to. Look deeper into Spark optimization, Delta Lake, and how Databricks operates in cloud environments. You can also study data pipeline orchestration using tools like Airflow or Prefect. Tools like dbt are also helpful for managing transformations.\n\nIf you prefer structure, try building a small personal data project. For example, collect data with Python, store it in a cloud database, process it using PySpark or Pandas, and visualize it using a dashboard tool like Streamlit or Power BI. This hands-on work will connect the dots and show you how the tools work together.\n\nThe internship you have now is just a stepping stone. You are not stuck. You’re gathering real experience and starting to understand how things fit.",

Your goal shouldn't be to be a full-blown data engineer by the end of your first internship. You need to focus firstly on executing your tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter how simple, and putting the people you're working with at ease about the quality of your work. This will encourage them to give you larger and more complex tasks which will increase your rate of learning more than requesting exposure to X or Y tool. Also take every opportunity to ask your seniors the why and how questions of the tools they're using. Patience and baby steps, knowledge will come to you before you realize you have it.",

You would be surprised to hear the number of times when different teams disagreed on the definition of a subscription or what a logged in user is. After you have the definitions locked down you can set up a classic 3 layer structure: raw, cleaned/merged and marts. Depending on your situation you might not need the middle layer, but i found that it helps to standardise the data and denormalise it where necessary.",

My company has DEs who do nothing but manage Kafka infrastructure, and there are others who are doing almost exclusively dbt modeling. The learning paths for those roles are completely different. I'll assume you want something more general.\n\nIf you have a passion project and time, it's a little easier to build out a coherent training plan, since you have something concrete to work toward. For example, if you're really into sportsball, you can find a place to get sportsball data, extract it on some cadence, transform it, maybe do some simple ML on it, and then visualize the whole thing. That gets you:\n\n1. Extraction patterns. This can be DIY Python scripts or an ETL tool like dlt or Airbyte\n2. Scheduling and orchestration. Maybe it's as simple as cron jobs, or maybe you'll stand up Dagster or Airflow\n3. Database management. You can probably comfortably do everything in DuckDB, but if you want to get fancy, you can use a single-node Spark cluster to write out to Iceberg or some other table format\n4. Data modeling. Your data may have quality issues or just isn't structured in a way that's easy to work with, and you can learn about patterns like dimensional modeling and Data Vault. You can also pick up a transform tool like dbt or SQLMesh\n5. Optional: you can do some (simple) ML with keras / Tensorflow or PyTorch. Think simple classification or prediction\n6. Visualization. Make a dashboard. There are a billion tools out there, both OSS and proprietary: Power BI, Tableau, Looker Studio, Lightdash, or Superset are just a few. Pick one and make a dashboard to help you understand the data you've extracted and transformed\n7. Optional: A lot of this stuff can be managed either via cloud resources or locally-run via containers. There's a lot of opportunity to learn about cloud infra, IAC, and CI / CD",

That's obviously a bit different since you specify it separately, so I suppose the lineage is 'manual' in that case.\n\nThe workflow tooling has some advantages. You can specify which clusters to use for which steps, so you can keep a cluster live throughout the process for faster job startups, or switch clusters if some steps need specialised settings or need to be larger.\n\nObviously you don't have that with just Spark, but essentially any orchestrating job runner could work.\n\nYou can mix DBT in with python functions for python models. Those can specify their model dependencies within the function, and other sql models can reference the python module. I believe there are some more hoops to jump through in specifying the model in yaml and needing to set up your spark session to be passed in, so it might take some work to figure that out.\n\nThen things like Airflow, Dagster, or more classic things like Ctrl-M can be set up to orchestrate things, or in Azure ADF can do it if it isn't too large. I believe they all have a similar limitation that you can't just ask for \"things leading to this\" or \"things following this\" or both, you just have a set pipeline to run.\n\nYou can also do a very basic one yourself. If you have a function that runs some data process you can create decorators to specify dependencies, then as long as you `import` the module with those decorated functions you'll have a full dependency tree and can automatically execute what you need. You could find all dependencies leading into some data process function, so they are all refreshed, or run a data process function and update everything that follows from it. The functions to map all that out, but it is a pretty general dependencies problem so an LLM will likely have something to get you started.",

I'd recommend only building the environment in the image and don't bake the code into the image directly. Use a volume (or bind) mount or a side car to expose your code to the container at runtime. Something like git-sync makes this easy but there are a lot of different ways to handle it. Now your version updates to the base image decreases substantiality, reducing build time and storage costs. It becomes much more practical to store many versions of the image. \n\nThis has other benefits as well. Want to upgrade one pipeline to a new version? Just pin a new image version to the job. Testing becomes significantly easier by disconnecting the two pieces.  \n\nGood advice when running in production is never rely on the 'latest' tag, always pin your dependencies. That goes for images as well as Python packages. \n\ntl;dr - Mount code to an image, don't build a new one every time. Pin your dependencies",

Your image should behave exactly the same way regardless of what server it runs on, that's the entire point of containers. \n\nThis does differ from the approach you would take if you were building something like an API or a Django web app. In that case rebuild the image every time, for a lot of different reasons you wouldn't volume mount code in this case.\n\nFor data pipelines there really isn't a good reason to do so. Build your python environment and install your required libraries as part of the image. Your pipeline code should not be responsible for managing its environment. \n\nYou very much can put the code directly in the image and it is perfectly acceptable to do so. You'll just be building images extremely frequently and be storing a lot of them. If you are using cloud storage or Vms to build the costs add up at scale. At the very least though make sure you have an image per pipeline. You don't want to fall into the trap of needing to test every pipeline if you want to upgrade your image in any way. \n\nHow you accomplish this can vary. Are you running on bare metal, k8s, some kind of runner? For example running in k8s using airflow as a scheduler kick off jobs from a yaml file. The yaml includes image tag, version, command to execute, some inputs or outputs depending on the pipeline. Git-sync container runs as an init container to grab the code and your image executes the desired pipeline. This makes the development cycle short and keeps testing easy. Need to run an old version, provide a tag or a sha to git sync to reference from instead of HEAD.",

If that is the case,  the big vendors are willing to pony up money to finance a core group of developers to maintain and support the system.

You'd need to do the overlap joins then, but you'd only need to pull in the `starts_at` for each table where there's an overlap.\n\nIf you have dbt macros, or can use jinja templates to help build the sql for you, or you're using a dataframe library, you should be able to make something adaptable to multiple tables being included.\n\nThe benefit is you'll still get the full grain of every change across all tables, and you won't have to create dummy entries for periods where nothing changes, and you still get to use equijoins out to the original dims when using the table.

Vendor tracks for Collibra, Informatica, or Microsoft Purview can pay off fast when your projects already use those tools. Mix the classroom work with a small home lab on a free Snowflake or Databricks tier and you will have real proof that you can turn policy into practice.",

Postgres is great and all but there’s no reason to do extract/load that you don’t need to, and if you’re licensed for MSSQL then use it!\n\nHaving an intermediate layer means another tool chain. What would you use? I tried dlt for that and it can’t properly handle MSSQL sources or designations; its reader library fails on large column types and the writer library writes everything as varchar rather than nvarchar! I ended up rolling my own (for MSSQL to MSSQL). \n\nBut also for performance tuning and investigation tooling wise, MSSQL has it all. I’d keep it all in there. \n\nI haven’t used dbt but I’ve been trialing sqlmesh which is a kind of successor to it. It’s good at managing nested views on top of data and materialising it, and I’m contributing a patch to make it run better on MSSQL also for my own purposes.\n\nTo expand on that, sqlmesh works perfectly for all of the MSSQL data types I’ve thrown at it so far. Because you aren’t moving data through it and just managing views, that’s all it needs to do, and so in that case it’s great.\n\nIt reads in your source tables and data types. You create your views and it understands what output types should be there, even in views that reference views too, and creates the output heaps to dump into with all of the right data types (they say you should explicitly declare them but I don’t want to and it seems to work without it, so why would I? that’s the whole point…).\n\nSo there’s no repetition of basic data type information or table management. Just write your views and go.\n\nMy patch is around improving the way it does its merge for incremental updates to the views. But also the output tables it creates are just heaps, there are ways to add indexes after the fact though and even in an automatic kind of way, it’s just not as intuitive as it could be. Still, it works!\n\nSo yeah I’d keep it all in MSSQL but also if you’re mostly interested in materialising views I’d probably at least try sqlmesh before fully committing to dbt. Just in case it’s a better fit for you.",

Do not enrich with fields specific to one domain or subprocess because now you add the overhead of having to know which fields have to be filtered out for downstream consumption. If for example your sign up date is an attribute that is relevant to the whole enterprise it would be a good candidate for a customer field. If it describes a specific sign up for a newsletter that is relevant to marketing it might be better suited to keep those sign ups separate. Maybe create a signup table that references the customer id so it can be reused across different business processes and is easily understood.\n\nIn the end it is more about the approach itself. A few fields here or there wont break your architecture but once you have super wide tables because people keep adding columns to defined tables the madness starts.

Imagine being out of work and then applying, that would be even more stressful, so I counted that as a plus too. At work I was just managing and making sure that nobody knew about my job hunt, made sure I was doing just enough. I targeted roles at specific companies and even reached out to recruiters directly, saying in a few lines how well I can fit into the role. By some miracle I got two calls. I was able to convert one. Didn’t have to lower my comp from the current too, however, I did lower my expectations a bit after a while. It was tough and looking back the journey was hard, stressful and brutal. But trust in yourself and your process. Talk to people and eventually you will get there.",

My pay is the highest I've seen for a DE and in 3 years have not encountered any offer higher. 174k (fte) and not located in CA or NY. I got offered a promotion a couple months ago, but denied it. If money is your goal, there are many other better ways of getting it than slaving for a company that dangles carrots. \n\nI've been where you are and the way you talk about your debacle reminds me a lot of myself 7 years ago. I don't know any companies taking in DEs at my current rate, but there are still very good paying roles if you're patient and persistent. Even in today's job market. There are consulting firms that want your Databricks skillset.\n\nAlso, never take the counter offer.",

Learned the specific operators which were used in that project itself and some bare minimum basic infra things.\nThe project was of Data Migration of Data Warehouse from on prem Teradata to GCP Big Query. So learned a bit Biq Query as well.\n\nNow coming to your question when I went out again for Interviews every one was expecting Spark as a must so learned that too from a guy call Manish on youtube.\nThis process helped me get 4 offers after working for 2.5 years in that company. \n\nIn short all you need to do is study the above tech stack and tell the interviewer that you have worked on xyz project on DE. With less thn 3 years of Exp they wont be expecting too much\nAnd the most important thing of all do some hard core Sql as part of preperation. \n4 5 months is the correct estimation. \nBest of luck 👍 ✨️",

This greatly reduces cost of cloud computing, but still allows you to take advantage of certain cloud native tooling, such as Power BI connection to database without gateway middleware. There are also some advantages on the data security side of things. I would not be surprised to see more companies approach data infrastructure this way in the future, as we see cloud computing cost skyrocketing, and a mass emigration from the cloud.\n\nOther than allowing for half the data infrastructure on prem and the other half in the cloud, I can’t see why anyone would implement this approach on a strictly cloud based environment. Generally, OLAP based systems are faster and more efficient at data transformations than OLTP, so you might not be getting any cost advantages. You are also managing yet another pipeline, and likely need another DBT project implemented with incremental models. This approach also reduces visibility and traceability of your pipelines, and complicates CI/CD. \n\nThere are plenty of reasons NOT to do this. I would not recommend this approach unless you have some convincing reason to do so.",

I'm still a bit lost on how you're using both Power Automate and Service Bus. If you need low-latency, I don't think a data warehouse with reverse ETL is going to be a good solution. My guess is that if you have decent data volume and velocity, it's going to get costly pretty fast. If your message bus isn't getting you quite what you want, you could always look at Event Hub or Confluent for managed Kafka. Either way, you're looking at some amount of custom code to read / write data to / from your queues / topics.\n\n>Alternatively, the option of Microsoft Fabric to try to keep things within Microsoft / Azure, despite my many hangups with trusting it lol.\n\nI have literally never read anything positive about Fabric.\n\n>Trying to use FOSS tools to build our own stack, (difficult, we're a small team)\n\nI think your team is too small to take this approach, but it depends on your company's cost sensitivity. Some have the mindset that it's \"cheaper\" to avoid vendors and have engineers build everything in-house; in my experience, that math only works if you discount labor costs at 100%. You will certainly have some custom tooling and processes, but make sure that you're getting good value: the commodity solution is very expensive, or you can build and maintain a solution with minimal resources.\n\nIt still sounds like you want a data warehouse for reporting. Snowflake is a fine choice in Azure, though you could also look at BigQuery Omni. You may want to look into ClickHouse, since it's got a realtime / time series angle. My hunch is that this still won't satisfy your systems integration requirement, but I'm not familiar enough with ClickHouse to say definitively.\n\nIf your data is relatively small, I'd at least look at a recent feature from DuckDB: [https://duckdb.org/2025/05/27/ducklake.html](https://duckdb.org/2025/05/27/ducklake.html) This goes against my advice to do things in-house (although MotherDuck may offer this in a managed solution soon), but if you're not processing multi-TB datasets, DuckDB is very attractive in terms of pricing vs. traditional distributed warehouses.\n\nGood luck!",

So one job is moving that into a more robust ETL/ELT/sync solution.\n\nThe second problem is ingesting data for analysis is difficult. Right now, the reports that are ran directly on the web database have to be refreshed manually after opening an SSH tunnel (the DA opens it through PuTTY right now). Instead, I want to have this data pulled into a more accessible place. The data from D365 and our other tools would also benefit from being in here, as we'd be able to leverage something like ELT to transform these datasets into something easily useable for PBI reports or synchronising with each other.\n\nSo, the problems I'm looking to solve are to find a good place to centrally store our data for reporting / analysis, and to then find a good way (not Power Automate!!!) to move that data there.\n\n> How many data sources are you trying to sync? I'm still a bit lost on how you're using both Power Automate and Service Bus.\n\nMain 2 datasets are MySQL are D365. This is through power automate. When one makes a change, it gets put into a service bus to be processed.\n\nAdditional sources are:\n\nExternal API from a similar org that uses Power Automate to pull into D365. This runs on a schedule. Every change made then syncs real-time with MySQL.\n\nSeries of spreadsheets from another service we use for raising tenders (it's complicated). These are processed by Power Automate on a manual basis, pushed into D365 which then synchronises realtime with MySQL.\n\nMailChimp also synchronises here, pulling data from I believe oth MySQL and D365. We're apparently contacting our D365 vendor about a quote for having this data more closely married with D365.\n\n> If you need low-latency, I don't think a data warehouse with reverse ETL is going to be a good solution. My guess is that if you have decent data volume and velocity, it's going to get costly pretty fast.

Either way, you're looking at some amount of custom code to read / write data to / from your queues / topics.\n\nGot it. I've heard about Kafka, the other two will probably be similar enough. Custom code is something to consider.\n\nGenerally, I think the real-time requirement is one that causes more problems than solutions. Changing an accounts name on CRM might be nice to have immediately show up on the website, but I've found achieving that so far is difficult and time consuming.\n\n> I have literally never read anything positive about Fabric.\n\nLmao, me neither. The only benefit I see is it makes setting something up a little bit easier.\n\n> I think your team is too small to take this approach, but it depends on your company's cost sensitivity.

Hiring an external vendor to build something is gonna be costly/ difficult to get to pass, but would be at least a decent idea. The vendor we use did suggest adding Data Factory to the unused Synapse instance we have, but with Synapse now being effectively discontinued I'd rather find a new solution than depend on it even more.\n\n> It still sounds like you want a data warehouse for reporting.

Main reason for a data warehouse / lake is that the main existing alternatives would be Microsoft Dataverse which isn't a great idea imo, or wrangling the Azure SQL DB that's sitting empty. A little more feasible, but wouldn't offer as good a feature set as something made for warehousing.\n\n> If your data is relatively small, I'd at least look at a recent feature from DuckDB\n\nI've heard a fair bit about DuckDB, it might be time to give it more of a look.",

It was chosen by our vendor as the way to synchronise these datasets at the time, and since then I've hated it considering I've been the one to maintain it. One of the main purposes of rethinking our DE solution is so that we (I) can stop using it.\n\n> If I was designing such a system, my choice of platform would be SSIS from the start because I know I can accomplish everything you have described and not worry about the solution not being able to handle all the additional requirements that are being added as the time goes by.\n\nSSIS is a reasonable option.

ADF designer requires network connectivity and it becomes clunky once you start to create more complex solutions.  \n\\* In SSIS you have a choice of many third-party extensions to use when developing solutions. In ADF you are completely dependent on Microsoft for connectors and new features.  \n\n\nSome people call SSIS legacy. However, the reality is SSIS is still the best ETL platform on the market and people not only continue to use it, but the use is increasing. I suspect many people are now discovering that having the ability to run SSIS both on-premises and in the cloud is a very attractive feature compared to having a solution that is cloud-only with no ability to transition back on-premises for cost reasons, for example.",

The DBA team ground to a halt so that the lead DBA could spend all their time and attention nannying the change. The analytics team ground to a halt because they wanted to manually check and manage 50+ reports and talk to all the stakeholders of those reports to find out how they wanted the reports to work with the new data. \n\n\nIn other organizations I've managed this by creating a data lake, creating pipelines and DAGs and incremental models with tests.

        "body": "I'd vote for [Malbolge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbolge), if we're counting esoteric languages. The language was designed with the express purpose of being as difficult to use as possible, going as far as requiring the source code itself to be encoded in a cypher, making it essentially impossible to read. Beyond that, it uses base 3 arithmetic, and essentially requires to use of self modifying code to accomplish most tasks.\n\nThere are very few programs written in it, with the first hello world program appearing 2 years after the language was published. And that code was not written by hand, but instead generated using a [beam search](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search) algorithm.\n\nIf we relax the \"uselessness\" requirements a bit, and focus more on languages that are simply incredibly different from the ones you've learned, there are a lot of potential candidates.\n\n[Prolog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) is a logic programming language where you basically describe the problem and the compiler finds a program that solves it (assuming it has a solution). This is a very radically different way of writing code compared to the languages you have experience with.\n\nSimilarly [Rocq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocq) (previously Coq) is an interactive theorem prover, where you wrote code that describes mathematical logic modeling something and can find formal mathematical proofs about it. It is possible to write programs and verify their correctness in Rocq as demonstrated by the [CompCert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompCert) C compiler.\n\n[Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html) is a functional programming language with algebraic effect types, which clearly define what kind of side effects (if any) a function is capable of causing.\n\n[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is an extremely powerful functional programming language with an absolute crapton of functionality that can be enabled for all sorts of advanced type level programming. As a bonus, since everyone loves to create custom operators, it's not uncommon for Haskell code to look like symbol soup with a handful of recognizable names mixed in here and there.\n\n[APL](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)) and other array languages treat everything as arrays and provide a bunch of super basic functions to manipulate them, leading to solving problems in a very different way than you might in other languages. As a bonus, APL specifically uses a bunch of custom symbols, leading to code that looks like this:\n\n    life ← {⊃1 ⍵ ∨.∧ 3 4 = +/ +⌿ ¯1 0 1 ∘.⊖ ¯1 0 1 ⌽¨ ⊂⍵}\n\nThis example implements [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in APL.\n\nYou could also try Racket, as another commenter mentioned, or any other Lisp really, as they are different enough from what you're familiar with to require learning to think differently about solving problems.\n\nThere are tons more languages in various different paradigms you could try, and they would all be valuable right now. All the languages you;be learned sit within a very tiny corner of the world of programming languages, and offer only the tiniest glimpse into the variety of languages, paradigms, and ways to think about solving various problems.\n\nWhile I respect that you aren't interested in learning something just because it's \"useful\", I think putting emphasis on the \"uselessness\" of a language is not the best way to think about this. Instead you should consider \"how different is this language from what I'm familiar with\", because the more different and alien a language feels, the harder it will be to learn, but it will also reshape how you think about solving problems.\n\nEdit: fixed APL link (at least on mobile)",

Because of that, the publishing team will promise that changes and especially breaking changes to the interface definition will not be made without notice and time for code bases using it to adapt. When you as a programmer include someone else's library, you would be advised to interact with it through defined apis. If you don't and instead use reverse engineering techniques to find and interact with other internal points like internal methods, services, or data tables, the library publisher may change these at any point without notice and you may have unexpected emergency fixes.\n\nNote that something being an api is about the stability and change notification promises not about a particular format, spec, or connection method. An api is often a set of service layer or business layer web services using rest/json or soap formatting, but it certainly does not have to be. There are UI layer apis, which are usually js, iframe, or css interaction points. There are apis that are simply methods you call when you add someone else's code to your project. There are plugin apis where you code an extension that implements a published interface and register it using a published json or xml config file. There are data layer apis which are usually sets of tables, views, and stored procs you are to use when extending a product's data model.\n\nIt's not all about web services and not every web service is an api.",

This fuels the mythology: you’re either a wizard or doomed.\n\nUnlike Python or JavaScript, you don’t get guardrails. Crashes, memory leaks, and security bugs are easy to write. Meanwhile, Rust, Go and others provide modern alternatives with safer defaults for many tasks. Python and Java are easier for most high-level work. So for hobbyists or self-learners, Python is simply a better first (or second) language. C++ is like learning calculus before arithmetic.\n\nBut C++ still does matter.  There is a ton of existing code written in C++ that needs maintaining and the language is still unmatched in performance-critical domains. And there is a lot of learning value in it.

        "body": "I'll provide a contrasting point of view since most people are trying to convince you there's nothing special about C++. I believe C++ is very problematic for newer programmers because a huge list of reasons. The general dismissive advice is to just program in the \"safe\" areas of C++, but there is no way for a beginner to know where that is.\n\nThere are basic problems right off the bat for a beginner.\n\n1. No real package management system. If you want to use libraries in C++, you'll often need to download someone's .hpp and .cpp file and figure out how to compile that into your program and use it. That directly leads into\n\n2. Compilation. No other modern language has a system as complicated as C++, you are going to struggle with your program finding your headers, things are going to compile and not link the right libraries, these words don't even make sense to beginner programmers in other languages. But of course C++ programmers have tried to solve this and that causes problem number\n\n3. Build systems, C++ has 3 popular build systems, and they don't necessarily work well with each other. You got make, cmake, autoconf and just regular writing the compiler arguments yourself. These systems are extremely complex, introduce a whole new language to learn, and are often impossible to debug. People will tell you that a newbie doesn't need to know about any of this, well they do if they want to be doing anything substantial using existing code instead of implementing every single thing themselves.\n\nSo all of that is before you get a program running, so once we've figure out how to compile code, what happens when we write code and try to learn stuff from online?\n\n4. C++ is extremely fragmented. C++ has gone through multiple incarnations, from C with Classes to C++11 to more recent versions. The way you write C++ code differs dramatically between pre and post C++11. By default the majority of the code you write based on basic examples will be considered incorrect. For example, you'd think you can generate random numbers using `rand()`. You'd be dead wrong, C++ developers do NOT suggest using `rand()` to generate random numbers, it's not guaranteed to generate a uniform distribution or numbers that are sufficiently random. People will even tell you off if you use iostream, the basic recommended way to handle input/output in every tutorial, because C++ code is supposed to be fast, and iostreams are considered slow. Basically C++ does something wrong in some initial implementation, and has to maintain that for backwards compatibility forever, so they implement a whole new different correct way to do it, but a newbie has no way to tell if they are looking at outdated and bad code or new code.\n\n5. Standards vs Compilers. Suppose you are super keen and keep up to date with new language features. You see that C++23 has some cool new feature you want to try in your own code. Well too bad, it probably hasn't been implemented yet. The standards committee are independent from the people that write the compilers. So the committee declares that the new version of the language has this new feature, and it's someone else's job to actually implement that feature into the compiler so it can actually be used in code. This is done bit by bit, so your compiler will support some C++23 features and not others. Hell, some features are in the spec and NEVER get supported. So if you're a keen beginner and see people present cool new features and code patterns you want to try, bad luck, try again in 5 years and pray that compilers have caught up.\n\n6. C++ data structures are heavily memory focused. This isn't the memory management that people usually talk about. These are the standard vector and collection types that manage the memory for you like in other languages. Except in almost every case, you interact with these objects via iterators, which dips down a level of abstraction and makes you think about memory anyway. So where in another language you might run `sort(s)`, in C++ you run `std::sort(s.begin(), s.end());`. That seems ok, until you start using references and pointers, and `sort` shifts the values in memory and you end up not pointing to what you thought you were pointing to. That's just a rookie mistake, but most algorithms do things in-place in memory and it's an easy mistake to make. On top of that you get pointer invalidation, where sometimes the automatic memory management just takes your data somewhere else and all your previously declared pointers are now pointing at nothing. The simplest way to accidentally do this is when you are using `push_back()`, when the allocated vector fills up it'll relocate somewhere else.\n\nI could go on. But the overall point is that\n\n1. Compilation and library management in C++ introduces significant complications to beginners that simply do not exist in other highly used languages.\n\n2. C++ has many conflicting ways of doing something, and there does not exist a single agreed upon set of teaching material for beginners to learn best practices.\n\n3. C++ has MANY hidden pitfalls that will cause beginners to write broken programs. Almost by default any code you write intuitively will be considered wrong in some way. The simple `for (int i = 0; i++; i < s.size()) { s[i]; }` should be written as `for (const auto& v : s) { v; }`, note the additional syntax and operators that might be unclear to beginners. Also you were meant to use `size_t` instead of `int` for the first loop, but that's almost never presented in basic teaching material.\n\nC++ has more complicated language constructs than other languages, worse developer support, has no single high-quality resource for learning, and online resources are litered with bad practice that beginners have no ability to distinguish.",

This isn't even true. The only situation where this might be a thing is where you're copying around data needlessly, but using references in C++(just like Python does by default) is an idiomatic language feature. \n\nBarring those cases, C++ code can be like 100 times faster than Python, unless you use Numpy arrays or something(which is written in C, so hardly counts as Python code).\n\n>I also understand that there's a huge responsibility in managing memory safely. \n\nYeah, except if you use smart pointers, C++ even has automatic memory management. People who say memory management in it is this super hard and difficult thing probably never heard about C++11. \n\n  \nThe language's complexity is greatly overblown, of course, but there is some merit to it. For example, template metaprogramming is functional programming, while your normal code tends to be object-oriented / imperative, so you need to learn two programming paradigms to properly program, which indeed is a lot. \n\nBut most of people's problems with the language aren't really a problem if they use the right solution.

Time to learn!  Learning what you need to make the project will be your project!\n\nBreak it down into smaller and smaller tasks until each task is small enough to be accomplished in less than a day or two.  Create an ordered list of those tasks and tackle them one at a time.  Stack up those small victories.  Create momentum and ride it.  Stuck on something and feel your momentum slowing?  Switch tasks or call for help.  Momentum is king and it's fed directly by those small victories.  Small victories eventually add up to bigger ones.  Those bigger ones eventually add up to a completed project.  This is a marathon, not a sprint.  You have to pace yourself.\n\nOnce the project is done, do an analysis of what went right and what went wrong.  Learn from your mistakes and keep doing what works.\n\nBask in your victory for a short time.  Treat yourself, you earned it.\n\nPick your next project and buckle up.  It's time to ride that train again.\n\nThe longer you go, the easier it usually gets.  If you find things are getting harder instead of easier, take a moment to step back and see why things are getting harder and how to lower the difficulty.  If you find the difficulty of the project has gone past your limits, it might be time to realize your limits and find a more manageable project.  Maybe, you got too ambitious and need to pick something easier, for now.  Maybe, what you picked just isn't realistic to begin with.  Sometimes, you have to figure these things out the hard way.  It's a learning process and, if you do it right, it never ends and you don't want it to end.\n\nAs for tools, you're pretty much the only person who knows what kind of tools you need.\n\nWhen it comes to programming, the tools you're likely to need are mostly in two categories.  There are the tools that directly impact programming and the ones for organization and tracking progress.\n\nFor programming, it's mostly about the environment; the editor, plugins and related tools.  These are usually fairly straight forward to understand.  Though, finding your preferences is a bit of a trial and error experience.  Most people are fairly happy with Visual Studio Code for the editor.  Try that and see what you like or don't like about it.  If you're happy, move on to figuring out what additional plugins and tools make it work best for you.  If not, figure out what you like and don't like about it and see if there's something that better fits your preferences or if there are plugins that fix what you don't like.\n\nFor organization and tracking progress, it becomes even more personal.  Maybe, you do it all in a series of post-it notes.  Maybe, you type it out in a bunch of plain text documents.  Maybe, you use something more sophisticated.  You're the only one who knows what work flow works for you.  There's more organizational and tracking tools out there than I could list in the 10000 character count limit.  Do some digging and find your favorites.  I'm a minimalist, so I mostly use Notepad and the occasional spreadsheet, as an example.\n\nI feel like, in the world of programming especially, searching for perfect answers is the biggest of all follies.  You don't need a perfect answer, just one that isn't wrong.  It's fine to occasionally take a moment to see if better answers exist but don't get obsessed.",

        "body": "For clarity : My answer is based on my own experience in this field, but I have formatted the response with AI for clear reading, AI will never generate knowledge like this.\n\nHey, wishing you a bright future—read to the end! No way is programming dead, trust me. The idea that AI will wipe out coders is a myth. Tools like GitHub Copilot are like having a brainy assistant—they make you faster, not replace you. Coders who skip AI might lag since it cuts problem-solving from weeks to hours. You’ll learn quicker, debug faster, and tackle big stuff, but AI needs your creativity to work. Coding’s been around forever (before you were born!) and isn’t going anywhere—it just evolves. Use AI to level up, and you’re golden. It’s totally worth jumping into in 2025. The industry needs solid coders who solve real problems. Stay curious, keep learning, and you’ll stand out, no matter how many others code.\n\nLearning paths depend on you. Self-taught is awesome but tough—you need discipline to avoid scams or getting lost. A mentor, even paid, can save you tons of time by guiding you right. Tons of top devs are self-taught, so it’s doable with grit. Bootcamps are great for fast, practical skills—3-6 months and you’re job-ready if you pick one with mentorship and job help. Check Course Report for legit ones to dodge duds. A CS degree gives deep theory for stuff like AI or systems coding and looks great to employers, but it’s pricey and takes years. You don’t always need it for jobs like web dev But remember that if you don't learn the deep theoretical stuff like systems design, algorithms, data structures, computer architectures and operating systems, and only the final technology like web development, you will reach a stage where you will not develop, and you will not move up the career ladder until you have comprehensive knowledge and experience in all aspects, not just simple technological skills like html, css, etc. Whatever path, you’ll need to self-learn, so try Coursera’s “Learn How to Learn” to master studying. Tech’s got endless free resources—use them! I’d start self-taught to test the waters, then maybe a bootcamp or degree if you’re hooked. Just know bootcamps focus on jobs and might skimp on theory like algorithms, which you’ll need.\n\nPlease do not be tempted by crash courses, all of them aim to teach you how to use the programming language only or just a basic understanding, and do not teach you deep programming concepts, the least professional course may take more than 50 hours of learning, and time is not a condition on the professionalism of the course, but for example, you will not find an in-depth algorithms course of 10 hours ...\n\nFirst, see if coding’s your thing with Harvard’s CS50 on edX—it’s free and a fun intro to programming with bits of C, Python, and JavaScript. It’s not a full course but a taste of what coding’s about. You’ll know if it clicks and get a sense of next steps. After CS50, don’t jump straight to a track like web dev—focus on building core programming skills, like algorithms, data structures and solve a lot of problems on websites like hackerrank,leetcode,codeforces, and so on... . These are the foundation of coding and crucial for any field. You can learn them while exploring a track (like web or AI) or before picking one—it’s up to you. Python’s a great first language—easy, versatile for web, AI, or data, and super in-demand. But it’s not about the language; it’s about getting loops, functions, and logic, which apply everywhere. Think of coding like swinging a hammer: easy to learn, hard to master. Start with computational thinking to grasp how computers work before diving into languages.  \nTo gain a solid foundation in your level, I suggest reading books that will develop your way of thinking. It can be read while you are studying CS50. There is a great book called Computational Thinking: A Beginner's Guide to Problem Solving and Programming by Karl Beecher. I really like it and still read it from time to time, even though I am experienced but it's really a great book.\n\nExpect bumps—coding’s all about solving problems. Don’t quit when you’re stuck; take a break, hit Google or Stack Overflow, or use AI to explain (but don’t let it solve coding challenges—that’s cheating and you learn nothing). Everyone learns differently—some pay for courses to stay motivated, others grind free stuff. Stay consistent, even 2 hours a day. You’ve got this! Finish CS50, then focus on algorithms, data structures, databases , operating systems, programming with C++ and OOP, and any programming fundamentals that didn't covered in CS50(because 8 weeks not enough to know what you should learn ) (try free resources like FreeCodeCamp or books like “grokking algorithms”). Hit us up for next steps.\n\nWhat you did was the right move, you took the initiative to ask, keep doing that when you have questions, always ask the experts and don't rely on the answers of laymen or non-specialists, not even AI, AI can help you along the way if you know what you're doing, but it may not be appropriate at all times.\n\nAnd not all paid courses are good and not all free courses are bad, I can give you advices for hours, but unfortunately that is not the way you will develop, you have a path that you must discover for yourself, what I discovered is what you will discover, but you will discover it in your own way and with your own understanding, so I said it directly to you ... You may not always be convinced, so I'm not going to give you all the advice as much as I'm going to give you what works for you at your current stage.\n\nAnd remember that not everything is clear at the beginning, meaning that I cannot give you everything from the beginning until you are an expert in the field, but this depends on you and your research, reading books and learning, I only guide you to the beginning of the road. Good luck!\n\nupdate : CS50 (also called CS50x which is the most popular course of the CS50 series) may be difficult for some students, but in some countries computer principles are taught in schools, if you don't have knowledge about it, you can watch the content of the CS50T course first and learn more about computer principles and how to use Windows and what is hardware and software.",

The idea is a set of concentric circles, like an archery target - in the middle, the bullseye, is what you, the learner, can do without any assistance, around that is the ring of **proximal development**, what you can do with guidance, and around that is all the things that you cannot do (yet).\n\nWhen learning something new it is important to start from the middle, and work your way gradually outwards - everytime you learn something, the bulls eye gets larger, and so does the ring around it, meaning that you can learn even harder stuff.\n\nAs a teacher it is important to guide the students to this zone - my students tell me that I keep them on the very outermost edge of it - but when you are learning by yourself, it is harder to plan ahead. You don't yet know how complicated something outside of that zone might be, how far away it is, and how much else you need to learn before.\n\nSo - to sort of answer your question:\n\n>So how does one bridge the gap from being a programmer who can only create a terminal CRUD to becoming a programmer that understands how to build something like a compiler?\n\nBy gradually making projects that are harder and harder, always make sure that you know how to build *most* of it, but that there's some aspects you don't yet know how to do.

Then you either build a new project, or expand on the one you already have, and learn yet more things!\n\nThe same way you'd \"bridge the gap\" from fixing a puncture on your bicycle, to being a formula one car mechanic - by learning more and more and more - and at some point taking a dedicated class, course or job in exactly that, but there's usually no straight line!",

For example, you need to know a little bit about the tax code in your region in order to write a tax preparation program.\n\nLikewise, you need to know a little bit about cars to make an automobile control system.\n\nSo if you wanted to build a compiler, you really would need to know what’s done to make them, and how they connect the hardware, and how a programming language is connected to that hardware. When you’ve learned more about that, you can build a compiler, or other things or interest",

What that really means is *you’re not standing out yet* — and maybe you’re not putting in enough work. If this is enough to discourage you, then maybe you don’t actually love or care about this enough to go all in.\n\nThink about actors — look at what age most of them got their big break versus how long they had been grinding. If you're ready to give up now, then yeah, quit — because the pressure this industry will put on you will be way worse than this.\n\nYour first dev job won’t be easy. It won’t be smooth sailing. You still have to learn how to communicate well, adapt quickly, and solve real-world problems. I used to volunteer, I used to code for free just to get experience and feedback from senior devs — some who worked at Amazon, Google, and Netflix.\n\nI’ve led teams while volunteering, participated in hackathons, and mentored people — taught them how to lead and grow. On my *days off* from working a warehouse job, I would go into coding Discord servers and help people debug their issues.\n\nI tried college — it didn’t work out because of life circumstances. Everything I know is self-taught. I couldn’t afford bootcamps, so I found free ones. I hunted down Udemy courses on sale or found ways to get them free.\n\nThere are **plenty** of ways to make money coding. Go find one. I used to be homeless, and I was still learning, still listening to lectures and podcasts, still grinding.\n\nMy first contract? Made me $300 and $7/month. My second? I built software for a company, but the staff all quit before it got deployed. I still got paid. Now? I’ve got a pending contract with a startup and I'm building a demo for someone else.\n\nI’ve been doing this for about five years now. I’ve worked with people in Canada, Africa — folks who don’t even have consistent electricity or stable internet, and they still made it work.\n\nSo I’m saying this:  \nIf you *really* want it, then you have to *work* for it. You have to grind.  \nNot for weeks. Not for months.  \n**For years.**\n\nAre you willing to do that? Shiii I was diong this homeless. But yea have to put in the work because if you don't even the people who would like to help you wont because your not helping yourslef. Networking is good as a dev because you can work on projects with devs , you can work on projects with ui/ux designers etc . They'll reach out after if they don't its fine. Even if you network with busienss people you can get work though them . Sometimes it not about being good its about communicating and getting the job done because poeple don't understand what they are looking at in terms of code they look at results .

That's exactly what I did and I don't have any certificates, college education, etc. I basically found a small web developer shop that did websites for local businesses and offered to work part-time on a contract basis and cut my teeth on developing POS and/or internet ordering systems for them, and then leveraged the experience I got working with payment processing to get a job as a junior engineer at an actual payment processor.

You usually learn that through a scientific education heavy on math, physics, etc. and an applied field.\n\nBut what you mentioned, backend and frontend, is definitely not programming but software development. I'm saying that because you sound like you are focusing on the tools and missing the bigger purpose as well as all the tasks needed before even starting creating a new source file. You and your team identify what the software needs then you build, select and piece together all the components, and sometimes you will be programming some logic or patterns here and there.\n\nI understand that you panicked and did something permanent in a temporary situation, but you could have believed that you had enough tools to assist you so that when it wasn't the time to code you should have focused on the rest of the software development lifecycle - a lot of which is about everyone preparing, reading and understanding their assignments.",

That said, I’ve found the Manager pattern can be useful in specific cases, particularly when I’m dealing with tightly coupled dependencies that I want to decouple. For example, in one of our applications, we had settings that were unfortunately intertwined with other parts of the application, like the data layer. Introducing a manager to hide those implementation details behind an abstraction allowed me to control those dependencies more easily, making it simpler to swap or adapt implementations later on.",

Your question is a \"devil's in the details\" kind of question, and it's hard to make a sweeping good or bad generalization of any and all manager classes. But if you want to approach it from the Stroustrup style, then I'd say: \\* Check that your class fields are maintaining an invariant. If they're not, then maybe this class should be a struct with plain functions. \\* Check that every method plays a role in maintaining the invariant. If one doesn't, then move it out of the class. \\* Check that every method is valid to use right after the constructor finishes. Does it make sense to invoke unload if I don't invoke load? If some method still needs more setup, then it should have its own constructor (and thus own class).\n\nStill, as always, the devil's in the details. If you can share maybe simplified example code, then we can get into the nitty-gritty.",

For this reason, if you read code and you encounter a manager class it tells you nothing about what it's doing. That's not only bad for understanding the code but also because these classes tend to attract more and more code because every logic fits into a manager class. It's the same issue with \"utils\" or \"common\" folders or files. They accumulate all the code people don't know or don't care to name or place properly. It just builds technical debt over time.\n\nThe solution is not always to split the class into several smaller ones, often times it's enough to just pick a more meaningful name.",

The best option might change over time, but currently for windsurf you can purchase their lowest tier subscription and get unlimited use from their base model. If any kind of expense is a problem, then use a normal code editor and ask a free ai service for code, like perplexity or Google or Bing.

At 15, you're not even close to starting your career, let alone getting the ball rolling enough to rely on your experience / tenure to help you settle down.\n\nFirst thing to mention (even outside of AI) is that this entire field goes through ups and down. Software development is not immune to economic downswings unless you luck out (there are some jobs out there that are more \"essential\", but not most), and we're in one right now. The current job market, plus all the AI advancements in the news, has everyone worrying about AI, but it's a scapegoat to larger issues over-hiring from Covid, interest rates, and tax laws (Section 174 being a big one).\n\nAnd in regards to AI, if software development gets to a point where a non-technical person can use AI like a \"cheap high-quality on-demand agency\", nearly every job is getting replaced. Put \"will doctors\" into Google search, the first result is likely \"will doctors be replaced by AI\".\n\nBeing concerned about AI ***right now*** is pretty ridiculous. I've not seen any major instances of \"AI replacing developers\". There have been some decent showcases of AI reducing workloads (AirBnB did some interesting work in regards to testing migration), but even those are pretty limited. In general, it helped cut out some of the mundanity with repetitive boilerplate code, and helped people who have never written code to get things started, but that's about it.\n\nBeing concerned about AI in 20 years is perfectly reasonable though. We've seen major advancements over just the last two years, but we still are not completely sure if there's a \"ceiling\" that might cap what AI can do, or if those advancements will continue to accelerate.\n\nOverall, if you're passionate about something, especially at such a young age, it's worth investing some time into that passion. No one knows what the world is going to look like in 5 years, let alone 20. People who are really passionate about what they do, and put in the time and effort to make smart decisions, tend to make things work.\n\nEdit: grammar",

They often use special frameworks for these languages that have built-in features that make building APIs easier or more performative. Typically they also work with databases in some capacity, as a core function of most APIs is retrieving or saving data to a database.\n\nTypically the devs consuming APIs are frontend devs who need data to display on a GUI. However, APIs can also call other APIs, so consuming APIs is something done by devs front or backend. \n\nIt's becoming more common to become a full stack developer where you both create APIs and then consume them on the frontend. Often times though even full stack devs will specialize in one over the other. You'll find when you do this kind of work, you don't need to be a master of a language or framework to create passable features. Obviously it depends, but if your API consists of a lot of CRUD (create, read, update, delete) work, most devs can produce these endpoints with not a ton of experience needed.\n\nA great tool to start messing around with APIs is postman. You can call API endpoints from this tool and see exactly what type of data they return. Then you can start imagining how you could use this data, or how to build your own API that produces data you need. \n\nA real life example I'm currently working with is that I'm creating an app that uses flood data. Weather.gov has a great API that allows me to get flash flood alerts. Instead of just calling this flash flood API from my frontend, I'm actually calling the weather API from my backend. I'm doing this because I need to alter the data to fit my needs before using it. So I'm using my API to grab data with weather.gov's API, manipulating that data into a usable form for myself, storing that data in my own database, and then calling my own API from my own frontend to get that data out of my database so I can display flood alerts to users in the way that I need. \n\nHopefully that helps!",

        "body": "One good way to think about APIs is a way to connect 30+ different services, instead of having a single service that tries to do it all. You need a way for service 1 to talk to service 3. This is done through APIs. Here is a long winded example:\n\nImagine you have one central platform that users interface with (the UI/website).\n\nBut then you also have three services {A1-3} that take in data at the start, from three different sources. Say  the data coming into A1-3 is different user activity, say everytime a user logs into some systems {S1-3}. Those systems send data in different ways to A1-3. \n\nA1-3 may transform the data in some way and send it down the pipeline. Possibly convert it into some central schema, since the three sources {S1-3} provide different sources data formats.\n\nMaybe one of these data-consumers {A2} needs to query some other service {B1} that provides additional user data. Perhaps A1 and A3 already get this additional data directly from their sources, S1 and S3. \n\nB1 is a service your company created that just stores a bunch of specific data in a database. When the service A2 queries it (or any other service), it returns some useful information. \n\nMaybe the database holds user host information (like their computer name). So B1 is an API that takes in a User ID, and returns their hostname/Mac address/location, ect. It just queries the database by user ID, and returns the information. \n\nSo you might say, why not just have A2 query the database directly? Well, what if later on you have another service that wants the same data. So you made the API B1, which is the only connection point to this particular database. \n\nOnce A1-3 enrich and convert their data into a central schema, they send that data using some messaging service (e.g. Kafka) to one consumer, C1. \n\nC1's job is to just store this data in some database. All it does is read data from A1-3 and store it (in a DB), and then it provides an API to retrieve this data on-demand. \n\nAll of these could be called 'microservices'. Instead of having a single service that does it all, we have 6 that just handle their own little section. \n\nThe user interface (the front end), needs to be able to provide information to customers. If the customer needs to know when User#45 last logged in, it queries C1. This event has the original data A2 consumed + some enrichment from B1. \n\nNow is the best part. Remember how we made B1 its own independent service? When the UI wants to give the latest login info about a user it query C1.\n\nBut what about when it needs to provide just hostname information (which is not directly tied to a particular login instance). These hostnames are unrelated to the login information from C1 (even though C1 has some hostname info, but only when related to logins).\n\nSo now the UI can query B1 to provide a bunch of hostname information. \n\nIn this long example, we only have two APIs, B1 and C1. But whilst populates B1? \n\nImagine we also need to manage payment information, basic account info, ect. If it's closely related, it could be with one API and in one database. But often there will be disparate data from different sources. Better to make everything modular. So you end up with a bunch of small services that make their data available through their individual APIs.",

I both take advantage of libraries that others have written and expose an API for consumption, and deliver libraries that are used by others. \n\nThis goes for REST as well -- if you work with microservices, it's very common for the individual services to all communicate via REST APIs.

Both languages will force you to think about memory management of your programme.  C will do this by either crashing or allowing you to compile a programme that will corrupt its data.  Rust will do this by failing to compile and telling you why.\n\nFor a beginner, I'd think that the Rust approach is more useful, because the compiler is helping you understand the lifetimes of variables, and where you might be trying to hold references to them beyond their existence.\n\nRust also has some nice features that makes it a bit more expressive.   Plus it deals with Unicode for you.\n\nHaving said that, you will be fighting the Rust compiler to begin with as you learn Rust's rules.  This could be frustrating as it will be holding you back from writing code.  In contrast, C will compile much more readily, and you will actually be able to get on with other aspects of learning programming.",

Both languages are technically high-level languages, but they can be used for low-level system programming.\n\n\nWhatever language you start with, you'll need to learn systems programming. The language is a fairly small part of that.\n\n\nYou'll be learning the different parts of the os, what subsystems/interfaces/APIs are available and where/how to access them. At an even lower level you be accessing hardware directly and learning how whole systems are architected on-chip, accessed through registers and fifos, and how all those are connected on various busses. Plus concepts like multithreading, mutexes, semaphores, spin-locks, memory barriers, irq contexts... I could go on.\n\n\nIMO, the only thing you'll miss by not learning C first is the why. Rust can teach you the how, the concepts, the best practices, etc, just fine. But you might not understand why rust does what it does, which you can pick up later.\n\n\nHowever... If you want to learn systems programming, you will have a lot more examples, explanations, and tutorials in C.\n\n\nSo while I was initially leaning towards rust if that's what you want to use, I would really consider at least learning to comfortably navigate and understand C if you are new to systems programming and want to focus on that.",

For ex. with Python, you’d want to pick up a web framework like Django or Flask to build websites. Those frameworks handle things like routing, templates  & databases which aren’t part of core Python itself.\n\nFrom my experience when I first started with Python I focused on the basics like syntax and data structures. But when I jumped into web dev, I had to learn how HTTP works, how to structure a web app, and how to connect to databases. If you want to build apps (like desktop or mobile), that’s another layer you’d learn different tools (like Kivy for desktop apps or something else for mobile). So yeah, the core language helps, but web dev and app dev have their own sets of skills you’ll want to pick up along the way. Keep going it’s all part of the fun!",

An English dictionary is a reference for English words.\n\nReferences assume you already have a general knowledge of the tool. They’re very useful for double-checking obscure stuff once you know a bit about the tool, but you can’t really start learning from a reference. Here’s a definition from a Japanese dictionary:\n\n節(せつ)を屈(くっ)・する の解説\n「節を折る」に同じ。\n「せつ【節】」の全ての意味を見る\n\nThis doesn’t help a beginner. To learn anything from this you already have know a bunch of Japanese.\n\n***Tutorials*** are guides for learning a tool. They’re a narrative, a kind of story that leads a learner along a path, teaching a little about each feature they present – usually just enough about the feature to achieve the next task.\n\nTutorials don’t assume you know anything about the tool. They’re not useful for checking fine details about a specific thing, but they’re very useful for getting to know the basics.\n\n***How-tos*** are a sort of mini-tutorial for a specific area. They assume you know mostly how to use your tool, and focus on how you could use your tool to do one particular task.\n\nSo here’s your answer: ***don’t try and learn from the *reference* docs***. Find a *tutorial*. Not all tools have good tutorials, but if you search for “<language or framework> beginner tutorial” you will find one. Once you find a tutorial that’s recommended by others and not too old, actually work through it. Don’t just read it. \n\nGood luck!",

You need to find the right kind of documentation for your particular needs and level of understanding (of the system and of programming).

For frameworks, I do better once I understand their underlying model but tutorial docs are where I start, then I visit the more detailed \"how it works under the hood\" documentation.\n\nRegardless of the kind of documentation, though, try to practice with the language, libraries, and frameworks as you go through the materials. When I learned C# for work way back when, I created a scratch solution with, eventually, dozens of projects. Each one had maybe 20-100 lines of code in them that exercised different parts of the C# language, C# libraries, or third party libraries I was trying to use. Whenever I found a new corner of the language I didn't know, I'd add a new one and practice.\n\nI do the same thing for exploring other concepts in CS, programming, networking, etc. Small throwaway projects that let me verify my understanding and, if it doesn't work, identify my gaps.",

Especially nowadays where the cost of degrees are astronomical compared to what I paid (I graduated in 2010 and paid off my degree through work contributions alone in 2018). As a PHP developer you will have some income and also proven time spent actually doing development. As you get further and further into your career the fact you have a degree becomes less and less important. The only thing I would say that you would benefit from perpetually from a degree is learning the fundamentals as in my experience self taught engineers often skip a lot of these and struggle at certain points in their career when these fundamentals become more important (switching languages, architecture etc). Id also say that in my experience a lot of people doing ML / Machine learning that I encountered in the wild aren't actually people with Computer Science degrees they tend to be mathematicians. Two very different disciplines despite what people say (I'm awful at maths as I'm dyscalculic but really good at software development as it's more akin to algebra).",

Eclipse has a \"workspace workflow\" (you can have a whole folder of projects open at once in Eclipse), which IntelliJ doesn't have. Great for hopping between demo projects as a beginner, and also good for pro Java programmers.",

Some don't like reading the theory parts because they just want to program, so reading programming principles bores them. They prefer to jump in and code. Others don't like that approach.\n\nPersonally, I don't think you should separate the two into a \"principles\" part and a \"programming\" part. If you're studying principles, then you're learning *about* programming and not *programming*. On the other hand, if you program from the start, you would lose out on principles. You need to know how a program runs, to help you write, and more importantly, debug a program.",

Just find a good balance between them, it is still good to study so that you know how things work under the hood, especially subjects like Data Structs and Algs, Discrete Maths, etc, because the concepts taught in these subjects will act as supplement for your programming knowledge.",

I think you're much better off learning Full-Stack JavaScript (using a front end framework as well as a backend using express) and then learning another popular backend framework such as Java Spring or C# .NET.\n\nThese are not only much more popular in enterprise but don't require as much fundamental CS knowledge.

Well, you can start small, I would assume that tictactoe is too simple for you as well, what about something in between, like Pacman? You can add a lot of interesting depth to that game. \n\nSome part of it is visual, which usually helps make it a little more interesting and captivating. But there's also stuff like Ghost behavior, which can be solved in a lot of ways. You can do it with more traditional search algorithms, you can make deterministic tabled graphs to use for look up. They both need to flee and pursue Pacman, the 4 ghosts all act differently, so figuring out how to add that nuance in, once you find the solution you want to use could be an interesting little thing to tweak around with.",

Similarly, you can have a UI without being a front end expert, just keep it very basic, like just use a template and be done.\n\n3. You can just have projects with no UI, this is extremely common. In fact, a project should really just solve one little tiny problem if possible, and if someone else wants to make a separate project that wraps your project with a UI then fine.\n\n4. Not that this probably matters for you, but there is a subtle difference (front end devs can correct me if I'm wrong) between front end software dev versus UI/UX design. You can design for functionality (and performance etc.) on the front end without really worrying about the design itself. You can conversely design a UI without getting into the functionality or even writing any code.",

That’s a real sign you’ve found something you’re genuinely passionate about. A lot of great devs started the same way - just getting lost in code.\n\nSince you're learning C#, that’s a strong start. It’s used in tons of real-world applications - especially in enterprise software, game dev with Unity, and even backend web stuff (with .NET). So don’t think it’s a “just-for-school\" language - it’s got legs in the industry.\n\nIf you're eyeing cybersecurity and want to branch out smartly, here's a quick breakdown of useful languages based on where you might go:\n\nFor Cybersecurity:\n\nPython – absolute must. It's everywhere in cybersec (automation, scripting, tooling, etc.), super beginner-friendly, and has a massive library ecosystem.\n\nBash/Shell Scripting – essential if you're going to be dealing with Linux servers or writing security automation scripts.\n\nC/C++ – if you ever want to understand exploits, memory management, or reverse engineering.\n\nFor General Dev / Building Stuff:\n\nJavaScript + HTML/CSS – if you ever want to touch frontend or build tools with a GUI.\n\nGo – gaining traction in cloud & network tooling, really nice for fast and secure backend systems.\n\nSince you're enjoying it already, I'd say:\n\nStick with C# and get comfy building small projects.\n\nStart Python next - you’ll love how fast you can get stuff working.\n\nMaybe check out TryHackMe or Hack The Box once you’re comfortable with the basics - great intro to hands-on cybersec.\n\nAlso, shameless plug, but I’ve been using this app called BootSelf lately. It gives you an AI mentor that helps explain code and quiz you with flashcards. Pretty helpful if you're learning solo and want to stay on track. There's a free version if you're curious.\n\nYou’re on a great path - you don’t need to have it all figured out right now. Just keep following your curiosity, and you’ll build the skill stack naturally.\n\nGood luck, and keep building 👊",

That's because figuring out *what* to learn and in what order often isn't entirely obvious, sometimes I just have to waste time learning something I'll never use in order to figure that out.\n\nBut when l've decided, I start with a mix of reading independent blog posts, analyzing usage statistics and browsing Reddit. I look for what seems exciting or relevant to the kind of software I might want to build.\n\nFor example, I wanted a personal website, which led me to Eleventy. I tried to dive in, read some docs, and attempt small things, until I realized that I was really struggling to get what I wanted. I then looked for a tutorial that builds a complete project, so I could get a notion for what it could look like. When doing tutorials, I try to actively change minor things, add small features, or try to integrate it with something else. I like doing this because it forces me to understand why it works and make it my own.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree with project-based learning. I also like to say that you should embrace failure and be quick to abandon learning projects if they're not serving their purpose (i.e., you're not learning or enjoying the process). The goal is learning, not necessarily something you'll put on your portfolio.",

I was hired into a team and at a time where all the others in my cohort had masters degrees and seemed so much more experienced than I was. And it's possible that they were, I didn't realize that it didn't actually matter that much. I was showing up, passionate about doing a good job, and learning every day.\n\nI have a distinct memory of talking to a mentor about it. A meeting had just ended and I asked him to hang back in the conference room with me. I mentioned those feelings, that I wasn't as good as the other junior developers. I'd hoped my mentor would have some sage advice for me, recommendations on learning materials to catch up, or even just a pep talk. Instead, he told me to never let anyone hear me say that again. Because people will believe it if they hear it. And it sort of crushed me, because **I believed it.**\n\nLater on, that same mentor was let go from the company. In my final chat with him he shared that he'd had a lot of personal things going on in his life. The reality is that he was struggling too, all that time. And his way of handling it had been to put up that front. That's why I thought he was the person who would be able to help me. Because he presented like he had it figured out. When really, he was falling behind just like the rest of us. He felt lost. His mental state was impacting his work, etc. And worst of all, he didn't have a healthy mindset of how to address it.\n\nYears later, I was one of the most senior people working on a product. I had a manager who was new in role and together we built out a team of mostly college hires to stand up and then operate a new set of services. Every one of those developers we hired were brilliant. I always felt like they were so far ahead of where I was when I started and found each of them to be so impressive. But sure enough, in the months and then years that followed our building that team out... those new junior developers would each take me aside on their own to express how they were struggling with feelings in inadequacy. Literally, every single one.\n\nIronically, it was those junior developers who helped me to overcome my imposters syndrome. Not the experienced mentor like I'd imagined. It was when I realized how **we all feel behind,** that I managed to wrangle my own feelings. What you're feeling now is completely normal. Its okay to be vulnerable. To share if you feel lost, or don't understand something that everyone else seems to. You are on the long road to becoming an expert. Give yourself grace.",

Their feelings of inadequacy are completely justified because they **are** literally beginners, and now they're understanding that completing a 3 year degree doesn't mean they know everything.\n\nOr they're too young to understand that the top 1% of any field are outliers, and everyone else is just a regular human who makes mistakes and doesn't know everything. Basically they haven't yet mentally grown out of the phase where they think parental figures are magical perfect beings, they've just replaced their actual parents with like, a senior colleague, or some YouTuber. But hey, better that pirate software guy than fucking Peterson or Tate right? Then their idol either quits or fucks up, and after a short existential crisis they realize they were just normal people after all, boom no more \"Imposter Syndrome\".\n\nOr they've grown up with social media, where your understanding of the world is warped by selection bias. User X is an expert in A, user Y is an expert in B, user Z is an expert in C, they conflate it into some amalgamation of everyone knows everything. Then they get a job in the real world and find out individual people are good at maybe a few things, but really fucking stupid at everything else.\n\nTL;DR as far as I can tell 99% of \"Imposter Syndrome\" is just young people lacking cognitive development and real world experience to understand they have every right to feel less capable. They literally are. That's why we pay them less. If you're asking questions on this sub, chances are you fall into at least the first category, if not the others as well.",

Sometimes that out there question is just some guy asking a bad question, but sometimes it's because they're checking for a really specific kind of experience.\n\nFor example, I once had an interview where they asked me \"when would you mark a variable as both 'volatile' and 'const'?\" This is mostly not something that will ever come up for a C/C++ programmer, but if you specifically work on hardware/firmware/drivers, you're more likely to have a good answer, which is that you'd do that if the hardware was setting a particular memory address with a value, and you would be regularly checking that address. But that's not something you'd know just because you knew C/C++.\n\nDifferent interviewers have very different styles, and also, many interviewers are bad at it and will reject you more or less randomly. This is just a thing that happens, and you should expect half your interviews to be failures due to no real fault of your own. Sorry. Just politely thank them and move on when it happens.\n\nDo review BSTs, quicksort, and making a linked list from scratch, just in case, but asides from that, it's too late to study.",

My goal was to make sure candidates weren't lying on their resume.  For C++, I would ask basic questions that any C++ developer should know.  Not advanced stuff.\n\n\\~15 minutes of role-related knowledge questions.  Again, the goal is to see if their resume is correct.  So if they say they worked on a graphics driver for a certain operating system, I would ask them basic questions that someone who worked on that should know the answer to.\n\n\\~60 minutes for a coding question.  I would ask a question that a seasoned professional could solve in 10 minutes.  The extra time was to allow the candidate to take time to disuss the problem, maybe have a false start or two, and still have plenty of time to get to a working solution.\n\nMy general advice:  Try to relax.  Try to think out loud if you can - the interviewer is probably trying desperately to figure out how you think about problems and whether you consider alternative solutions and tradeoffs between different ways of answering questions or solving problems.",

A software engineering role at say a car manufacturer might need to know a bunch of math, electrical and mechanical stuff while the same role at a online clothing store might need none of that.\n\nProgramming is *sorta* similar to healthcare in the way that concepts build upon each other. For example, to fully grasp diabetes knowing what insulin actually does first helps a lot, but it’s not a hard requirement to understand the disease. Similarly för programming, learning the basics like stacks, pointers, arrays etc. will make further concepts so much easier to understand, but it’s not required.\n\nIf you’re interested in AI you’d need at least a bachelors, and probobly a masters as well. AI works on a lot of linear algebra and multi-variable calculus. You basically have an input, break it down into a bunch of smaller components represented by numbers. You then feed these numbers through a magical web consisting of a 1000+ tunable dials which outputs a prediction. You need linear algebra to efficiently traverse this web, and you need the calc. to identify how *wrong* an AI and how to best adjust the 1000+ dials to make it less wrong.\n\nIt’s never to late to start coding, it’s a really cool space and I hope you’ll enjoy it!\n\nHere are some videos graphically showing how AIs work:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk?si=XmQwghEwlM-x11H7",

You just need to pick something, anything and move forward. You don't need to worry if you stop or quit because something else sprouts out of the side of that. It's even ok if you move on to something else (if you're doing it because that drew your interest). Just program. \n\nThe issue is that new ideas won't come to you until you get more experience coding and playing around. You'll be working on a website, learn about networking and then think... 'hey I wonder if I could create a program that would connect my two laptops in a way that.........'. Or you'll be using a database and think... 'could I put a layer in front of that which handles X case?'. You'll get frustrated running a shell command and as part of script to install a separate project and wonder if you could edit its source code to alter something. \n\nJust learn and practice.

If it's web, personally I'd say go with JavaScript over Python as that will let you cover FE development and limited backend through Node. When you are then ready to move onto a more robust backend and need something more powerful / designed for the task then go with C# or Go. If it's not the web side you are looking at then stick with Python as a scripting language then move onto something deeper like Go or C# (.net) or Java.",

You understand the theory by applying it. Work on a project, encounter problems, fix the problems.\n\n>Any good projects or tutorials you’d recommend for practicing?\n\nAny project that you personally care about and are motivated by. And it's far more useful if you work on it yourself instead of just copying it from some book or video. \n\n>Or even just personal experiences — what helped it all *click* for you?\n\nFirst, figure out the properties of your problem, and then find a solution that best fits those properties. Try thinking about the future, like \"what if I wanted this to work for both 32-bit and 64-bit floats?\" or \"what if I wanted to change the database I use without having to change any other part of my program\" and the solutions guide you to SOLID principles naturally. \n\nI think that it's important to always have a reason for everything you do. Don't follow the SOLID principles because someone told you that it would be good to do. Understand what problems they help you solve or avoid. If you don't understand, then don't use them. Eventually, you might encounter a debugging session that frustrates you, and you might then realize that the use of SOLID would have avoided you the headache.

Well, those patterns never really resonated with me and using Java helped solidify to me that OOP cannot be the simplest way to organize things in a maintainable way.\n\nIn my career I’ve seen a lot of patterns, and the one that really clicked for me was pure functional programming. Working with a language that doesn’t have mutable objects, null values, or even a semblance of classes was such a revelation: nearly all the problems the golden rules try to mitigate come from mutability and complex hierarchical state. Pure functions always return the same result, given the same arguments, which makes testing them incredibly easy and fun. And if the language has nothing but pure functions, then all applications built with it are incredibly easy and fun to test.\n\nMy point is, it’s okay if some aspects of programming don’t click. Maybe they will later on, when you’ve seen how following it avoided issues or cutting corners lead to issues. Maybe you’ll come across another way of looking at things (like FP for me) that finally makes sense and helps put everything else in a new perspective.\n\nJust build things you want to build, that’s the only way programming is going to start making sense. Try following the rules and try breaking them. Come up with your own solutions and once done, analyze if what you did actually followed a common pattern, just in a roundabout way. If not, was it better than the common pattern? Why did it work, would it scale to a larger codebase or a project with 10 developers?",

        "body": "You are on the right track. This is an easy fix. The problem with most programming concept is they are abstract. Think of it this way. If you see an object, say a car. How do you justify if it’s a good looking car? Well the only way that you could do so is you need to have a reference point of what is “good” and what is “bad”. It’s the same case with these concept.  If you never encounter a “problem” in an OOP language code base. You will have no idea how OOP concept will solve those problems. \n\nThe easier way to move forward is find a project or build one NOT using an OOP. Once you build to certain level, stop and look at how your code wired together. Does any of the OOP concept that you know can make your code “better”.",

Another more accurate name for these constructs is Inversion of Control (IoC) and this idea came about because of TDD, and the need to inject objects to help separate production and testing environments.\n\nIMHO this design patterns actually go against classical OOD, which defines concepts like 'has a' and 'is a' as the types of relationships objects have with one another. Dependency injection means some external body knows all about the internals of an object and injects other objects into that object as needed.\n\nNow the OOD model still works if you think IoC as some kind of God object that has control of the construction of every object in the system. Because IoC is a God these objects literally pop into existence.\n\nOnce you understand this, it makes a lot more sense. The IoC takes care of the construction of the object, and everything else is OOD.",

Sitting down and actually breaking down each element, what do I want, what do I need, who will be doing x and who does y? What “date” should I be using and why?\n\nLearning how to define the success factors and set realistic goals is vital in coding. As I’m going through it I’ll jot down possible approaches and methods I might need going forward. I don’t need to fully code them now but I need to make sure I have everything tight for when things get complicated later. \n\nYou won’t be designing every system you work on from the ground up but you will need to be able to read and identify what the other coders were doing, what were they thinking when they made this method or class and where does it go? You won’t be able to feed full applications into an AI to read them out to you when you’re on a team. \n\nI also put a lot of work in before I started college and got advanced entry into Y2. At Christmas I was miles ahead of most in the class and took the foot of the gas looking at other languages instead. Come April I realised I’d slipped too much and had work my balls off to catch up. Yes I had a basic understanding of what we did but I couldn’t use it effectively. \n\nThe best example was SQL. I could read SQL, I knew where the query was going how things joined but I struggled trying to fix it together myself. I used AI while making my database connections and had to constantly look back to do them from scratch myself. Eventually I just stopped using the AI designed methods as this is something I need to be able to do. \n\nWe had interviews presenting our final projects at the end of the year and they asked “You have well designed methods for database queries in the first 4-5 frames but you don’t use them later in the project. Why?”  I explained that while I would be using those methods from the helper files in real world conditions, I wasn’t happy with my understanding of them. I couldn’t do them from memory and kept making errors, so I decided to drill them in by typing them out each time. \n\nThey loved that answer. It showed I was able to use helper files and methods to keep code clear and concise making the project easy to read, but I also knew how to make and adjust the process to perform custom tasks. They asked me to isolate certain conditions and how I would pick out individual combinations and I was able to do it on the spot because I knew the system and understood how it worked. Some of the others struggled with that as AI had done all the thinking for them. \n\nWhen it came to exams I flew through the test because I A) understood how I would do it. B) was able to identify what they were looking for and how to trace back to it. And C) I made the mistakes and worked my way through them so when they happened there I knew what I was looking at. \n\nTLDR:\n\nDon’t use AI to design everything. Yes it’ll spit out loads of lovely code that works for this window of the project but it won’t improve your skills or work when you only have this small section on larger projects. \n\nKeep pushing in college, you might be ahead right now but that’ll slip real quick it you get lazy",

And if you ever get stuck on something, just google \"how to X in Y,\" where X is some task (e.g. use a switch statement), and Y is the programming language you are working with.\n\n\n\nTLDR: courses are beneficial, but they are even more helpful when supplemented with practical work and experimentation.",

You just need to learn to live with it and take the challenges step by step.\n\nIn programming, you will never stop learning and will always be fighting an uphill battle as there is always way more that you don't know than what you do know. There is always a huge mountain ahead of you. Yet, if you take it like you climb a mountain by looking at the path, the steps ahead of you instead of looking at the seemingly unreachable summit, everything becomes much more manageable.\n\nAlso, too many people in programming are *afraid*. Afraid of not living up to the(ir) expectations. Afraid to break things. Afraid for completely irrelevant reasons.\n\nThere is nothing to be afraid of in programming. Unless you do some incredibly stupid things (like deleting random files, or formatting your computer) nothing serious can happen. The worst case is that you need to restart the computer, so what?\n\nYou need to shift your mentality about failures: with every failure, with every error, with every thing that doesn't work like you expected, you have learnt something. You have learnt how not to do things. This is equally important to knowing how to do things.\n\nIf you mess up something, you'll remember. If everything runs smoothly without battling from the start, you're not remembering, nor learning.",

When you finish the branch and merge it into master, it won't try to update backwards if you're missing some unrelated commits from master, which is why you don't necessarily have to pull.",

The assignment criterion is based on the *shortest* distances.\n\n**Question 1:** Is there any significant difference between the execution times for **2** computers?\n\nWrite a Python program for the scenario above and compare its execution time using 2 different computers. You need to run the program 50 times on each computer. You must provide the specifications of RAM, hard disk type, and CPU of the computers. You need to use a *shaded density plot* to show the distribution difference. Make sure you provide a discussion of the experiment setting.\n\nSo now this is how I prepare my code for it (please refer above).\n\nOnce done, for some reason, my shaded density plot to show the distribution difference is not showing a Curve plot.\n\nBased on my professor, it has to be a curve plot to show the shaded density plot.\n\ni am not able to get that, my plot is just a vertical line. i am sure something is wrong with my code, which is resulting it not showing a curve plot, but i am not sure which part of my program code is wrong.\n\n  \ni may need some help on that. \n\n  \nDid i make it clear this time?\n\nAppreciate the help pls.",

I can't speak to how it compares to other codebases but for someone who has only worked on small projects for classes, it's pretty daunting. Plus, while I have basic familiarity with Java, I don't know C# at all.\n\nI looked at a bunch of other mods for the game and decompiled the source code to get some starting points, but it wasn't long before I ran into roadblocks that no amount of Googling would have ever resolved. Normally, I'd probably have just given up. Being able to make tangible progress has been hugely helpful in keeping motivation up and frustration down, and I feel like I've learned a ton about C#, Unity games and even certain OOP concepts I wasn't super familiar with.\n\nBeing able to say, \"Okay, here's how this other mod did Y, can you give me some ideas on how to implement similar idea X?\" Or, \"I understand what this piece of code accomplishes, but why is it structured like this?\"\n\nYou have to be willing to challenge the AI's ideas sometimes, too. Like, a specific weird issue I was having with this mod the AI suggested a very \"brute force\" solution that probably would have worked, but I was 99% sure was not the correct or \"ideal\" way to do it. So I would say, \"No I'm pretty sure you're wrong. I can see a bunch of methods in this source file that may be applicable to our situation, maybe we can find an alternate path?\" And then we found a better solution together. The AI didn't solve the problem for me, it just saved me the frustration of having to parse thousands of lines of unfamiliar code in the hope that I was on the right track.\n\nIt definitely leads me astray sometimes, it hallucinates methods pretty regularly but *conceptually* it's implementation plans are usually pointed in the right direction. I treat it like a pair programmer, not a code monkey, and I can say with complete confidence that I have a better understanding of coding because of it.",

We've made a false equivalency, because AI has pushed beginners so close to what people studied so long to get to so we act like these vibe coders should be treated at that level. In reality, they will learn theory they need and drop stuff they don't need anymore.

        "body": "The trend of Chinese international students returning home to China rather than remaining in the U.S. has massively  accelerated over the last few decades. As of 2019,  approximately 90% of Chinese international students return to China after completing their degree. The idea that the U.S. has been benefiting from a brain drain is no longer valid. \n\nThe reality is that University admins love international students because they typically come from wealthy families, require less financial assistance and pay much more tuition. America’s top universities are sitting on fabulously large endowments and are fully capable of subsidizing the education of U.S. students in need. However, their highly paid administrators seem intent upon transforming these institutions into tax-sheltered political think-tanks rather than educating America’s best and brightest. \n\nWhy should U.S. universities educate Chinese citizens in bleeding edge industries? Imo, we should be putting resources into US citizens.",

The big tech companies and all the other smaller companies that look up to them are bracing for economic slowdown. They’re laying off hundreds of thousands of workers - flooding the labor market and increasing competition for the companies that are hiring. \n\nPeople don’t quit bad jobs - they quit bad bosses. Try to keep your head up and not take all of this too personally. No manager or person will ever be perfect, but I promise you will have much better experiences moving forward than you have had so far. It’s very hard to grow under an unsupportive manager, but it’s incredible what a supportive one can do for you when they learn and value your strengths. ",

Don’t do more than you need to stick around and every time you want to do something extra at work make a mental note and put that energy into job searching.\n\nAlso take time to document everything that you did in your time there somewhere that you won’t lose access to afterwards.  It will help when people ask about your experience.\n\nAnd if you get a cool position afterwards, flex.  People at your old job will see people leaving and get worried about their own jobs.  If they see people getting interesting jobs elsewhere they’ll get FOMO too.  I’ve seen teams collapse after a round of PIPs because key people don’t feel stable in their job and leave.

A rockstar SWE living in bumfuck nowhere Montana might be making a very \"normal\" salary at a normal company, and a dumbass SWE living in the Bay Area might've weaseled their way into a top-paying SV startup. And we *certainly* don't make \"2x or 3x\" what ***most*** other white collar fields make. Maybe if by \"most\" you include working in fast food, but definitely not white collar.\n* For one, this isn't an inherent trait of a SWE career. It *never* has been. There are lots of fully onsite companies, even top tech companies. But it's also not unique to SWE. It's a trait *of a company*, not of a role. At every hybrid/remote company I've worked at, ***everyone*** is hybrid/remote and is afforded that same amount of flexibility. Marketing, sales, legal, IT, etc.\n* It's genuinely interesting to you and me! But to a lot of people out there what you just described is more boring than watching paint dry. Different strokes for different folks.\n* Variety also exists in many other careers... You know those prestigious companies you're talking about? And the exciting startups you're talking about? Guess what they both also hire? Non-SWE's.\n* Now you're just saying \"White Collar careers are the best careers by far\". This has nothing to do with SWE.\n* If you work for a large, well-known company it's just as likely (I'd argue significantly *more* likely) that you'll be working on some boring internal tool that has 20 internal users. Scale is also not inherent of this career. \"I work for Google\", \"Cool, what do you do there?\", \"Oh.. uhh... I manage a dashboard that lets a small team of internal users track internal budgets between departments\".\n\nIt's a great career, don't get me wrong. But all of what you're describing isn't inherent of a SWE career, nor is it unique to a SWE career. There are billions of people. When you use words like \"best\", you're forgetting that the overwhelming majority of humans out there don't care at all about the things you care about.\n\n*Your* \"best\" career is someone else's living nightmare. Someone else's \"best\" career that makes them love waking up in the morning (someone who *enjoys* a manual labor job and like working outside, in extreme conditions for example), might be ***your*** living nightmare.\n\nIf you enjoy SWE, pursue it. There's really no point in trying to argue it's the objectively \"best\" field. Let people do what people want to do with their lives.",

He probably doesn't think about how much people like him or dislikes him, not because he doesn't care but because he hasn't thought about it, he is there to work. Make no mistake he has feelings and is sensitive to being hurt, that said, I did socialize in a small circle but I didn't waste time either.\n\nI was protected at times, especially in one job but they didn't change the expectations of everyone else, no. Instead I was looked at as a leader following a company mandate ( saving money ahead of downsizing - in 2015). Other guys asked me what they thought they should be doing instead. I had no idea and I wasn't ready to be a manager of others.\n\nLooking back, your manager needs to put aside through put to a degree whilst also acknowledging that maybe you don't want that person to work, maybe like I did all the time, they may regret not taking it a little slower and not enjoying the role more. And if they at all care about the person, they unilaterally should and it should be a concern discreetly shared to his peers, like you.\n\n\nAs for letting him fail, I'm not surprised it being stated but still feel awful hearing other people say that and probably did about me. There's better ways and conversations then to just let someone drop and if I'm honest, you've probably got no idea if you're really testing him in the role. What I mean is, this may not be a strain for him or even considered work. This might be a passion and something they take a great deal of pride in and not even work but is paid to be. \n\nYou have every right to raise a concern though and your manager needs to look at the person aspect. You all do but do it with them in mind as well as yourselves, maybe with their skills, they can learn to articulate them and go towards the team. \n\nIt might be sensible to expect that the standard of work will improve and that doesn't have to be a bad thing (doesn't necessitate 'harder'). \n\nHope that's helpful.",

Everyone lies on the applications and everyone uses AI to do everything for them and they can't answer basic interview questions. I work with some people who couldn't solve an easy leetcode problem. \n\nIt's saturated with \"react developers\" who are useless outside of next.js with tailwind but it is massively lacking people who can plan out, scale, and build production-ready systems. It's lacking people who can do DevOps if they don't have Vercel, or people who can roll up an auth system without Firebase or Clerk. \n\nSo we got 700 applications for a mid level web app developer and only maybe 20 are even qualified. Of those 20, 10 of them show up late for the interview or refuse to turn their camera on, of the remaining 10, they want more money than we can offer because they are more senior level and they know other companies will pay more than we can. \n\nSo we are really struggling to find someone who hasn't had their brain rotted by Theo Browne and the Vercel ecosystem. Web may be oversaturated but if you're truly competent then the jobs are available.",

That was the whole point of the layoffs. If all these big tech companies lay off employees at the same time, the hiring pool is suddenly filled with lots of talented employees. All of these employees need jobs and are competing with each other. In order to get employed again, some of these employees will take big pay cuts. So the companies are able to hire new staff at the same or similar level of talent for a reduced cost.\n\nThat obviously won't work forever. And once the economy improves some of these employees will jump ship. But it's what these companies have decided to do in the short term.",

You're not going to get any better growth opportunities than you do here.\n\nI read your other comment where you described what led to the issues with your past 2 jobs... what immediately jumps out at me is you're working at startups, or at least small enough companies where you're interacting directly with the founder, and the CTO. Startup environments like that are chaotic, and can be very exhausting, and aren't good fits for *most* people. I think you might be burnt out on startup culture, not the industry itself.\n\nInstead of abandoning your career entirely, have you considered looking for a more traditional job at a large company? Where you could work on a normal team, doing normal things, with normal expectations, where you aren't in a fast-paced high expectation environment where the founder or CTO aren't talking to you directly and are many, many layers removed from you and the work you do? Working a job like that will be like night and day from a startup.\n\nIf you're truly no longer interested in the work, then by all means pivot. I'm just worried that you're thinking a pivot is going to be a magic cure that fixes all your problems. The grass is always greener and all that. I think changing the type of company you work for would be a much smaller and easier to achieve change that could be refreshing for you. You don't need to immediately jump to the nuclear option when there's still smaller changes you can make that could make a major difference.",

It is not seeing the upside from those investments hence they need to cut and trim where they can to have enough capital to pivot to the next big gimmick. Generative AI does have its use cases and value however it's definitely not what many consumers envision it to be. It definitely does not mirror today's AI tech leaders stock prices and we will be in for a correction.",

But the fact is that American companies are trying to reduce the number of software engineers as much as possible. It's not the AI that's your immediate problem, it's outsourcing. Microsoft is firing software engineers in the US and then hiring them in India, also raising the bar for engineers in the US making it harder to get and keep jobs. This is due to the fact many unemployed engineers on the market from Google, Meta and other good companies, so it makes sense for the company to fire some of its bad performing, too expensive or old engineers, and hire fresh talents from Meta. It's dog eats dog world, and it is probably going to be worse since OPEX is predicted to get less funding compared to CAPEX by the end of this decade.\n\nAI is still mostly overhyped, but it might become a problem in few years.

It's relatively common to have weak support (either by a manager carousel or lack of E6+ sponsors) that can block your promo - ask me how I know lol. \n\nMore subjectively, I think it's worth finding a team that you trust in their feedback (there are some people who are 10x more critical than average), and if you care about timelines, a staggering of levels (if there's like 8 E3s, it might take longer for your promotion to come through). \n\nAs an aside - I think performance will be much more about stakeholders talking about how great you are / other people in PSC, and objective metrics are somewhat secondary, esp for E3->E4.",

They might not want to/cant give you opportunities to check off those requirements.\n\nImpact is also important. Theres an idea in big tech where you need to make impact, which means “what can i do to make something easier for another engineer”. Its not always “i have to work on the newest feature”(although ig is alway making then removing features lol), it could be related to fixing something for On-Call, etc. You just need to optimize some part of the job to “make life easier”.\n\nThe only thing you need is to adapt and meet these requirement, but the hard part is if your team is going to even let you/give you the opportunity.

        "body": "Approximately 1/50 application to interviews is pretty good in the current market. \n\nMy advice would be to try to figure out what went wrong in the three interviews you did get, and work on fixing that in addition to applying. Because if you can fix that, you just need 1-2 more shots and you're good! \n\nAssuming you posted your resume to solicit feedback, here's a huge text wall of resume advice you can take or leave: \n\nAs another user suggested, you might want a different template. I linked one at the bottom. I'm not sure if your template is the issue, but it doesn't hurt to try something different and test results, you can always circle back to what you have now.   \n  \nI'd also include a projects section, put your 2-3 most impressive school projects with some jazzed up bullet points (you can get an llm to help you with jazzing them up) and work on a project yourself using industry tools in the space you want to work in. Using and mentioning industry tools in projects is a great way to get through ATS assuming it's checking for keywords (for example \"Docker\", \"React\" and \"Java\").   \n  \nHere's an example of what I mean by a personal project, say you want to work with python full stack? Make and deploy a django app or something. Link the frontend on your resume, maybe the github too. What kind of app? I don't know. It doesn't have to be crazy, but try to use docker, a common database, maybe make the frontend with react that's popular af. If you can't get actual work experience in a company, try to get a bit of experience doing a project. You don't have to use industry tools to make a toy project, but doing so gives you a little practice and exposure to them which is what's valuable, and can help you get through ATS.  \n\nMaybe even better than a personal project would be if you could contribute to an open source project and put that on your resume under the projects section. TLDR get a projects section and have your 3-4 most impressive projects on there until you get enough work experience to de-prioritize them. \n\nI'd shorten the skills section up to make room for the projects, mine is only two lines, languages and frameworks. I had an interview where the person was like, ok i'm going to list stuff from your skills section, you tell me on a scale of 1 to 10 how good you are with it, then proceeded to ask me corresponding difficulty questions about that skill/language/framework. After that, I trimmed my skills section up to stuff i'm at least a 4/10 confident in and it hasn't had a negative impact on my response rate.\n\nI'd consider putting one or two of those summer jobs back, you could put them under \"additional experience\" section at the bottom or something, just one liners very brief, if you give a description I think that describing teamwork and communication would help the most. \n\nFor a template that has additional work experience I think the \"additional expereince\" template in this google doc from Codepath would be a good start (make a copy don't request edit access).   \n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TDGkSD5l--GjKu56jw6frHmjr075QHbr\\_wfma\\_gmv8s/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gjdgxs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TDGkSD5l--GjKu56jw6frHmjr075QHbr_wfma_gmv8s/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gjdgxs)\n\nYou might want to consider making tailored resumes for different roles like swe, data analyst, etc where you put the popular keywords in. For example in your data analyst resume put a data project you did in there that uses powerBI or something at the top of the projects list, maybe change the skills up to include numpy pandas excel and tableau. \n\nAnyways, good luck. I'm curious from a scientific perspective if your response rate will improve after tweaking your resume. If you do change it up, you'll have to let me know if it made a difference.",

FYI: I also had to move across the country to get my job, do what you have to in order to get in the door.",

Consider using that instead. \n\nOthers can chime in here on if they suggest a better resume or not etc \n\nAlso do some projects and link it with your GitHub and such and make sure it’s hyperlinked in word same with your email and LinkedIn. \n\nYou can actually just type “linkedin” only and hyperlink it instead of having it typed out \n\nGood luck!!",

We can't just give a single description/anecdote to describe that entire period.\n\n2010 for example was the recovery period from the Great Recession. Hiring was picking up compared to 2008-2009, but it was still slow and cautious. Companies were not hiring with confidence.\n\n2021 for example was the golden era of SWE. Companies were massively over hiring, the demand for SWE drastically outpaced the supply of CS grads, and that single-handedly created an entirely new sub-market of bootcampers and self-teachers. People already in the industry were job hopping and getting insane 100% raises,.\n\nThat said, in my experience, good market or bad market, thing's aren't all that different. I still do the same interview prep, there's still the same kinds of startups/companies hiring, the expectation of this industry is still that you have a CS degree, etc. The difference I notice between a normal market (2011-2018-ish) and a bad market (2023+) is that the response rate is much lower. You need more applications to get responses. When I was applying for jobs in 2016 I did 10 applications total. When I was applying for jobs in 2021, I did 11 applications total. When I was applying for jobs in 2024, I did 82 applications total. I didn't feel like there was any difference in the process itself between those markets, once I got a company to actually interview me, the process was the same\n\nFor your second note, I think the insane over-hiring of 2021 is what ruined todays market. Not AI. We're still recovering from that overhiring. A lot of people that wouldn't have had a chance of being hired in a normal market broke into the industry in 2021, and the industry is trying to self-correct. It's a slow, and painful process.\n\nAI is a valuable tool for SWE's. Some companies are buying into the hype, and might try to reduce headcount as a result, but it's still just hype. There's always some sexy new hyped up thing in the industry that companies try to chase, and might make them increase/reduce headcount. AI is no different. A company that laid off a bunch of employees because of AI-hype might be desperate to hire a ton more employees a year from now to fix all the shit that the vibe coders did.",

Often because you have to know what is actually a good solution and how to prompt your way to it. It’s easy to see it do tricks and get excited, but it’s not replacing real experience for a while. Many big businesses are messy, hesitant for countless reasons, or existing code just too complicated for it to work right now. Can’t say that will be true forever. \n\nThe economy, at least in the US, depends on consumers consuming and a top fraction exploiting everyone else’s labor. Billionaires are living proof that there is no end - there is seemingly not limit so the cycle continues. Probably until enough people have nothing to lose and revolt.

In practice, it means that the law says an employer has to post a job ad for a role that had already been filled and ramped up a year+ earlier.\n\nThe undertone of these kinds of exposes seem to be that some cohorts are more \"deserving of the opportunity conferred by the law\", but arguably the immigration lawyers involved are actually going by the spirit of the law (even if it may technically be malicious compliance) when they ask the H-1B worker to provide job descriptions with excruciatingly high level of detail to construct these job posts. It is already hard enough to get candidates to match nice-to-haves in a regular job post, so who else can check every checkmark in a huge and highly specific list other than the person that is already doing the function, and with zero ramp up time, to boot? Or so the rationale goes.\n\nOne could argue that labor market assessment ought to be done upfront, and it actually is in some countries, notably the LMIA in Canada, but as Canadians might attest, that's not necessarily successful in practice either.\n\nPersonally I'm pretty cynical about political reform in general. \"Don't ask what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country\", as Kennedy famously said, if nothing else because the political machine doesn't really have your personal interest at heart in the first place.",

It's going to take a bit of time to read, to process the noise, to think of a solution and it takes time to write the code for question 1 and by the time you finished writing the code for q1, you are met with a bug. Then by the time you solved the bug, you now only have 10-20 minutes left to work on question 2. There is no time left to work on q2, especially when both qs are leetcode hard. Not sure if that's very reflective of the industry, at least in the internship I did, it wasn't like \"you must solve this in X minutes, otherwise we are all doomed\".\n\nThe other thing I don't like about leetcode questions being used for assessments is that we can't use debugging tools. I use my IDE to debug my code, to understand where my logic is wrong, to better understand my thought process and to fix them accordingly. This is also what happens in the industry but I can't use them. And so I am left staring into the screen trying to understand what I am doing wrong, I am trying to guess where I fked up. Sometimes print statements are not helpful because you don't know where you are going wrong and it's not effective/efficient. It all takes time.\n\nIt's like they are looking for robots/AI who can process everything in seconds and write up a solution in minutes. It's like they are not looking for humans.\n\nTo solve these questions, you need to have tons and tons of of leetcode practice. It's why I tell everyone to start DSAs asap, and to start leetcoding asap. It's the only way to match a robot/AI when it comes to big tech leetcode questions.",

A lot of people who move here only for a job but don't generally like it for what it offers end up leaving after a couple years. Without a positive keeping you here, the negatives of weather and COL will become overwhelming.\n2. Does advancing in your career matter to you? There are more high paying but demanding software jobs available in the Seattle area than anywhere except the Bay Area. If you care about growing your career or making more money, there are more opportunities. If you care about having a chill job where everyone works less than 40 hours a week, you're probably going to find these demanding jobs miserable eventually.\n\nHybrid in Seattle is fine if your employer has a good office and you have an easy commute to it. Those who hate working in the office the most where I work all have long, hellish driving commutes. If you can walk, bike, light rail, or bus to downtown in a small amount of time, or have a short driving commute to a suburban office park based job, it is much more manageable.",

You learn to spot the patterns in the resumes over time, and once the zoom call starts it’s usually pretty clear who is a phony; but filtering through all the garbage and finding the real humans is hard.

When I first started, I was told \"Go build an integration between our product and X CRM\" and that was about as much interaction as I got.\n\nSame thing where everything is always urgent, everything is always broken, everyone always needs something from you CONSTANTLY. I think that's unfortunately pretty common in SWE, but even more so at a startup.\n\nMy advice would be first, to stop caring so much, and second, keep looking for new opportunities with a healthier company. I'm not saying give up, or slack off, but I am saying that you should understand and accept that you will always have work to do and tickets to complete, and if you put forth your best effort and don't get all of those tickets done, it's not a reflection of you or your productivity, it's a result of poor management and unrealistic expectations.\n\nWhen I first started, I felt like I had to grind late nights and weekends so that I could meet the needs of every customer, and I would often work 60+ hours a week just to push a project past the finish line. Time and time again, I would put in all of this extra work and a few weeks down the road, the customer would churn for a reason unrelated to my work and then suddenly all of those extra hours were for nothing.\n\nNobody else cares about your mental health as much as you do, so you need to learn to set boundaries to protect your mental.\n\nI adopted the mantra \"Not my circus, not my monkeys\" lol. At the end of the day, if this company lives or dies, your life will ultimately be the same. Don't let it consume your life or your mental health, because one day you will find that it was all for nothing. My only other coworker in my department was just like me -- he stressed out about customers after hours and worked extra, and guess what? One day they decided he was too expensive and they canned him. All of those late nights and extra hours for nothing.\n\nPut forth your best effort during the work day and try to leave the stress in the office. If work is unfinished, it's unfinished, but it's not your problem because you already did as much as you reasonably should.\n\nI could go on and on, but my point is, *while you're looking for another job,* try to at least make this one more tolerable in the meantime by learning reasonable ways to protect your mental health. If you get punished for that in any way, let it roll off your shoulder knowing you're gonna leave the toxic environment as soon as you can anyway.",

Wait until you find out how little support you'll get at the average FAANG.\n\nWhat have you tried so far? Have you tried sending PRs to add/improve docs whenever you do finally figure something out? Have you talked to the other engineers about this?\n\n> Unrealistic expectations\n\nThat's literally every company. It's your job to push back and manage expectations.\n\nIt's very easy at your level. You just \"yes and\" everything. Examples:\n\n  - \"Sure, I can definitely do that. It will take N days instead of the 2 you've suggested, though, because <brief technical reason that's more detailed than anything they could debate>.\"\n\n  - \"Yes, I can prioritize this, but I'll have to put aside the other tickets on Foo and Bar, which will delay those by 42 days.\"\n\n  - And so on. You get the idea.\n\n> Long commute: have a 3 hour daily commute (1.5 hours each way).\n\nThis is pretty common in major cities for serious tech jobs. Lots of people start with this and then work their way up to a better situation.\n\nMy roughest commute back in the day was a drive to the train station (which had to be ass-early to get there in time to get parking), a train ride, and then a 1 mile walk from the train to the office. Then, in the evening, I'd do the whole thing in reverse. I dealt with it 5 days a week for a year, then got a better job. C'est la vie.\n\nI recommend a nice pair of noise-canceling headphones and a playlist of your favorite podcasts. It's temporary, and you'll have a better job with a better commute sooner or later, but in the meantime there's no need to suffer unnecessarily. Use the time to decompress or study, and be glad the noise-canceling headphones are way better these days than 10 years ago.",

If something isn't literally on fire, you probably don't need to drop everything else to do it today. Normally you agree on milestones and delivery deadlines upfront, or at least in advance.\n\nSecond is deconstructing delivery timelines based on whether it's due to technical complexity or due to scheduling. The former presumably means you've done some due diligence before estimating, and you should be able to articulate what the time consuming parts are with some degree of granularity, and their respective estimates. The latter is about what prior commitments you already have, and you have to decide how negotiable it is to make changes. Maybe you can deliver things faster by dropping/negotiating other things that have lower priorities or charging premium to work overtime or hiring a subcontractor, maybe not. If you can't, then be transparent about having other commitments. In other words, urgency is a feature, and you can charge money for it.\n\nIf it's a question of perception, you could try to explain via analogies, e.g. in law movies everything happens very quickly, often within the same day, whereas in reality, they drag on for months/years because in the real world things just take time. Same thing here.",

What's so difficult about it?\" are asking those questions because what they *really* want to know is When will it be complete? So your response to these questions should be a date you'll have that feature complete. Once you give a deadline, you'll get many fewer of these questions and if you do, just refer them to the aforementioned date.\n\nThe other part of this is just that non-technical people just don't know how hard things are. They've been taught, through drag-and-drop website builders and, sadly, AI-marketing, that things are easy. A new form should take an hour to add, right?? It can also be helpful to explain, as part of the communication providing them with the estimated timeline, what goes into the feature you're building. If they ask for a button to send a report to their email, for example, you can explain that part of your work means preventing security issues, handling permissions, formatting the report, testing it, making sure the email doesn't go to spam, etc etc.\n\nAs for the full-time job part, if they knew you had a full time job when they contracted with you, you can remind them of that, but I honestly think that's unnecessary to include. Just focus on giving them the timeline and they'll back off. It's not coming from a place of malice for them; they're just feeling in the dark probably.",

I technically work a “data” job but most of what I do is building internal tools and dashboards for business analysts and data analysts. \n\nI’m one of a few here at my company that have a CS background and I became a lead within about 6 months after being hired as a “Senior Developer”. I’m paid well because I’m the one who tests if new software or applications will help the team improve in some capacity. \n\nIt’s generally easier to get a job doing something technical at a company for a couple years and then pivot over to software engineer in the same company than it would be to get hired directly as a software engineer. In some cases you even get to skip the whole ten interview plus projects pipeline a bunch of companies are trying to do now.",

If you budget your time like you have 60 hours a week, you will be working 60 hours a week. Most people find 45-50 hours a week with short bursts above that sustainable, and I think that's a good place to target. You will be be pressured to work more; be ready to gracefully wiggle out of it.\n\n2. Whenever you ask someone for a piece of information (\"what is X?\", \"how do I do Y?\"), also find out how they know/obtained that information. Getting questions answered is good (and you should ask a lot of questions), but you should also be learning how to find answers yourself.\n\n3. Underpromise and overdeliver. You should describe every single task task you complete as both absolutely amazing and the product of tons of hard work.\n\n4. Optimize your commute. If you spend an hour sitting in the car each way, that's equivalent to working an extra 10 hours a week. Live close to work, work from home, or go in early and leave early to beat traffic. I usually listen to a podcast on the way in and call out of state family on the way home, much better than feeling your brain bleed out your ears as you sit in traffic.\n\n5. Be *very* careful when it comes to agreeing to take responsibility for something. Once you take responsibility for a project or feature you become the person on the hook for it, and if/when things go poorly you're going to be working 80 hour weeks while out of your mind. You need to be strategic, you need to advocate for yourself, and you need to resist peer pressure.\n\n6. If you're on a team of workaholics, just lie. Work 45 hours a week and tell people you're working 60.",

For all they know by just looking at your CV you could be 22. Obviously a 37 year old will look older when it gets to the in-person interview, but by then you're at least able to make your case.\n\nSadly ageism is a huge problem in the industry, but I've worked with people who have pivoted to CS at an older age, I think oldest was a junior dev in her 50s. So there are definitely companies willing to give older people a go.\n\nThe disability could be another issue. I don't agree with it at all, but sadly remote work is being more and more rare with at least 3+ days in the office being the norm here. Plus if you can't work full time obviously that puts you in a tight spot because I rarely see part time dev roles.

The piece of paper you get at the end is one thing, but what's more important are the general skills that you can learn from pursuing a college degree: time management on a progressively longer scale, learning independently, collaborating with other people.  Of course, these may be skills you have picked up from elsewhere, but if they are not (or if not to the level you would like), then this is an excellent opportunity to pick them up.  Note that these are not necessarily things that happen automatically, though; graduation requirements get you the piece of paper, but how you spend your time engaging with your coursework determines what skills you'll actually get out of your degree.  This is especially true if you're able to go full time and not worry about work during that time, because otherwise you will rarely have the time and energy to spend as you like on thinking and learning as you will during those 4 years.\n\nOn majoring in CS: choosing CS because you \"like math and computers\" is a much better rationale than choosing it because of the job market, and part of why there are a lot of people complaining about the job market now is because a lot of people entered this field only because of the second reason back when the market was good.  This of course does not guarantee you a job, but it does mean you're more likely to engage more deeply with the material in the degree, which means you will get more out of the degree one way or another.  That said, do you know whether the program will allow you to switch majors?  While you shouldn't switch out just because some class is harder than expected, if you discover that CS is really not for you, having the option to switch into something that better matches with your interests will make starting the program feel less constraining.\n\nOn getting a job after: Let's be honest, no one actually knows what the job market will look like 4 years from now.  Will it be challenging, especially with your nontraditional background?  Probably.  But would it be so bad that you would regret even \\*trying\\* in the first place?  Some people on this sub may say so, but that outlook has a nasty habit of becoming self-fulfilling.",

If you're picking CS because of remote work, you're mostly wasting your time unless you've been lucky with lottery tickets because remote job is the dream job.  Most roles require in-person nowadays.  \n\nDon't get fooled by the cheap or free tuition from the state if the bargain requires majoring in something CS or IT related. This field is way, way oversaturated thanks to Learn2Code.  With AI coming up to bat, this trend of AI eventually replacing IT workers and developers is IMHO irreversible and permanent.  \n\nLearn to become a plumber. Seriously.

Check out CS50 for a formal introduction, I've heard it's a bit difficult but it's a great intro to programming and CS fundamentals. The Odin Project is a great starter resource if you're into / want to try web development. \n\nIf you choose the school route, go to a community college first to save some money, then transfer to a state school. See if you qualify for any grants. If not, check out scholarships. \n\nRegardless of your decision, I don't think you should base it solely off of the opinions of people from the internet. Not saying you are, but I just wanted to make note. Do your own research, make a plan (budget, time, courseload) and look into possible programs. \n\nDo you have any connections in the industry? Even a connection in something software-adjacent, like IT, would be valuable. Any sort of connection would help. Even a help desk job, or some IT position on campus would be great, assuming it makes financial sense for you. \n\nSign up for CS50 or start The Odin Project to see if you enjoy this stuff. I can't speak for CS50, but the actual CS degree would be different from The Odin Project. The common ground is problem-solving. Just see if you enjoy the actual problem-solving process, whether it's practical or theoretical.\n\nBest of luck!",

The tech stack, the team, what your role will consist of, what the expecations of you will be, what an average day of a SWE looks like, what kinds of major projects are coming in the future, etc should *not be a surprise*. These are all things you should be asking about in the reverse interview.\n\nNext time you job hop, make it a point to reverse interview. Otherwise you're literally just rolling the dice that you'll end up at another place that you thought would be doing X, but is actualy doing Y. You need to be the one rejecting companies you don't want to work for.\n\nThat being said, I don't think your situation is that bad. Firstly, *you got a job*. In 2023, as a new grad. That's a win, regardless of the stack you're using.\n\nAlso, especially this early in your career, companies won't necessarily require an exact 1-1 match of their tech stack expectations. You know Java. That's big. You can learn Spring on the side, or even on the job, it's not that hard. Just because you haven't worked professionally with Spring doesn't mean you're unqualified for Java/Spring positions.\n\nAnecdotally, I've switched stacks completely many times. Companies aren't DQ'ing me because I have no experience in their stack. They know I can learn on the job, and my resume paints that picture. One company I was talking to used Java/Micronaut, which was a completely new concept for me. That interested me, I had some great conversations about it with my interviewers, its pros/cons compared to Spring, etc. I got an offer. My confidence, and my interest in learning the new tech, made up for lack of experience in a core technology that company used. You can do the same, swapping out Spring/Micronaut with GWT/Spring.\n\nAll that said, right now you're disqualifying youself without even trying. You've made this whole post freaking out about starting to find jobs... *but you haven't started lookign for a job*. You have no idea how it's going to go for you. Make sure your resume is on point, get rid of the negative thinking and start oozing confidence because you're an intelligent SWE that can pick new things up easily. Companies will see that. My confidence, warranted or not, is what gets me my jobs offers.",

Got a CS version of a minimum wage job (some IT help related role - my standards got worse as my desperation grew) to stop that 90 day clock and finally got my first interview after months of graduation - SDE at rainforest. *Had* to nail it and I did, which is a testament to how broken the market truly is because 90% of the jobs I'd applied to by that point were significantly less demanding. \n\n\nI did a couple of interviews after that funny enough, but one phone screen with each of them when I made it clear I was an international student made them lose all interest. I know this sub has a lot of hate towards internationals which is disheartening so I'm taking a chance with this comment - but in some ways we're much more impacted by this market than you are; most of the people I know are very capable and it'll take years to repay any loans if they are sent back. Everything in the US is run like a business, even education. A lot of universities have fairs in our countries selling us dreams of an elite American education and how we get to work for 3 years to pack back tuition, only for us to come here and realize nobody wants to give us a fair shot purely because hiring domestic workers is much easier (as it should be).",

How are they staying within the country?\n\nSome of them end up leaving. There are ways to stay, but for a lot of those people they need a legitimate job that pays legitimate money, and if they can't get that, then they end up having to leave because of not only immigration status but also finances.\n\n>Also, could this hiring freeze combined with the layoffs be intentional to make the foreigners leave the country without overstaying illegally on an expired visa? Basically slowing down hiring for 90 days until the foreigners on visa have to self deport?\n\nHiring freezes and layoffs are company-driven decisions. Those companies have no incentive to drive foreign workers out of the country - that would just make the cost of labor for them go up. Most companies want foreign workers to be available.\n\nSo this makes no sense. Companies are doing layoffs because layoffs = higher profits, and that has always been true.\n\n>If people on those visas do an unpaid internship, for example, can they stay in the country until they find a real paying job, even if it takes more than 90 days to find the job since they're not unemployed technically while doing an unpaid internship?\n\nYes. As long as it's a valid unpaid internship - i.e., an internship that is consistent with their field of study/profession. Like, on OPT you can't go get an unpaid job as a janitor and have it count. But you can, for example, work as an unpaid researcher for your former grad program (I've seen this done several times).\n\nAgain, the problem with that strategy is that you need to then have the finances to float you until you do find a job, which isn't something everyone can do. And in a lot of cases, if you get to that stage, a lot of people end up preferring to just go back to their home country and not have to deal with that situation.",

But in 2025, that probably won’t lead to a pathway into a more technical role, since most data science and ML roles are looking for either loads of experience or advanced education. \n\nSo yeah, I think an advanced degree would 100% be beneficial to your candidacy at companies.

Most people in the field have a degree, and it puts you on a level playing field.\n\nNot having the degree is going to close doors -- there's no way around it. That doesn't mean that there are no open doors for you, but it's going to limit you. Particularly if you ever think you might want to work in another country, your visa may hinge entirely on having a CS degree.\n\nWhen changing careers to software engineering, I went and did exactly what you are considering and got a Masters in CS. I have never even once had regrets, and many of the opportunities I've had wouldn't have been possible without it. If you have the time, and can afford the expense (I received a partial scholarship), I cannot recommend it enough.\n\nAdditionally, considering the current job market, it is so competitive for new grads right now that I don't think companies are taking risks on giving someone their first CS job with no work history and no degree. At this particular moment in time, I think it would be incredibly difficult to get your first job in the industry unless you already have personal connections to do so (getting the first job without a degree and proving yourself is the biggest hurdle) or are prepared to work for absolutely abysmal pay or conditions (which may have lifelong career repercussions -- people will probably know exactly how your previous employer paid you and treated you, and it can be a struggle for your wages to catch up even as you move to better and better companies). Getting the degree also gives time for the current job market to possibly improve, though I don't know I'd put money on it getting better so that's neither here nor there.",

Use whatever you can 'on the job' because it sounds much better, looks better and I'm no expert at lying.\n\n* **Learn Postgres for databases**. Easy to install and use. Make a new database with the UI and do CRUD operations. Can get up to speed in 1 day. Oracle isn't nearly as common as it used to be and MySQL is the cheapskate version of Oracle. MSSQL is good though.\n* **Learn one of AWS, Azure, GCP**. I used to think no one used GCP but I saw one company switch to it because it's cheaper. Recruiters were always cool with me only knowing 1 of the 3 since the others are easy to learn at that point. Using on the job goes a long way, else get an entry level cert that you see listed in a few job applications. The only cert that not a scam for this reason but it is crazy expensive. Thus your employer pays. Probably need a book or course and the exam has extra cheating detection.\n* **Learn one of Docker or Kubernetes**. You can learn both but there's some overlap. Pick what you see more in job descriptions. I guess Kubernetes and that's what I've seen more as well.\n* Microservices, yeah this is on the job experience. You can't teach yourself, or you can, but it won't matter to a recruiter.\n* Less important: Compliment Java with another language. Could be Python, Kotlin, Go aka Golang or TypeScript/JavaScript with your choice of React or Angular. Actually is important but if not used on the job, it ranks here.\n* Less important: Use Jetty with Spring Boot, preferably now on the job for local testing. I haven't used Tomcat on the job in 10 years. Cloud crap is taking over but local servers is a nice plus and they don't use cloud data. Bonus: Mock a database with JUnit + Mockito or PowerMock or whatever. You should know JUnit.",

Build a few small projects using React, deploy something simple to AWS, and set up a basic Kubernetes cluster locally - you don't need years of experience, just enough to speak intelligently about the concepts and show you can learn.\n\nI'm on the team that built [interview help AI](http://interviews.chat), and it's designed specifically for situations like this where you need to navigate tricky questions about skills gaps and position your experience in the best light during interviews.",

Jumping tracks will be difficult to near impossible without some sort of inflection (like getting a graduate degree from a top institution). \n\nThis is already how it works in other fields like law and finance. In finance there is retail finance and high finance. In law there’s big law raking in big bonuses and local firms that aren’t.

Interviewers might start using more original questions and guarding them from being posted publicly. Services like HackerRank seem to be pretty good for this already and probably have pretty large private question banks. The cheat detection tools will likely get more sophisticated too. \n\nIn person interviews might make a comeback. This has been said but they companies might start trending toward getting people on site for technicals.\n\nMove away from leetcode to open-ended technical questions. I have had just as many of these as leetcode style interviews, or at least some marriage of the two.\n\nPair programming. This is still probably one of the common ways to do a technical. My current job was gained through a pair programming exercise. Here you can put in a leetcode style puzzle that might be harder to see coming and cheat through. \n\nYes, I think it will trend away from purely online leetcode questions and LLMs are disruptive but they don’t necessarily spell the end of leetcode style interviews.",

When I got my new job they were offering me a good bump from my last job (about a 30% raise). When I told my GF (we live together) she looks at me and says \"OMG we will be able to buy so much for our house\".I dont want her to sound like she is money craved, it's more like she is a spend-mentality where i am save mentality. My mindset is I will live the same regardless of how much money I make (to a certain degree) and just save the rest and hoepfully retire younger. When I heard about the 30% raise my first thought was \"ok I can set about 10% of that to pay off some stuff from when I was unemployed, then when that's down invest that 10%, maybe with another 10% i will put in my savings/invest funds and then the last 10% will be for anything for us\". When she said that I was taken a bcak. My GF is someone who will pay and buy for her own things so I have never felt like she has cared about it. She'll buy me clothes even when I dont ask for it. She makes good money too. She has good money saved but when it comes for future money she hasnt really prepared well for it. She is definetely more of a spender than a buyer. \n\nTo your point about people not wanting to go down. I gave her some tips to help her save more and told her to put maybe a couple hundred bucks per paycheck. She did it and for over a month she was crying about how little her paycheck was now looking. Again this is a girl who makes 6 figures. I think she is around 105k and in a no-income state her take home is probably around 70k.",

It's not a great data source (uncontrolled factors like Indeed itself and changing in recruiting market), but it's a large signal that the overall field is not in a great place!\n\nThe other signal: [https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe\\_sbc.pdf](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe_sbc.pdf) is that unemployment for CS grads is higher than all 25-29 year olds, in a statistically significant way.

I'll have to shift focus away from X in order to do that though, so X won't get done\".\n\nI have 40 hours in a week. My manager/PM is in charge of deciding how I use those 40 hours, they get to choose my priorities, so if they want me to address something immediately, I will. But *I'm* in charge of setting expectations, and enforcing my professional boundaries of a 40 hour work week. So the question goes back to them, they can trade one priority for another. They don't get to tell me \"Everything's gotta get done\", that's just a sign of poor management if they try. Luckily for management though, a lot of SWE's are scared to establish professional boundaries, so they just decide to quietly do everything and inflate their hours beyond 40, which is not sustainable.\n\nWhen unknowns pop up in tickets that I've estimated, I very clearly communicate those things as early as possible. \"X, Y,and Z came up while doing this ticket. We can either make a 2nd ticket to tackle next sprint and close this one out partially complete, or we can include that increased scope as a part of this ticket and it'll carry over\".\n\nIt's all about how you respond. Obviously having completely clean sprints would be great, but that's rarely how things go. When things come up, tickets carry over. It's pretty normal.",

This varied by team, but sometimes someone would act as a point person for the sprint from other teams. I don't recall if this was the same person every sprint, or if two different people played the roles.\n\nPerhaps your manager would be open to tracking the additional work that way. It might also be helpful to track how much time is being spent either not fixing things the right way or poor planning. Some of what you're describing sounds like requirements might be inaccurate, which adds to these issues popping up. \n\nThere could also be an increased culture of testing. There used to be a practice back in the day that whoever broke the build was the new buildmaster until the next person. Or, you can rotate the role. It may give people more appreciation of what they are committing (realistically, there are some people who will never care). But if you go with a per-sprint role, maybe that can be a pointed ticket/story to cover that work. \n\nSounds like your manager might not like those ideas because they just want to push features, but it's worth at least having the discussion. It's real work, and it may help the team find ways to be more efficient in the long-term. \n\nAnother huge advantage of these rotations is spreading knowledge across the team. What happens if you're on vacation, or you're not longer on the team? This helps protect against that. It will also hopefully expand peoples' skillsets. It will help everyone and the team as a whole.",

So that discrepancy - like, $400-$500K - *that* is really tough to offset.\n\nBut if you're just sacrificing $25K a year, $75K total? That probably is worth getting a PhD.\n\nNow, [as some have commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l3ueaa/comment/mw3rrha/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) if you get your PhD in something ultra-specific, you might actually be limiting your career growth and potential. *But you don't have to*.\n\nA lot of people do their PhD in a relatively broad area of CS, or an area of CS that has applications acrosss industries and areas, and in that world you don't get the same negative impact of specialization.\n\nSo to me, that is important - if you go to do a PhD with a focus on going back to a corporate/industry job instead of staying in academia, then make sure you shape your PhD (research, publications, etc.) to match that. Don't let the incentives of your academic-minded colleagues and advisors (i.e., publications) to take precedence over your priorities (i.e., developing proof of skills that are valuable in the workplace).",

It almost seems silly to put something like solutions architect or especially cloud practitioner down when you already have X number of YOE. \n\nIf I saw that on someone’s resume it would at best not change my mind or at worst raise some flags as to why they’re getting a cert in the first place. If they work with it everyday, why study for a cert? Makes me suspect they either don’t use it as much as they say or they’re not confident in their skills / not very good.\n\nI’ve only ever seen people get the certs who are new to something or want to break into a role using it.",

I have interviewed for national laboratories before, and if you're capable of getting a high level security clearance - they actually really value MS degrees.

In one, I got into an argument with the founder of this company, and thinking it was okay, I just kept going. The recruiter called, and told me all about it. I just thought it was discussion. You don't want to work for people like that, who aren't comfortable enough with their decisions to entertain other ideas or viewpoints.\n\nAnother interview, I basically was used in a consulting mode: \"tell us exactly how you would solve this\", and the just kept drilling into these really small, and more practical concerns. I figured that one out during the interview, but it was no surprise one of the dudes in the room, taking notes, got the job. Tools.\n\nAnyway, you'll get a bunch of these stories. Remember, you are playing with probabilistic outcomes, so numbers on your side are good. If you can't be yourself in a professional way and pass an interview, working their will be a problem!",

When it's an employer's market, some hiring managers let the sway over applicants' lives get to their head and they pull stunts like this. Worst I personally received was the interviewer refusing to discuss the job or my qualification and spent 20 minutes asking me triva about the history of the organization while they fruitlessly tried to resolve tech issues on their end and shouting \"turn up your microphone, I can't hear you\". It was an old man claiming to be a senior SWE who'd muted his desktop speakers at some point during his little trivia performance...\n\nIts almost as bad as my first and only technical interview at google, where the interviewer asked me to turn on my webcam, looked me up and down and just played angry birds on their phone and spun around in their chair, slouched and despondent after putting up a leetcode hard with 15 minutes to solve it.\n\nOP, terrible interviewing practices are very common- take it as a sign you wouldn't have been better off working there and keep plugging elsewhere.",
