Jupyter Hub too, you don't need it, it's just a collaboration tool and not sure why it would be recommended to use. Jupyter notebooks yes, but Jupyter Hub? MLFlow makes sense, orchestration is important, and I have never use Feast but I feel this section doesn't tell me what I want to know in this context. You list different AI models, which is also a bit awkward considering how much they change, but why not list ML models like Tensorflow Keras or XGBoost/Catboost? \n\nTo be even more honest, I don't think your audience will get past the first row of tools. If somebody is looking at this to learn, they'll stop there because why bother with the other tools when AI and vibe coding can do it all?",

But for “frontend data engineering”, as i call it, the data is all there, but you’re just finding the data with optimized queries and transforming and loading into a dashboard or whatever. For some, that’s enjoyable. For me, not so much. \n\nThen “backend data engineering” is more storage, modeling, and infrastructure. \n\nYou can def up skill with tools like spark and airflow to automate some of those processes. Those skills def transfer to “backend” data engineering a bit more. \n\nAlso, use Python.",

You can find software engineers specializing in multiple different specificities but they’re still someone who writes code to solve a problem. Same for DEs: they write code and design systems to solve data problems. Analyzing data and working with business requirements around data systems is also part of it. Creating reports can also be part of it (although that’s more of a data analyst thing in my opinion).\n\nGenerally you will find multiple different realms of data engineering when looking for jobs. To me it sounds like you need to be more specific with yourself about what exactly it is that you are interested in within DE (is it writing Spark ETL jobs? Is it writing SQL pipelines? Is it working with Kafka/streaming systems?) and then filter your job search based on that.",

We started with accounting data, because it was the cleanest and slowly migrated the data silos into centralized database. If we met any resistance, we told them that if they wanted their data reflected in the monthly report, it had to come from the centralized database. Since the report was highly visible, they had to agree and after some initial growing pains (mostly historical data cleanup and arguments about what to name things), the automation and built in error-checking won people over. \n\n\nI've worked with a lot of organizations since then and most of them don't have the demand or the inter-departmental communication necessary to break down data silos. It sounds good in theory but if the marketing team only cares about marketing data and doesn't mind getting financial data a month late, then why go throught the considerable time and effort to build a third system to combine marketing and financial data? Especially if after the system is created, you have train people on how to use it, how to keep the data clean, and how to maintain the 3rd system. ",

This process, known as *aggregate navigation*, must be *open* so that every report writer, query tool, and BI application harvests the same performance beneﬁts. A properly designed set of aggregates should behave like database indexes, which accelerate query performance but are not encountered directly by the BI applications or business users. Aggregate fact tables contain foreign keys to shrunken conformed dimensions, as well as aggregated facts created by summing measures from more atomic fact tables. Finally, *aggregate OLAP cubes* with summarized measures are frequently built in the same way as relational aggregates, but the OLAP cubes are meant to be accessed directly by the business users.\n\n[https://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/kimball-techniques/dimensional-modeling-techniques/aggregate-fact-table-cube/](https://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/kimball-techniques/dimensional-modeling-techniques/aggregate-fact-table-cube/)",

I then took the leap into cloud native data engineering in 2021\n\nInstead of slowly making the transition and building alongside a team that knew what they were doing I ended up a tech lead by the end of 2022. IMO this never should have happened and I ended up stepping back to senior. This has hurt me in some respects trying to find my next role but that's off topic\n\nWith no awareness of cloud tooling I originally built a skillset in SSIS. Weirdly - maybe due to the fact that I was still largely a dev day to day - nobody would give me the time of day when I tried to find roles in that area from like 2018 onwards. I largely credit COVID/full remote/zero interest rates and the explosion of hiring for even getting interviews for cloud native jobs as my dev job never had cloud native options. I still wonder if I'd have even broken into the field at all without that\n\nAs to how I'm managing - I've really been on the \"learn outside of work to the point of burnout\" trail for the last 3 years. I was a SQL heavy dev so no issues there but I still don't think I know enough about anything else. This gets more complicated because my current role is analytics for security teams so I'm also doing SIEM work and chasing security certifications...\n\nI always get by in my roles by being passable at things the teams I work in can't even get started. As a data engineer that's been teaching everyone Git, CI/CD, and infrastructure stuff, or in my current team doing actual security work in the SIEM/SOAR space\n\nI've written far too much but there's lots to share I guess.

Especially large ones. Often the people conducting the interviews are themselves out-of-date in their knowledge, and ask the types of questions you mention, because that's how it was done ten years ago are they haven't changed much since then. Your final thoughts there \"Felt very surface-level and disorganized — no discussion of pipelines, tooling, architecture, or even team dynamics,\" are very indicative of how it will be to work there. Expect disorganized approaches to projects with a lack of technical leadership on best practices with a modern data stack.

After models are stable, point PowerBI at the warehouse and retire the spreadsheets one by one. Airbyte is fine for extraction later, but don’t let learning a new tool block progress; the first victory is seeing yesterday’s data appear without manual clicks. For orchestration, Prefect is lightweight and fits your Python skills-start with a single flow and add tasks as needs grow. I tried Fivetran and Airbyte, but DreamFactory let me expose secure REST APIs from legacy SQL boxes so the warehouse could pull fresh data without extra connectors.

The idea is to build slim vertical slices rather than horizontal layers. And the benefit is that you learn most from first try in each step (also about mistakes of the steps before), so you don't make the same mistakes in the next slice.\n\nWith layers you increase the chance of making a mistake andnhaving to correct it in all parts of the layer only after you've already started the next layer. It's a mess and its wasteful.\n\nThis will be especially true if you've never build an ETL or DataMarts before.",

I’ll start with a raw dump, build dim_date and a slim fact table, wire up a simple report, then loop back to fix naming or grain issues while the blast radius is tiny. Once that slice feels solid, adding purchase or inventory tables becomes copy-paste instead of redesign. Airbyte’s plug-and-play extractor will get the first two tables moving, Fivetran could handle the ERP later, but DreamFactory still helps me expose a couple oddball legacy views over REST without extra drivers. Keeping scope to two tables forces me to learn the full path and keeps rework cheap-exactly what I need right now. Vertical slices first so I can learn fast without drowning in scope.",

Consider pivoting this to a human in the loop approach where your agents generate detailed remediation plans and PR suggestions, but require approval. This would still save the manual work while avoiding the uncontrolled automation scenario.\n\nThe real value is in the detection and recommendation capabilities you've built. Your agent system could be powerful for automatically identifying pipeline issues, suggesting fixes, and even generating test code - all while keeping humans in the driver's seat for final decisions. This approach is especially valuable when managing complex data ecosystems where schema changes ripple across multiple sources like Windsor.ai's extensive connector library.

Multiple excel tabs instead of 1 expected tab?\n\nEssentially my point is the folks creating the raw data that you then ingest as \"raw\" data in bronze layer are often times front desk staff who dont know what excel even is - there is huge variance. We can't reject every other row in real life, that data needs to be cleansed and ingested/used for x purpose(s) (because we pay for it, or responsibility to load it or whatever the use case is). \n\nWhat you've built is really cool, and teams out there would pay you big bucks to get this sort of pipeline operating efficiently, assuming you can course correct for the above scenarios.",

European data engineering interviews tend to favor real-world scenarios like writing SQL queries to solve business problems, designing data pipelines, or explaining how you'd handle data quality issues. The coding portions usually involve manipulating datasets, working with APIs, or demonstrating your understanding of data structures in a practical context. If you do encounter the occasional algorithmic question, it's often more forgiving and focused on problem-solving approach rather than memorizing optimal solutions. I'm on the team that built [interview copilot AI](http://interviews.chat), and we've seen this pattern consistently - European data engineering interviews focus more on practical skills, though having a tool to help navigate any curveball questions can definitely give you confidence going in.",

Our golang devs were shocked when compressed XML-based GML over REST trounced serialized avro over REST and flatgeobuf protobuf over gRPC in performance testbeds. They expected nothing to touch protobuf over gRPC, much less have xml over rest beat it so badly.

You want to know how to parse things like addresses or names into components, with different rules for different types of addresses/names. You want to figure out which aspects can be ignored or moved around, or can have specific changes.\n\nEven when you have it working well, it is still only 90%, and the last of it is always a continuous manual process of fixing things that didn't quite work, and your rule set just can't handle the subtleties that a person can manually implement.\n\nA great annoyance is the business looks at it and thinks 'this is easy for me to figure out, why can't you just write an algo for it? it should be easy' - not understanding how trying to implement all the nuance of human understanding is impossible.

That way people can just query the Parquet file to get link(s) to where they can download the dataset.\n\nFor the DGUIDs, I have to be really careful. I don't want to say that I have modified any statistical information, so I have emailed Statistics Canada with the blog post I made, so hopefully they address some of these issues. I could do the fixes on the client-side and call it **backfill-dguid**, so the user is aware they are back-filling the field.\n\n**Edit:** For the DGUID I want to experiment with linking to Overture Maps, as they have boundaries on places/divisions. They have something called GERS \\[4\\] that I can link to, that is a stable ID throughout time. Look at the interactive table that I sent you, there's tons of data from outside of Canada, they just have no idea how to link it to statcan data.

I won't get into them here, but say for instance Fuzzy Matching is involved. Sometimes the fraud team will keep these secret since if folks were aware of the nature of the detection analytics they could circumvent them. I'm referring to sophisticated stuff you can't really do this in PowerBI, not basic calculations or lookups. \n\n- If this access is absolutely necessary, the fraud team should make every effort to limit who on their team can view the data, they should have procedures for granting access, and document who has access and who approved it, ie I wouldn't advise a \"free-for-all\" but I would be pretty upset if PII was restricted. \n\n- I had access because I was one of the 'trusted few' at the company. I was maybe one of 10~ employees out of 100k employees who had the level of access needed to conduct this work, the others being legal, the CEO, CFO, etc. There were maybe 50+ other folks in my org, but the PII was masked for the rest of the employees. They could download aggregated statistics from dashboards, but not the PII or row-level data. \n\n- You may want to involve in-house Legal. Anytime I granted access to the raw PII data, we involved legal. \n\n- There are excel-level controls, like encryption and security, you can tell the team must be enabled anytime they send an email - we did this as a policy. There's no real way to enforce it, but we'd always encrypt the emails and the excel file if we ever shared it. \n\n- On that note, aren't there controls in your company which monitor the sending & sharing of Excel documents? ie if it is ever exported to a flash drive or printed? \n\n- Speculating here - I think Microsoft has a data governance tool, Purview, which might detect things like PII containing columns and restrict the sharing of the excel report? Might want to look into that. I briefly used it but can't speak to its applicability or effectiveness in this situation. \n\nJust my thoughts - could also maybe learn from them exactly what procedures they need to do in excel and see if you can design queries to handle it? I could see the financial industry being a bit more sensitive than where I worked so, these controls might not be enough.",

Row-level policies masked PANs to last-4 unless the user had the fraud role, and even they got an auto-expire token after 24 h. Every extract got watermarked with the ticket number so leaks were traceable.\n\n\n\nIf your stack is mostly Databricks, hook the VDI to Delta Sharing or Power Query so analysts still build pivots. For quick looks, spin up a Squirrel SQL style web viewer that limits results to 10 k rows.\n\n\n\nI’ve tried Immuta and Privacera, but DreamFactory slots in nicely when you need to expose just a few masked endpoints to vendors without opening the whole lake.\n\n\n\nThe safest move is to isolate Excel in a monitored sandbox instead of banning it.",

They can also update a CRM through its API endpoints, but that's not too different from doing so in any other CRUD apps, and your average analyst won't have the necessary permissions nor skill to handle authentication to use those endpoints.\n\nIn a larger context, the unmet need this feature is trying to solve is a common one: analysts often get asked if they can add some kind of write-back to their reports, such as documenting decisions, comments, events. If you end up working somewhere that has such a need and that extensively uses Power BI and Fabric, using these can be a great quick solution for enforcing clean data entry without having to build a full CRUD app, and it clearly beats using spreadsheets with no data validation for inputs.",

Follow up with a dbt rewrite; the model tests catch bad assumptions you didn’t realise you made. Drill the planner-explain analyze will teach you more about skew than any blog post. When stuck, screenshot the plan and compare it to the Spark DAG; patterns start to click. Keep a scratch sheet of oddball functions (lateral, array\\_agg, conditional windows) and fold one into every practice query so it sticks.

It’s also resume-friendly and much cheaper than tuition.\n\nIf you're leaning toward school, look for programs with strong co-op/internship pipelines (like Northeastern, Georgia Tech’s OMSA, or UCSD’s MAS Data Science).

That’s why Spark (that originally was meant for parallel processing) usually goes along with Hadoop File System (HDFS).\nWith this setup you can simply pick a CSV file, manipulate with Sprk, and then store in another location.\n\nNow let's complicate a little bit the situation: for example you can still store records as CSV table but want to enforce a schema, in this case you can spin up a Spark cluster with Hive Metastore (it’s just an external small database to store metadata of your tables). This allows you for partitioning, clustering, grant RBAC, ...\n\nIn the last 20 years more complicated file types have been enforced in data engineering, like Parquet (think of it as a self describing CSV which has an header with column names and data type) and Iceberg.\n\nI don't know if this answer your question but to recap basically you need to combine a query engine with a metadatastore to have a complete database/datawarehouse otherwise you can only transform data from point A to point B.",

Without a metastore, you'd check storage directly.\n\nBut if the table not already existing doesn't affect the required logic, you can just write in overwrite or append mode without the need to handle table existence. Either will implicitly create non-existing targets.\n\nFor pure DDL operations (just creating a table, not writing any data), if you're using the SQL API then `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` [is available](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-syntax-ddl-create-table-datasource.html).\n\n> can add some parameters to your query to do it ?\n\nYes. Notebook widgets (not advised, notebooks are poor code artefacts), script or function arguments. But you may want to pin this to the runtime state (or lack of) of the target table, a config value, or some combination of these.\n\nTypically what Spark code for data warehousing \"looks like\" is some sort of workflow orchestration using a DAG, in something like Luigi/Airflow/Dagster (and/or dbt), which will invoke stuff (scripts, notebooks, dbt runs) as needed and with the required parameters.\n\nYou can totally run dbt against Spark, the connector is [officially supported](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/spark-setup).",

I don't really recommend it for most use cases. \n\nConnections and editing in Grafana is a simpler experience but it has its own annoying quirks (the plotting UX is underwhelming and has weird data transform abstractions that I find myself fighting with rather than enjoying) and it's generally not as flexible as I would like it to be. I don't use any of the advanced alerting features. I'd like to, but I haven't figured them out yet. My favorite part of Grafana is the units and formatting support, it really is nice and convenient. It's not great, but it's better than superset.\n\nNiFi gets a lot of hate, but I am a firm believer in \"there's a time and place for every tool\". The time and place that NiFi was developed for was the NSA. A lot of the stuff that it was good at was classified and got dropped when it was published. Now, Nifi is good for moving data around from point to point, not data transformations. You'll want something else for more advanced data transformation, such as something with real scripting language support (nifi's code editor sucks ass. Basic user interface tasks are also hidden behind different context menus and it's a pain to use, generally. The JOLT processor advanced interface is pretty good though). It is however an okay tool for setting up long-running batch processing jobs from your database to something else where you want to have visual feedback. I set up a number of web scraping flows with it (not really a good use case) and I'm looking to migrate to something that sucks less.\n\nDagster and Airflow are the NiFi alternatives you'll want to consider. I have used Airflow in the past, and am considering moving some of my existing data transformations to Airflow.\n\nI have no complaints about Postgres. Postgres owns.",

        "body": "> do modern BI systems need an analytics Database\n\nTechnically no, in practice yes. \n\n\nThe reason is that productive systems like ERP are built for recording transaction data, i.e. a fine-grained log of events and facts. Technically this translates into lots of short-lived requests to the system, e.g. \"store this order\", \"lookup this invoice\" etc. That is, the system load per request is low. \n\n\n\nThis is different for analysis oriented queries, where we typically want to show aggregate results, e.g. \"order volume in the last 3 months, grouped by product / region / customer segment\" or \"show \nall customers who's order volume over the last 3 months is less than their average over the previous 12 months\".\n\n\nThese aggregated queries require a different data model, at least a different set of indexes v.v. the data model for the transaction system, aka operational database. Of course it's technically possibly to run these aggregate queries against the operational database directly, however it will strain its resources and potentially result in bad performance for end users.\n\n\nAnother aspect to consider is that the data needed to answer these kind of queries often span multiple systems, e.g. orders are tracked in one system, invoices in another. That is, we have to combine data from different systems, which is notoriously difficult (as in requires dedicated effort) unless there is an infrastructure that supports it.\n\n\nWith this in mind, it is easier to build a seperate database that is optimized for aggregate queries, and does not interfere with the operational database.\n\n\nRegarding the argument against storing data multiple times: That's a very common objection and it sounds logical. You don't want arbitrary copies of data stored just about everywhere - that's a valid concern. However, the need to serve analytics demands are equally valid, and following the above line of argument, they require a different technical setup. So there's a trade-off between avoiding data duplication, and the need to have well-performing systems for both operational and analytics needs.\n\n\nThey key is to build the analytics database (whatever you call it) by a controlled and managed process, that is the data is not stored arbitrarily, but the process is designed to keep the data up to date, the purpose of the duplication is to serve analytics needs, and there is ownership assigned.",

I would get familiar with some scripting, cloud providers like Azure, AWS, and GCP. Learn some warehousing skills. I personally like Docker even though more for DevOps but it’s great to know also maybe a little bit of Linux. Writing docker files/yml is good to know don’t need to be an expert at every single thing again knowing the basics and when to use should suffice. Yes orchestration like airflow and some knowledge of APIs. I believe you don’t have to be the super expert but knowing how these applications/services work would be a great benefit. Try to avoid buzzwords, HR/recruiter and new shiny tools every 5 mins there’s always going to be something new. Focus on your fundamentals and add databricks DBT? something solid be open and honest and think about what’s useful? Why is it useful for this scenario etc. lastly a visualization tool Tableau/Looker etc. Good luck you got this.",

Get comfortable packaging Python jobs in containers, wiring them into CI/CD, and writing tests with pytest; that’s the bridge from classic ETL to modern DE. Learn dbt for in-warehouse transforms so you can show you can model data the “analytics” way, and skim Spark only enough to talk partitioning and schema evolution-real heavy lifting there is less common than the hype suggests. Fivetran covers the boring ingestion so you can focus on orchestration; I’ve also kept DreamFactory in the mix when I need instant REST endpoints over old SQL Server tables. With that stack you can pitch yourself as a senior who happens to be deep on Microsoft rather than a mid-level up-skiller. Main point: layer modern tooling on your existing strengths and you’ll stay competitive.",

The cost structure becomes attractive at scale since you're paying for compute that auto scales vs. Snowflake's storage+compute model. Foundry is overkill if you're not doing heavy government/defense work or need their specific ontology features.\n\nFor the business case, hit up your Databricks rep as mentioned, they'll build you a TCO model that accounts for your specific data volumes and use cases. In my experience, Databricks wins on cost once you're processing substantial data volumes, but Snowflake can be cheaper for smaller analytical workloads. Consider your data ingestion strategy, tools like Windsor.ai can streamline data feeds to any of these warehouses, giving you flexibility to switch platforms later without rebuilding connectors.\n\nRun a pilot on a subset of your current workloads to get real performance/cost metrics. Leadership responds better to actual numbers than to theoretical comparisons. Also consider operational overhead, Databricks requires more hands on management than Snowflake, so factor in your team's capabilities when making the pitch.",

I’d slot three extras into your flow:\n\n\n\n1) Add a migration tool like Flyway or Liquibase so learners manage schema changes with versioned scripts and rollback drills instead of ad-hoc DDL edits.\n\n\n\n2) Wire up a tiny CDC stream (Debezium + Kafka or even a Postgres logical slot to stdout) so students watch bad updates ripple downstream, then trace them back upstream.\n\n\n\n3) Cap it with a contract-test stage in CI: Great Expectations for row-level rules, a schema diff gate, and a quick load test that fires malformed payloads generated by property-based fuzzing. Scraping the pgAdmin logs after that is an eye-opener.\n\n\n\nI’ve leaned on dbt tests and Datafold diffing for similar demos, and DreamFactory slid in nicely when I needed the REST layer auto-generated instead of babysitting custom endpoints.\n\n\n\nThose tweaks keep the sandbox lean while exposing every failure surface in a way that mirrors day-to-day work.",

I think contracts are great (I'm writing the book on the subject), but I think it deserves its own course and might make the course too big.

Kick it off with a tiny wal2json slot and have a sidecar script echo each update; once they break the login flow the console floods and they instantly see the pattern. Pair that with Flyway’s repeatable migration files-rollback drills feel more natural when they type flyway undo instead of hunting for the right DDL snippet. For contracts, strip it to a single Great Expectations suite that only checks the critical login table; learners learn the pattern without drowning in rules. I’ve used FireHydrant for chaos drills and Datafold for diff diffing, while Pulse for Reddit quietly surfaces edge-case questions from learners before they hit support. End the module by toggling the bad schema back and showing green tests, then stress-test with a ten-row fuzzing script so they feel the full cycle. That live-fire loop is what makes the lesson stick.",

All streaming pipelines serialize to Protobuf\n2. All Protobuf schemas are shared via a monorepo\n\nCombined you get quite a strong consistency model for data interaction at the streaming level. Protobuf is backwards/forwards compatible, and it doesn't care about the field name only its integer ID. That solves 99% of the data interaction mismatches.\n\nHaving said that you're still ultimately persisting to a database somewhere, and that part will require an unavoidable migration. This is where the hack-ish solutions are usually found. Usually here you either go with the slow-but-safe versioning approach or with a simpler 'all downstream services upgrade simultaneously' one. Or just don't rename a field unless there's a strong business requirement. Pick your poison.\n\n\nEDIT: there is actually a cleaner option for column renaming in *some* databases, though I personally haven't used it. You could create a new column that defaults to values from the old one. For example in ClickHouse you could do this:\n\n    CREATE TABLE example (\n        old_name String,\n        new_name String DEFAULT old_name\n    )    \n\nThis effectively creates an alias for the same field (at the cost of duplicated storage), and  you can then slowly deprecate the old field at your leisure. The caveat being that inserts into the new column won't be visible in the old one. I don't necessarily recommend going this route, but it would prevent going down the versioning rabbit-hole.",

Even something lightweight like duckdb or a cloud based pgsql could work, especially if you’re layering a BI tool or dashboarding solution on top. But that does add more setup and ongoing maintenance.\n\nIf not, and you’re mainly just showing charts or summaries from selected batches, then pandas might honestly be enough. You could just scan the folder, load only what’s needed based on the user’s selection, and cache results to keep things snappy. That keeps things simple and flexible, especially if your files aren’t massive.\n\nIf I were you I would first answer these questions:\n\n- How big are the csv files, roughly? A few MBs or closer to GBs?\n\n- Are the column structures consistent across files, or do they change?\n\n- Does anyone on your team need to explore the raw data themselves, or are you the one curating all the views?\n\n- How often is new data added to the data lake?\n\n- Are there any heavy computations or aggregations you’re doing often that would benefit from SQL?\n\nAnd then, \nOnce you know the answers to those, it’ll be a lot easier to decide if you need a proper database layer or if a well organised pandas workflow can get the job done.",

Cache the converted parquet once at ingest, store minimal metadata (batchid, path, row count) in a tiny SQLite file so you can list options instantly, and use Streamlit’s st.cachedata to avoid rereading the same files. When the data volume finally outgrows laptop RAM, you can point the same parquet set at a warehouse like Snowflake without rewriting code.

PostgREST works fine as long as the query patterns are predictable; cache the common ones at Cloudflare edge with a long TTL so the box only sees cold misses. For uncached ad-hoc queries, set a hard timeout and ask clients to batch. If you really want to squeeze the VPS, move the Parquet layer to a Trino or DuckDB service and only ingest the hot partitions into Postgres nightly; that keeps storage and vacuum overhead low. I kicked the tires on Hasura and Postgraphile, but DreamFactory ended up easiest when I needed a quick autogen REST layer with per-key RBAC. Finally, measure disk random read before anything else-IOPS is what will bite you way before CPU or memory. Cheapest path is well-tuned Postgres plus aggressive caching.",

If you’d rather avoid code, point PostgREST at the database: views become endpoints, row-level security handles auth, and you deploy a single container. Supabase is basically PostgREST plus auth and storage if you need hosted options.

It's very simple to learn: data exists somewhere, we extract it, we do things with it.  But there are 1000s of ways of doing this.\n\nSometimes even the engineers themselves are unable to explain how data hops from place to place, or why. I've found doing 'walk-throughs' of the data pipeline to be incredibly valuable, and they are easier to understand when someone sketches it out by hand on a white board or paper instead of just pulling up random scripts and expecting you to understand code with zero context. \n\nAnd, in general in the corporate world, always assume that every single person you're going to talk to is a horrible teacher,  gives you no context that you need, or does not understand the context you're missing.\n\nFor example, your first day you may sit down with someone and they will say \"we take data for daily crude futures, run it through our model, and load it into this report\" or whatever.\n\nThey will not explain why they are doing that. They might just assume you know what a \"crude future is\", how it helps the firm, why the data needs to be prepared a certain way, why they look at things with one language vs the other, etc.\n\nWorse, maybe they won't teach you at all. Maybe they know you don't know any of this stuff, and will not want to spend time teaching you.\n\nOne piece of knowledge or behavior you learn this year, when you're young, compounds for decades, so it is incredibly important and valuable for you to maximize the amount you learn. You do this by being annoying sometimes and asking dumb questions.\n\nVery, very often interns are terrified to ask questions, so, they often do  narrowly-scoped tasks and never understand what it is or why they are doing it.\n\nA healthier approach is to adopt the opposite mindset: be terrified of NOT asking questions. Anytime you feel the 'feeling' of confusion, it's a very good thing, embrace confusion, become addicted to it, since that feeling is actually your brain learning.\n\nNot being confused is a bad thing, it means you're overconfident, which will make you very dumb over time.",

As a contractor, you have to pay the employer component of a number of taxes and other contributions, see below.\n\n\nUnlike full time employees, you are also taking on the significant risk of your contact not getting renewed at the drop of a hat. Contractors are always cut first when projects are completed or budgets get tight. Btw once there, don't let them death-march you to the finish line while only paying 40 hours per week with a promise that \"it gets better when we're done\". They will cut you off without remorse, I've seen it myself. That risk needs to get paid to reimburse you for any gaps between contracts spent looking for a new one.\n\n\nAll this to say it is customary for contractors  to charge significantly more per hour than a full time employee, between 50% and 100% more.\n\n\nThis recruiter is trying to pull a fast one on you because they sensed your lack of knowledge. Consider yourself informed, and use chat gpt to give you a professional phrase to let them know that you are aware that they are full of shit. Read below for details, and Google for employee vs contractor tax calculators to work out what your break even rate should be.\n\n\nhttps://accountinginsights.org/irs-worker-classification-employee-vs-contractor/",

The merge key column is null fir these. Then I merge and update based on merge key = primary key and update the end date to close the old record and on the insert clause I insert everything from the second set.  This includes records with new keys and the latest version of records with existing keys. \n\n\n So when the merge key is matched then update and when it's null then insert.  You build the rows you want to insert and update in the selects in using clause.  Hope that makes sense.  ",

Here i would use dlt because i work there.  \n2. see if you can generalise the cleanup - if yes, then you probably will have an easier time to write some cleanup methods and reuse them before loading the data, while you are still in python  \n3. If you already loaded the data then generalising will be hard since you cannot programatically apply rules to columns anymore (unless you go back out of sql and generate the sql). So I would only do small cleanups in sql rather than the bulk work.",

Retain the original address string, regex the zipcode out (there's probably one some mad bastard wrote out there) into the zipcode column, take the rest of the string and dump it out into the street address column.  You now have three columns: `original_address`, `street_address`, `zip_code`. Layer on top of that with more lookups for cities if you want.\n\nThe most advanced thing you can do is pay for an address API which will take your address as a string and then return where it thinks it is along with a confidence value.  Anything below a certain confidence value you review.",

        "body": "When you're running commands on a CLI, there are actually two\\* different pieces of software running. The \"terminal\" (or terminal emulator/tty/console) is the actual thing that you see on your screen that you can click and type in, and see characters on. Underneath that is the \"shell,\" which is software that knows how to take character sequences and interpret it as commands, and can then run those commands. If you type \"ls\" and hit enter, the terminal is what shows you what you just typed and the results, while the shell is the thing that was able to locate the \"ls\" command and run it. You can interchangeably use any terminal (e.g. iterm, konsole, ptyxis, ghostty, kitty) with any shell (e.g. sh, bash, fish, zsh, nushell).\n\nSSH, \"Secure SHell,\" is an encrypted server-client protocol for communicating with a shell on another machine. You still use the same terminal emulator locally, you still type in your commands and see the results. But behind that, instead of calling to a shell that's running on your machine (accessing your files, running your binaries, etc), you're sending all your keystrokes over the network to another box that has an SSH server running (called sshd). Then that SSH server acts sort-of like the terminal on that remote box, passing those keystrokes to the shell, which then runs commands on that machine (with their files, binaries, etc) and gives back the results.\n\nWhen devs say SSHing to another server, they really mean interacting with a shell\\*\\* on that server, from the comfort of their machine.\n\n\\* I'm simplifying a bit. Details @ [https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/](https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/)  \n\\*\\* Well, really SSH supports arbitrary data transfer. You can do port tunneling, send files over it (it's the default backend for scp and rsync), run GUIs remotely over a desktop gateway, whatever. But usually people don't call it \"SSHing\" in these other cases.",

This is especially true in your case because the response says \"their expectations\" which suggests that you're getting the information secondhand.\n\nThey might have said the same thing even if there was nothing *wrong* with your code, but they had 10 applicants and one of them did slightly better than you, by whatever subjective criteria they're using to judge your code.\n\nAs far as actual issues go: As already mentioned, you allow the player to spend more than 3 credits on a spin, which violates the spec. But more importantly, you made up a formula that increases the payout if the player spends more, and you did it in a way that would be a **big problem** if this were a real casino. With a wager of 3 credits, the house has a significant advantage (a player will lose 1.333 credits per play on average). But with the way you're calculating payouts, a player who wagers 6 credits or more has a positive expected return per play, so they can easily just bankrupt the casino by playing repeatedly.\n\nAlso, this is a much smaller issue, but your test code in `SuccessfulGameTest` seems kind of sketchy to me. For one thing, I really don't like the structure of making all your test cases being dependent on running in a specific order, because it means you can't test them separately. For another, you're not *meaningfully* testing the final balance; if you start with 10000 credits and spend 800, then checking whether the final balance is >=800 tells you nothing about whether the payouts were correct.",

None of the little failure cases are tested, like \"what if we withdraw a negative amount of money?\" You have code to handle it, which is good, but code should be tested. The most important part of your gambling game is the Reel logic, and you have no tests for that.\n* Your tests are kind of unusual. Most tests I see are self-contained at the method level. They set up a situation from scratch, they exercise the system, and they examine the result. Your test methods each run one part of a larger scenario. That's not necessarily wrong. It even comes across as readable and maybe is the best way to do it, but it did give me a \"huh?\" moment, which might be bad for an interview project.\n* The main logic of your game is, to me, oddly organized. You have a \"CreditStoreService,\" which is fine, but its interface is \"takes arbitrary logic to manipulate the balance.\" Why doesn't the credit store service just have deposit, withdraw, reset, and checkBalance methods? Why put the business logic of how to modify balances in the controllers and also the game service?\n* When a game is played, you simulate the result before checking whether the player was allowed to play. This has no side effects, so it's fine, but it struck me as odd.\n\nStill, all in all, a reasonably fine project. I don't see any obvious red flags. I'd probably let a project like this through the screening.",

Companies had rooms full of manuals, and you had to look up, or photocopy, or buy your own documentation to know the api, usage etc.\n\nThen HTML arrived, actually IBM had another online format, but very similar just before html. At any rate, people who used the online documentation were more productive than those still reliant on paper, the change happened and today no one even considers having a paper copy of documentation (seldom anyway). The old guys were like \"What you can't remember that api?\". They were soon out-produced by the newer guys.\n\nNext came stack overflow, and other question / answer assists, and productivity increased for those that used it. Soon, it was required knowledge if you wanted to be competitive. Again, old mentality guys said \"You don't already know that? You have to look it up?\". Again, outdistanced soon.\n\nI'm sure you get the pattern. \n\nAI is the next documentation tool. This time the \"example\" code it provides is even closer to what you need.

When I see \"Agree\" or \"Disagree\", but they make similar points, then they have a different understanding of what they thought OP said.\n\nOK, so I'll start. I think OP believes learning a bunch of languages just to learn them is not good, at least, not at the start. Instead, pick a language, and begin solving problems, and not just learning how to write \"Hello, World\" in a dozen languages. \n\nOP did suggest that learning new languages didn't teach him more than Javascript did, but he admits that maybe some of that was failing to take a deeper dive in any of the languages.\n\nI don't think OP is saying every language is the same, but if s/he is saying that, I disagree.\n\nAs an analogy, this is like saying, what's important about learning a spoken language is what you want to talk about, i.e., the ideas, and not the words you use (which depend on language), and yet, you can be well spoken in English and don't know how to say the same thoughts in another language.\n\nWhy is it challenging? Natural languages like French or Japanese have a huge vocabulary compared to the syntax of a language. In particular, verb tenses are tricky for most. On top of that is learning the grammar, Is it subject-verb-object? Also, pronouncing words is really hard. Many non-Chinese speakers struggle with the tones in Chinese (assuming they don't also speak a tonal languages). On top of that, there are cultural differences, slang, whether to speak in complete sentences or to drop certain words, etc.\n\nProgramming languages don't have that complexity. But to say they are all the same is also wrong. For example, if you know Javascript well, but tried to learn Prolog, you'd struggle trying to find equivalent concepts. Prolog is that different from Javascript.\n\nHaving said that, I generally agree with the basic premise which is learn a language well enough to solve problems. Don't learn a bunch of languages early on, esp. superficially where you can't solve problems in any of them.\n\nMy minor quibble is the language does matter, at least, to how you think about a solution. Doing OO programming where you create classes and objects differs from doing procedural programming where you don't do that. That also differs from doing functional programming. You need to adjust how you think about programming. But in a sense, it doesn't matter which style who pick, just pick one and don't keep switching languages to know a bunch of them at a surface level.",

The industry has already enough of this kind of dev and has (had?) insatiable hunger for mediocre workers.\n\nIf one wants to gain more insight though, one needs to get in contact with other languages and how they work and solve problems in them. Then out of the specific experiences with different primitives to work with, one forms a more educated overall picture and expertise.\n\nDon't obsess, alright, I agree, but don't assume, that because you have used Java, Python, JavaScript or another mainstream language for a couple of years, you know all there is to know.

        "body": "As long as I meet developers who are afraid of recursion, I will doubt it. We are in a profession of cult, rather than actual engineering.\n\nThe problem is also one of self selection. Some people choose to continue learning, and maybe project Odin could be a place where such people go to learn. Some are even fortunate enough to be able to do so on the job, at some functioning organization. Most others will not or are not at organizations that encourage learning.\n\nExample: In the past I have been at an organization that had fake \"learning days\". I was not allowed to learn about some advanced computer programming topics, but someone else \"learning HTML\", that was OK. Only that I learned HTML a long time ago, at school and over time I mostly kept myself informed about what new stuff is there. I have no need of learning HTML. It is something so basic, that I would be wasting my time doing that. Knowing HTML is such a widespread thing, that it is not even anything to boast about. Yet I was denied learning, because silly middle management did not have the capability to understand the impact of the things I wanted to learn. The perspective was always short term, and they let their own lack of experience and knowledge limit what others are allowed to learn on the job. It was completely dysfunctional.\n\nI think many people in this situation would not have energy left to then learn more in their free time. That is, if they were into being a developer out of passion and learning about computational processes, and not just for the good pay. We have too many of the not passionate devs in the industry, who will jump on any hype train, as long as it pays well, messing up project after project, and being lauded for it by incapable management.\n\nMany will continue to mess up projects, introducing unnecessary complexity at many turns. Management usually doesn't realize this, because they have no proper understanding of the detailed implementation ideas and what their consequences are. Or the ever-present silly phrases like \"80-20!\", \"YAGNI!\", balblabla, which are weaponized to cut against developer concerns. You are a ticket machine! We want you to be a small cog, that we can easily replace with the next generic developer!\n\nThey are not able to distinguish between someone really knowing their stuff and someone just going with the first best idea that \"works\" (until the next requirement change, when they have to adapt their half-assed solutions again). Developing computer programs without \"programming oneself into a corner\" is a valuable skill, but also a rare skill.",

There's a reason people say to start with tic-tac-toe or a TODO app. Building something small and self-contained is great \n\n2. Piggyback off of existing projects. Clone some open-source repos down, poke around, see how much you can understand. Pick something small and cool to rebuild as much as you can, using the repo as a reference. That way you can see how code is built and used in the real world.\n\n2. Tutorials can be really useful, but don't just build what's in the tutorial. Change or add \\*something\\* so that you can apply what you've learned.\n\n3. Maybe controversial, but I strongly recommend preferring text tutorials over video. I've found that text has a number of advantages. It's more similar to reading documentation. You can easily jump around back and forth without needing to rely on timestamps or trying to skip back and forth on a video. And I'd argue that reading long tutorials helps flex the muscle of quickly filtering relevant from irrelevant content, which is important when troubleshooting and searching for relevant documentation, browsing reddit and old Stack Overflow posts (if that's even still a thing) and even when chatting with an LLM and figuring out if it's hallucinating or giving you outdated information",

So, my philosophy of building a project is like, start building it from 2 points parallelly. One, from the user's POV and two, from the functionality POV. **You don't need to know everything all at once.** Just ask yourself **\"What will the user see JUST when my program starts?\"** Code whatever it requires. Once it's done, question yourself again **\"Hmm, okay! Done with this! What will happen if the user tries to access this thing?\"** So, it will be like several branches of thoughts starting from the VERY FIRST question **\"What will the user see....\".**\n\nI hope I could help!

Use that to your advantage! Take everything you learn as an opportunity to practice writing code.

Great engineers can communicate complex ideas in simple terms. They adapt how they explain things depending on who they're speaking to and what the context is.\n\nI’ve been conducting interviews in Big Tech for a while now, and here's what I look for: when I present a problem, a strong candidate asks questions and engages in a real discussion about how to approach it. That back-and-forth tells me more about their ability than the actual coding exercise. In fact, in most cases, I’ve already made up my mind before they start writing code. The coding just confirms it. It’s incredibly rare that someone struggles to design or explain a solution but somehow writes brilliant code. Communication and reasoning come first.",

Its a continual gradual process that takes years and as soon as i took a break, a lot of the specific details started to fade. Its challenging but can also be enjoyable. When I was in it, and something I was working on did what it was suppose to do and all the pieces worked. That was exhilarating. Not everybody is like that though.

If you're spending a bunch of time learning a little bit about a lot of different languages, then you'll never build up your depth. Pick one language to really focus on, and then you'll discover that the other languages will naturally come easier over time, as you make connections.\n2. In whatever language you've chosen, learn as many built-in functions (and operators, syntax, etc.) in that language as you can (with the theoretical goal of learning all of them). New programmers often make things harder than they need to be on themselves, because they don't realize all of the tools that the language offers (and they try to write extra utilities themselves, or reach for code from the Internet or third-party packages, when the language already offers a helpful tool built-in).\n3. Just like how when you're at the gym, you don't do each exercise only once and move on to a new exercise, apply the same approach to coding. Once you get your code working, start over from a completely blank slate, and try to do it again. See if you can look up even a *little* less than you needed to look up last time, or if you run into a little bit fewer bugs than you did last time. You'll find that once you do something five or ten times, you have a *way* deeper understanding than you thought you did after you only did it once.",

It's to develop new circuitry in your brain for thinking about computational problems (which you do by *the process* of writing code, which code assistance can skip, so you get the right answer, but don't develop the brain circuitry).\n\nI also find that (good) books, in general, go far more in depth and provide far more insight than most other mediums for learning, which tend to be shallow and focus on low hanging fruit. Even AI is going to be mostly low-hanging fruit, as it's basically a compilation of all the blogs and reddit posts and tutorials that are out there on the internet already.\n\nIf you want something other than a book, CS50, which is basically (good) book quality in video format. Very rare.\n\nAt the end of the day, technology has changed, but our brains have remained almost unchanged the same since the advent of modern computing.

The more you expose yourself to different patterns and libraries, the more sense it will make. \n\nWith that, try to filter out the \"you should know\" noise. I'm sure you've seen there's a lot of elitism and strong opinions in programming. A lot of people forget that different programmers face different challenges and use different tools and approaches. Learn what you can, try to focus on learning things you see the most of, and don't worry about knowing every aspect of every thing you work with. Most of it comes with time and learning as you go.",

Syntax is not as complicated once you learn it. I think the key is small problems, not projects. Something like a small math simulation.  My favorite was modelling the \"sick hobbits\" problem: \"There are 1000 hobbits on an island. X hobbits begin 'sick'. Each day, any healthy hobbit travels to visit another hobbit. If a healthy hobbit visits a sick hobbit, the healthy hobbit becomes sick. At the end of the day, all sick hobbits are removed. On average, how many hobbits will become sick? On average, how long will the contagion last, how many days?\"\n\nOnce implemented, then vary it up by changing how many hobbits are visited per day, how long the sick hobbits stay around (maybe more than one day). This type of problem is good for learning because the code for it is just a page or two.\n\nBuilding programs into projects is another skill in of itself. To do projects, you need to start worrying about system design, modularity, testing, and more advanced debugging. So, start with something a lot smaller so you can get syntax, data structures, and control flow statements down. Then move on to larger projects where you'll then need to train additional skills. The issue with projects is that you're being forced to learn too much all at once, I suspect a person would feel completely lost.\n\nI'll hate to mention, but the 'easy' leetcode problems are generally good for learning programming language syntax and basics (again, the basics are syntax, control flow, and data structures). I busted leetcode out recently to help learn Python. I don't think leetcode easy problems are necessarily the best or the most interesting; but if you can't find or come up with similar problems to the 'hobbits' problem above, then leetcode could have some decent ones for training/learning.",

While not easy, try to find a group of people with similar interest in coding, that don't just yap about how good they are but are genuinely interested and put effort, these people would motivate you just hearing about their work! \n\nI'll have to stress on the 3rd. unless you want to hit a super horrible burnout.",

Imagine yourself in a few years being able to automate boring paperwork, analyze patient data, or even build tools that could help your colleagues and patients.

It can make you more adaptable, more creative, and honestly, it’s just empowering to know you can build something from scratch. And who knows? Someday you might even find a niche at the intersection of medicine and tech that you really love. I say go for it!\n\nGood luck!",

But getting really deep into HTML and CSS can easily feel less rewarding than the early stages, and it would probably me more interesting and engaging to dive into Javascript to run in the browser.  Start simple, just utilize the Developer Tools console that's provided with FIrefox / Chrome / etc, and experiment with assigning \"id\" and \"class\" attributes to HTML elements and then selecting them using javascript.  Get the hang of that, and then start experimenting with things you can do with those selected elements when you have them selected in your JS.

        "body": "I have the following \"algorithm\" for reading a programming book:\n\nStep 1. Read through the book \"leisurely\". This is somewhere in between skimming and reading in detail. In this phase, for example, I would make a mental note of technically heavy parts (e.g. code examples) but would not go through them meticulously or line by line.\n\nStep 2. Go through the book a second time and make a listing by chapter of what \"things\" need to be done to really study it. For example, which examples should be tried out. What additional exercises should be done. Questions that I have (which could be answered by writing a program, for example). Other \"what ifs\" that come to mind (e.g. what if I try Y instead of X in this example).\n\nAfter step 2 is done, then basically I have a sort of \"todo list\" of sorts for what I actually need to \"actively do\" to learn that material \"for realsies\".\n\nStep 3. Go through the list that I made in step 2 and actually do those things.\n\nSuffice it to say that \"Step 3\" is what takes the most time and it requires the most concentration. I've found that I can do either step 1 and step 2 in a variety of environments, for example, even on a bus -- but for step 3 I need to be focused, e.g. in a \"library\" type of environment (people around me are quiet and concentrating).\n\nFor step 3 (\"implementations\") I need to use a good development laptop or workstation to actually work on the problems that I assigned myself (sometimes I will draw stuff on paper as well, e.g. diagrams or organizational notes) or that were assigned from the book author. Step 3 is sometimes \"unfinishable\" for me in practice because I tend to write \"too many\" little experiments to myself, or in the course of doing them I realize that it's no longer worthwhile to do some of them. In practice, when I'm doing step 3 I will make a little \"checklist\" to keep progress:\n\n\\[ \\] (123) foo: Implement foo example from chapter\n\n\\[ \\] (146) bar: Implement bar example from chapter\n\n\\[ \\] (146) \\*bar\\_rvalref: // Can bar example be redone using rvalue references?\n\n\\[ \\] (146) \\*\\*cmdline\\_calc: // Create a simple command-line calculator (e.g. calc 1 + 2 \\* 8 should output 17). Output goes to stdout. Also accept \"\\[\" and \"\\]\" as synonyms for \"(\" and \")\" if it is not ambiguous. E.g. x\\[5\\] is unambiguously an array indexing operation, whereas 7 \\* \\[1 + 2\\] is a grouping operation and equivalent to 7 \\* (1 + 2).\n\n\\[ \\] (146) \\*\\*\\*cmdline\\_calc: // Modify the calculator so if given the switch --arm, then the calculator also outputs machine code that would perform the same calculation using ARM instructions (output instruction set: ARM v4T without using Thumb instructions). Run the resulting machine code output via QEMU and verify that the result calculated in the emulated machine is identical to the desktop version's output.\n\n...\n\nIn my notation I write the page number reference in parens, and I use a \"\\*\" mark to mean \"it is a level-1, i.e. fairly easy exercise\", \\*\\* to mean it is a more involved exercise, and \\*\\*\\* or more to mean it is an \"advanced\" exercise.\n\nThe stuff after // is my explanations of what I want to do or experiment on; it can be somewhat vague because it is probably based on the example in the book so if I reread that part of the book, then what I wrote should make more sense.\n\nThese \"checklists\" work fine on paper (in fact I prefer them not to be electronic), but for the actual \"stuff\" that I am doing it is mostly a program and is mostly electronic (i.e. I just create something in a text editor or IDE). If I'm following a book with chapter 1, chapter 2, etc. style then normally I'll name subfolders with the chapter number and the topic, e.g. ch3\\_pointers, ch4\\_memory\\_management, etc.",

It was a different concoction of operating system libraries per platform, meaning Windows had a different solution than Linux, etc. total gong show. Couldn't test anything because, how do I test a component that depends on the computer shutting down to run the test?\n\nA month after putting that portion down I realized the good solution was about 1/20th as complicated and fully testable. \n\nThis is just one subdomain of problem solving.",

I have done that before with hard to reason about code bases with dynamic, interaction-based and hard to understand flows and it was surprisingly useful. It might make less or more sense in your case, depending on the context.\n\nPerhaps there are also static analysis tools for whatever language/application you're dealing with that can visualize modules, module members and relationships between them. I have also written custom tools for that for my code base and it was also quite useful, but it's a bit much. Besides that, I'd say perhaps don't sweat too much about it unless there's a good reason and let it come to you organically, as you work through the issues and features (hopefully, gentle at first).",

Then build an overall history that accumulates those individual pieces, maybe give that the ability to calculate analyses like EMA, stochastics, or whatever. \n\nThen model a portfolio that can track buys, sells, profit/ loss, etc of individual stocks. \n\nThen build something that will fetch historical data from an online source and build up your historical data. Might also need that to analyze the data for cleaning: find holes, potential anomalies, normalize for splits, etc. \n\nI'm not familiar enough with crypto to know the analog, but hopefully that gives you a way to begin. \n\nPython would be fine for this if you're not planning to do real time analysis.

They allow you as the developer to control the way your class is interacted with. In the field, you'll rarely be writing code on your own. Most of us work on projects with at least 10 other people touching the code that we write, and on code that other people wrote. You won't always have the benefit of knowing exactly what was going through the authors head when interacting with a class. Also... after a few months or years you won't know what was going through your own head.\n\nSo, consider a scenario where a class has a static object in it which is critical to its function. Say.. an in memory data store or cache. Nearly every public function in the class calls this object and it would be really cumbersome to check for initialization in every function call. Plus, that leaves room for error. You or another developer later on might forget to check. But you could define it with a getter that checks initialization and executes lazy initialization if its not done. Now that initialization logic exists in one place, and you never need to worry about checking for initialization when using the object. And you don't have to worry about some other developer down the line writing dangerous code into your class that forgets to check initialization.\n\nSimilar with constructors. You can use the constructor to perform logic that **must** be done before the class gets interacted with. Go grab some service dependencies, initialize some variables, warm up the cache, whatever you need.",

However, one case I am currently using right now of a more complex getter is that I have to retrieve the firmware information of a co-processor that talks to my primary MCU application over a serial connection. I request that information and cache it when the program starts, but if I call my version getter and that value is invalid for whatever reason (firmware update, mainboard resets, etc) I can spin up the serial port and request the info again, then return the new information or an error code. \n\nFrom the application perspective, I am just getting the firmware version and it doesn't really concern itself with how. I don't have to almost ever change that code, and it can be reused in other places so that if I ever change how the firmware version is retrieved, it's in one spot and makes my job much easier.

Just think of it as a method that is always called on construction.  Could you create an init() function that you have to call after you create the object? Yes you could, and you often do if you want to be able to return a failure code.  However when you don't need to return a failure code, it's less typing to just initialize in a constructor.\n\nOne area I've found setters as being really nice is lets say you have a variable that should only be a number between 0 and 10, and you have a bug where it's being set to 100007.  How do you figure out why it's being set to 100007?  With a setter you can put a break point (or a conditional break point) in the setter, then trace up the stack to see where and why it's being set to 100007.\n\nAs for getter, unfortunately with java if the variable is public then if it can be got it can be set.  And see why setters are nice above.",

More on that at the end.\n\nPresumably, in a real (not a learning exercise) program, many of your variables have constraints that require validation, eg can a person's age be negative or higher than 200?  Can their name contain unprintable characters or whitespace like tab?   These constraints are put into the setters, and signal an error if the attempt to set them to an invalid value is made.  Getters protect data that the user can see, but should not change.  For example, with the person, you can maybe look at their address when making a map of your customers but this is not an appropriate place and time to be changing the values -- a getter can provide a look without letting you accidentally modify it.  To modify it you must deliberately call the setter rather than just an oops side effect on a free wheeling variable. \n\nBut when the getters and setters do nothing, and they often will,  their only purpose is to keep it consistent.  These 10 values have getters and setters and those 5 do not in class A,  those 18 do not and 11 do in class B, .. C, D, E, ... after a few classes, remembering which variables in which classes have getters and setters is overwhelming.  If you just assume they all have these functions and use them for everything, its that much less burden on the programmer.   They also abstract validation: when using them ALL of your validation looks the same:\n\n    while( !class.setter_for_variable(new_value) )\n    { \n        display bad input message()\n       new_value =   get new input from user ()\n    }",

This isn't good, because this means that if you want to update the contents of one of the arrays, you will have to change multiple places in your code, where you should only need to change one place in your code for such a change.\n* Similarly, in `UserInterface`, you have one area that prints out a numbered list of all the actions that the user can choose from, but the logic that goes along with each of those actions is elsewhere in the file. It would be good to use a data structure such that if you needed to add an action, remove an action, or rearrange the actions, you could do so by only making one edit to the code, not multiple edits.",

It might make the code look better, something like:\n\n    switch(command) {\n      case 1 -> generateRandom();\n      case 2 -> generateWithLength();\n      case 3 -> generateWithLetter();\n\nand so on. But it is a matter of taste.\n\nYou could benefit from making a single method for reading a valid number from the input - something like: `getValidInput(int[] numbers)` that would only return one of the numbers in the array, or zero if something else was entered by the user. That would isolate your use of scanner to that method alone, and make the rest of the code easier to write without having to handle exceptions or different invalid inputs.\n\nIt is always a good idea to have a lot of small methods that only do one thing - my own personal rule is that if I have more than two levels of if-statements or loops, I need to make a method to combine them.

No, I am not referring to updating the content of string arrays through a method.\n\nLet's look at the `dCons` field as an example:\n\n2a. You define `dCons` as an array that contains 40 elements, which is perfectly fine.\n\n2b. However, later on, when you *use* `dCons`, your code looks like this:\n\n    dCons[random.nextInt(40)]\n\nHere, you have explicitly hardcoded the length of `dCons`. In the future, if you ever manually edit your code to change what is in `dCons`, you will need to update *two* places in your code — 2a and 2b. That's not good, because it's important that those two places in your code stay in sync.\n\nInstead, it's better to remove the hard-coded length in 2b, and have it *read* the length, via something like `dCons[random.nextInt(dCons.length)]`. This way, if you ever manually edit your code to change what is in `dCons`, you will simply need to update *one* place in your code, and everything else will automatically adjust.",

I think my autistic pattern recognition may have contributed to my preference but idk I started doing it 28 years ago when I was seven so my recollection is a little hazy",

Your electrical background is actually a huge advantage. You already understand complex systems, troubleshooting, and working with detailed specifications. That kind of logical thinking translates really well to programming.\n\nThe fact that you've already played around with TrueNAS, Linux, and Docker shows you're not starting from zero. Don't downplay that experience, lots of grads don't even know what Docker is when they start.\n\nAt Metana we've had students from all kinds of trades backgrounds make successful transitions. What I've noticed is that people with hands on experience often do better than traditional CS grads because they understand how to build things that actually work in the real world. You don't necessarily need a degree for most programming jobs, especially in Canada where the tech scene is pretty good. Companies care way more about what you can build than your educational background.\n\nThe ADHD thing might actually be an advantage once you find your groove. A lot of great developers I know have adhd, that hyperfocus can be incredibly powerful for debugging and problem-solving.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you want to chat more about specific learning paths or what the job market looks like right now.

Don't let that scare you off though, it can absolutely still be done.\n\n\nOne piece of advice I can give on self-teaching (from an ADHDer as well) is pick ONE language and stick with it for learning. It absolutely does not matter which one you choose as long as it isn't completely obscure, or something like COBOL. The fundamental concepts are all the same in every language.\n\n\nI started with Ruby, learned C# through my first job, now work in C#, JavaScript/TypeScript.\n\n\nI'd recommend you start with JavaScript (alongside HTML and CSS) as you can use those 3 to build interactive web pages and get immediate feedback and a sense of achievement, which is big when self-teaching, especially for ADHD folk. Also even if you work in any other language, if you're working on a web page in any capacity, you will almost certainly need JavaScript so you might as well know it, even if you end up not using it as your primary language. \n\n\nFor where to get started, The Odin Project is a great resource to get you on the right track.",

This is a much, much harder thing; many programmers who are best of the best cannot do this, because getting funding, finding a market, making something that is open enough for people to try but not so open that they never give you any money... all of that is just incredibly hard. If you want fast money now, this is probably not the way. But if you just want to contribute to *something*, or have *something* to put on a resume or application, then you have time.\n\nIf I were you, and if I *really* wanted to be a business owner more than anything else, I would first get a regular full-stack job.

This could easily be handled by a single kernel thread when it comes to CPU load, so it makes perfect sense to create virtualized threads, which expose the same API as a kernel thread, but all run on a single kernel thread.\n\nWhen faced with CPU-bound work, however, user space threads are simply not that useful. No matter how you slice your algorithm, you only have a fixed number of threads capable of independent computation, so even if you run 10 thousand virtual threads per kernel thread, all of them together can execute only as much real computation (not waiting) as the kernel thread itself. Of course, since managing user space threads has some overhead, this is also a net negative in performance for CPU-bound work.\n\nModern server applications are rarely CPU bound, though, so feel free to go as far as you want with your millions of user space threads, like Go has shown to be completely possible and manageable.",

If your program executes on a single core, there's no benefit. Multithreading (and lightweight async execution) lets a program benefit from context switching where a blocked thread can surrender the cpu until its data arrives. The OS scheduler will do this with processes as well. As long as the thread can still do work on the cpu, there's no point in switching off. Also, do note that cpu cores are pretty good at parallelizing independent work and simulating in order execution. We've had cpus with multiple ALUs per core for example since the 90s and the hardware will dispatch parallel instructions as long as there's no dependency within the execution window. You as a programmer don't have to specifically ask for this. The same is true for things like hard disk caching.\n\nOn the multiple cpu issue, it is worth testing or reading more about if you need this. There have been notorious cases like Playstation where hardware designers shipped multi-core hardware only to find that the OS hardly ever used more than one and never more than two. On the flip side, there are cases like Sql Server on Windows, where the server absolutely can scale across cores to process large volumes of data. I know that's an IO bound load, but often the whole load is aggressively cached when the request comes in so there's low latency.",

        "body": "It can be, if the executor of the user-space threads is itself multi-threaded and runs on multiple system threads.\n\nUser-space threads are designed to solve a very specific issue - to reduce the time a system thread needs to wait on operations that block (think: locking a mutex, waiting for IO, waiting for timer,...). It is implemented thusly:\n\nInstead of calling blocking APIs, we call their non-blocking alternatives . The non-blocking version of the API works the same, but instead of blocking, it returns \"would block\" error.\n\nA user-space thread is a state machine. The states are the values of thread-local variables at the points where blocking operation is called. Advancing a state means executing all the code up to the operation that would block.\n\nThis advancing of states is done by an executor, which runs directly on a system thread. The executor has a set of user-space threads. It advances a user-space thread up until the point it calls a \"blocking\" that would block. It then tries to find another user-space thread in the set, which no longer blocks and can be advanced. If all the user-space threads in the set are blocked, the executor (ie. the system thread its running on) blocks, until one of the user-space threads unblocks (operating-systems do have API that lets you wait on multiple blocking operations simultaneously, until one of them unblocks).\n\nAs you can see from this, user-space threads are completely useless for CPU-bound tasks (ie. tasks that don't wait on blocking operations). You might as well just directly run such tasks as a sequence, because that's exactly what a user-space thread executor will end up doing (likely with some additional overhead).\n\nHOWEVER! A user-space thread executor can be parallelized using system threads. You spawn multiple system threads (as many as your computer has cores) aka. a thread pool. Each system threads runs an executor, but they all share the same set of pending tasks. Now the tasks (in our case, user-space threads) can actually truly run in parallel.\n\nThat being said, user-space threads, as tasks for thread pools, is not the best abstraction for CPU-bound tasks. If you don't divide the work evenly between the user-space threads, then some of the system threads in the thread pool will be busy with big long tasks, while the rest are parked, waiting for something to do.\n\nA better abstraction are tasks that can be automatically broken down into sub-tasks that can be done in parallel. That way, the thread pool can automatically spread the load among the system threads. For example \"apply this operation to each item in a list\" can be easily split into processing sub-ranges of the list, or even individual items.\n\nThis is why pure functional paradigm has gained some notable traction in the last decade. It is trivially parallelizable, because the program is ultimately a tree of function calls where branches (ie. evaluation of arguments) can be evaluated independently of one another.\n\nImperative code, much less so, because it essentially describes a sequence of operations that are expected to be executed in order. Transforming that sequence into multiple independent parallel sequences (ie. threads) is not trivial.",

Usually one process:one app but when you can and want to utilise multiple CPU cores you need more processes. That usually gets called multi threading but that's not what your operating system, or my concurrent computing textbook calls it.\n\nIn my experience outside uni, both these things tend to get called threads without much care for the very important distinctions. Like I'm seeing people talk about user vs kernel threads and it kinda sounds like when they say kernel thread they mean what I've called a process above. However windows and Linux both provide a kernel feature that matches my definition of a thread above. Not having a go at anyone we're all just using words the way we were taught to.

So they are a binary tree where the smallest/largest element is always the root, and like a normal binary tree one side (like the left) contains only smaller values and the other (right) contains only larger values. For an interview you should know right away that you can search such a tree in oh log n time. You can also insert in oh log n time except for when you need to rebalance a subtree. Also you need to rebalance a bit when you remove the top element. You can think about how often insert rebalances happen and how long they take. And also whether the rebalance after removing the top element is always simple. My intuition is that with randomly ordered inserts the overall time for adding with rebalancing doesn’t really add to the time complexity of the case when you don’t have to rebalance.",

Build 2-3 full stack projects that solve real world problems. Don’t just build your cookie cutter todo app. \n\nYou should come up with an idea or a problem you’d like to solve in your own life, and then create an app around it. This alone will distinguish you from the masses that have the same generic todo app projects on their portfolios. \n\nYou will stand out as a legitimate developer if you do this. Also, make sure the portfolio website you put your projects on looks great and professional.\n\n2.) Any time you write code - commit it to GitHub. You will want to put your GitHub link in your resume and portfolio website so that employers can go look at your code. Make sure you can explain what your code is doing during an interview.\n\n3.) Apply to 10-20 software development jobs a day. Curate your resume and cover letter to each job description (use GPT to speed up the process).\n\n4.) Network like hell on LinkedIn. Reach out to anyone and everyone who works at a company you’d like to work at. Ask them for 15 minutes of their time for an “informational interview” and at the end, politely ask them to refer you. Or reach out to recruiters directly. Show them your projects. \n\n5.) If you land an interview - research their company and take a few days to build out a prototype app that is relevant to their company. Showcase it during your interview. This will make you stand out like no one else. It shows that you’re ambitious and will go the extra mile. \n\n6.) Be proactive. You can’t fail if you go hard at all the above every single day. The above 5 steps should be your full time job until you land a job. It might take time - but you’ll land something eventually - in fact it took me almost 2 years to land a job after learning how to code and following the steps above after 6 months of coding. So don’t give up.\n\nBonus tip: Never think that a job is below you. If you get an opportunity that sounds shitty but it’s software related, take it - because you will be able to build credibility to add on your resume which will help you land that dream job much easier down line.\n\nFirst dev job I took was a shitty TA gig at a coding bootcamp. Paid $11,000 annually. I did it for a year, leveraged the experience on my resume and landed a $70k gig as a junior developer 8 months later.\n\nEdit: I don’t have a degree in CS. But I do have a bachelors in psychology. Which may or may not have helped my chances.",

I'm also in Toronto, also a front-end-biased full-stacker. There's a fair bit of meetups for JavaScript, front-end, web perf. Go to them. Be seen there. Meet folks, talk about stuff, try to learn and show all the cool stuff you're building. Worse comes to worse you meet some cool new people, best case you start getting tips.\n\n\\- integrate your projects with the LLM companies APIs. Considering how popular these tools are in tech right now, you'll have a bit of an edge over people making boring boilerplate apps. If you want to be hired, working with these APIs will look good when you're demoing your work and show you're on the cutting edge.\n\n\\- Don't let doomers discourage you. Tech is a very boom-bust industry. The dot-com bust didn't kill software development, the latest trends won't kill it either. Get good, show your passion and you'll stand out over a sea of apathetic grads who are just in it for the six-figure payday.\n\n\\- Lastly, most importantly: only become a front-ender if you genuinely love it. Programming and software development are one of the best jobs in the world, but after a post-pandemic big tech hiring boom we're seeing massive layoffs and salaries are shrinking. It will still pay well but you need to set expectations and be willing to find a smaller place to skill up. I got my start working in a creative advertising agency, then was able to pivot into software.\n\nSource: BA Psychology+bootcamp grad, worked in the industry for a decade now.",

Second, a lot of those people are successful programmers who are good at what they do, so in a sense, they're correct. You can be a good programmer and be bad at leetcode.\n\nI would say, though, that the reverse is far less likely. There are far more good programmers who are bad at leetcode than there are bad programmers who are good at leetcode. For interviewers, this is usually a good trade. Sure, the leetcode arbitrarily filters out some good talent, but it also effectively filters out bad talent. Not all, but most. A person who has gotten good at leetcode is often pretty passionate about programming. \n\nProgramming is a wide field. There are people whose jobs look a lot more like leetcode problems. It's also critical to understand the basic tools you would use for leetcode. You should develop a basic intuition for time complexity. I always think that working on improving at leetcode problems will make you better. To get really good, you need to have a deep understanding of the language and everything happening under the hood. \n\nBut there are really 2 factors here: getting good at solving difficult problems, and getting good at optimizing simpler problems.

ECC guards against memory corruption due to spontaneous magnetic flips in the physical storage medium, mostly from background radiation. This is not limited to, but includes cosmic rays, for which reason spontaneous bit flip increases with altitude and is worst in satellites (as u/MediumRay said). And of course, if a bit has spontaneously flipped, that bit could represent a variable in a comparand, or for that matter an operand.\n\nHow real is this problem as opposed to merely theoretical? Well, as I said, it's not enough of a problem to be worth fixing in personal computers, but still a concrete enough problem for there to be a manufacturing sector and a market for ECC RAM. People out there are paying a lot of money for this stuff, and probably for good reason. So in certain applications, it's a possibility real enough to pay money to mitigate.\n\nI don't think choice of language should be expected to have any effect. Ultimately an opcode is an opcode.

It's really nice to see someone trying to clarify something about the interaction of the language with the environment it's running in.\n\n`scanf()` is not moving the cursor.  The OS is.  Well, the terminal application is, with the help of the OS (and possibly BIOS).  It turns out that the cursor advances all the time.  Like when you type in the command to compile:\n\n```\n$ _\n$ g_\n$ gc_\n$ gcc_\n```\n\nAfter each character typed, the cursor advances (most of the time).  But terminals are very complex things.  Suffice to say that the terminal--with the help of the OS--manages receiving keystrokes and \"sending them\" to the application.\n\nIOW, the terminal receives the keystrokes.  It does what it usually does; advances it when you type a character, retreats it when you type backspace, etc.  Then, after it does what it needs to (though there are exceptions, like what happens when you press `Ctrl-C` on a Unix-like machine), it tells your C program: \"Hey, someone pressed a character, here it is.\"  Then, you do whatever you're going to do with it.\n\nIt's somewhere from \"a little\" to \"way more\" complicated than that in realities, but that's the general idea.  Just to finish this up, the complexity can come around buffering, which is how many character the terminal and OS will hold before sending them.  If it sent every character, one at a time, that could be inefficient, so sometimes terminals and OSes buffer.  Generally, in terminal applications, hitting `<enter>` will force/suggest the underlying bits (terminal, OS) to send the data to the application.  Also, it's the terminal that decides to move the cursor down (newline), and then return to the left-side on English/Western locales (carriage return).\n\nIf you're curious about how terminals work on Unix-like machines, check out **Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment** by Stevens, often abbreviated \"APUE\".",

Sometimes other characters change the cursor position, like a carriage return moving the cursor to the beginning of the current output line, a line feed moving the cursor down one line, a backspace moving the cursor backward one character, and other special escape sequences can move the cursor in other ways (such as to a specified row and column).\n\nAlso in most cases the operating system terminal driver echoes characters input on the terminal back out to the terminal.  This may happen automatically in the terminal driver without the remote program having to do anything, but the terminal driver can also be put in a mode where automatic echo is disabled and the program must deliberately echo input characters if it wants to.  A text editor, for example, may set non-echoing mode so that editor commands are not echoed when they are typed, and instead output from the editor program displays the results of performing the command.\n\nThe terminal driver in the operating system usually also handles input in line mode, meaning that an entire line of characters followed by a ENTER is buffered up and made available to the program after ENTER is pressed.  But the terminal driver can also be put into a mode where every keypress from the terminal is immediately available to the program, rather than being held and sent when ENTER is pressed.\n\nIn modern computers the terminal is often a program that emulates the behavior of a serial terminal, because the serial terminal model is so pervasive for managing program input and output.\n\nIn a simple program, output to the terminal is what moves the cursor, so calling scanf() does not cause the cursor to move, and if the terminal driver is in its normal mode of echoing input, it's the echoed output of input characters, or output from the program, that moves the cursor on the terminal",

We could leave either flag out of the call, of course:\n\n```\nsome_function_that_takes_flags(SAY_HELLO);\n```\n\nNow this function call only says hello.\n\n\nThis way of using flags improves code readability compared to having multiple separate booleans as function params. It also enables extending the list of options very easily without having to go fix a thousand different calls to the said function.\n\n\nHope this explains it.

What is common to all of it is that when you hear the term 'flag' you usually should think 'optional configurable/alternative behavior'.",

Meaning: you should be good enough to handle 80% of development on either frontend or backend.\n\nSo if you think you got enough information on Springboot to do 80% of the development on a Springboot app, learn some JavaScript.\n\nAnd to clarify that \"80% of a Springboot app\": handle network requests, CRUD operations, unit testing (enough to read the unit tests for another class, and copy how it's handling testing for your class), and enough OOP / MVC best practices to avoid making a complete mess (which honestly isn't too much, but hard for me to describe atm).",

I will however give you a great starting reference guide though - \n\n[https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)\n\nThis is a site that not only has documentation for just about anything you can do with HTML/CSS/Javascript(these three were as deep as we got) but also includes built in environments to start messing around and see what happens when you change different values. \n\nOne thing I do recommend though - learn HTML at least reasonably well before you move onto CSS. CSS is an *amazing* tool that basically acts as templates. It makes a lot of things much easier to do but it's important to know *how* they work under the hood if you want to really get your skills up. Trust me, HTML is not hard and you can get up to speed relatively quickly. Our course was like once a week for 12 weeks and by the end we could make functional websites with decent designs.\n\nOne amusing thing about HTML compared to other languages - it does not care how bad your coding is. It will try to run it anyway. You can have a garbled mess of garbage that god himself will not forgive under the hood and as long as the important parts are functional it'll still go, as opposed to other programming languages that tell you to die in a fire if you miss one bracket. Just something to keep in mind - your code may work despite being terrible(professor asked me \"what the hell is all this doing?\" one time when I had a solid 30 lines of broken code) so use some attention to detail to keep it clean.\n\nHope that helps a bit, best wishes!",

Companies generally aren't searching for people who know some obscure language. In the few cases where they are (like COBOL), they're looking for people with 30+ years of experience, not beginners.\n\nI think a better way to approach it might be to pick a part of the world that has a good tech scene, but is not as exciting and fast-paced. In the U.S. an example might be Minneapolis or Atlanta. Both cities have lots of software jobs but nothing like Silicon Valley, Seattle, or NYC. Look at job openings and see what languages, frameworks, tools, and specialties companies are looking for there.\n\nSince you're a CS major, an internship can be the best way to break in.

Note that the last type argument of a `Func<>` is the return type. \n\nSo `Func<SomeObject, SomeOutput>` matches a method `SomeOutput MethodName(SomeObject arg)`\n\nSo instead of multiple ifs or switch statements, you can do something like this:\n\n```\nDictionary<string, Func<SomeObject, SomeOutput>> handlers;\n\nvoid Init()\n{\n    handlers.Add(\"A\", HandlerA);\n    handlers.Add(\"B\", HandlerB);\n}\n\nvoid Handle(string value)\n{\n    if(handlers.TryGet(value, out var handler))\n    {\n        var output = handler(input)\n    }\n    throw new ArgumentOrOfRangeException(nameof(value));\n}\n\nprivate SomeOutput HandlerA(SomeObject value)\n{\n    // Do something for for value A...\n}\n\nprivate SomeOutput HandlerB(SomeObject value)\n{\n    // Do something for for value B...\n}\n```",

Pick one resource and stick to it because if you try to do many things at once, it will overwhelm you. There are many great resources to learn programming. If you want to learn Web Development for example then I can say the Odin Project is a fantastic free resource. Almost everything I know about web programming I learned from the Odin Project. However, there is one important point you need to know when starting this journey. The motivation you feel right now will disappear, usually around the time when you can't solve some hard problem or can't fix a bug or you are trying for hours and don't get anywhere. Programming, especially once you can actually build cool Apps yourself can be very rewarding until it's not and you question why you even started. Just don't give up when you get to moments like that. Also don't let AI solve your problems. You might think you learned something if AI is doing the work but you actually didn't. If you gonna use AI then use it to ask questions about a concept you don't understand but don't vibe code your way to an app as you won't learn anything this way.",

Disclaimer: this is just my personal experience.\n\nWhat is really funny is that everyone assumes that physicists suck at coding. I have heard \"you're good for a physicist\" so many times, but I actually take it as a compliment. Most physicists don't care and want to make a throw away program. That's fine but if you want to learn how to make software that lasts longer than a single day, you obviously need to do something very different. I never really learned that systematically, I just kinda wanted to write stuff that was useful later, so I just naively tried to structure things more cleanly. I spent lots of time reading tutorials, reddit, other peoples code and whatnot. I did read \"Clean Code\" a year or so ago, and I thought it was ok but much is learned by trial and error, writing lots of bad code, rewriting it slightly better, changing the scope, trashing it again, and so on. Practice, practice, practice. And build nontrivial things, not just toy programs. If programs get big, you MUST apply some structure. I think you need to feel the pain of being stuck and then digging yourself out of that hole.\n\nSorry for the ramble, your post kinda resonated with me. Let me know what you think",

Soft skills are all about interaction with people and are very useful in the work place. They will help open a lot of doors regardless of industry. People in IT regardless of field have a very bad image with most people because a lot of us lack basics like conversation skills or team building. The old joke of a coder locked in a closet because no one wants to deal with him is what a lot of non technical people think of IT related jobs.\n\nLeadership skills are also very useful regardless of if you want to get into management or not down the line. Every project or team needs someone to lead it, why not you? It also helps with dealing with different levels of management. Something I learned a while ago is leaders don’t just lead those they are responsible for, they also lead their managers on up as well. Of the two this one has been very useful since I started developing it. \n\nAs for how to learn them; soft skills are mostly about interaction with people on a regular basis. Help desk jobs are great for learning them but going to classes about anything you are interested in person is a great start. Just get a conversation started and keep it going. One big skill to learn is active listening. As for leadership I can recommend a couple of books to get you started if you are interested.",

It's when you combine the two—the principles and routines from books, and the practice from going to the gym—that you get good results.\n\nThe same is true with programming. Read good books to learn the principles and techniques, and then build projects to get practice with those principles and techniques.

The point is to exercise my very meager skill in the new lang with tiny, manageable problems.\n\nLater once I feel bored, or like I'm wasting time with the ease of the problems, or I want a greater challenge, really any negative dull non-transient feeling, I move onto building a very small program. Usually it solves an imaginary problem, but if I could do something I could conceivably use (still small!) I try to do that. \n\nThis approach avoids Tutorial Hell, where you are stuck in analysis paralysis.

Feeling unsure about what to do next is completely normal, especially when you have multiple options in front of you.\n\nSince you mentioned interest in both full stack development and software development, here's a simple breakdown:\n\n# 1. If you want to become a Full Stack Developer:\n\nStart with web development. It's beginner-friendly, highly in demand, and offers a clear path. You can follow this roadmap:\n\n* HTML → CSS → JavaScript (vanilla)\n* Then move to React (frontend framework)\n* Learn Git/GitHub for version control\n* Then go into backend: Node.js + Express\n* For databases: MongoDB or PostgreSQL\n* Build real-world projects along the way\n\nThis path gives you visible, hands-on progress and prepares you for full stack roles.\n\n# 2. If you're aiming for general Software Development or Big Tech:\n\nThen continue with C++ and go deeper into Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). Companies like Google, Amazon, etc., focus heavily on problem-solving and core CS concepts. Your path could be:\n\n* Strengthen your C++ fundamentals\n* Learn DSA topics: arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.\n* Practice on platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces\n* Study core CS subjects: OS, DBMS, Networks, OOP\n\n# Still confused?\n\nTry both briefly spend a week or two on web dev, and then a week on DSA. See which one excites you more and where you feel more engaged. That’s usually a good signal for what path to follow.\n\nYou're not behind you’re just in the exploring phase, which is totally fine. Stay consistent, build small things, and clarity will come. You've got this!",

Your focus should be on adding value rather than making sure you are getting “credit” for every thing you do. HR would tell you that is what your compensation is for and you can document on your self-assessment for your performance review. I would never utter the word “credit” again as this all transpires.\n\nHaving said that, this is a wonderful opportunity and quite flattering for anyone, never mind someone early in his career. \n\nI would suggest writing a lengthy email about your concerns. You can start it with, “As the architect of this process ….. it has come to my attention… and in order to ensure maximum success…. I want to make everyone is aware xxxxxxx” List the important stuff, like why you think this won’t scale and why each instance needs to be customized. But offer fixes to the problems as well. How can this be customized so that it does work for other departments? What work effort would be required? Be specific and as lengthy as you need to be, as you will be saving them time and possible embarrassment. Also, if it doesn’t scale, you could end up being blamed, (“who created this in the first place”)\n\nSend your email to all interested parties and cc: your boss. Again, make sure the email is emotionless, fact-based and solely focused on you trying to help the company and the team to succeed. Of course, this also serves as your documentation that you are the originator.\n\nTry not to assume the worst in people.

I’ve been in contact with folks at my company since they first started layoffs in 2023. I personally know a couple of people who this summer are moving back in with their parents because they can’t land a job. That’s with my FAANG company in the resume. No it’s not Amazon or Meta. I know some with families who were forced to pack up and move across the country. I know some who got laid off after moving. I know some who can’t move their families so they have to fly across states every weekend just to be with them on the weekends. I know some who went from making 300k+ to around 150k - 80k. \n\nI don’t want to cause any alarm. But there are my personal anecdotes. I always try to keep in touch with coworkers, it’s just something I do. Yes, there are some who managed to land jobs at other high paying companies. But I’ve noticed that these people are either really smart or went to top colleges (Stanford, Cornell, MIT, etc). I went to a shitty state school and for the most part I’m severely average. Do I really want to be constantly grinding for the rest of my life? I’ve been interviewing candidates for the last 2 years. The level of talent is insane.

Even people with solid backgrounds like yours are getting ghosted left and right. It's not a reflection of your worth or abilities, the hiring process is just broken in a lot of ways.\n\nSomething I've noticed works better than the traditional apply and pray approach is  that you need stuff people can actually see and touch. Your GPA and internships are great but recruiters want to see what you can build. Even small projects on GitHub that solve real problems can make a huge difference.\n\nAlso, have you considered bootcamps? I know it might seem like a step backward given your background, but sometimes the structured approach and job placement support is what breaks through. At Metana we've had people with CS degrees who just couldn't crack the interview process, and the hands-on training plus career support made all the difference.\n\nThe other thing is, what specific roles are you targeting? Sometimes pivoting within tech (like from pure SWE to product management, technical sales, or developer relations) can open doors that weren't there before.\n\nYour education definitely wasn't wasted even if it feels that way right now. Those problem solving skills transfer to pretty much anything. But I get the frustration, job hunting is soul crushing.\n\nTake a breather if you need to, but don't give up just yet :) The market will turn around.",

Companies have been known to backchannel and torpedo candidates who have gone on public record bashing them. Especially in the tech world, it's not unheard of for one C-Suite to reach out to another to \"warn\" them about a problem candidate. A close friend of mine was let go after her first 2 weeks at a new company after the CEO of the company we both worked at got wind that she was trash-talking her experience on Facebook. He reached out to another exec at her new company, pointed out her posts, and said it would be risky to keep her on. \n\nAnother is that some companies love to sue. This is especially true when people sign a non-disparagement clause in a severance agreement. If a former employee starts talking shit and the company catches wind, you could lose out on your severance, they could come after you in court, or just make you suffer through a legal fight you likely can't afford. \n\nAs much as I would love to expose the garbage companies I've worked for, it's not without it's risks and frankly, many folks aren't in a position to defend themselves.",

Let me give you my perspective.  \n  \nI think your questioning isnt only about software engineering itself. It touches how we roll our lives on the big picture.\n\nAs humans, our likes change over time, **and this is completely fine.**\n\nOh gosh, if only you knew how cruel it is to realize for the first time you dont like to do that activity anymore that just a couple of years ago you could do with your hands tied. Did you lose yourself somewhere?\n\nAnswer: no. Actually, you still like to do it, you just dont have that blasting flame anymore, and its ok. You cant lose yourself, because you *are* yourself. But you have to know that yourself is not static, it will change. And so will you. \n\nSo now, you can bang your head against the wall wondering why you are no longer the person you were 10 years ago, or you can recognize that you may have changed, and if that is the case, welcome this change with open arms. After all, this is still you. Why reject it?\n\nBut I understand that everything may still feel blurry to you, as it is often the case when we have ourselves facing such big changes. So maybe you're best off waiting before moving. You know the saying, la nuit porte conseil. In your case, you may need many nuits. You already gave a BIG step: acknowledging that you may be changing. Now, give time to time, to see how this will unfold. Maybe it's just a phase. Maybe not, and you need time for your mind to recognize the change, to stick to it, to decide that you you want to live by it from now on, and to be able to justify itself to you, so that when you ask yourself why you changed, it can reassure you that you did it because it felt better that way.\n\nIn any case, dont rush to find it out. A definitive position will click when you least expect.  \n  \nAnd if its just a phase, well, I think you know how to go on with your life then.\n\nIf its not, remember you will feel 'empty' during some time during the transition, and this is a part of the process. Transitioning can take longer than you expect, but profit from every moment. Do things you wouldnt do in other times, and remember something really cool awaits you. Sooner or later, you will be gifted with new likes and will feel complete once again.",

During that time the employer has 3 chances to attempt to acquire a H1B to retain the worker.

That's exactly what this is!\n\nWhoever is spreading the narratives that H1B is exclusively (or primarily) an outsourcing visa to replace American workers is wrong. It's important to understand the other primary use case to retain US educated top talent (who happens to have been born elsewhere). In that situation folks are not hired directly on H1B.

Its not the shiniest anymore but companies actually use it in production. Next.js is also huge right now if you wanna go that route.\n\nThe thing is, at this point its less about picking the \"perfect\" stack and more about getting really good at one thing. Companies would rather hire someone who's solid at React than someone who kinda knows React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte.\n\nWe see this at Metana all the time. Students who try to learn everything end up not being great at anything. The ones who pick a stack and build 2 to 3 real projects with it are the ones getting hired.\n\nBuild stuff that actually does something useful. Not another todo app lol.

I'll do this for the time being until I can land a much better-paying job that's at least IT-related or adjacent.\n\nAt this point, it's just outright borderline impossible to even get your foot in the tech work field door right now because there's just no way to get the necessary experience without time-traveling back to the past when entry-level jobs still existed or without compromising a lot of money(certain certifications, unpaid personal projects, volunteer, etc.). \n\nIt's also gotten rather tiresome for me to see quite a lot of out-of-touch folks in so many CS subreddits making the boomer assumptions that all of the latest CS grads who are unemployed are just too unqualified and incompetent for any job in tech and that they supposedly didn't try to get internships during college. They conveniently ignore that even CS internships have gotten a lot more incredibly competitive, selective, and oversaturated now than ever because they're aren't negatively affected by today's poor job market, especially in tech.\n\nOn the bright side with my temp agency work, despite not paying a liveable enough salary, at least the job itself was pretty laid-back in my experience when I briefly did it during my short time off from college before graduating.\n\nSorry for this TL;DR-length comment.

The rest of the world is generally less so, you will need to achieve a high level of fluency before you will have any luck looking for work and even then, there are some cultures (ex. Germany, Turkiye, most of eastern Europe) that would rather hire someone from that culture who speaks English over an outsider who speaks their language. You will never have priority over someone from that culture, unless you offer a particular technical skillset that they can't find. This is xenophobia imo but it is what it is.\n\n2. People tend to be misled by online courses claiming they can become fluent in 3-6 months. You can learn the basics of many languages quickly, but actual fluency can take years, especially if you want to read and write Mandarin. In terms of professional development and career payoff, the ROI relative to effort is very low. You could learn several new tech stacks well in the time it would take you to learn Mandarin.\n\n3. The tech industry works primarily in English. One of my former employers had teams in China and Portugal that I worked closely with and it wasn't uncommon for them to discuss technical problems in English.\n\nI speak several languages to a relatively high degree of fluency and, while it's a great hobby for personal growth, the payoff is really poor for career opportunities. If you want to do it because you just like those cultures, go for it, but I wouldn't expect to get anything from a professional development perspective.",

I was able to end the prices with one when I got the offer at my current job \n\nWhat follows is my anecdotal experience. Companies are extremely picky right now. I would feel really strong about my interview performance. I would connect with the hiring managers and the CEO or CTO. I would feel great about my technical round performance. Then I wouldn't get the role. The reasons given, because I would always ask for feedback, were typically that I performed well, but someone was a better fit. Which makes sense. There were probably five hundred or more applicants. But a few of those I would see the same job posted a week or two later, those were frustrating. \n\nMy advice is to keep a pipeline going. You want a few of those initial recruiter interviews a week so that you have a couple of technical and later stage interviews going at all times. The process seems slower than it used to, like a month or longer from application to offer. \n\nAnd give yourself grace. This is really difficult and you are going to get down on yourself.

But long term today is not as clear to consider the USA is better even at more pay. Depending on what you want of course.\n\nI'm retiring in France in 3 years. Not French, and hopefully B2 French by then. I have often regretted not staying in Europe but back then options weren't as plentiful as here. Still aren't. \n\nBottom line. If you value money vs quality of life, or adventure vs quieter life, America is good. But it's changing, as is Europe.",

        "body": "FYI: most of these comments are from students or new grads who have maybe worked 1 or 2 shitty jobs. \n\nThe real answer is that it entirely depends. Compared to the Netherlands, the US is a massive country where each role and each company and each city will lead to a VERY different life. \n\nIf you move to the US you might be working 80 hour weeks with barely enough to pay rent and get laid off after 2 months, OR you might work 40 hour weeks, earn $300k+, have plenty of vacation days, and stay at the same place for 5/10/15+ years. \n\nSo, my advice:\n- Apply around to roles in mid- or large-sized cities (NYC, Seattle, Chicago, etc.)\n- Interview IN PERSON (do not assume anything about a company based purely on what they sell you during an online interview - make sure their success is tangible) and thoroughly research employee reviews \n- Only accept an offer if your gross income will be 2x the household median income or higher FOR THAT SPECIFIC AREA \n- Do not actually move until you have signed an offer and your start date is <2 weeks away \n- Keep an emergency fund of at least $30k \n\nIn general, just be smart about it and you’ll be fine. \n\nEdit: just want to mention that this advice is specially for OP. Someone with less experience or who lives in the US already doesn’t need to have as high of standards. ",

They might only have 2 weeks PTO, might be 100% in the office, might have a terrible company culture, are extremely low paying (less than 104k), etc.\n\nFor others, it's great. They have 4-7 weeks PTO, are hybrid, or even fully remove, with a great company culture that is extremely high paying.\n\nAnd a million flavors in-between. There is no single concept of being a SWE in the US. There is a ton of variety.\n\nMy main advice is to never move before you actually have a job lined up. Don't move to SF with the hopes that the move will land you a good job, because there's a real possibility that it won't. If you want to move to SF, look for jobs in SF, and only move once you find one you like, that meets all your personal criteria.\n\nAs for COL, AI, and google searches aren't good here. Don't rely on a calculator to tell you that you need to earn $X. Living in a big city is inherently different than living in the burbs. Those calculators try to project what it would cost for you to buy a 2-3 BR house in the middle of the city, which is obviously millions. But in reality, nobody living in the city is buying a 2-3 BR house. They're buying a 0-1BR condo. It's an inherent difference in lifestyle. Calculators don't take that into account. They're also not great at taking into account neighborhoods. If you want to live frugally, you can absolutely find neighborhoods that are cheaper. If you want to live extravagently, you can absolutely find neighborhoods for that too. Calculators just average out an entire city, as if there aren't 100 neighborhoods within that city each with their own COL and culture.\n\nCompute the COL difference on your own. When I moved from the Midwest to the East Coast, I actually looked for apartments that were in an area I wanted to live in. That gave me a realistic number of what it would cost for me to move, and what my COL hike would be. Find apartments you would *actually* live in. That's your COL increase.",

Chronic pain issues, like what? Are you injured, is it just pain because you sit at a desk for 10 hours a day? Either way that's a physiotherapist/doctor issue. \n\nDepression would be a therapy thing, I imagine that it's linked to your health too. I'd be pretty sad too if I had to live with chronic pain. \n\nDon't worry about your girlfriend, if she's good for you she won't leave you because you lost your job.. but the caveat is that she might have a chat with you or *consider* leaving you because you're not willing to fix your situation. No woman in the world wants to play mother to their boyfriend (unless they're abused or manipulative). Either way, you're smart and driven enough to work in this industry I'm sure that wouldn't be the reason a good girl would leave you. But your depression and anxiety? it might contribute, not specifically because you have depression or anxiety, but because of what depression and anxiety can do to you and those around you. So you need to really lock in and get those things sorted. How? idk, therapy? but ask someone more qualified than me (probably a therapist lol). \n\nAt the end of the day, no matter what job you pick you still have to pick a flavour of shit to eat. I've worked everything from warehousing, labouring, construction to office based engineering.. all are good and all can be shit. \n\nAt the worst you could probably try a more \"chill\" job that pays less, like part time stocking shelves or something.

Then we give them minor features or whatever the more senior engineers can dig up for quick hits.

Product manager wants shiny new feature in the shipping module, senior engineer on the shipping team works with UI/UX and architecture to design it and implement it.\n\nStaff+ engineers own entire business domains or product verticals -- using my previous example, we have a few staff+ people in \"logistics\". Product manager, or more often chief, says logistics needs to do X Y Z for our customers by 2026. Staff+ engineers work with engineering managers and product managers to plan/execute the work required for X Y Z by 2026.",

For the first month they did an extensive onboarding which involved teaching me as much about Java, Spring, Typescript, and React as they could. They also had me develop my own application from scratch to get me familiar with their process and tools. After that I was treated like any other developer on the team and given tickets. It’s a small team and everyone on it really loves their work so it’s very fast paced and I get to make meaningful contributions all the time which is great. I am a junior and have a ton to learn but with it being a small but stable team I am able to work on a lot of real work with real contributions which is nice, I am never sitting there trying to find something to do and was given really good training which I think is rare.",

They'd verbally tell you you're underperforming, and they'd work with you to improve your performance.\n\nThe PIP is a last resort. It's not something managers give people right away at the first sign of poor performance. It's something managers give people they already plan to fire. It's a paper trail. That's the sole purpose of a PIP, to serve as a legal paper trail of poor performance so you can't claim the company wrongfully terminated you.\n\nYou should absolutely start applying to other companies.\n\nOne aside though... it sounds like you're blaming all of this on the fact that you're quiet, don't chit-chat, do your work, and leave. Are you sure that's the cause? I'm quiet, I don't chit-chat, I do my work, and I leave, but I've never had issues like this. I've had bad managers before, but it doesn't have anything to do with my introvertedness. Just ask yourself that question. If there was a deeper reason behind this PIP, figuring that out would benefit your career. Ignoring it, blaming your quietness, and carrying whatever trait got you fired with you the rest of your life will make your career very painful.",

        "body": "I had a guy like that on my team. He wanted the whole codebase changed basically and when he didnt get his way he'd go to Jr engineers PR and lightly suggest these nitpicky changes. \n\nI dont mind changing a variable name or a method name or even a small refactor in a file I am touching. Things that wont add a shitload of time to the PR. Like if im already making a change to a file and someone had a nitpick comment I think I can quickly add, ill add it. \n\nBut sometimes in the cases where it is beyond the scope of the PR I think doing what Sidereel said is the way to go. Most jobs reveiw you on your PRs and output. If it doesnt have a task, then they assume you didnt do it. Even if you do it yourself, it's better to create a seperate task because now you have the proof that you worked on something. Like let's say your task involves, creating a new method in Foo class to make Foo multithreaded or some BS like that. Principal Engineer who loves to nitpick, adds \"since you are touching this file, this other irrelevent method (let's call someMethod) just doesnt look good in this file and would be better used in Boo class. Please move it to Boo class\" When you look into it, you realize Foo::someMethod gets called in a few files that could take at least an hour of your time to fix, build, test, etc. You can either change it in the current PR because it's easier than having to create a new branch, rebuild, retest, etc. But the downside is when the current PR gets checked, you wont get credit for that refactor becuase that wasnt part of the task. So your manager will see all the tasks you have completed and he wont give you credit for that refactor. He will view it as the PR took you longer than it should've.   \nBut if you create a seperate task, sure it might not get fixed right away but once you do it, you will get credit for the refactor. Software enginneering is about playing the game. A piece of advice I heard was, it's better to do two tasks and show your manager all the work you did than to do 10 tasks and not say anything about it.  \n\nSome higher level engineers dont care about your career that much they care to get what they want in the codebase. They have the belief that it's on you to defend your career (which it is) and if you are going to be a pushover than so be it. \n\nI learned that mistake a little too late. When the higher level engineer ask for something, I did it with little pushback. I wasnt afraid to say something I just didnt think it was a big deal. But then my PRs had more iterations than they should've and would spend an extra day or two longer due to some of these changes this guy wanted. Guess what was said in my review session? That my PRs take a bit too long and have a bit too much iterations. Guess who told my manager that? The higher level engineer. \n\nI think if it takes too long and is outside of the range of the PR, just politely say \"I gave it a quick look. It seems that this is outside of the scope of the ticket. WE can have a quick chat and if it's really needed I can create a seperate ticket for this.\"",

What matters is that you identified a critical performance bottleneck, diagnosed the root cause of database deadlocks, and implemented a solution that increased concurrent request capacity by 50x. That's the kind of impact that makes interviewers sit up and take notice.\n\nThe startup context actually works in your favor here because it shows you can thrive in environments where you have to wear multiple hats and solve complex problems with limited resources. Frame it as a story about your problem-solving process - how you noticed the performance issues, investigated the database connection patterns, identified the deadlock scenario, and engineered a fix that dramatically improved system scalability. Interviewers love hearing about real-world debugging skills and measurable improvements to system performance. I'm on the team that built [ interview AI](http://interviews.chat), and this is exactly the type of technical story that tends to trip people up when they're trying to present it effectively, so having a tool to help you practice articulating the impact and technical details can make all the difference in landing the role.",

Through various debugging and unit testing skills I discovered that there was a potential deadlock that went unnoticed. I presented my findings to the team and after resolving the issue we starting seeing the max db connections go up to 500 as expected\".\n\nMaybe tie in the business impact of it too. Like it saved the company millions of dollars in troubleshooting or some BS.\n\nI dont see how this story makes you look bad. You didnt make the error, you found it and fixed it. Honestly, debugging skills is something that many companies value. Because many of these codebases are complicated especially in databases. If you can find a difficult bug in a large and bad quality codebase, you can defientely do it in a large, better code quality one. I would leave it and use it as an example.

Think local/state government contracts as well as contracting for companies.

I've seen plenty of introverted product managers so long as you can still articulate and do the coordination part of the role, not every product manager is the energy spewer.\n\nYou can understand whether you will succeed in product management by the views you take on things as a developer. How much you prioritise the business goals over the technical goals (etc, etc).\n\nDo you feel comfortable taking what the team is telling you and communicating that to leadership (spending time on powerpoint, and project management software to communicate this). Do feel comfortable interpreting and communicating changing demands from the leadership to the team?\n\nI will regularly talk about what I don't know and the path gaining that knowledge. Having said that tools like NotebookLM and equivalent have made it much easier to become a rapid expert on a given subject.\n\nGaps in CVs depend heavily on how you sell it. Selling it as T shaped individual is an amazing way to make yourself look better not worse. I've taken large amounts of time off and live a fairly unorthodox life (nomadic) and if anything it's helped my career rather than hindered it. I'm seen as a little bit crazy and edgy and that helps break preconceptions.\n\nThings like taking up sailing or other activities can be a great way of demonstrating that you have depth.

I would definitely take everything you believe about yourself and spin it to explain why that would make you a good product manager. Every development experience that exposed you to good and bad product management. Every time you stepped in to wear that hat.\n\nI'm expecting there to be a real hybridization of some of these roles anyway over the next few years with the increasing impact of AI, so enhancing your skills on this side is a wise move regardless of whether you become a fulltime product manager.",

That intellectual honesty built more trust than any amount of confident bullshitting ever could. \n\nYour dev background gives you a massive advantage because you actually understand what's possible and what's painful to build, which is surprisingly rare. Own that art/writing gap. It shows you think differently and have a broader perspective on user experience and storytelling, both crucial for PM work. \n\nThe buzzword thing is spot-on; the best PMs translate complex ideas into simple language that engineers, designers, and executives all understand differently. If you want to level up your PM knowledge systematically, Product Alliance has some of the most comprehensive interview prep and frameworks I've seen. Their modules cover everything from product sense to execution and they're particularly strong on teaching you how to structure your thinking without relying on empty jargon. \n\nDon't fake being someone else. The industry needs more thoughtful, technically-grounded PMs who ask hard questions rather than confident performers who can't actually ship anything.",

It seemed like it was worthwhile, as I really wanted to expand my horizons and I feel I'm valuable as a leader. The politics were very difficult, sometimes. The work piled up, as I was expected to be an IC sometimes, help other ICs, run a team, and help run a department. Meanwhile, the pay did not scale with the work, and in fact the job opportunities compared to IC opportunities were not as sustainable. This meant less jobs open, and lower salaries at the top end compared with other senior engineering positions. \n\nI feel that you have to find the right situation with a manager who can effectively protect your time and scope, so you aren't doing too much. You also need help, politically, so you're not swimming upstream against people more senior than yourself. Of course, you have to be pretty dedicated to doing a good job, on top of that. It's a lot. \n\nI do believe that there are probably thousands of successful engineering managers/leads, but I also believe that many are burned out or are burning out. Maybe if you feel excited, it's worth trying, but if you keep getting burned out, it's time to retreat back to the IC world. I'm honestly still trying to figure out what I'd do next. Good luck OP and let me know if you have any questions. I was a team lead/engineering manager for several years at big banks, with 30 total YOE.",

You can start by asking them where the holdups are and see what they say/ take it from there.

Not everyone on my team has the skills to manage epic level work streams, but everyone is forced to try. Once you can delegate the work streams, the job then becomes about planning what those work streams will be, coordinating the various stakeholders, and inevitably dealing with whatever crisis comes up.\n\nWhen an engineer is under-performing, it's on them to ask for the help they need. With 8 people on the team, that's a lot of individual work to over see, and I imagine it'd be all consuming. Therefore, it's okay to look out for the engineers on your team, make sure they have the work streams they need for a good review, but you need to let them do the work and decide when they need help. I'll never be able to apply my own standards to under-performers, but to some extent doesn't it doesn't matter. If an engineer isn't a net benefit to the project, and I can't help them become one, I just involve management and we deal with it that way. Team lead is not a people management job: it's not command, but the soft power of influence.\n\nAt least on my team, as a lead I try to focus on three things: planning, communication with other teams, and review of our execution. Most of my focus is on long term planning, and the sprint plans are basically up to the engineers. After all, the team lead is in a unique position of owning the outcome of the team, that all parts fit together and contribute to whatever goal management put you on. From that view, the single most important thing you can do is ensuring the project is going in the right direction.\n\nDoing a great job as a team lead, you'll essentially make yourself redundant. Most of the work you are describing, could be by the people on the team with only a little coordination cost.",

From my experience, 99% of new devs (interns, salaried, contract, whatever) get that same feeling when jumping into an established company with an established codebase. No reasonable person will expect you to \"just get it\" right off the bat. Keep asking questions until it clicks. It's the only way you will learn.\n\nThat said, what I wish I had done much sooner was to just spend time with the software. Poke around. Get a feel for what the user's experience will be. Try to understand what problem it is that your software is trying to solve.\n\nFor me, I jumped into smart agriculture development with zero farm experience. It wasn't until I sat in a combine and just drove around for a day that I understood why x button is there, why menu z is nested in menu y, etc.\n\nFrom there, you can start to understand the hows and whys of the software design. Most frameworks just tackle one area (except maybe for the \"we've got it all\" frameworks like Qt), so understand what frameworks/middleware you're using and, more importantly, why you're using it.\n\nAnother thing you can do it almost any industry is look at other people's PRs. Presuming the title is \"fixed a bug where x would happen when you do y\", make a chain in your head between x and y and the chunk of code that was modified. It's a decent way to start connecting those dots. Plus, informally, it looks very good if you can say \"oh yeah, I saw something about that in Tim's PR\" since it shows you're engaged and taking an active interest.\n\nOn a less technical note, nobody gets mad at the new guy for asking questions because they understand it's all a lot to take in. They have all been exactly where you are right now. What people DO get upset with is a developer who has been onboard for 6 months, a year, 3 years, or whatever and still doesn't know some of the basic things. Ask questions, take organized notes.\n\nOtherwise, if you have any specific questions about the industry you're in, what frameworks you're using, etc, feel free to ask her and we can lend a hand or at least point you in the right direction!",

Pretty much every first time intern will experience the imposter syndrome. The company knows you’re still a student. The company knows that the point of an internship is to learn. You are not dumb, my friend.\n\nMy advice is to find a colleague, maybe someone in your team or someone who’s working on something you’re curious about/interested in, and schedule a 30 minute meeting with them. Ask them about their journey and their role in the company. And then talk to them about yourself and your journey. If you like the conversation, make it a point to speak to them regularly. Congratulations, you just got yourself a mentor.\n\nThe mentor will look out for you. They’ll give you some guidance and hopefully show you the ropes. They can help you parse the code base. And if they don’t have an exact answer, chances are they know someone who does. They’ll help facilitate those other connections. See, something you learn is that people love flattery. And there’s nothing more flattering than a young person latching on to you and seeking you out because you gave them clarity. That’s the power of networking.\n\nBest of luck out there. Deep breaths.

I think that is a large factor here, actually.\n\n\nIf we're talking, I don't know, 1-3 years, you're likely competitive for entry-level-ish SWE jobs -- you have real, paid, dev experience, but, as you say, are almost certainly lacking in some skills. Some companies will pass on a resume that looks like yours, but plenty won't. For larger companies, whether your degree counts as \"or related field\" is going to be a factor -- they're going to be less flexible when it comes to degrees.\n\n\nThe PhD is mostly useful in two scenarios: companies in industries where your background is relevant and it'll open up ML/DS roles as an option if that's something that interests you. Otherwise, 99% of the time, it's either irrelevant or a negative (\"not practical enough\"). The last 1% of the time, someone will understand it as a marker of grit and problem solving skills.",

The reality is that your academic background gives you skills many traditional developers lack - you can talk to stakeholders, understand complex problems, and build solutions from scratch without hand-holding. However, big tech companies might worry about your code quality, collaboration skills, and knowledge of industry best practices since you've been working solo. The key is being upfront about what you know and what you're eager to learn, rather than trying to oversell your experience.\n\nYou're not really overqualified for mid-level positions - you're differently qualified, which can work in your favor if you frame it right. Focus on the problem-solving aspects, the full ownership you've taken of projects, and your ability to work independently, but also emphasize your excitement about learning team dynamics and industry standards. Many companies actually love hiring PhD holders because you bring analytical thinking and persistence that's hard to teach. The trick is convincing them in interviews that you can adapt to their environment and that your unconventional path is an asset, not a liability. I'm on the team that built [interview copilot AI](http://interviews.chat) to help navigate those tricky \"explain your background\" questions that can make a huge difference in landing the right role.",

I joined the industry more than a decade ago, and things have already changed substantially. Even if we assume AI takes the first rung of coding jobs, the difficult part of software was never writing code, it's figuring out what we need the code to do, navigating various corporate processes, and knowing that the code we write will work as we intend it. What I see happening, is that in 5-10 years, programmers will be super-efficient, and our job will look more like a tech or team lead that serves as the owner for the code and interfaces with management and stakeholder.\n\nAnyway, software isn't going anywhere, it's going to continue changing, but no matter what, we're going to have more software in 20 years than we do today, and someone is going to have to build it, or at least be the person responsible for it.\n\nJob security in software doesn't come down to the coding skills, it comes down to all the non-coding skills you have. Are you experienced enough to learn new concepts? Can you lead a team? How well do you do working on ambiguous problems? Do you have a track record of producing results in difficult environments? How well do you work with others? These are the driving questions that determine employ-ability. You'll learn how to pass software coding assessments in school, but after that, employ ability boils down to the ability to contribute to companies bottom line. That's never going to change!",

If a listing has been live for more than two weeks with no hiring manager activity, pops up every quarter with the same wording, and shows fewer than five employee views from the company on LinkedIn, it’s probably resume-fishing. I always DM a current team member asking, \"Did this role open internally?\" – no reply or confusion is a red flag. Also watch the applicant count: 200+ resumes in 48 hours with no status change usually means the req is on hold. Instead of grinding those, push referrals; a thirty-second ping to an alum landed me three real interviews this year. I’ve used Huntr to track applications and Simplify to autofill forms, but JobMate is what I ended up using because it actually submits apps for me while I network. Ghost jobs are real, learn to spot them early.",

Clarifying the job you were interviewing for at the offer stage is scammy. There are situations where that could make a lot of sense for everyone but this doesn’t sound like that.

The key thing in my mind is to focus on salary, not level. If they pay you like a senior/staff/whatever, then fuck it. Take the money. Title aint shit without the money.\n\nI had a similar situation: I was hoping for staff engineer, but got a senior offer. I was up front from the beginning about my interest in the staff position: I think it's important to lay the groundwork early - if you go through everything at one level and suddenly ask for the higher, that won't go over well. Then later, at the offer stage when we talked about senior, I was clear \"Hey I started looking at these because of the salary band of this higher level - can we meet in the middle somewhere?\"\n\nThere are obviously no guarantees, but that's how I played it.

Fingers crossed I get more info on Monday. I was given the offer at the end of day Wednesday with no comp numbers and just an email from the recruiter outlining what I shared in my OP and a “we will talk about it on Monday”. \n\nI feel like after 5 rounds of interviews including an hour long presentation and a 4 hour panel, they should have given more info regarding the downgrade and not leave me hanging all weekend… but such is life. \n\nThanks again for your thoughts and experience",

It's also an intersection of computer science and maths. Most people here are more theoretically maths/stats heavy. Think advanced stochastic theory, measure theory, etc.\n\nIf you want to be.in the camp of majority of people here / software engineers that want to be implementing, building, or having sufficient conceptual knowledge around AI / ML - then you can get it from any combination of uni, self study, work and practical experience.\n\nMost unis offering these programs are masters by coursework. Some might have a small thesis component or project at the end. A masters by coursework is just units/subjects similar to your undergraduate. Most people take them to shift into a new field. A master by research is for those considering dipping their toes in research - effectively \"create new body of knowledge and how to build on others research\". It's more likely for someone to upgrade their masters by research to a PhD. They are two different purposes.\n\nFor your situation - \n\nYou could consider a masters coursework and supplement it with practical experience and self study. \n\nThe industry moves fast and you still won't learn things that people talk about now that trendy like mcp, ai agents, LLM, rag, all those tools people talk about like cursor / Claude etc.  These are just implementations / practical applications and they will change quick, some will be adopted and accepted and other dropped.\n\nThe masters program would be useful if you need a planned study program and if you wanted theoretical foundation that underpin AI  (provided the uni program unit) such as statistical learning, machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning Bayesian theory... How hopfield neutral networks work , Monte Carlo etc work. Remember ML / AI is actually intersection of CS and Maths. So when you pick a uni program, make sure it has a balance of CS and Stats. If you really wanted to go deeper, your maths level will need to go deeper.",
