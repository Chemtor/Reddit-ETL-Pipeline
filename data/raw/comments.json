Offshoring always ticks up when the business starts dealing with uncertainty in the market or some sort of economic downturn. Many of my previous companies used at least a small cohort of offshore resources and some even had entire teams that were offshored. \n\nEventually the result becomes the same. Either the offshore quality drops due to conditions in their own country deteriorating or individual resource quality drops enough that something triggers a management 5-Alarm fire drill trying to fix offshores output. It‚Äôs a boom and bust cycle.\n\nThe weirdest situation a company of mine dealt with (at least that I was privy to) was we had a group of offshore resources that worked at a shared office location in their country. The main analyst freaked out, suddenly quit, formed his own company, and poached the entire staff of his original team leaving only the ‚Äúmanager‚Äù for that team. The guy pretended everything was fine for 2 weeks and told nobody that he was soloing all this work. During that two weeks, he fucked up some report for management that made the corporate metrics look absolutely dogshit which triggered an analytics all hands meeting to figure out what was happening. Offshore ‚Äúmanager‚Äù joined remotely and when leadership asked to see the rest of the team, he just said,‚Äù what team? They all quit. It‚Äôs just me.‚Äù The next month or so the analysts across the company were helping do interviews to get more onshore talent.",

        "body": "Let me take a crack at it with a handful of examples:\n\n**First Normal Form (1NF): No Crowded Rows**\n\nEvery row should be unique, and you can't stuff multiple rows into one cell.\n\n*   **Rule:** Each cell in a table should have only one value.\n*   **Example:** Let's say you have a table of your friends and their favorite colors.\n\n**Messy (Not 1NF):**\n\n    | Name  | Favorite Colors      |\n    | :---- | :------------------- |\n    | Alex  | Blue, Green          |\n    | Bella | Pink                 |\n\nTo make this 1NF, you give each favorite color its own row:\n\n**Organized (1NF):**\n\n    | Name  | Favorite Color |\n    | :---- | :------------- |\n    | Alex  | Blue           |\n    | Alex  | Green          |\n    | Bella | Pink           |\n\nNow, every field in your table has just one piece of information.\n\n**Second Normal Form (2NF): Everything in its Right Place**\n\nThis rule is for tables that have a composite key, i.e. made of more than one part. It says that everything in the table should be about the *whole* key, not just a piece of it.\n\n*   **Rule:** Be in 1NF and have no partial dependencies. This means that all the information in a row must depend on the entire primary key.\n*   **Example:** Imagine a table for pizza orders. The key is the `Customer` and the `Pizza Type`.\n\n**Messy (Not 2NF):**\n\n    | Customer | Pizza Type | Customer's Favorite Topping |\n    | :------- | :--------- | :-------------------------- |\n    | Sam      | Pepperoni  | Olives                      |\n    | Mia      | Cheese     | Pineapple                   |\n    | Sam      | Veggie     | Olives                      |\n\nThe problem here is that the \"Favorite Topping\" is only about the `Customer`, not what kind of pizza they ordered that day. To fix this, we can split the table into two:\n\n**Organized (2NF):**\n\n**Orders Table:**\n\n    | Customer | Pizza Type |\n    | :------- | :--------- |\n    | Sam      | Pepperoni  |\n    | Mia      | Cheese     |\n    | Sam      | Veggie     |\n\n**Customers Table:**\n\n    | Customer | Favorite Topping |\n    | :------- | :--------------- |\n    | Sam      | Olives           |\n    | Mia      | Pineapple        |\n\nNow, the \"Favorite Topping\" is in a table all about the customers.\n\n### **Third Normal Form (3NF): No Secret Information Hiding**\n\nThis is about making sure that the information in your table is only about the main topic (the key) and not about other things in the same table.\n\n*   **Rule:** Be in 2NF and have no transitive dependencies (in other words, each cell on the row should *only* depend on the key, not on other cells)\n*   **Example:** Let's look at a table about your favorite Disney characters. We'll throw in their first movie appearance for good measure.\n\n**Messy (Not 3NF):**\n\n    | Character         | Movie               | Movie's Director |\n    | :---------------- | :------------------ | :--------------- |\n    | Buzz Lightyear    | Toy Story           | John Lasseter    |\n    | Woody             | Toy Story           | John Lasseter    |\n    | Elsa              | Frozen              | Chris Buck       |\n\nHere, the \"Movie's Director\" is really about the `Movie`, not the `Character`. If the director changes, you'd have to update it for every character in that movie. So, we split it up:\n\n**Organized (3NF):**\n\n**Characters Table:**\n\n    | Character         | Movie       |\n    | :---------------- | :---------- |\n    | Buzz Lightyear    | Toy Story   |\n    | Woody             | Toy Story   |\n    | Elsa              | Frozen      |\n\n**Movies Table:**\n\n    | Movie     | Director      |\n    | :-------- | :------------ |\n    | Toy Story | John Lasseter |\n    | Frozen    | Chris Buck    |\n\nNow, the director is in the \"Movies\" table, which makes more sense.",

E.g. you have the patient name, age, gender, etc. The doctor's age, name, gender, specialty, license number, job title, etc. You could store all this data in one table, but it's not very efficient and it may end up causing issues later. \n\nImagine what that table looks like, every time person A sees a doctor, you're writing to the database all the data about Person A, their name, their age, their gender etc. so if person A has 100 encounters, you're storing their gender 100 times. Same with the doctor. Every time the doctor sees a patient, if you store all the data about the doctor, you're storing their name every time. In addition to being very inefficient from a space perspective, it's harder to modify data later. Let's assume the doctor changes their name. Now you have to go back and update the doctor's name at every instance it was recorded in the database. \n\nInstead if you normalize the data, you have one record in a patient table to represent a patient, and one record in a doctor table to represent the doctor. Then you just give each record an ID and \"point\" to those records when you want to reference them from somewhere else in the database. It also has the benefit of conceptually distinguishing the different entities in the universe of data.",

It‚Äôs possible that the offshore resources will be entirely replaced with AI coding. It‚Äôs also possible that companies will demand generalized data professionals (kimball, analytical engineering, master data management, etc) and then those generalized people will just instruct AI to build solutions in the technology of the year. If this starts to become the trend, then you‚Äôll no longer need to keep up with mastering what language or platform is the yearly favorite and focus more on implementing value - how to ensure AI assisted code generation is working successfully at your company. This would be a very interesting and disruptive time to be a data professional! (If it happens)\n\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\n\n\nOne of the things I‚Äôm keeping my eye on is whether companies start switching develops each time management attends a conference and decides to change their stack. To be clear - I‚Äôm not seeing it now - but here‚Äôs the scenario I‚Äôm looking out for. \n\n\n1) outsource DE to India. \n2) hire X dev‚Äôs with current stack\n3) management changes mind on stack\n4) replace current India team with new India team who know new stack\n5) repeat yearly, each time manager attends conference\n\nThis catches my attention because of 1) the current trend of tools changing quickly, 2) the enormous availability of cheap labor offshore. \n\nKeep in mind, if managers want to do this, they will have no issue finding offshore bodies to fill roles.\n\nSo - as an onshore senior/lead Im happy I‚Äôm deep into a business domain (subject matter expert) and would be needed for more then my coding skills. \n\nIf you are worried about this scenario you might start by asking how you can fit into this paradigm. If a company won‚Äôt hire you because you are not a 10 year expert on an acronym that was invented 2 months ago - then can you fit into a leadership/guidance position to enable ‚Äúhot swappable‚Äù developers? I point back to the other comment in this thread - do you know Kimball? Do you know business processes, business data, and how to mature raw data into actionable insights which can reduce cost and increase revenue? If the answer is yes, you will likely be ok. If the answer is if no - I just know SSIS and I really can‚Äôt do anything unless my team lead holds my hand - then I would set some goals for career development.",

We compare partitions generated from prod and staging, get sign off, and deploy.

Then any downstream changes can always be deployed and rerun against these without data loss, only cost is compute.¬†",

Let me share a few previous posts to help you out.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mb3280/comment/n5m27am/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mb3280/comment/n5m27am/?context=3)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1m77ztz/comment/n4pn6zs/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1m77ztz/comment/n4pn6zs/?context=3)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lu3rhx/comment/n202zx2/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lu3rhx/comment/n202zx2/?context=3)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lj7ws8/comment/mzi4z7l/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lj7ws8/comment/mzi4z7l/?context=3)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kt45y6/comment/mtxmq6u/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kt45y6/comment/mtxmq6u/?context=3)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jigk9j/comment/mjina8d/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jigk9j/comment/mjina8d/?context=3)\n\nIf you have any more questions, (and I'd be surprised if you don't) feel free to ping me.",

A lakehouse is just storage plus some transform and serve. A streaming platform is just ingest plus a bit of transform. The tools evolve, but the functional flow is the same.\n\nThat Exasol guide you shared is good for grounding, and pairing it with hands-on projects (like building a mini pipeline with Fivetran ‚Üí Snowflake ‚Üí dbt ‚Üí Looker) really locks it in.",

I would say that if you explicitly say that the data is \\*copied\\* from source systems to staging area to the warehouse then some things may become clear.\n\nFor example, the fact that you can copy the same data to multiple staging areas and multiple warehouses, from the same source system.  It's harder to think about that using the word \"move\".",

Cool if you need it, 90% of places don't, and now you've lost all the advantages of a relational db.

I managed a team doing the platform work in this case, and we did build some great stuff: a linter that would block PRs if the SQL was messy, really useful costing analysis comparing actuals to planned budget, etc, etc.  But it was a brutal fight to attempt to prevent the entire solution from collapsing under the weight of tech debt.

A slow internet connection, poorly designed API and rate limiters can turn what you'd think would be an hours work into at least a couple of days.\nIts great when things work but IAC is like stepping into the dark ages when it comes to meaningful error messages.

You will learn a lot of the tools on the job if you dedicate the effort and time to it.\n\nSQL knowledge will get you by on a large portion of the job but for the specific things they're calling out like legacy ML code is likely going to be in Python or another language. You can definitely learn to code in those but reviewing, refactoring, and optimizing takes a lot of on the job experience to do well. \n\nI suggest really diving into understanding the broader concepts behind modern data engineering and working on some projects in Python at the very least. Example: build an ETL pipeline to pull data from a public API, shape it, and write it to a database. Then build a simple dashboard for it",

While catalogs can bring in documentation from different sources, they often still need supplemental information to bring things together in a cohesive manner. Because of that, if your people won't maintain it, it doesn't matter. So make sure you have some of those user types in your discovery meetings, because too often I've seen them skipped and not able to provide feedback and the catalog turns into shelfware that does nothing but extract metadata from your systems.\n\nLike everyone else in the thread has said, open metadata is rather popular and can be self hosted. Alation can get really expensive as you tend to pay per connector IIRC. Atlan has a lot of integrations, but I don't recall if you can host it. I've also seen Collibra and Data.World come up, but I'm not really familiar with them. Good luck on the discovery!",

A couple more angles from the Python side:\n\n* If your XML parsing logic is already in Python, you don‚Äôt *have* to switch over to Spark right away. Libraries like `lxml` or `xmltodict` scale pretty well if you can fan them out in parallel.\n* Dask is a nice middle ground since it lets you run the exact same parsing code across many cores/machines, then write out to Parquet in parallel. That way you can keep things Pythonic while still scaling to millions of files.\n* For cloud vs local: prototype on your laptop with Dask, then move the same workflow to the cloud when you hit limits. Tools like coiled make that spin-up pretty painless if you don‚Äôt want to manage the infra yourself. Worth noting coiled has other non-Dask APIs that might work well for scaling out arbitrary Python code (like their batch jobs api)\n\nSo I‚Äôd say: if your pipeline is mostly parsing Python ‚Üí Parquet, Dask can be lighter-weight than Spark. If you expect heavy SQL-style processing downstream, Spark/Databricks might make more sense.",

        "body": "I've been designing DW solutions for 30 years. Up until recently, surrogate keys were always defined as int or bigint and to generate them you used a sequential number generator or similar.  This meant a couple things.  You almost always had to process your dimension before facts (because the dimension table contained the mapping of the business keys to the dw surrogate key assigned).  When processing fact tables, for every fk, you would need to lookup the associated surrogate key in the corresponding dimension table.  In the old days when we were all using OLTP based database systems like Oracle and SQL Server (on-prem because that is all we had), using integer based surrogates added in performance at query time).  Later Dan L came up with Data Vault methodolgy.  That is a very different way of modelling with one of the often listed benefits of being able to process in parallel entities that would be come dimensions from those that were facts.  To do this, he used hashing (of some sort) so that you didn't necessarily have to process data in a certain order (apologies if I have some of this wrong....I only worked on 1 DV project 14 years ago).    The other thing which occurred was columnar database solutions, the cloud and elastic and ultra scalable dbms solutions like Snowflake (and before that Terradata and Netezza).  These systems reduce/eliminate the need to worry about defining surrogate keys as integers and using a hash methodology works fine so hence, you now see many practitioners use a fixed length deterministic hash column as the surrogate.\n\nBTW:  one of the lesser known reasons for using a surrogate (based on a sequential number generator) was that you build in some isolation from the source system.  While not common, systems of record have been known to change the key of a source record (probably seldom happens now) so using a surrogate key meant that it was possible to only need to change the relationship of the dimensional business key to the existing surrogate (no need to update the FK in all related fact tables where it occurred.  By using a hash, that won't work anymore since the source key fields which might change, will result in a different hash.  But since these new systems are so much faster, probably not a big deal (I don't recall ever running into that situation but I recall Ralph Kimball mentioning this in one of his books...I think)\n\napologies for rambling on.",

There are a few advantages:\n\n* Independent processing:  You can generate foreign key without needing to do a lookup. So you could create fact records without needing to join to already loaded dimensions, or satellite and link records without joining to hubs. This allows parallel processing that isn't dependent on load order (warning: it can also lead to including a foreign key that doesn't actually exist)\n* Prevent having to do multi-column joins. For example when you have to do a diff or merge for incremental load, you can join on the hash key. \n* Records from the same source data will have the same key in all environments. This can help in some testing scenarios. \n\nThere are some disadvantages such as increasing storage of the key, risk of collisions, and being less human-readable.",

Please add or correct. \n\nAdvantages of using hash function to generate a surrogate key over creating surrogate key from sequence \n\n1. During table load into distributed system, generating sequence could become a bottleneck where as if we use hash function based on business keys, they could be loaded independently parallel much faster. \n\n2. Anonymization: Hashing protects sensitive data by creating a oneway, non reversible key. By using hash keys, you ensure that the vast majority of your data warehouse users‚Äîwho are simply analyzing metrics‚Äîcan't even see the sensitive data because it's not present in the tables they access. Usually dimensional tables hold sensitive info like ssn, credit card etc. \n\n3. Efficiency while doing data lookups and data integration. Use of hash keyed surrogates avoid the need for what they call pre-join. Using a sequential key requires a lookup against the dimension table to find the correct key for a given business key. But if we are using hashed surrogates, we can derive this directly from the business keys and avoid pre-join. I think what they mean is an application querying with business keys does not need to go to the dimension tables first to find the sequence number foreign key and then use that to fetch fact table details. Instead, the application querying can directly generate a hash from the business keys that the user entered and query the fact table directly. \n\n4. If data is sourced from different source systems, the hashed key approach ensures the same key will be generated for say the same customer whereas if we use sequence, that will end up creating multiple records  for the same customer causing data integrity issues.",

I know at one point this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for.\n\nOne thing I'd suggest is trying to avoid a fixed requirement on docker containers or having a sprawl of dozens of individual components needing to run in tandem again for the smaller places/one man bands. They might not have capabilities to run Docker (IT blocking etc) and if the alternative is 15+ individual components all needing to be run at once then it'll be overwhelming.\n\nYour package avoids this currently so definitely worth sticking to that in my view. \n\nOutside of that some way to choose the destination DB engine would be good, Postgres is great and all but again smaller teams/OMBs might not get a choice and might be required to use MSSQL server or Oracle, or even just have a section within a larger warehouse like Teradata/Snowflake/Databricks that they get to use for operations. Don't think I saw anything for changing the write destination engine type so if I missed that then ignore me. \n\nGood work on it though!",

And yeah a python script with pandas and sqlalchemy could do it but that's assuming that the team have a python dev. Lot of data teams are basically SQL and their BI tool of choice only. This is where a simple GUI tool shines. They know the data, they know how they need to get it and where to get it but the how might as well be magic currently but a GUI tool to pick, load to staging and then do a series of basic cleaning steps to get it ready and save that as a flow they can schedule allows them a lot more capability and lets them get a lot more value from their data.",

I am only one person and not having to maintain dozens of scripts would be great. I also figured that the widget-based dashboard would be useful for the same reason.

        "body": "Better observability and pipeline monitoring. Often pipelines fail and there isn‚Äôt any notifications on the ssis end to let me know.  Recently I was told that he does allow me to use an smtp server to notify myself of failures. This is true and I only have one counter to it right now and that he doesn‚Äôt use the emails for the the packages he has  built in the past that my team relies on so often I am stuck trouble with stakeholders emailing me because he doesn‚Äôt let me know that something went wrong on his end. This brings my next point.\n\nBetter data practices. You could say that I could do this with SSIS and I could if I had the opportunity to but it‚Äôs not my environment and the dba will not let me try anything different in his environment. I want to standardize things like ci/cd and proper data pipeline monitoring as well as documentation.  From my point of view it seems easier to do so with a tool that aligns better with my skill set and the skill set of my team if I cannot change anything in SSIS environment. I mentioned in another comment that the dba didn‚Äôt go for implementing ci/cd in his environment.\n\nShorter product delivery times. This isn‚Äôt really because of ssis vs python. I could make an arguement like that but I know that that is subjective.  This is more about man power and ease of deployment.  There are more coders in my agency than gui developers and the business units are required to build their own data pipelines (dba words because he said that he doesn‚Äôt have enough staff who know ssis to support the business units. He only got two new people in the last few months and they aren‚Äôt trained.) from my point of view leaning into a coding based orchestration tool or a coding solution in general will alllow the business units to really build their own data pipelines efficiently and then IT and the dba can just manage production which is what he seems to want anyway. I guess I‚Äôm saying this will play to changing skillset of employees and allow the organization to develop faster as a whole instead of business units feeling frustrated by a slow IT.\n\n\nTechnical debt.  This one is tricky because I can see both the IT setup as technical debt and mine. My team is technically acting like a shadow IT in some ways and that always resulting in technical debt. However the dba is on an outdated SSIS. By that I mean he still uses msdb and hasn‚Äôt upgraded to ssisdb which would at least allow for basic version control.  Additionally as I said, he doesn‚Äôt really have anyone who knows ssis well on his team and therefore if he leaves one day my organization is in a pickle.  He can say similar for what I want to do but I am documenting everything I‚Äôm doing so there is at least that. Also I am training and have already trained people on my entire environment in case I leave. I do know that this point is probably the most debate point that I am making however. Overall I‚Äôm saying that if we move to a more modern setup that fits better with the skillset of those in and outside of the agency (outside matters since they are required to build their own data pipeline) then I think we can eventually get off ssis completely and overall have a more manageable system that more people are familiar with.\n\nI typed this up very quickly so it may not be the most clear response.",

The cloud databases are good because they are scalable so you pay less with smaller data volumes.  The big ones are Snowflake and Databricks that are full featured, but more costly and generally want you to commit to some amount of spend with them.  Google also offers GCP and AWS has Redshift (not recommended).  One other you might want to look at is Motherduck, which is quite a bit cheaper than some of the others.   You could also go the postgres route as those are fairly cheap on a number of clouds, but aren't optimized for analytics workloads though they are usable for smaller scale warehouses.\n\nThe database is the core, but then you need to figure out how to ingest the data from your source platforms to the warehouse and transform the data into table structures that support your reporting needs.  Again, there are a multitude of patterns and tools available.  A lot of companies with basic installs are using Fivetran or Airbyte to ingest the data and dbt to transform it.  Personally I wouldn't pay for those, but it simplifies the setup where teams are small or inexperienced.  \n\nThe real hit though is going to be contracting someone to build it.  It's absolutely not something you want to figure out on your own as someone that just writes some SQL and python.  Mistakes can cause issues with usability, create rework and even higher costs depending on your stack.  And to add to the fun, there are a lot of bad consulting firms out there that don't know WTF they are doing, so taking the lowest bid isn't necessarily going to get you to where you want to be.\n\nGood luck!",

Under the hood, NumPy typically uses C-level memory management (`malloc`/`free` or aligned variants) from the system runtime, though it also supports custom allocators.\n\nIn contrast, I expect stampdb to have lower overhead since it uses a straightforward C++ `std::vector` for memory management. By default, `std::vector` relies on the C++ allocator API, which eventually ends up at `malloc`/`free` as well. Our current plan is to provide only the thinnest wrapper around the C++ core. That said, we‚Äôre not claiming to be better than pandas in any way.",

But, it's a massive investment, and 3 years in we're still working on adding components that our manager estimated we'd have done in the first 6 months.\n\nIf you don't need that, its good, but get documentation of your code, your sql tables, try and centralise into a single semantic model if you can (short of data warehousing).  But the one thing that we keep running into with people creating their own dashboards is that they change the queries, they're no longer performant, take forever, use more resources, and they're reloading and recalculating the same details x 10 different queries in a power bi dashboard x 10 dashboards.\n\nSo, consolidation - if you can at least run the data out to a table, and then have any dashboards read from that table, then you'll be saving yourself.\n\nTry to source control your dashboards.\n\nIf you're using PBI online, if you can use things like datasets, that centralise the data, go for it.\n\nStored Procedures may give you more centralised control, semantic models are more or less exactly what you're creating in PowerBI anyway (source -> dim/fact tables + relationships + measures).\n\nCreating a centralised semantic model/warehouse that has all of your tables and data in one place, that you write your code and measures and everything once will definitely allow you to reuse it multiple times and is a big win.",

I‚Äôm coming from a DBA/SSIS/sql-heavy background though, and those approaching from a more software engineering background will likely recommend different approaches based on their favorite tech stack and their CI/CD and version control preferences.\n\nI‚Äôm not a big fan of text-to-sql or promptql-style approaches mainly because I feel like that‚Äôs something that should be more for data exploration and presented to the end user rather than a way to streamline your reporting pipeline - all my opinion though, I just don‚Äôt like that added layer of abstraction from data when I‚Äôm thinking about robust data processes.",

This can often be more reliable and cost-effective than external CDC.\n\nIf you're looking for a robust, managed solution for Snowflake-to-anything pipelines,¬†**OpsTree Global provides expert Snowflake data engineering services**, including custom CDC design and implementation.",

        "body": "The real fix is to stop file-sharing an Access file and put writes behind a server DB or a small API; at minimum split Access into front end per user and a back end on the share.\n\nPractical steps:\n\n\\- Short term: Manually split Access (no wizard needed). Backend: tables only on the share. Each user gets a local front end with linked tables. Turn on record-level locking, no datasheet edits, and keep persistent connections. Disable Offline Files on the share and use wired only. Nightly copy + compact/repair on a backup, not the live file.\n\n\\- Python GUI: wrap inserts/updates in explicit transactions, commit, and log the inserted PKs. Add a CreatedAt and a soft-delete flag to avoid hard deletes. Check for cascade deletes and filters that might hide ‚Äúmissing‚Äù rows.\n\n\\- Better: move the backend to SQL Server Express or Postgres on a small VM, link via ODBC so Access keeps working. Add a rowversion/updated\\_at for optimistic concurrency. Point the GUI to an API and keep the search hitting a read-only replica (SQLite/Parquet export hourly).\n\nI‚Äôve used Supabase and Hasura for quick APIs; DreamFactory helped when we needed REST over legacy DBs with RBAC so clients never touched the database directly.\n\nBottom line: put writes behind a server DB/API and keep Access as just a front end.",

I'd rather have my leadership evaluate our success by looking at major outcomes, what product & user reps say, and doing skip-reviews with my team members.\n\nBecause while measuring an outcome metric like lead time would be great, in reality even simple metrics need work: you'd have to deal with story prioritization (which may change), stories getting updated, dependencies, stories being split, etc.\n\nAnd I'd want health to capture engineer stress level, confidence in their peers, happiness on the job, etc.  Not just simply infer it from project metrics.\n\nSo, what I typically use include:\n\n   * story points\n   * team point capacity on a sprint by sprint basis\n   * excluding people on call from feature work, let them just chose whatever high-priority operational excellence work they want to focus on \n   * holding some capacity points in reserve to support surprises and urgent requests from users.\n   * application SLOs along with an incident review process with teeth - so that missed-SLOs can drive reprioritization.",

Because they're not going to sit down and do four years of work entirely alone, without classmates or teachers, without tests. They're probably not going to read books and do 40 hours of assignments per week for four years.\n\nI'm tired of the \"it's just a piece of paper\" crowd. It \"looks weak\" without it because it is weak. Without a degree you have none of the business background, no math, no probability, no stats, no physics, no engineering, no logic, no years of proofs, no architecture, no operating systems, no systems programming, no threading, nothing.\n\nIt's my job to tutor all kinds of people. I've been watching people self-study vs university students, and the holes in their learning is immense. All they do is WebDev and LeetCode. They think they know Big O but they don't. They don't know that it's worst case and why worst case is the one that matters because they don't know what p and np are. They're failing interviews because they can't explain what a log is from high school math or a limit from Calculus. They think it's not important. They don't know binary or anything about how data is stored. They're grinding \"DSA\" but they don't know that cache misses make a program 100x slower, because they never took \"useless\" courses like architecture or operating systems. They don't really get what references are because they never managed memory. They don't know how to comment or write documentation. They've never seen an actor diagram. There are entire courses on all these topics. This is just off the top of my head.\n\nMeanwhile, cheating has ramped up big time over the past ten years. People were paying Indians thousands of dollars on Chegg and Upwork to do their entire coursework for them. I know this firsthand. That was before AI too. Now it's totally fucked. Teachers literally can't give homework and it's a learning crisis. I don't know why people pay so much for education just to cheat and get the paper but it's not long before employers catch on.\n\nEveryone has it backwards. The degree is what's invaluable, not the paper. If someone actually pays attention in school, they will learn things that others will never know. The reason why so many think education is useless is because so many cheated their asses off. It's ridiculous that people actually think there's nothing to be learned from four years of education, but here we are, defending it again from Reddit.\n\nHere's a link for anyone who wants to self-learn:  \n[https://github.com/ossu/computer-science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)",

It is like trying to do calculus when you can barely add two numbers. If someone wants to make a game without the foundation then they will most likely flounder about cause they are trying to start on step 10 where instead they need to start at step 1 (what language do you know, downloading an IDE etc...)\n\nBut with the prevalence of AI, the barrier has been reduced down considerably. I condone the idea of 'vibe' coding ie copy/pasting what you see and not digesting (reading what the AI spit out doesnt count). But I do recommend asking thoughtful questions that are small queries to AI (how to do print statement, why is ('hello' + d) not working etc...). And when you get the response back, think about why it is telling you the error is happening. So if ('I said hello' + 10 + 'times') threw an error then the AI might respond you cant add a str to an int. Now think about why that is ie you are adding two incompatible data types (string, int) which should lead you to asking what kind of data types are there and why data formatting is important etc...\n\nWork on the proof of concepts, small building blocks first. Even if it is stupid like learning how to add two numbers literally on some scratchpad of your coding IDE that will help you on your journey. It builds momentum, confidence and skill so you know what to employ .\n\nYour first iteration will suck ass. The first 1000 line of legitimate code will suck ass. Don't try to be perfect.

You don't need a degree for this, but if you want to study it at this level, you will also be reading a lot of scientific papers as well.\n\nIf you want to be an engineer, like an actual engineer that requires certifications and to be able to code well enough that you're applying engineering principles to every project. If you want to be a REAL engineer, then that usually means gaining certifications from accredited organizations and/or governments. Think about it this way: A software engineer is, ideally, the type of person that creates software systems for things like nuclear power plants, utilitiy companies, hospitals etc.I look at it as you're working on aserious infrastructure projects and your code cannot break under any circumstances because the consequences could be catastrophic, costing people lives and stuff It always needs a failsafe if bad things happen. Like it still has to work somehow even if AWS or Azure servers go down. Multiple redudancies and all that.\n\nIf you simply want to code, you're a developer that mainly works n consumer grade apps. You don't need a degree or even necessarily certifications. You just need a somewhat robust portfolio, personal and volunteer projects, getting your apps into app stores, etc. IF things break down, people are merely inconvenienced.\n\n  \nDon't listen to all these others about a CS degree being meaningless.

Not saying you 100%  have to like all these things, but if you are lacking, you better do them like you love them. \n\nHere‚Äôs what you need to do, even if you don‚Äôt like it.\n\nLeetcode is a terrible assessment of ability, but I do believe you could get up to speed in about a month of regular study, at least enough for interviews. Go to neetcode, learn the algorithms first for the section you are about to try, then go do them. 30 mins is your max timer, if you get there, look up  the answer, and move on. At the end of your session go back and do the ones you missed. It took me about 2 weeks to get up to speed. \n\nPick a language, and ‚Äúmaster it‚Äù. What I mean by this is find a language you actually enjoy, who cares if it‚Äôs the most practical. Learn the basics, tips and tricks, become familiar with the standard library, build a pair with it, connect to a database with it, etc etc. roadmaps.sh is a good resource for what order to learn things. Being very capable in one language does help as you are aware of what is possible, then you can go translate it into another language. \n\nYou like frontend? Pick 3 popular websites, and remake them. For each use a different frontend stack if you don‚Äôt know what you like. I‚Äôll choose them for you, tailwindcss with svelte, bulma with React, and plain CSS with vanilla JS. Don‚Äôt stop until you have a working homepage and links. Add to GitHub and repeat. Obviously go expand on this as you go but these are starting points. Along the way take the time to explore and learn. \n\nSince it seems you‚Äôre still in school, get a tutor, join clubs, make friends to program with, go to hackathons, go to game jams, job fairs, etc etc. \n\nIf you really want to do this, write down a plan that would make it seem silly if you didn‚Äôt make it and then go execute. Stop saying you like the idea and go become one. \n\nCheers, if you want more specific advice regarding what to do let me know. Best of luck.",

BUT you aren't gonna be applying now and no one can tell the future, most self taught devs that aren't a part of a local group type thing/serious accountability group take about 2-3 years to get to a \"job ready\" knowledge base from my experience over the past 5ish years running my local group.\n\nWith college being out of the question for you this is gonna be a long journey so I would ask myself \"why do I wanna get in this\".  The ppl that come into my group and do it for the money/remote/travel the world traditionally don't make it and really the remote stuff is shrinking up A LOT.  But if you have legit reasons and even if they are the aforementioned ones Odin Project is still a great start to see if you really really wanna push through\n\nThis is what we do at my group.  Watch a 1-4 hr html/css course, then watch a 2-6 js for beginners course on yt.  Then just start building things (this works for us cuz we meet every week so they have us and the other ppl in the group who are super driven)\n\nNOW this does get a little harder if it's just you or you don't have a group like that but the key take away is you need to start actually building things as soon as possible, because you ARE going to suck and that's fine we all did, but that's when you learn.\n\nI have seen ppl with comp sci college degrees that can't build anything cuz they haven't yet.

I wager it could say things like: ‚ÄúSo, the AI said it wrote X using Y method. Whaaaaaat is happening - I better check the documentation for Y. That is *not* how it looks, the documentation from Y imports completely different methods‚Ä¶.‚Äù Etc\n\n- Document the whole process, by which I mean the prompt used, the AIs response, the code it gave, and your debugging notes.",

        "body": "I will go in the exact opposite direction if some comments here: This is a tough question to answer, because it doesn't really matter. I mean, languages are cool and all, but learning a new programming language really is not that hard, once you already know how to program. You can learn any language similar to the ones you already know in a week. \n\nThe more important question is: What kind of project structure, architecture and patterns do you learn. If you are going for \"applications and tools\", that can also mean many things. GUI or no, Desktop or mobile, which target audience does it have, what should it do? \n\nIf you want to be the most versatile, able to learn \"anything(TM)\" that might come up in a few weeks time, I would suggest having experience in at least one project / language out of all of the following categories (and each project must have a minimum complexity to \"count\"): \n\n  \n\\- 1 web based frontend. Can be pure html/css/minimal JS, or be fully based on a JS framework. maybe a homepage for a simple business, without a shop, like a bakery or a hair salon. \n\n\\- 1 non-web based frontend. A C# GUI in windows, a Java App on Android, a Swift UI on iOS or a QT-App in any language you want, it doesn't matter much. Probably a complexity between a calculator and a calendar would be good. Games work, but are normally structured differently, do I would advise against using a game engine unless you want to stick with gaming. \n\n\\- 1 complex application, written in a low level language, optimized for speed. A raytracer is the classical option, because it has good visual feedback, but a compiler, OS parts or a real time embedded component can all work. Suitable languages are C, C++ and rust. A compiler has the additional benefit of teaching you more about programming languages in general.\n\n\\- 1-2 APIs. It is great if you have both written a REST (or similar) API, accessible through the web (in theory, you don't need to deploy) as well as a library, that exposes a C-standard API for use from other programs. They are pretty similar in conception, but quite a bit different in practice, and understanding how both of these actually work, can be hugely helpful, even if you are only using them, and never have to build them again! \n\nYou should 100% have experience in one Object Oriented language. The best options are Java and C#. OOP (or some half hearted attempt at OOP) is still the standard in most industries. \n\nAdditionally, you should be comfortable in a language, suitable for scripting. Python and JavaScript, but also Bash are all options with different advantages. You need to know at least one. \n\nI think everyone can learn something from trying something completely different, so you should have done one project in a completely functional language. Haskell is my favourite, but F# and Clojure are also options. You will have to re-learn to think about programming, which is exactly the point of the exercise, not to use this exact language again in production.

Also all of them have a syntax which is derived form the C language, yes even Python with its move to significant whitespace instead of braces. So for these languages a lot of it is just learning slightly different syntax for the same thing, and learning to navigate a differently structured standard library.\n\nThen you occasionally hit concepts that is completely different and nothing like what is in the others. going from languages with implicit memory management to one where the programmer has to do explicit memory allocation and de-allocation for instance is a pretty big leap. In the languages you listed c++ is probably the hardest language to learn weather you learn it, first, second or fifth.\n\nAnd then you have languages which are just different. Javascirpt has prototype inheritance, yes even the modern versions with a class keyword still don't work the way you would expect them to. Really Javascript is a Lisp with C like syntax, and it works best if you treat it as such and write functional rather than object oriented code. Go and Rust are not Object oriented and also require a different coding approach. \n\nYou also have more exotic languages like Lisp, Prolog or Haskel that use completely different abstractions because they are just not descended from C at all. These are harder to learn because everything is different. But you are also unlikely to encounter these languages in a professional setting because very little production code is written in them.",

You don't just need to know comp sci, you need to know best practices, and have a good grasp of boolean algegbra. Doom is going to be throwing around terms like \"R-trees\" or \"Binary space partitioning\" so be prepared.\n\nAt the heart, what you want to make is a raycaster. Not \\*ray tracing,\\* but raycasting. The idea is you will write something that shoots rays out into the world, checks what they collide with, then renders that collision. It shoots a ray for every vertical column on the screen. That will get you a basic wolfenstein-like look, but those games, \\*especially\\* doom, do way more than just ray cast out in to the world.

CS education isn't technical school -- it taught you how to figure out how to develop solutions, how to learn new skills as a project demands, it almost certainly did NOT teach every single skill you'd ever use on the job. You will learn as you go, that is just the nature of the field. The knowledge snowballs, yes, but getting a new project, having no idea how to complete it, and having the skill to research and teach yourself is THE most important skill you can take away from formal CS education.\n\nAI is a research accerator and a peer programmer in your pocket. My employer recently started expecting us to start using AI like we've been using IDEs -- a core tool to speed and supercharge our development. So start/continue using AI as your coding partner and a research aid. Don't vibe code - hell no - but anything you'd search the internet to know, ask AI first, then dig a little deeper, fact check it - its the faster version of digging through stack overflow and stack exchange and reddit to cross reference the collective knowledge, right? And have AI write code, do a peer review, build on what it writes, feed it back in - go back and forth with it, like you would peer programming. Use it to bounce ideas around and fill the gaps in your knowledge. If you rock up to an interview with the skill of knowing how to utilize AI effectively in your development, then you WILL be the most attractive candidate, because, honestly, a lot of experienced devs are behind the curve figuring it out and we're feeling the heat from our employers with all their crazy high hopes for AI.\n\nIf you like web dev, there are still plenty of jobs out there, even if the job landscape has thinned out and changed in the last 5-10 years. But also be open to try anything - I NEVER thought I'd end up a web dev, I didn't do well in those courses in school so I thought it was the LAST thing I'd ever do, but I'm SO GLAD I gave it a chance and I ended up liking it so much more than I'd ever thought I would.\n\nAlso, I got lucky: I was a year and a half out of school and struggling to get an interview for junior roles and was kicking myself for not trying to get an internship the minute I graduated. Some internships will accept you shortly after graduation, but most won't accept you more than a year out. But when I reached out to a connection about a junior role at their company, their company countered by offering me an internship which turned into a full-time offer and I've been there nearly 3 years now. \n\nSo 1) If you want workplace experience after graduation, definitely don't give up on internships (plural, even if you finish one, don't assume its gotta be one and done); post-grad internships are out there and experience is experience and employers love demanding 2-3y of experience from new grads and junior devs for some crazy reason. 2) Build your connections, reach out to your connections, never stop making them even after you land a job; they don't stress that enough in school, hell it probably should be it's own course its that important.",

        "body": "What the other commenter said. \"Efficiency\" like you describe is what managers see to juggle scrum points and velocity. It's a useless metric for actually working on code.\n\nImagine programming as a gigantic space of possibilities. You're searching for positions (programs) in that space that fulfil certain functional (the thing the program should do) and usually some non-functional requirements (memory/time constraints, being readable and maintainable). There's not one solution but many, but they are far out (as far as lines you need to write to get there). Each line you write gets you closer to some solutions and farther from others.\n\nUnless you have decades of experience and the program is quite small, it's usually not possible to just \"see\" a good solution and write it down in one go. You need to iterate on it, write parts of it you know will likely be part of a good solution. And even identifying those is lots of experience. Often you'll have to rewrite parts to make it work.\n\nThe first running prototype is usually garbage because it shows the meandering path you took to get there. Restructuring and cleaning up your solution is still expected when you work on large programs, so that the overall commit history doesn't look like a rabbit on acid typed it. This is something that is discussed in professional settings as well. If coders think refactorings are necessary, who will pay for them? Some teams just silently do them as part of other tasks, others try to communicate the need to higher ups.\n\n>  I've tried the Algorithmic thinking tip from the FAQ to help me plan the processes, but I don't notice classes and objects immediately\n\nThat part of the FAQ is not for planning programs. It's for translating doing something into a series of steps that a complete moron (i.e. a computer) can follow and not missing anything in the process. It won't help you with planning ahead. You don't want to plan your programs ahead, neither as a beginner nor as a veteran. It's nigh impossibly hard and the reason why Agile exists.",

Installation guides, both for beginners and for \"Python veterans\". They are short enough, so I can skim them both quickly. \n\n2. both tutorials. I will probably follow along with the \"Quick Start\", because it's short and will let me see some concepts hands on to start with, and I will skim the longer tutorial, as I personally already know how SQL works, and how an ORM works. If I were new to either of those concepts, I would work through it completely. \n\n3. I skip the migration notes, because... duh. \n\n4. Now we come to the complexity: In the section \"Reference and How to\" I would stop reading \"everything\", instead I would skim the chapter titles and try to remember, which information is available. Later, when I go ahead and actually map my first classes, I will open \"Mapping Python Classes\" and \"Relationship Configuration\", and then, when I go to test it, I would probably read more configuration stuff, so that I can be sure I didn't miss any important config options. \n\n5. I will skim the relevant Dialect Documentation, PostgresQL in my case. The most important things to note will probably be highlighted, and if I skimeed it, I will be able to go back later when there's an issue and be able to know, where to find the relevant information. \n\nEverything else I would just search in the docs, as it comes up. Such as error messages, or how to do a specific kind of relationship. \n\nJust reading and skimming what I outlined above will probably take 1-2 hours.

Your brain just gets lazy and used to it. This isn't even unique to AI, this is just how learning works, reddit can do the same if people wouldn't be so openly hostile towards people asking for help with minor issues. Instead tell your preferred AI that it should never just give you the solution and just analyze your code and point out where an issue might be. Then attempt to solve it by yourself.

        "body": "There's a concept called the Entity Component System model, or ECS which solves this issue in a way that also makes writing high performance code much easier. \n\nThe idea is that instead of having discrete classes for different kinds of creatures, items, or other game entities with all sorts of complex logic attached to them, you create simple data structure called an entity. An entity is usually nothing more than some kind of ID value, like an integer, UUID, or even a string. You then \"attach\" additional small components to that entity which give it additional properties. It's these components that hold the data that would have been held in the class. So the `hasHealth` component would hold maybe 2 numbers, max health and current health.  \n\nAll of the logic for the various components is handled by a set of \"system\" classes. Their job is to handle the logic associated with the various components. For example, the health system would handle adding or removing health on entities with a health component.\n\nTypically the way ECS are written let you query the world for entities with specific components (or the components of an entity and such), or sometimes more complex conditions like \"has components x y and z, but not a\". This query then will find the components that match and produce a list of entries which can then be processed by the system.\n\nThis is probably complete overkill for what you're doing, but it's becoming a very popular way to write games. It gets rid of the awkward problems that come from a more object oriented approach, and completely strips all dependencies between components and entities. This allows you to build up unique entities simply by combining different discrete components. Of course, for unique interactions you would occasionally still need to make 1-off components, but a *lot* can be done with only a small collection of basic components when you can freely mix and match everything, and implementing new kind of entities is often just a matter of figuring out what components they need.\n\nThis roguelike tutorial in Rust does a great job of explaining/teaching how you might use an ECS in a roguelike game: https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/chapter_2.html\n\nRoguebasin has a very basic Python implementation of an ECS: https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Entity_Component_System\n\nThere's a ton more information on ECS out there, this was just meant to give you a very very rough idea of the overall concept. There are quite a few ECS libraries out there in a whole ton of languages, but it's not that difficult to write your own either (at least as long as your not trying to squeeze every bit of performance out of it).\n\nHere are a couple blog posts that explain ECS and implement one:\n\nC++ - https://www.codingwiththomas.com/blog/an-entity-component-system-from-scratch\n\nC++ - https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/\n\nC# - https://matthall.codes/blog/ecs/\n\nHere's an ECS FAQ: https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq?tab=readme-ov-file",

The reason is because when it is 1.1, the C standard automatically casts it as float by detecting it as a decimal number.  But it doesn't know how to handle 1.1d0 in this context.

Then at api endpoints, each has a http verb and a route and will return a http response code.  You don‚Äôt need to know it by heart but look at what response codes could be returned, look at which verb each route uses and understand why - then you can build test cases to hit each one, like what data gets you a 200 ok response vs a 400 error response and how can you make each happen. \n\nKeep a notebook with everything you hear that you‚Äôre not sure about and Google.

APIs are how systems are made to be interacted with, think the buttons on the remote of your TV. *A Philosophy of Software Design* makes some interesting points about API design, but I think you'll need to progress a bit more before going into it.\n\nWebhooks are just a call back address for inter-service communication, the only trip up here is how more complex ones are implemented in code, but I don't think this should worry you at this point - the gist of it is \"Here's what I want, call me back on this number when you have it\".\n\nFor the rest, there's no specific order you have to learn things in, nor is there an expectation that you will instantly develop a deep understanding of any of these topics, as long as you understand how they fit together. Might as well focus on learning things that will help you be better at automation and save the deep dives for later\n\n1. TCP/IP, REST + others, if working in web\n2. Database basics, lock contention, ACID (if your work has you interacting/testing databases in any way)\n3. What does it mean to actually deploy something, what's going on behind the scenes (ssh, cp, configs, env vars)\n4. The basics of your language of choice, most common data structures (arrays, lists, maps)\n5. Once you're comfortable writing some code in the language you'll be using, go into whatever testing framework you'll be using (selenium?)\n\nNo one knows everything, so I suggest focusing on things directly related to what you want to do and then slowly expand your knowledge out of professional curiosity and/or to upskill.",

        "body": "First, you need to determine the width. The key to this is to look at the center line\n\n    4321234\n\nEach number is listed twice except 1, so you can use the formula `2n - 1` to indicate the width. In this case, `n` refers to the largest number (or the initial number picked).\n\nThe pattern is basically in two parts. There's the stuff reaching the middle line\n\n    4444444\n    4333334\n    4322234\n    4321234\n\nThen, there's the rest of it.\n\n    4322234\n    4333334\n    4444444\n\n### What's the pattern?\n\nYou'll notice the numbers are basically seven 4's on the first line, five 3's on the next line, three 2's, and finally one 1 at the end. So the pattern is: 7, 5, 3, 1.\n\nThe idea is you print the numbers doing down, like \n\n   43\n\nThen when you reach 2, you print 2 three times, \n\n   43222\n\nThen, you do 3 4 at the end (going back up).\n\n   4322234\n\n\n### Coding logic\n\nSo, let's see how we can do that one line. Let's put it in a function\n\n    void printLine(int size, int patternLength, int currNumber)\n\n        // Step 1. Count down\n        for (int i = size; i > currNumber; i--) {\n           printf(\"%d\", i);\n        }  \n \n        // Step 2. Print repeated numbers\n        for (int i = 0; i < patternLength; i++) {\n           printf(\"%d\", currNumber);\n        }\n        // Step 3. Count up (you do this)\n\n        // Final newline\n        printf(\"\\n\");\n    }\n\nSo, then you have the main function\n\n    int main() {\n        // Assume the user enters in a size and it's stored in size\n       int size = readSizeFromUser();\n       int patternLength = 2 * size - 1;\n       int currNumber = size;\n       // Print the pattern up to the midpoint\n       for (int i = size; i >= 1; i--) {\n           printLine(size, patternLength, currNumber);\n           patternLength -= 2; // Next number is printed this many times\n           currNumber--; // The next number is decreased from the current\n       }\n       // Another loop to go from 2 to size to do 2nd half\n    }\n\nI've left a lot of code out for you to think about, but hopefully, you get the idea.",

Programming books also occasionally contain such problems in the exercises sections but are normally paired with whatever you were supposed to learn in that chapter.\n\nFor this problem I would try to figure out the \"general rule\" (someone already said that it is the distance from the center). Usually this will result in the easiest-to-test and most-likely-to-be-correct solution.\n\nIf you can't figure out the general rule, take a piece of the problem which is solvable and then work backwards from there. For example, for n = 3, the middle line is this:\n\n    32123\n\nFirst write a loop that outputs just this line, for any n. That's part of the problem. Then work backwards to make it work similarly for the other lines (so that the line before middle is 32223, and so on). Doing it this way is fine too, but there are more opportunities to mess things up or to get edge cases wrong.\n\nFor the given problem this is not really a problem, though, since \"exhaustive testing\" is pretty straightforward. You can run your entire solution on all values of n = 1 through n = 9 inclusive and make sure that the output is according to the specification.

Can you entirely avoid branching aside from the necessary loops by writing a value every time? How can you generalize your condition to give you a number to write instead of a boolean? This will prevent a large void in the middle.\n\nSomething that might make it more efficient: how can you restructure the loops such that the number to be written at each position can be directly inferred from only the iterator values at that position, so aside from the code configuring the loops, nothing else needs to be aware of how large the square is? If you try to make n only exist in the loop headers, I think you will find a more elegant solution without a big mess of addition and subtraction of i, j, n, and 1 going on inside every iteration.

Particularly [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). It‚Äôs how I myself started coding, with python same as you. It has a bunch of problems arranged by difficulty going from 8-kyu (easiest) to 1-kyu(hardest) iirc. You can start doing some of the 8 kyu ones and progress as you see fit. You have as long as you want to solve them, and once you do you can see other‚Äôs solutions.\n\nDO NOT USE AI, or be very careful in its use. Always always always understand the code you‚Äôre using. And especially for these types of projects, I‚Äôd say don‚Äôt use ANY code generated by ai, it kinda defeats the purpose. You can use it as a googling aid ‚Äúhow do I get the length of an array, but not as an actual coding assistant ‚Äúgive me a loop that finds the highest value‚Äù.\n\nAlso, when you see code by others, don‚Äôt think you learned whatever you saw because you understood it. That don‚Äôt mean shit if you can‚Äôt recall it when you need to. Seeing the solution to the problem is obvious, and easy to understand. But if the next time you find that problem you can‚Äôt remember or recreate the solution, you‚Äôre still fucked. Until you can generate the code/algorithm yourself from scratch, you don‚Äôt know it.\n\nGood luck out there.",

You do become acquainted with the variable quality of resources out there.\n\nI'd say it's a great framework to learn full stack. It gives you quite a few projects - you can go deep dive into areas that interest you, and skim others that don't (come back to them later, maybe not).\n\nYou'll fly through the early lessons. Skim through the curriculum. But just get started- you know soon enough if it's a good use of your time.",

IMHO good for training problem solving and debugging skills, as well as some logic (AND, OR, etc.).\n\nTIS-100 - Somewhat like Shenzen, but more simplistic. Has you program the fictional TIS-100 chip for various purposes. Uses an Assembly-like language.\n\nWhile true: Learn(); - Primarily visual programming, teaches AI and neural networking concepts.\n\nGrey Hack - Very nice hacking game where you can build your own exploits and helper programs. Uses its own scripting language, but does teach you problem solving and how to help yourself with code.\n\n\n\nThen there's the real kicker - try to program simple games in C# yourself while learning. One of my firsts was a simple hangman/wheel of fortune game that I made as a console app. Trying to render simple console stuff and text graphics is a good way to start out learning the fundamentals of graphics programming.\n\nAnother good start could be making a simple 2D engine for a shoot-em-up, which can teach you how to manipulate graphics, make sprites and move stuff around. My first one back in the day ran inside a C# form using GDI - it was a b\\*tch to program, but included a very simple AI, parallax scrolling and some other neat stuff.\n\nBack in CS class, I had a semester project (actually two), that consisted of a tile engine running a sort of educational RPG. It was written in C# and ran on the now-dead XNA framework...\n\nIt's probably the harder way to go about things, but it's something you can do as side projects while learning the basics of C# before moving on to Unity.",

When I say \"how computers work\" - I mean things like the different components in your CPU, how the ALU works, how instructions are executed, how memory is allocated, how processes are managed by your OS - all those kinds of lower-level plumbing things. \n\nThe problem isn't that you are not talented / smart enough - the problem is that computers are a giant clusterfuck of abstractions upon abstractions, and understanding what the hell is going on down to the electrical level takes a lot of time and a lot of learning, hence why coding might look & feel like \"magic\".\n\nTL;DR - If you want to *actually* become proficient, then start teaching yourself more about how computers work. Also I'd recommend just starting with Python and using something like PyGame to make a simple game. You will most likely never run into Godot in your life ever again.",

Body builders are never entirely happy with their figure and still want more muscle growth. The same thing happens in our brain with code. \n\nEven very successful games have had a history of terrible code. Pok√©mon sun and moon is a very famous example of poor project organization and I'm pretty sure eve online had to rewrite their engine before because of how much spaghetti was in it. It happens and you will learn with experience. Just keep making your games and more will click\n\nAlso, I do want to address the anxiety here. If you go in to every hobby and skill wondering if it's for you and get analysis paralysis then you will never truly enjoy anything new and give it a chance. If you have a hard time addressing this i do recommend seeking help and learning to be more comfortable in your own head and getting some confidence",

Who knows, if I'm the interviewer and I have a fishy feeling that you're not \"up to snuff\" as it were, maybe I'll throw you a random algorithm question and see how you respond. And if you don't get the job, who knows, maybe you'll go off to Twitter or X or something and whine about how company Y wants people to memorize algorithms or something. Really? I don't think it's that simple in an interview situation.\n\nPersonally I think you should be able to program an implementation of something, given a description of an algorithm. All non-trivial programs that we are making nowadays are essentially algorithms to solve problems for which we (almost never) have a truly complete specification. The \"Algorithms\" in algorithms books are simply smaller problems which have been studied thoroughly, for which complete specifications exist.\n\nFor example, we know 100% what we mean to say whether a sequence is sorted or not, so it's easy to specify that a sorting algorithm takes a sequence for which that property may or may not be true and produces a sequence for which that property is true. \n\nThough even in that problem there are sometimes overlooked edge cases. For example, occasionally the difference between stable sort and unstable sort crops up naturally. If you have never studied algorithms, how likely is it that you would even understand the difference between a stable sort and a non-stable sort. Also how likely is it that you would know which algorithms guarantee stability and which ones don't?",

Intuition is knowledge you don't actively think about. It's implied. It's inherent to your thinking. It silently informs you and influences you. If you watch a master of his craft, any craft, you will see they make it look so easy. They don't \"just know\" better, it's not merely muscle memory, it's a career of lessons learned, and decisions made, and fundamental concepts wholly and completely understood.\n\nSo a master developer can get cracking at code in an instant, whereas you might have to spend a lot more time trying to understand the problem and design a solution. The master can do it because all that understanding and design work? Yeah, they already did that - same as you, even for this very problem today, they just did the work 20 years ago...\n\nSo you learn this stuff not because anyone gives a shit whether you can actually implement a binary tree in an interview.

Do not do that. Your teacher is not qualified to be teaching you. Unfortunately, you are where you are. \n\nWhat you \\*should\\* be asking is, what did you spend all that time on instead? I am going to give you the bottom line, I have worked in software for over 25 years, almost \\*invariably\\* the people in the field who a) get very good and b) enjoy their lives at work are those people who would not have done what you have done, because the project would have excited them from the start and they would be desperate to get hacking on it. \n\nThat's not you and you need to accept that. The question is, is this now your best option? If you tell me you have spent the last 3 years sitting on your ass and playing video games, maybe any kind of switch is going to take time, if however you told me you have been busy with other hobbies and interests, I would honestly and seriously tell you to choose one of those to turn into a profession if you can. \n\nSoftware development isn't going anywhere, but the gold rush is \\*over\\*.

There are cases where an AI backend is a wonderful and effective thing, but it is not always the case. For many tasks, thats just a crazy bloat, which slows down the app, makes it like 10x more expensive to run, and consumes much more electricity, all that to achieve the same exact result. \n\nSo, just go and make projects you enjoy. And as for the AI, do not use it as a default solution to everything. Might be a fun addition sometimes, but not always. Instead, if you want, use it as your stack overflow summarizer, or debug assist.

        "body": "Massively simplified analogy: You need to find the email of Professor Dan to beg him to let you into his full class next semester. There are a number of ways you can go about getting that:\n\n1. Ask your current CS teacher what Dan's email is. He says \"I don't know, Professor Smith might know though.\" So you go ask Professor Smith what his email is and she says \"I don't know, but Professor Stevens might know.\" You go ask Professor Stevens and she says \"I don't know, try Professor Jones.\" You keep going down the chain, each person telling you to go talk to someone else, until you reach someone who knows what the email is, and who knows how many people you're going to have to talk to and you just don't want to do that.\n2. So you realize that oh wait, you can just look him up in the staff directory and find the email that belongs to him. You know he's a CS professor so you can just start with the CS directory instead of scanning down from Dr. Aarons in Academic Advising, and you already know the guy's name is Professor Dan so you can just jump to D.\n\nThat's basically the difference between finding something in a linked list vs. hash table In reality it's a bit more complicated:\n\n3. Suppose you go to the staff directory and it's not in alphabetical or department order -- it seems totally random. Also, it's split into 20,000 pages. So you have no idea where Dan is and you're thinking you've got to just work your way down, and you really don't want to do that. But then you see that the directory is maintained by the department weirdo Dr. Bryant. You go ask Dr. Bryant, who tells you almost immediately \"Dan? He's on page 56.\" You ask, astonished: \"You just memorized that???\" Dr. Bryant: \"Nah, I just multiplied the letters of DAN, so 4 \\* 1 \\* 14 is 56.\"\n\n4. You go to page 56, and sure enough there's Dan's bio and email. Problem solved! But then the next day you have a realization and go back to Dr. Bryant: \"Wait a minute, what if you hire another guy named Dan? Only one of them can be on page 56, your system won't work anymore.\" Bryant goes \"Uh..... wait, I know, his employee ID is 4LBA8F, and his ID is unique so I can just use that instead!\"\n\n5. Satisfied, you leave his office, then 2 minutes later turn around and go back in. \"But that's not gonna work either, what if you have employee 222 and 22B? Or 2BB? What about 6666, 666F, 66FF?\"  Dr. Bryant says he needs to think about that.\n\nThis is also massively simplified and obviously the actual calculations are more complicated, but that's the general idea: since your data is probably not going to be perfectly ordered, you need to come up with a function to map each item to a numerical value, and that value will be the index to the \"bucket\" of memory that data will go into. You don't want that function to come up with different values because that makes things complicated, but unless you have an infinite amount of space, it's impossible to prevent that completely. All you can do is try to limit how often it happens; there's mathematical theory for the best ways to limit that and various implementations for how to handle whatever collisions do happen.\n\n\"OK, why not make it ordered then?\" You could do that, but then you'll have to continually fix the order every time you insert new data, instead of just crunching a number for where to insert it. So if you're doing a lot of insertions compared to lookups, that may not be ideal.",

Very sophisticated CPU caches do have the ability to notice that you're chasing pointers (they correlate values previously loaded with the addresses fetched) but that's most helpful if you repeatedly access shallow data structures.\n\nThere just isn't much that can be done to hide memory latency when the data structure is really deep.\n\nIf a linked list is the best choice it's probably because you need a LIFO or FIFO queue and search is rare.\n\nOther points in favor of linked lists\n\n* concurrent LLs (multiple threads will access at the same time) are easier than concurrent hash tables and compete with concurrent ring buffers\n* The objects you intend to link are members of some other data structure and the LL acts as an alternate way to access them.

When I finally did take the class, I did really well on it because I knew most of the material already. I also knew, based on my experience with the textbook, that the subject matter interested me.\n\nAlso, I always tell people to check out the FAQ here on r/LearnProgramming, it has got good learning resources. This: \n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/w/faq\n\nIt helps to have a coding project that you're currently working on. \n\n> \"I graduate in three years and wanted to hear from other perspectives on whether CS is a good route to take. The reason I'm so on edge is because of the job market right now. I've heard from many others that it's hard to get a job with a CS degree and I don't want to make the wrong choice for my future.\" \n\nThe job market for junior programmers can be tough, yeah. To even have a chance you need a good LinkedIn, a good GitHub (you can pin up to 6 projects to the front of your GitHub), and a reviewed resume (r/CsCareerQuestions has two resume review days a week). To use GitHub you need to learn the command line tool called \"git\". To use a command line tool, you need to learn the command line. There's a lot and it's all unfamiliar to you now. \n\nAlso, the job market fluctuates over years, and you don't know what the market will look like when you graduate. Will it be a market that favors employers or workers in three years? We don't know. The job market is always good for nurses, but it's not always good for tech. \n\nBut yeah, sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me, I have a Computer Science bachelor's degree and 2.5 years of past professional programming experience.",

In that case, start with the MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki.\n\n\"Hard\" is debatable. Programming *languages* by themselves aren't \"hard\" or \"easy\". *Programming* is hard - but by creating things with Scratch you've basically already covered that base. Even though Scratch appears as childish, block based system, it is still real programming. It has every single fundamental concept of programming, only that it is presented in a graphical manner.

        "body": "Repositories are self-contained dependency trees of commits. Every repository has an index or staging area which is where you add the changes that you intend to commit eventually. The staging area acts as a temporary safe space that is not a full commit and to which you can restore your tracked files if for some reason you aren't happy with the latest changes, and the changes saved to the staging area can also be restored. When you make a commit, only the changes tracked in the staging area are used.\n\nCommits in a repository are uniquely identified by hashes, which look like long strings of random characters that are in fact generated from all the information that they save. Commits contain the hashes of their immediate ancestors, the differences in the code between them and their immediate ancestors, the names and E-mail addresses of their authors, a timestamp, a message explaining what they change and why so that other people in the future can gain a deeper understanding of why specific changes were made, and optionally a digital signature to reinforce their authenticity. Commits represent snapshots of branch states at specific times.\n\nSince commit hashes aren't easy to remember, git provides the ability to tag them with more remarkable names. Tags are often used to record milestones, like the official version of a project at that point, but they can be used for anything you want, and can always have descriptions independent of their respective commit messages.\n\nBranches represent distinct and possibly concurrent development paths, and every git repository has at least one conventionally named main these days or master in the past, however branches can have arbitrary names. Branches are simply alternative HEAD pointers, you can create a branch from any commit in the repository, which will result in its HEAD pointing at that commit, and after that every commit you make to that branch will have the original commit of the branch as an ancestor in its history. Branches are typically used to avoid cluttering the main history of the project with irrelevant versioning information related to refactoring, bug fixing, feature development, or even to continue developing old versions of the same project concurrently to the main branch.\n\nRemotes provide the ability to name external repositories, and are intended to synchronize with the work done by other developers. Each branch can also track a single branch on a remote repository, which is typically used to synchronize with an upstream source of truth, and doesn't really need to have the same name as the local branch. Pushing to a remote branch attempts to append your changes in a local branch to the remote branch, whereas pulling attempts to append the remote changes of the remote branch to your local branch. If this succeeds then the resulting trivial merge is called a fast forward, otherwise you will be required to resolve the conflicts before the local and remote repositories can be synchronized. The HEAD of a tracked remote branch is pointed at by REMOTE_HEAD\n\nMerging is a process in which two divergent branches, both local or one local and one remote, are synchronized by a commit that addresses all the conflicts. Since only local branches can be written to, the merge commit is always created locally. After a merge all the concurrent commits are added to the history of the local branch, which can make the commit history rather confusing to understand. A different option to merging is rebasing, where all the divergent changes in one of the branches are added on top of the other branch, but this too can mess up the commit history, because if both branches have been getting concurrent commits, the timestamps in the resulting history where all the commits to one branch are logically applied after all the commits to the other branch will result in a history of commits that are not progressive over time, so git also provides the ability to squash commits, which can be used to coalesce a range of commits.\n\nReverting is the process in which the changes made by one or more commits are applied in reverse to a branch, effectively resulting in those changes being removed from the code. Reverting commits does not alter the commit history of a branch, instead a new revert commit is created specifically to remove the changes, at which point the author of the reverse is given a chance to address any conflicts that might prevent the operation. Switching is a process in which git is instructed to go back to any commit in the repository. If the switch is made to a branch then the local files will be updated to the HEAD commit of the branch, otherwise the switch is considered headless and no commits can be made until a branch is created to track them. Resetting moves the HEAD of a branch to any commit on the repository, which can result in some commits becoming unreachable and eventually garbage collected.\n\nStashing is the concept of committing your changes to a local commit tracker and restoring everything to how it was in the previous commit. Stashes are global and as such are completely independent of branches.\n\nOther concepts like pull requests, forks, and releases are specific to GitHub. Pull requests are just regular posts to a repository linking to a branch on your own repository whose changes you would like to get merged with the remote repository. Forks are just other developers cloning your repository under a new repository on their own account. Releases are essentially tags on steroids that you can use to provide ready-to-use builds of your project.\n\nGit is also quite versatile when it comes to rewriting history, however this is a fairly advanced subject that I'm not going to touch on here since it requires a good understanding of its fundamental concepts. Rewriting history can sometimes make commits unreachable from any branch, and These commits are kept around for a while but eventually git's garbage collector gets rid of them, however this grace period makes it possible to recover them, so even if you completely mess up a repository it's almost always possible to manually recover everything back during this period.\n\nHopefully this comment covers all the basics with enough detail but without being overwhelming.",

Too low to start building things? I disagree, but I absolutely concede that you have to have a very developed understanding of the language to know how to get off the ground quickly with it. C++ has a diverse ecosystem, and it all exists for a reason. With great power comes great responsibility.\n\nC# on Linux is actually very good. Don't conflate Microsoft's business nature and history with Linux with their ability to deliver an excellent development platform. C# .Net Core is platform independent (.Net Framework is the legacy Windows-only language - and YES, Microsoft is ABSOLUTE SHIT at naming things). VS Code is also platform independent. My last employer has arguably the largest options trading platform in the world written in C#, and we knew we were 300x faster than CBOE, for example. It's a robust platform for you.\n\nThe Java community is currently enamored with Spring Boot and cloud computing, which I also previously supported, among other things, when I was at Pivotal for 5 years. If you want to find Java in the industry, look to that ecosystem. It's otherwise still the Enterprise language of choice if you want a whatever job. Minecraft was originally written in it. But for my professional niche, C# is just Microsoft Java. Either language - JIT compiles to machine code comparable to optimized C, but it's GC and managed objects that just drive me insane - you never know when objects are going to be collected and finalized, it makes the timely and automated release of resources torturous. Java is going absolutely nowhere, because other languages target the Java platform. Python can, Clojure does, for examples...\n\nPython is the past, present, and future. You want standalone? PyInstaller. Graalpy. There are others. Who cares if Python is interpreted? Most computation doesn't happen in Python, it happens in the modules, which are written in C, C++, or Fortran. The more and better you can offload to the modules, the more efficient the program gets. There's very little, only very niche reasons, to implement solutions in lower level or more specific languages these days. Everyone knows Python, and it's worth learning. It's not hard to find a job because of Python, it's hard to find a job that doesn't explicitly ask for at least some rudimentary comprehension of it. It's everywhere. Employers will say, \"What do you mean you don't know Python? Not even a little?\"\n\n---\n\nContinued...",

You will learn a lot about collaborating with people, learn what they know, understand business software, and legacy, and project management.\n\nAs you said about struggling with writing a roguelike - it's not the fault of the language, but the inexperience designing software and managing projects. You went to writing software before you actually figured out what it was you were to do. The easy part should be writing the code, the hard part is the thinking you have to do beforehand. It doesn't matter what the language you pick is.\n\nSpeaking of roguelikes - Nethack is written in C. It's a terminal app. Yeah, of course. Well - someone wanted to create a GUI for it, so they made Falcon's Eye. How it works is - they didn't modify Nethack at all. Instead, Falcon's Eye spawns a Nethack child process; Nethack writes to standard output, which is received by Falcon's Eye, which uses that information to draw the screen. Your inputs into Falcon's Eye, including mouse clicks and the like, translate to serialized input on the Nethack child process - standard in.\n\nSo Nethack is written in terms of the `stdin` and `stdout` file descriptors, and is none the wiser of the GUI that was built on top. This comes back around to the Unix concept of small programs that do their tasks very well. You are meant to composite programs together. If you wanted to in C, C++, or Rust, you could build an HTTP parser (I know you said you're not interested in web, but this is my default example) based on standard input and output, and then use `netcat` to create your listening socket and spawn your program. You could even spawn a whole script that includes an `stunnel` for encryption. You can write a web server without knowing a lick of socket programming. You can write video games and defer the GUI to later. You don't work in a vacuum, and you shouldn't be focused on building monoliths - because even for performance reasons, processes can be better than threads. If a process fails, your parent process can restart it. Network Rx and Tx lines bind to processes, not threads, so if you want actual network IO performance, you have to fork your programs. And IPC can be made astoundingly fast with say page swapping for low latency, and then large pages on top of that for high throughput. And then you can get zero copy by memory mapping the pages.\n\nBut the point is - start making real programs, you already have everything you need to communicate those programs with hardware, processes, and the rest of the world. You have facilities to make them fast. The OS is a collection of resources, utilities, and services to help you. You can composite lots of little things into to larger and more complex things.",

I think that‚Äôs because yeah‚Ä¶, repeating exercises is boring af. BUT repetition is also what makes things stick. Think of music, which in fact is also a language in its own context. You hear a song enough and you can recognize it. \n\nWe communicate with symbols and logic. You gotta learn what the symbols mean in the specific context and then how to use them to express what you want. \n\nSo a breakdown of an example you gave in another comment. \n-Program in C (language/format)\n-Seconds to minutes (formula)\n\nEven if you don‚Äôt know that 60s = 1 min by memory, you can find the formula and write it down. The C language will have a way to write the function, the variables and handle any printing or user interaction. That‚Äôs the part you gotta know or find out about the language beforehand (like rules or properties). The coding skill comes from being able to write down that broken logic into the computer code. So you gotta be familiar with the language and how it works. \n\nBut in general terms you can do things for everything. Problems will sometimes have a full sentence to just say something is equal (the same) to another thing. You can usually simplify it into formulas or terms like: 3 bananas + 3 apples = 6 fruit. Instead of thinking ‚Äúhow pretty we can say something‚Äù in the language we‚Äôre thinking ‚Äúhow fast can we make a computer understand it‚Äù. I can say ‚ÄúI would like 6 of that delicious fruit, please good sir.‚Äù or I can say ‚Äú6 fruit‚Äù. In logical terms they mean the same. ‚ÄúI would like‚Äù implies addition for me, which would different to ‚ÄúHere you go, some fruit‚Ä¶‚Äù which would mean a loss for me. \n\nI hope that gives some perspective of the fundamentals of logic and operational thinking.",

For reference I spent almost 3000 hours with web development and I would still not consider myself a pro developer. I can build Apps and Websites but there is still loads to learn. An advice I can give you is pick a programming language you want to learn properly, identify a great resource to learn it and then learn it and build projects. Don't jump from one language to another just because you think you understood the basics. Use the basics to build projects that get more complex from project to project. If you gonna learn Web Development then one resource I can recommend because I did it myself is the Odin Project. It's free and open source. However with only 8 hours a week it's gonna take you a long time to finish.",

(My university had a student resource center to help all students with disabilities.) If you don't have a student resource  center, just meet with the person or office that helped you get an interpreter. \n\nI hope my suggestions make sense.

Python is slow because it's interpreted, so what Python does is offload the heavy lifting to its modules, which are typically written in C, C++, or Fortran. This minimizes the overhead of Python and maximizes expressiveness and productivity. So in this way, you're already heavily reliant on C, C++, and Fortran, and yet you don't have to worry about that.\n\nThere is effectively no performance to be found in writing a whole application in C++. You have the critical path, the core data structures and computation, and that's going to be fast and efficient - and the rest of the program is going to be non-critical interfaces, glue, and some business logic, where it frankly doesn't matter if it's slow.\n\nThere's still a need for C++ developers. Some places prefer to be homogenous, because it's just easier to manage software projects if you don't have to consider who knows what language or how well. There is also a need for lower level programming and performance - someone has to write that module in the first place, right? You're not going to write an OS in Python. Don't rely on die-hards who think that all C++ programs are inherently necessary for full end-to-end maximum performance. These people and their philosophies are naive and dangerous. There are also industries that are heavily invested in C++, so while the specific need for the language is no longer necessary, there isn't an incentive to reinvest. Game-dev, for example. But you see cracks in that, too - there are all manner of scripting engines on top of game engines. Lua. Unity has UnityScript - a form of ECMAScript. C# is also increasingly popular in game dev. C# is also growing in popularity for HFT.\n\nSo do you want to write modules, or do you want to get work done?",

I'll try to answer each of your specific questions, as well as point you to reading material for each of those areas.\n\n>Based on my understanding, I have to¬†`tsc`¬†client and server since the browser and node can only read js.\n\nLet's talk about each of those two separately, starting with your client. You are correct that the browser can only read JS. However, since you're using Vite, one of its built-in features is that it will automatically transpile your TS to JS ([docs](https://vite.dev/guide/features.html#typescript)). Therefore, you don't need `tsc` to do that ‚Äî and, therefore, you *should* have `\"noEmit\": true` in your frontend `tsconfig.json`.\n\nMoving on to the server, Node.js recently added native support for executing TypeScript directly ([docs](https://nodejs.org/api/typescript.html)), so you *might* be able to use that. However, if your hosting provider uses an older version of Node.js that doesn't support that, then yes, you are correct that you'll need to use `tsc` to transpile your server code.\n\n>I had a hard time outputting a dist folder when I ran¬†`watch:ts`¬†because I had¬†`\"noEmit\": true`¬†and¬†`\"emitDeclarationOnly\": true`¬†in my tsconfig.json file.\n\nIf you want to better understand each of the options in your `tsconfig.json`, I recommend [the official reference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/). In general, official references for anything are always the most up-to-date, reliable, and comprehensive.\n\n>I get¬†`Named export 'SupabaseClient' not found. The requested module '@supabase/supabase-js' is a CommonJS module, which may not support all module.exports as named exports.`¬†But my package.json has¬†`\"type\": \"module\"`, and tsconfig has¬†`\"module\": \"ESNext\",`¬†so why am I getting a commonJS error?¬†\n\nMake sure to read the error message very carefully. It is not saying that *your* code is CommonJS; it's saying that the Supabase package is CommonJS, and as a result, named imports might not work. ([MDN source if you're not familiar with what a named import is](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#named_import))\n\nThis is pretty easy to fix ‚Äî since they don't want you using a named import, simply use a default import instead. If you want to understand why CommonJS modules might not support named imports, this is explained in [the Node.js docs](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#commonjs-namespaces).",

However, in dev mode, the transformed code is stored in memory, and a local web server is started to serve that code. On the other hand, in build mode, the transformed code is written to disk.\n\n>Where can I read up on how the whole ecosystem works so I'm not running into one problem after another?

Official docs are always the best.\n\nSince it sounds like your questions pertain to various things in Node.js, TypeScript, and Vite, I'd simply recommend going through the docs for those three tools, to start.",

We'll skip Typescript for now.\n\nAll node.js projects are defined using a `package.json` file.  This file's primary purpose is to allow you to define the structure of libraries or applications you write.  If you ever publish an app or library to an external repository, such as npmjs.com, this file will be used by Node to work out which file bootstraps your code, what dependencies it requires, and so on.\n\nUsually, we aren't publishing packages, but we still use the `package.json` to manage dependencies, which are located in (and downloaded from) the npm repository by default.\n\nThe `package.json` file is managed by the `npm` command.  For example, `npm install` will install the dependencies listed in `package.json`.  `npm run` will run any script defined in the `scripts` property.  `npm test` will run your test suite, defined in the `scripts.test` property.  See the [docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json) for a full breakdown of the file.\n\nDependencies are installed to the `node_modules` directory.\n\nIn the old days, modules were included in Node.js apps using a system called CommonJS, in which you export variables from modules by adding them as properties to an object called `exports` (e.g. `exports.bar = bar`).  You could then import it with `var bar = require('./foo').bar;`.  The path has to be relative for modules you define.  For dependencies installed via npm, it would be `require('foo')` to load the module from `node_modules/foo`.\n\nThe trouble with this approach is that you always had to import the entire module, even if you only needed one thing from it.  If that same module is imported multiple times throughout the code, that's a lot of redundant duplication; so ES modules were invented to allow you to import/export specific vars and only those vars (e.g. `import { bar } from 'foo'`).\n\nThis feature has to be enabled in Node.js before it will work.  I don't recall if it's backwards compatible with CommonJS or not, but the error you reported above (*The requested module '@supabase/supabase-js' is a CommonJS module*) suggests that either it doesn't, or it doesn't by default.\n\nI expect there will be a supabase package that does support esm, or a package that provides Typescript bindings.\n\nTypescript is a language that compiles (transpiles) to Javascript and has its own additional syntax.  It's described as a superset of Javascript, meaning that it should be able to read and understand JS, but I swear I've had issues running normal JS through the compiler in the past.  Anyway, Node only speaks JS, so you have to run your TS through the `tsc` Typescript compiler first.  In order to import dependencies into a TS programme, they must themselves either be TS, or be JS with TS bindings.  These bindings are located in files with the extension `.d.ts`.\n\nBindings exist for pretty much all popular dependencies now.\n\nI've not used Vite so I can't help you with that.\n\nHere's a simple config I wrote from scratch for an interview I had to prepare for recently (that never actually materialised).  The expectation was to do a live coding interview using Typescript and a setup of my choice.  I installed express and mocha just in case they wanted me to demonstrate unit testing and serving web content.\n\nHopefully it's simple enough to help you work out what everything does:\n\npackage.json\n\n    {\n      \"name\": \"y\",\n      \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n      \"description\": \"Practice for interview\",\n      \"license\": \"ISC\",\n      \"author\": \"\",\n      \"type\": \"esm\",\n      \"main\": \"main.js\",\n      \"scripts\": {\n        \"x\": \"node target/main.mjs\",\n        \"start\": \"tsx watch src/server.mts\",\n        \"test\": \"mocha\",\n        \"build\": \"tsc --module nodenext --outDir target src/main.mts\",\n        \"watch\": \"tsc --watch --module nodenext --outDir target src/main.mts\",\n        \"puzzle\": \"tsx src/puzzle.mts\"\n      },\n      \"devDependencies\": {\n        \"@types/chai\": \"^5.0.1\",\n        \"@types/express\": \"^5.0.0\",\n        \"@types/mocha\": \"^10.0.10\",\n        \"@types/node\": \"^22.13.0\",\n        \"chai\": \"^5.1.2\",\n        \"mocha\": \"^11.1.0\",\n        \"ts-node\": \"^10.9.2\",\n        \"tsx\": \"^4.19.2\"\n      },\n      \"dependencies\": {\n        \"express\": \"^4.21.2\"\n      }\n    }\n\n\ntsconfig.js\n\n    {\n      \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"target\": \"es2022\",\n        type: \"module\",\n        \"module\": \"node16\",                       \n        \"esModuleInterop\": true,\n        \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true,\n        \"strict\": true,\n        \"skipLibCheck\": true\n      }\n    }",

I don't know what the context is here -- and anything involving working with raw data is well above the level of this sub -- but the gist is probably this:\n\nYou have an HTML file, which contains a table presenting some text, two cells per row. The *tr* is the element for a row, the *td* the element for a [cell](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/td). Each of these cells has a class called \"datavalue,\" and from that HTML file, you could write a script that grabs everything out of any cell with the \"datavalue\" class, so you end up with a text string of \"003F00502040003F00502040\".... (I assume that there are also rows with 00, 04 , etc.)\n\nThe screenshot is a [hex editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_editor) of some kind -- I don't know which one but they basically all do the same thing: they open a file and let you directly see and edit the raw data. Right now you don't have the actual raw data, though, you have the text \"003F00502040003F00502040\" etc., so you'd have to convert that to the equivalent data file. (Don't worry about the specifics of that, there are probably built-in functions for it in whatever language you're using.)\n\nThen in the hex editor you can view what the bytes of the file are, where they are in the file, and what characters they would be if it was supposed to be readable text. This data is almost definitely not supposed to be text, but without more context I don't know what it's supposed to be. (i.e., the 00 3F and 00 50 are probably supposed to be 63 and 80, but I don't know exactly what the 63 and 80 are being used for.)\n\nAgain, all of this is very much above the level of this sub.",

Sometimes it's necessary to use C to hack around the generally poor support that C++ has for linking to other languages (even to itself!) but that C doesn't feel too much like C.\n\nIt would be like using PHP to glue together several different Rails microservices.\n\nIf you like Cute I think you'll learn more by switching to C++.  If C is your goal, it's probably better to work in framework that is written in C.  raylib is the most common recommendation, though I haven't used it myself.",

It was supposed to be a machine learning model, but instead was just like 50k lines of a \"transform\" (insert data science is just if-else statements meme). The teams down-stream who were relying on the output of this thing are now way behind and several projects aren't going to hit their 2025 deadlines.\n\n\nI dunno, I just think that's extremely funny, because only 3 months ago our company had us go to a workshop where Big A was talking up their agentic tools. Big J (Big A CEO) has been pushing these tools on all of engineering, and like... Yeah, anyone whose actually used these tools saw this coming a mile away.",

        "body": "I mean literally every post on Reddit tells you this lol.\n\nAnyway, I was always a weird nerd, hung around nerds, shy non-popular guys etc. But because I was always great at sport and athletic I would hang around jocks and even gangsters so I learned how to get along with alot of different people.\n\nThis is a big question so there's nowhere to start really but for Reddit I will say this, biggest killers for the guys here are the following: Introverted, self awareness and over-valuing intelligence. I can explain lol.\n\n1. Introverted: People use this as a self-built cage rather than just a label. It shouldn't even be a label the way this word has a mental hold on people on Reddit. Firstly, yes you can be naturally inclined toward introversion or extraversion, but there's caveats. Being introverted or extroverted doesn't neccessarily mean bad at social interaction versus good. I've seen plenty of extraverts who fucking suck at social situations and introverts who are great, they just prefer to be alone more often. You can be good at social skills and continue to carry your special little introvert label if you want, it's just going to be a little harder than if you were an extravert ***simply because you're getting in less reps.*** An extrovert will try and fail more = more chance for success. Also, you can switch between being introverted or extroverted, this isn't WoW where you can't cast a spell because you chose the paladin class. You're allowed to try being extroverted for a week, year, decade if you want.\n\nLike OP said it will feel weird at first, but ask any guy who got ripped from being fat if he felt like a natural in the gym the first day he picked up a weight. Nope, he worked through the pain and embarassment and got the reward. The good thing about social skills is that it doesn't even take that long, nor do you have to always be the social guy.. you can just learn the skills and keep it in your back pocket until you need it.\n\n2. Self awareness: Reddit copes alot by thinking that extraverts in engineering are just \"smooth talkers\" wrong. Smooth talking is a skill that comes with social skills, but it's not the whole pie. Some social people over-use smooth talking and get found out real quick and exposed, luckily here on Reddit we're all extremely intelligent and know what's best for the world so that won't be our issue... right?\n\nThere's a negative connotation in engineering for having good social skills and confidence. I get laughed at by my friends for having \"good english\" and \"talking shit\".. like that's something to be embarassed about? In reality, I have great language skills to explain things to people of all levels, and I can basically nail down concepts into managable pieces for customers to understand without confusing them with jargon.. that's a skill that requires intelligence, humility and understanding concepts. Engineering isn't just about calculating numbers really fast, or memorising a fourier transform, we're here to sell products and create ideas. You NEED to be able to communicate those ideas or else the math and physics is lost in the void. What's the point of being able to create nuclear power if the government is scared of it and thus bans it because you can't explain to them why it's neccessary. \n\n3. over-valuing intelligence: In the sense that people here like to min/max intel stats, that's great. More intelligence is always good, but again that's not a license for you to suck at conveying your ideas or to treat people like shit. Yes conceptually a team of really high intel nerds will be good for a company, but in reality we live in a market where we need to promote ideas and actually be able to understand from person to person. You can't do that by being very intelligent but a dick or can't explain your ideas to people in simple terms.",

And who knows, you might even get a bonus, and a promotion.   Who knows!\n\nI seemed to fall into temporary contract work when FTE positions were not available.   I never minded doing some contract work.   I didn't worry about office politics like the OP said.   In some cases, I got holiday pay and even bonuses from some contracting companies.   But what I didn't like was short term extensions.   I worked for one client who did first 6 months, then another 6 months, and then it was 3 months, and then 3 months.   I had to leave.    I told my manager, who was a great person BTW, that I simply can't keep extending for 3 months.   As soon as you start the 3 months, you need to start looking again halfway through ... if you;re going to extend me, at least make it for some length of time, but I know she didn't control the money, so that was that.\n\nNowadays, I've been getting laid off a lot, the FTE roles don't seem to last very long themselves.  Yeah, you might get some extra benefits from FTE, but longevity isn't one of them.     I definitely have friends who have been contracting at one client for years and years, they have been around longer than most FTE employees.  They just keep getting extended, and they know the work, and it's not hard.    \n\nSo, pros and cons for each ..........",

I bought a copy of Microsoft Visual C++ and learned the language (as you said, it's extremely easy to pick up a new language or framework - nowadays, you don't even have to buy anything!)\n\nBut I didn't have any on-the-job experience, either, and self-taught didn't mean anything.\n\nSo... I didn't _lie_ about actual on-the-job C++ experience.  I never said \"so-and-so paid me to work on C++\".  But there's a lot of stretching you can do to the truth and keep it the truth, assuming you've actually put in the time to really learn the subject.\n\nI'm not giving you any _specific_ advice here, just sharing a completely unrelated story from 30 years ago.",

It's always been like this and probably always will be, because *ML work is difficult to evaluate from the outside*.\n\n* From the POV of someone not deeply familiar with ML, it's hard to distinguish ourselves from people less qualified, who might be liable to commit rookie data leakage/confounding/etc mistakes, and be none the wiser until the model is in production. Without stars and citations, GitHub repos and arXiv papers are laborious to evaluate and are indistinguishable from slop.\n* Our work inevitably requires some research, which usually doesn't pan out. If a manager makes a bad hire, and they're not competent in ML themselves, they have to wait through a long string of failures in order to decide \"okay this person is incompetent\" and finally fire him.\n\nSo hiring managers have to be very, very careful. In such murky circumstances, it's rational to resort to costly social signals. Publications in conferences, placements in Kaggle competitions, and of course experience at prestigious companies are reliable signals of competence, only because they are so costly to fake. They'd rather overpay for a highly-qualified candidate (not you or me) than gamble on someone less-credentialed who passed their interview (which they know isn't terribly high-signal to begin with).\n\nThis is all many times more extreme for researchers, for whom a PhD is mandatory.\n\n>But i see people doubling their salaries all with just taking a single course on basic ML....how???\n\nThis would be news to me.",

        "body": "  \nI've been on both sides of this. I started my career as an 'ambitious overachiever,' burned out hard, and then tried the 'maintain boundaries' approach. Here's what I learned.  \n**As an Ambitious Overachiever:**  \nFrom my personal experience, going above and beyond only **works if you're able to \"showcase\" your work.** That is, people in the company need to actively **see you as someone who goes \"above and beyond\"** in order for it to matter. You should also make sure to **document your achievements and positive feedback** received so you can later present them to management when discussing raises, promotions, and so on. I would also say, though this is also another personal experience thing, that **going above and beyond in every category is both ineffective and leads to burnout.** It's better to **have one project which you own/lead and excel** **at** at a time, and do the \"regular\" amount of work on your other projects.  In addition, it is important to build rapport. You don't have to be an extrovert per se, but **people should leave feeling positively after talking with you.** \n\nOn the downside, **career progression** at any one company inherently **depends on how much room there is for promotion** and the budget of your department. Plus, overperformance makes you advance faster but rarely do you ever skip progression tiers. You may be a truly stellar, outstanding, junior engineer, but you won't get promoted to senior engineer immediately. You'll likely just spend one year less in junior, one year less in mid, and so on. It also only partially protects you from layoffs--**you'll be the last junior engineer laid off**, but if they're **laying off all junior engineers you're still gonna get laid off.**\n\nSomething I learned the hard way is that no matter how much of a \"go above and beyond\" employee you are, **one period of poor performance**, even if do to extenuating circumstances, **can very quickly destroy your reputation** as an overperformer. If this happens, you should immediately look for a new job unless you really love your current workplace. I also found that **opportunities to truly excel can be difficult to find and sometimes even be gatekept.**\n\nIt is important to remember that much of **your excellent performance will evaporate** when searching for a new job **unless you're able to show public artifacts** which showcase it. Maybe references can do this too, but you need to tell the new employer to actually contact them. I got laid off without any public artifacts to show off, and it made job searching ***much harder.***\n\n**Do great work but maintain boundaries approach:**\n\nI took this approach after burning out, though that burnout was partly due to a toxic coworker.  \nI found it to be less stressful and often my outcomes became more consistent, which many employers value more than someone who does overall better work but in an inconsistent fashion. In general, it's only seen as a bad thing at (healthy) companies if it's the kinda role where overtime is inherently expected or a startup. How your work itself is recognized largely depends on your manager and how well they understand it. I'd say your manager's **subjective perception of your work matters far more than the actual work quality.**\n\n**Advancement** felt like it **depended** more **on the state the economy**. Good economy, relatively normal advancement rate. Bad economy, slower advancement rate and layoffs. \n\n**Summary/takeaway:**\n\nBrute-force 'tryharding' is rarely worth the investment and often leads to burnout. If there's a project you can take ownership over, do that and make sure to 'show it off' like a salesman.  Make sure to have evidence to support your skills for both internal promotions and getting jobs elsewhere. **Be an intelligent, strategic achiever who works to own and lead projects while building the skillset you want, rather than an overachiever for the company you work for.**",

The question should be more nuanced though- people (especially engineers) LOVE to microoptimize on a single variable when that isn't actually productive because our lives are multifaceted (e.g. either minmaxing saving money, or being a yolo spender).¬†\nMy practical recommendations are 2 things\n1) oscillate based on priority. Some projects are important, high-vis, high-impact and will leapfrog your career more than the rest of your work combined. Spending a bit more effort here pays dividends. Similarly, if you're close to a promo you care about, it's worth doing a bit extra. Rest of the time, it's okay to just do enough.\n\n\n2) understand the rubric better. Unlike school where assignments are graded 0-100%, work is very ambiguous. Understand who controls your career trajectory (usually your direct manager and maybe skip level), and optimize for success. Find ways to proactively make your manager's job easier, and make your manager look good to their management. This will do the most.¬†\n\n\nOne anecdote I've shared a few times: I grinded really hard when I joined this job, manager denied my promo again and again based on random nitpicks from career ladder doc. I eventually threw in the towel and said fuck it, that manager left, my new manager was chill and I kept sandbagging. I'd be responsive and helpful on shared projects, but I was also literally playing video games during the day (wfh). Despite all this, my new manager pretty soon put me up for promo successfully without me asking, and handwaved a bunch of career ladder \"requirements\". I did have to do a bit of extra work since manager asked me to draft my own promo doc (usually manager duty, but fair enough trade lol). It's all fuzzy and hand wavey end of day as long as those in charge approve¬†",

The fear of the online and offline world judging your every parenting skills and then having the fear of being lambasted because you make 1 mistake out of a million times when your kids usually don't \"misbehave\", its tough.\n\nAll I can say is, yes being a good developer who can code and everything is fantastic to have.  Have you had one to ones with your seniors or bosses recently? One thing that came out of a meeting I had with my boss, when I said I was shocked at how good the new hires were compared to me (3-4 yoe) and my boss remarked that if I felt that way, what the company saw was that I am a really good person to have in meetings, in projects, who could understand the scope needed for a project, who could bridge communication between stakeholders and developers, and people just felt knew that I was like a go to person when there was help needed etc.\n\nIf you can, do your best and find ways and opportunities to develop your coding skills.  Your soft skills from something as simple as communication between teams, don't neglect or underestimate these either, these can also help you stand out as a senior dev or higher",

If you feel you are stuck and will have a hard time being thought of as senior by your peers because you can't keep up in architecture and design discussions that might hold you back and force you to job hunt.\n\nI agree you should talk to your manager and try to feel out how likely it is you can meet their expectations to stay on assuming you enjoy the work aside from the new hoops they want you to jump through.\n\nI saw some others suggested asking more questions to keep improving your skills. Many people are afraid to ask dumb questions too often as it can make you seem too dependent on the other engineers. But these days honestly you can try talking to an AI about technical details. Most software design and architecture is very well understood and the AI can easily walk you through design questions and help you understand any parts that don't make sense so the next time you have a discussion you are more clear about what is happening.\n\nJust a month back there was a discussion at work explaining a mesh network setup for one of our products. And my networking is super rusty. An hour conversation with the AI and I was following their mesh design much more clearly and asking their team good questions, not the dumb ones where I was unaware of basics or some lingo. Most designs in software aren't super novel or deviant from knowledge the AI has.\n\nThe AIs can still lie so I do recommend double checking it's statements if you are going to put your reputation on the line defending a claim it made. But I feel like there has never been a better tool to help drill down on some \"dumb\" questions we all have.\n\nI will say I am generally perceived as very good at my job and I love software and design discussions. I am totally not immune to feeling stupid or inadequate. Especially on newer projects. Imposter syndrome creeps up on most people unless you have a godly ego. So it's hard to say how you feel really equals no hope of reaching senior in your current role. \n\n Also I don't do side projects. Clearly they are great if you can. But software is just a job and I love my kids more than I love my work. Most people I work with take this stance. I put in extra time to make sure stuff works during crunch time. And I do occasionally enjoy software arch videos on YouTube. But otherwise I enjoy my family and my personal free time.

It's difficult to tell the difference between early career and experienced commenters, and good advice is often counter intuitive. \n\nThere are two pieces of bad advice I am constantly trying to correct. First is learning more skills won't lead you to being overworked. People complain about the rising popularity of full stack development. They say they refuse to learn frontend or backend because that will just lead to your employer expecting you to do two jobs. That's not true. Learning more skills will make you more efficient at your job, saving you time. It will also make you more competitive on the job market, meaning it will be easier for you to find a job with good WLB. There's more than enough dedicated frontend or backend work. If an employer is going to overwork you, they're going to do it regardless if you know full stack or not.\n\nSecond is becoming more senior destroys your WLB. That's again not true. The things that destroy your WLB are getting a senior title before your ready and getting a senior title at a mismanaged company. Some people get thrust into a tech lead role 3 years into their career. These people are usually stressed AF because they don't have the experience to do it effectively, and the fact that they were promoted means the average level of experience is lower then theirs. That means they're going to be even more stressed trying to bail out all of the people on their team, because they also don't have the experience to do their jobs effectively. Don't try to avoid promotions. Avoid premature promotions and take on a senior/tech lead title when you feel comfortable you can do the job in <40 hours per week.",

        "body": "For anyone wanting a career in anything, it is very important to highlight your accomplishments for this very reason. Keep conversations up with your manager (ask for skip level 1v1s) to ensure you stay in communication so your manager can continue to gauge how you are doing vs. what your lead is saying. That then allows your manager to know how to work with the lead to make them a better leader as well. It is not being arrogant when you say I‚Äôve worked on this and this and this and these are the outcomes. If you mess up, own it and say I learned my lesson and don‚Äôt do Y again. That goes a long way and gains lots of respect, which helps with stability.\nIt doesn‚Äôt hurt to put feelers out there for other jobs, but each job has his own crap to deal with. I would evaluate the opportunities you have and get vs. this lead being a pain. This lead may not be here for forever either. If the lead is your only problem, do skip level 1v1s and go from there. Remember, everyone is learning. The lead, yes is being not a great lead, but likely it‚Äôs their first time being a leader and trying to figure it out and needs some guidance. Just like you when you first started. Try to highlight the wins with the lead too! Maybe that will get them thinking more positively as well. And maybe the lead is thinking of you as more senior than you are due to the work you are doing. So reminding them how young in your career you are can help.\nRegarding leaving the field, this is more of a corporate life issue than the field. I deal with this in cybersecurity (got a degree in compsci so why follow) too. You will run into these issues no matter what field you are in. Unfortunately school doesn‚Äôt teach you how to traverse corporate life. I say it sounds like you are doing a great job and have a lot of opportunities to grow. Do skip level 1v1s with your manager, communicate what work you are doing and the outcomes with both your lead and manager, and see what happens. Best of luck to you!",

She was transparent about her thoughts and feelings.\n\nEnter her boss, our group manager. He was the long standing ride the coattails to success type. He knew nothing about anything, but he ruled with an iron fist, and it was his way or the highway. Between my manager and our 12 person team, of which she was easily the smartest and most experienced, know who the ONLY PERSON laid off was when the company did a 5% layoff?\n\nYou guessed it. Her only ‚Äúcrime‚Äù was that she often frequently disagreed with his opinions on how to manage the projects (which were years behind schedule now thanks to him). And the group manager had a meeting with everyone else the same day to say ‚ÄúI had no part in this.‚Äù Meanwhile, he had quickly become the laughing stock of the team. He would get off department calls, and the second he hung up, one of our managers would say, ‚Äúoh good, he‚Äôs gone, now we can get some real work done.‚Äù So‚Ä¶\n\nFortunately for me, the business saw how little value he was bringing within 6 months after, and suddenly he was forced out in a matter of months once his old boss (and best friend) left him high and dry to pursue a higher position.\n\nI hate to admit it, but someone once told me, ‚Äú50% of your career is what you know, and 50% is who you know.‚Äù I‚Äôd hate to think they are right, but I‚Äôll\nbe damned if there isn‚Äôt a pole of evidence to support it.",

That will be your next job application!\n\nOr at least, given the 85 or so companies I have worked for or with, that's how it's had to be. Anyone showing ideas above their station, well, you know yourself now what you get.\n\nSecond, despite what most people would like to think, there is no top exec keeping an eye on you, ready to pluck you for stardom! I have only ever seen a company's butt tighten up like a snare drum when it comes to spending money on someone, i.e. promotion, training, etc. This whole idea of the company needs to value you or needs to encourage you, that's not the aim of the game for most companies.\n\nAnd to people who just want to say, \"I guess you worked for shitty companies\", 85 or so in so far, I've yet to see it any different. If yours is different, let me know how to apply! Even the nicest of places to work get fidgety when you tell them you've gone done achieved something big that's worth a lot more on the job market. That goes double if there's someone already in the position you're working towards.\n\nAny promotion means a move.

It actually took me a really long time to graduate and prep for my first job even in a better market, CS did not come naturally to me at all.\n\nIf I knew now what I do about ADHD (got diagnosed after my mentor got frustrated 4-6 months into my role, started out amazing but was not staying on point after I got the \"hang of things\"), I would've sought out help earlier and tried harder in pre-med, which I truly had a passion for even though my grades were mediocre.\n\nInterestingly, the highlights of my career have been getting on late night calls or pinged for complex issues, and leading troubleshooting calls in front my team, VPs etc. It lined up a lot with my previous interest in wanting to work in emergency medicine/surgery and being in positions where I needed snap judgement and worked well with high stress/low sleep/adrenaline.\n\nA lot of engineers do not like these situations so that always stood out to me as a potential miss on my career choice, looking back.",

They've got good soft skills.\n\nBeginner are studying the wrong things. They all leap onto Javascript and Python, the two most oversaturated job markets, bear in mind, the job market for Python isn't even that big.\n\nI blame a lot of things for this..

The level of hiring is not enough to displace issues with hiring entry level folks yet, the majority are still at senior level.\n\nI'm also fairly certain the effects of a recession have not yet hit the job market meaningfully yet. Its starting to show in the data, but there will continue to be issues in the broader economy from blanket tariffs and that's going to cascade down to CS jobs for sure.",

Almost every major fintech has an office here and its the 2nd largest tech hub. It also is the largeast finance hub.  Also NYC the sky is the limit so you can really use this as an oppurtunity to spring board.\n\nIts  very likely you will be making double to tripple what you are currently making within 5 to 8 years.\n\nWhat life style is like in NYC at that salary? 120k in NYC is around  a 6500 month net salary (due to city taxes).\n\n1. If you want to live somewhere fun for singles in their 20s, you would need to eitehr pick between living alone, living somewhere nice with roomates. You'd qualify a miximum of 3k a budget rent and at that price you can live alone. But you have to choose between  living in a nice apartment in jersey/outer areas or in a pre-war shoe box in the nice trendy neighborhood. Nice in NYC is 'mid' in other cities. Its usually means you have a building with some amenities like laundry room or laundry in unit (rarer) and a dishwasher. NYC is a story of under consturction. Most apartments here are 100 years old (prewar) and lack modern conveniences like laundry, dishwasher and central AC. I picked the shoe box, its more fun to be in a good neighborhood if you like to go out and party.\n2. A lot of people your age would choose to live with roomates in order to be  in a nicer apartment in a good location. Generally apartments are a lot mroe cost effective in a 4 bed 2 bath or 3 bed 1 bath situation. If a studio in an apartment building is renting for 4000$, there is a good chance the 3 bed is only 8000$ and the 4 bed is 10,000$. So a very common strategy for young professionals is to just have roomates to live in a nicer apartment in a fun location.\n3. You can afford to live alone and somewher nice, but it would generally be in outer neighborhoods that are either gentrifying or in places like jersey city, a part of New Jersey that is connected by Manhattan via a subway called path.\n\nThe biggest cost in NYC is rent.  Almost all of the cost of living is real estate. That effects things like entertainment and other stuff, because bars/coffee shops/ restaurants and gyms are paying even more per sq feet than you are. But outside of that the cost is the same its not like Amazon charges more here when they are deliving goods to you. Groceries can be all over the map, but trader joes generally is cost effective as they use national price\n\nTo give oyu some idea what prices are like.  Manhattan (you can take off 20 percent for other areas\n\n1. Hair cuts 40 to 75$\n2. Gym depends on which but 50 to 300$. 125 would be mid-tier\n3. Fast Casual lunch  15 to 20$\n4. Street food from a take out only operation  8 to 12$.\n5. Specialty  Coffee from a cafe   (6$ - 7$ before tax)\n6. Dinner at sit down casual restaurant with a waiter  40 to 80$ per person.  You can easily spend 150$ per person at more upscale. This is assuming no alcohol.\n7. Alcohol  6 to 10$ for beer, 10-20$ for wine, 16 to 25$ cocktails. Non-alcoholic options will be offered at most bars.  NYC has a BIG drinking culture. Tech community in particular has a lot of happy hour networking and social events that they host through apps like Luma, Posh VIP, Super Momos, Partiful. So even if you don't drink a whole lot, its in your interes\n8. Ubers 20$ per mile in Manhattan south of 96th street,  10$ per mile in Brooklyn/Queens/Bronx without manhattan entry.\n\nThe other thing thats nice about NYC, because the city is so expensive you won't have pressure to be extravagent which happens in middle cost of living cities. This is a place where people who make 300k a year might live like college students and no one would bat an eye.\n\nTLDR: 120k is a great salary for someone your age in NYC in the fin-tech space. You will ahve enough money to go out quite a bit, save adequately for retirment and you can essentially pick  where you want to live. It is a place where you will need to budget some and not be extravagent, but you can enjoy some luxuries. From a career perspective its also great, the only city that is better for Tech is SF and NYC is good at multiple industries. Fin-Tech space there is always the option of just transitioning into tech roles in finance and NYC is the capital of finance. You can basically live your best life.",

I'm too old to put up with that shit, the market being bad wasn't relevant in my decision to start looking for a new job.\n\nI prep very lightly for about a month. I'm not targetting FAANG, or anything insane where you get tossed leetcode hards back to back. I do practice *some* leetcode, but a lot of my prep is refreshing fundamentals, system design, language-specific quirks, behavioral, etc. I only really spend 30-60 minutes a day, sometimes more, sometimes less, sometimes not at all. My goal is to not burnout on the job search itself, so I'm not forcing anything.\n\nI had 11 YOE at the time, so I was applying to Senior / Staff roles. It took me just under 3 months, and 82 applications. All of them were cold applications online.\n\nTips for those struggling.... you need to be able to identify which part of the process is breaking down, and actively try to fix it. Don't just repeat the same exact thing that isn't working and expect it to suddenly start working.\n\nIf you're getting literally no interviews, the problem is your resume. Hard stop. A lot of people read a bunch of resume advice, get people to review it online, even pay professionals to review it, and then just assume their resume can't be the problem after all of that.\n\nWell, the proof's in the pudding. If you're not getting interviews, it's your resume. So instead of blindly believing your resume is good, look into some differing advice. There's the \"meta advice\" you'll get on this subreddit (impact, KPI's, etc), but there's *lots* of different approaches to resume writing. Try some conflicting advice, and build a 2nd resume from that. Maybe even build a 3rd or a 4th all using different strategies that disagree with each other. Then A/B test those resumes. This is something I did in the middle of my job search because I had a hunch one of my titles was hurting me, so I started using 2 versions of my resume.\n\nIf you're not struggling to get interviews, consider yourself lucky. It's much easier to improve on whatever interview techniques you're struggling with. Reflect, be honest with yourself where you're weak, and work to improve whatever that is. And don't sleep on the behavioral/communication aspect of interviewing, it can be hard to point the finger back at yourself and say you're not doing a good job at communicating, but you need to be able to be introspective.",

        "body": "I actually gave a short talk about this last week. My short opinion is \"yes, but a bubble doesn't mean the technology is worthless\". \n\nRight now what most people call \"AI\"  (which is really just a small subset of generative AI) is almost definitely in a bubble. There's an unbelievable amount of investment in it, a ton of business ventures that use it without a clear plan or analysis, and a lot of integration in places where it doesn't add much value.  There are also a lot of people banking on it doing things in the future that it doesn't do right now, and putting money into it based on an assumption that \"it'll do everything we need soon\".\n\nThere's also an issue at the very top. Companies that provide the service are not making money off it yet, and they will need to either raise their prices or lower their costs to make it profitable in the future. They're all hoping to win a market share and then hike up the prices. This is disastrous for businesses which are, by-and-large, planning as though their current rates will be stable forever.\n\nUnlike blockchain/crypto, however, AI does show many profitable use-cases. AI does work that would cost money, and it provides services people will pay for. Business analyses DO show that AI is successfully being used by businesses sometimes. It's just that most businesses don't know what works or doesn't work, and are using the technology blindly.\n\nI would liken it to the \"Dotcom Bubble\". The internet as a business technology was absolutely in a bubble in the 90s, and that bubble crashed. It wasn't because \"having a website for your business\" was a bad idea, it was because people were trying to do it without a good plan. Nowadays every business has a website, but unlike the 90s we've established clear use cases which provide value instead of just guessing what works and what doesn't.\n\nI expect AI to be the same. AI will \"crash\". There will be downtime where a lot of businesses disappear, and from the ashes will rise a few clear uses where generative AI is used by almost every business.",

Whether you would call that a bubble depends on what you think will happen when the market for the technology moves beyond hype into a mature, useful stage. There are many realistic and valuable business applications for LLMs, computer vision, etc. These tools are incredibly powerful and will only get better as the models get refined and as more skilled developers work on them (whether they are newly trained in an ML-specific context, like me, or they're crossing over from more rigorous, traditional SWE backgrounds).\n\n\nI'm currently a manager in a non-technical role but taking point on some exploratory AI projects, and I'm looking for a role as an ML engineer down the road. What I'm paying attention to, both in my current role and in my job search, is whether the product brings real business value. Investors and execs don't understand this stuff, they see how quickly and confidently chatgpt spits out text and they believe it's magic that's going to relieve them of the burden of workers. Dishonest hype men are more than happy to take advantage of that.¬†\n\n\nBut if you actually understand how these models work on even a rudimentary technical level then you can smell the bullshit from a mile away. I'm not going to peddle bullshit and I'm not going to go work for bullshit except as a last resort. I think that very few companies can survive selling bullshit (though some do) but I won't be surprised to see a lot of snake oil AI startups go under in the next few years, so I don't want to bank on that for my future.",

Are you expecting them to be around to have lots of time to talk with you? Assign you tasks first-hand? Daily interactions? Answer your questions about the business? Stuff like that?\n\nI'm pretty self-reliant, I don't need my manager around for that kind of stuff. I can figure out business logic on my own, I can talk to other engineers, I've always worked at places that had good processes in-place so asking my manager for a Jira ticket would be unheard of.\n\nWhat I expect from my managers is to handle politics, handle cross-team dependencies/conversations, planning, negotiating between product and engineering, etc. I want them operating at a level above me, above the individual. They're there to protect us from external stakeholders, and unblock us from external dependencies.\n\nSo that's why I'm curious what exactly you mean by \"ghost manager\". If I don't *see* or *speak* to my manager in weeks, not a big deal. They're still doing the job I expect of them behind the scenes. But if they're literally doing nothing for several weeks, that's another story entirely.\n\nI'd still much rather have that than a micromanager though. A Senior / Staff / Architect can step up to cover that kind of a role in the event of an absent manager. Otherwise your team's at risk of the Mack Truck Theory. You don't want the absence of a single person to bring your whole team to a grinding halt.",

I got quite a bit of traffic from the LinkedIn auto generated looking for work post.  Posting a new one with the tag every week would likely help you get recruiters to find you.\n\nThe other thing is realize all of the posted salary ranges are a complete lie.

Notably that paper wasn't about money, it was about me wanting to go into CS, and all the really cool things I can do with a CS degree. I wasn't thinking about the money.\n\nOne big difference about my approach, and the approach I see a lot of people on this subreddit taking is I chose the degree *first*, not my job.\n\nA lot of people here decide they want to be a SWE first, and then work backwards to a CS degree. This hyper-focuses their career path and job search, which can make it significantly more difficult. Especially early career where they may not land their ideal role right away, and because they worked backwards from their ideal role, they view it as a failure and get depressed, and give up.\n\nWhereas with me, I would've been happy with *any* job remotely in technology. I would've been *totally fine* with help desk. When I was in college I was applying to every internship under the sun. IT, Help Desk, PM, SysAdmin, QA, whatever. If it was tech-related, I applied. Since I didn't have tunnel-vision on any specific role, this gave me flexibility. I couldn't get a SWE internship after my sophomore year, but I did get an offer for a PM internship. As a new grad, I only had 1 SWE offer, and that came pretty late. But I *did* have backups. A return offer from my PM internship, other IT offers, etc. If that late SWE offer never came, I was totally prepared to take one of those other offers, and been completely content with it. I got my CS degree, and I got a job out of it. Goal met. It's much easier to meet a goal like that than it is \"SWE at FAANG\".",

If you have a medical facility near you, any communities related to them are also a good place to look because a lot of doctors have nannies. New residents and med students with kids in particular may be looking to nanny share to save some money. \n\nYour other option is to aggresively consolidate your day and hire in-home help for that time. For example, make your working hours 9AM-1PM (or whatever). Find a part time nanny who is willing to do 4 hours per day. Then tell work that your hours for meetings and other syncronous work have shifted into that mid-day block or to hours when your husband is home. \n\nBoth of these options, a nanny share or a part time nanny, will run you a similar cost to high quality infant daycare, but will keep your child from getting sick with all of the daycare sicknesses. It's also better for babies that small to be home. Group care is just not the best option for that age, so if you can avoid it, you should.

        "body": "People here have good advice but I'll tell you my story as it's very similar to yours. Advice at the end.\n\nSome background here: My wife and I had twins 4.5 months ago. My wife is a PM at a startup (she has anywhere from 2-4 hours of meetings a day), I'm a senior dev at a more established company (I have 30 minutes of meetings per day), and we both WFH full time. Also, I often can get away with working 10 hour weeks but the occasional crunch time for a project means I'm working 40 hours. My wife had \\~3 months of maternity leave and I had 2 weeks of PTO that I used all up front when the babies were born. Ours were also underbaked (lol) at 37 weeks which is actually full term for twins. Our twins for the first \\~4 months were also EXTREMELY clingy and could not be put down. We we wearing them almost all hours of the day.\n\nOur original plan was to attempt to balance them between meetings and work - we thought this might be feasible since my meeting schedule is so light and my working hours are extremely flexible.\n\nTowards the end of my wife's maternity leave, we realized things were only getting harder with the twins. On days where I happen to have a few extra meetings and she does as well (nearly every day for her) we really didn't have a backup plan other than 2 screaming babies behind me on camera or me skipping meetings. \n\nSo in the final week before she went back to work, we hired a nanny who came to our house to watch the babies from 9-2. That offered us enough time to get things down and squeeze our meetings into this time window and then do any work we needed to follow up with later in the evening. Even this was not a very sustainable lifestyle as we found ourselves far too often working into the night when we were exhausted from taking care of twins most of the day. Our nanny didn't end up working out - she was unable to care for the babies as they needed a caretaker who had more energy (you can read my previous posts for more context here) so we ended up letting her go a few weeks ago and we are currently on week 3 of working while taking care of the twins. Let me tell you, it is extremely difficult. I take meetings in my airpods with screaming babies and then run out of the room to give my scrum update and then immediately after (2 min later) run back into the room to continue looking after them. I take meetings on walks. I cram as much work into their short nap windows as I possibly can. My wife and I both work late into the night to make it work. It is HARD. I would not wish it on anyone.\n\nMy wife just put in her 2 weeks notice and work and I just landed a new job that gives me a raise to cover enough of her loss in comp that we should be fine for her to just be full time SAHM for now.\n\nTLDR;\n\nMy situation is slightly different than yours - 2 WFH parents with 2 babies. But I think you also will find (especially with your heavy meeting load) that it's just not sustainable. You might make it work for a few weeks but inevitably you'll find that you can't dedicate enough effort to either work or your baby and likely both will suffer for it.\n\nMy advice would be to spend the time now (before you go back to work) finding people in your network/community/neighborhood who would be interested in nanny sharing and then find ways if possible to reduce spending in other areas of your life to free up some funds for this. It's not going to be easy. But it will likely be SO MUCH easier than trying to do everything yourself.\n\nDM me or I can put you in contact with my wife if you have any questions!",

Maybe do a trial run of trying to take care of your baby while also doing those type of tasks. Is it doable at all? I‚Äôve found it to be really tricky but maybe you‚Äôll have better luck. If you are able to make some progress here, you‚Äôll be one step ahead if you decide the changes at your company aren‚Äôt something you want to deal with. Searching for a job while you have a job is better than searching when you need one.\n\nIf it isn‚Äôt doable, then I think daycare is the right call.

I returned to work after a 12 week leave, and I was also very scared and anxious about leaving my daughter in daycare. She attended three days per week and my husband WFH the other two days and took turns watching her. We worked evenings and weekends to make up for it. When she became mobile, we sent her to daycare four days per week.\n\nIt's hard to WFH with a baby. It can be done, but you're really doing both your job and your baby a disservice. Luckily we found an amazing daycare with teachers and staff we trust. Our daughter adjusted really easily - it even helped her establish a good schedule and nap in a crib! We truly consider daycare as part of our \"village.\"\n\nI hope you have an amazing remainder of maternity leave and soak up all those sweet snuggles. Ultimately, you'll have to do what's best for yourself and your family. I just wanted to share my personal experience.",

They can even say \"Great!\" and not be lying, because what a \"Good WLB\" is is very subjective. They may genuinely think their WLB is great because they only have you working 60 hours instead of 80.\n\nSo instead, ask them about stories. In the exact same way they use \"tell me about a time when...\" questions on *you* to gain insight into *you* as opposed to directly asking. \"When was the last time the team was missing a deadline, and how was that handled?\", \"How are deadlines decided, and who decides on them?\", \"When do most people generally come in/leave for the day?\", \"When's the last time the team got an after hours support call and how was that handled?\", \"What's considered 'crunch time', and how often is the team doing that?\", \"What are your expectations of \\[role\\]?\", etc, etc.\n\nThere are many, many different answers to those questions. It's up to you to decide if you think their answer demonstrates the kind of WLB/culture you're willing to join.\n\nIf from any of the questions it sounds like this is a \"work hard play hard\" team, you reject them.\n\nI've worked for 2 startups, and they had amazing WLB's.

My advice: take a look at the Blind/Grind 75 and try doing as many of those as possible. Over time, you will realize every Leetcode problem is really just a variation of another, and the crux is just figuring out which technique is applicable to said problem. Is it a BFS or DFS search tree problem? Dynamic programming? Greedy algorithm? Recursion? Hash table or heap? Once you get the hang of identifying that part quickly, the actual coding becomes a lot easier, and interviewers will be more lenient on your actual whiteboarding because you will have at least demonstrated you know what the problem is asking for.",

Your brain is not as \"plastic\" as it once was, so you will need time to get this stuff locked in (and that is OK).\n\nThe way I'd go about it is to seriously try the Leetcode Easy. Why Easy? Because a lot of the Mediums are generalizations of Easy problems, and the Easy problems give you a good foundation of key techniques.\n\nOnce you find a solution to an Easy, take around 10-15 minutes and think if you can find a faster solution. On Leetcode it is usually to tell if there is a faster solution by the speed/memory distribution.\n\nOnce you get the hang of Easys, then start doing Mediums that are semi-related to the Easys you've done. (For example, if you did an Easy in strings, do some Mediums in strings. If you did Easies in arrays, do some Mediums in arrays.) Your mind will be somewhat attuned to possible patterns and techniques.\n\nWRT AI... please don't. People will find out. If they don't find out then, they will find out at the interview when they make you code in front of them. And once recruiters find out, they tell other recruiters privately that this candidate used AI. Even if you somehow make it, you'll be miserable. You will have a case of impostor syndrome that you've never believed can exist. You will know inside that you're way above where you are, because the work will be assigned based on the AI version of you, not you. And if you think you can use AI at work... sure, I'm sure people will not mind as much, but you will NOT be happy in that role.\n\nEDIT: A lot of ppl have some flavor of what I said. I wanted to add. Please make sure you know basic Data structures (Arrays, Lists, Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks, Hash tables) and Algorithms (Sorting, Binary search, divide and conquer, BFS, DFS, Binary Search Trees and Tree Traversals, etc).",

Stop testing yourself on stuff you haven't practiced yet.\n\nLearn the concepts and ideas behind \"algorithms and data structures\". Actually make sure you understand what it is about, how things work in principle. Then start practicing. Do not try to solve as many questions as you can, but look at a question, understand it, and work your way not just to a solution, but to understanding what it does, and why, and how, and explain why that is better than sub-optimal alternatives.\n\nOnce you're good at that, you should have very few problems with leetcode anymore.\n\nThere are problems that you'll absolutely have to memorize. Dijkstra's algorithm is named after the dude because it is nothing short of brilliant. I know I am not that clever, so I won't come up with that solution to that problem. but i don't have to memorize how to scan an array for the largest value, because I actually understand what is going on, any way,  and can rebuild the solution when it is needed.\n\n\\*: Fun fact, chicken sexing is one weird exception that nobody has an explanation for yet.

They want to see how you break down problems, ask clarifying questions, and adapt when given new information mid-problem. You can't really drill these like you would technical coding questions, but you can practice explaining your thought process out loud and getting comfortable with saying \"I'm not sure, but here's how I'd approach it.\"\n\nJane Street's bar is high and they're looking for a specific type of analytical thinking that either clicks with you or doesn't. But the uplifting part is that if you've made it to round three, they already see potential in you. Focus on being genuinely curious about the problems they present, don't be scared to ask questions, and show them how your mind works rather than trying to guess the \"right\" answer. The topics can range from basic probability and statistics to market dynamics, so having a solid foundation there helps, but your reasoning process matters more than perfect recall of formulas.\n\nI'm on the team behind [interviews.chat](http://interviews.chat), and we built it specifically to help with these kinds of challenging interview scenarios where you need to think on your feet and articulate complex reasoning clearly.",

Started at 75k and worked my way to about 90k (not a huge bump but defense doesnt pay that crazy). I decided to jump ship during the last hiring boom of covid. Ended up at a big tech company (one of the bigger ones) for 200k TC. I took it without even thinking. \n\nDefense - i loved my co-workers and was moving up the latter quickly. It was so chill and the work was fun and easy. I did 20 hours of work and chilled the rest of the week. I was my team's scrum master and developer and i didnt think about work after 5 pm and was a top performer. There werent any real deadlines and i could sit on a task for 2 months and nobody complained. \n\nBig tech - things got hectic quickly. I was working for their cloud service. What i didnt know is that cloud is where work life balance goes to die. At first i wanted to respet my balance and stuck to 40 hour weeks for the most part. Then it slowly got more and more hectic and since i was remote id idnt realize my coworkers were pulling 50-60 hour weeks sometimes mroe. so after a year i obviously was behind the rest and even if my work was to my standards, they compared me to my coworkers standards and i got less than average. I drank the kool aid for a year and worked like crazy. Matched the 50-60 hours but i realzied i just didnt lvoe the work but the economy was shit so i kept it going. After a year i got another bad review and a few months later fired. \n\nIm not saying dont take AWS, for the money it sounds amazing. You might have a way better experience than i did. I know someone who works for AWS, has 300k+ in TC and it's one of the easier AWS projects where people sign off at 5pm and dont think about work. They dont even have on-call.  You could land ion a project like that or you could land in a project that requires 80 hours from you in tough weeks. \n\nIm just saying sometimes the fame and fortune isnt what it lives up to be. You need to decide if you will be ok with the potential burnout. Also it's not always you will find a job with coworkers you like.",

You can make it better by fixing root causes, tuning alarms, and pushing back on what‚Äôs worth paging.\n\nWill you grind 60‚Äì80 hours a week? No. Major incidents can happen, but you can (and should) set boundaries. If you‚Äôre up half the night, escalate to your manager, hand off, and rest. That‚Äôs encouraged.

Cybersecurity / Cloud Operations has lots of problem solving, and you can pick areas that don‚Äôt require daily coding.

I didn't have it or any AWS experience and was hired since I used Azure at my last job. The cloud certs are the only ones I ever see and only about 10% of the time. Less relevant for that 10% if the company uses 1 of the other 2. So you see, low value but not zero.\n\nRest of certs are scams.\n\n*How do you stand out more after graduating?*\n\n1. Work experience. Nice if the job is a similar industry. List technology you used on the job because no one wants to train you. Make the hiring manage believe you can make significant contributions with minimal training. Easy to get the chance if they like you resume.\n2. Greater than 1 YoE, resume can be 1 or 2 pages, or 1.5 is okay white space kind of looks bad. Use a big font if 2 pages. Honestly, big font is underrated. Eye tracking surveys you can search for show HR reads you resume for less than 8 seconds. Don't make it an adjective fiesta. I list the tech stacks both in the job descriptions and in a separate section at the bottom for ease of reading.\n3. A select few companies like seeing community involvement such as volunteering. Can attend young professionals events and maybe make friends at companies that are hiring. Adult kickball leagues, I know multiple married couples that met on teams.\n4. Sounds obvious but be within driving distance of the office. I don't list my full address, just City, State, Zipcode. Remote jobs all well and good but those get the most applicants. Almost every company I know went back to 3-4 days in the office.\n\n>still managed to hit \\~120 applications.

        "body": "There are probably several people from FANGs who were able to get rapid promos with similar stories, but this was one way to get on the fast track for promos there.\n\nI came in as an L3 at Google working on a product that was about half a year out from a product reveal. It's on Android, which is good because we didn't lack any Android expertise in our org. This was in the Lollipop - Marshmallow era. We were trying to write what was effectively an Android-on-Android \"emulator\" to sandbox Android code, which was a non-negotiable from Android Security for our product launch. I was part of an org built around solely this one product.\n\nThe problem was that the Android framework code was heavily customized by different OEMs (for the framework services) and SOCs (for e.g. the egl GPU drivers, as well as the Bionic/libc runtimes themselves).  The main architecture was there, but we couldn't figure out how to proceed with working through the thousands of miniscule differences between the various different OEM customizations that would cause our sandbox to break in subtle ways.\n\nI had some RE experience in the past, so I asked if we could get approval from our OEM partners via our account managers to reverse engineer the proprietary framework code for different OEMs to work through these bugs one by one (obviously, we couldn't get src code access). A lot of them okay-ed the request, though for very few bigger OEMs, we had to create a setup to do slow black box RE instead since the TAMs couldn't get an agreement in place.\n\nIt turns out that most OEMs and SOCs reuse their customizations across all of their devices (with the exception of Samsung, where even within the J series, things changed drastically version to version), so the final list of things we had to RE and then add hackarounds for was a fairly feasible space of changes.\n\nWe did have to redo our go-to-market roadmap since we couldn't tackle the whole thing in just one half. Instead, I wrote out a quick roadmap for what I thought would've been a good ordering of OEMs to unlock, and a \"PoC\" demonstrating how to fix up one specific OEM. My skip LGTM-ed it, and I started as the de facto L3 TL of this program that went to weekly program review at our org level steering.\n\nI spent about 1.5 years running that program to completion. I spent the first half teaching 2 other SWEs how to do the RE work and then working through most of the low hanging fruits to get to our launch target (IO). Then another year to grow out the team and get to something like 95% coverage by device count before we hit diminishing returns (the fan-out of highly customized devices with low user base that we scoped out from the program). By the end of it, I had made L5 as a TL for a team of 8.\n\nI won't lie, that was definitely the funnest 2 years of my career. I was also blessed with good mentorship, since my EM really helped me figure out what I and the team needed (e.g. swaying me away from the tendency to become a single bottleneck and instead focus on growing the same skills in my peers). At the end of the day however, it's mostly a matter of being at the right place at the right time.\n\nAnother year down the line, and the org lost interest in maintaining the product. So we pivoted to another greenfield project that ended up helping me get to L6.",

Squarespace definitely has a pretty chill wlb and has a good engineering culture + you should have a very supportive engineering manager. There were regular company-wide panel meetings for engineers to showcase their recent work and share interesting news and upcoming tech. However, from my own experience, the product management and roadmaps can be a little shaky and if you are the type of dev that prefers autonomy and moving at your own pace, you might feel bogged down by all of the meetings and politics between different teams & departments.\n\nAs the other commenter said, options are definitely a crapshoot and thats part of the reason I left for a startup where my options would have a little more upside + I could have more eng & product ownership. By the time I left I had a few years of stock refreshers that were worth about 75k a year in straight up equity which were then converted to plain cash payouts after SQSP went private. The change to options was def a downgrade for me given that any potential value hinged on growth in valuation and going public again or doing a stock buyback/other liquidity event. At the time that I left a lot of people viewed the valuation target from the company leadership as a bit aggressive but who's to say that they can't meet it with some aggressive catch-up against their main competitors (eg. shopify with a current valuation \\~25x that of Squarespace when it went private).\n\nI'd say to not make the jump just because of the potential value of the equity, but if you're looking for a good engineering culture and interesting product to continue your career growth I would definitely suggest considering Squarespace",

You might find backend, automation, or even systems programming a better fit. Python is especially powerful because it crosses into both software development and cybersecurity. For cybersecurity, it‚Äôs useful for scripting, automating scans, and working with security tools.\n\nIf you‚Äôre interested in cybersecurity, focus on Python scripting for automation. Networking basics (which you‚Äôve started on). Linux security and command line skills. Certifications like CompTIA Security+ or CEH (these can help open doors). If you‚Äôre more interested in software development, building a few solid projects (maybe a command line tool, an automation script, or a backend system) will help you stand out.\n\nEU companies often look for flexible engineers who can do multiple things. Stick with Python as your main tool, add depth with either Java or C#, and build some focused projects. Also, check out [Cloud Strategy Labs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhSfe40GX9gqDkFvvURNJA) for more clear roadmaps and step by step guides for both software development and cybersecurity.",

So even if you‚Äôre not into web dev, both still have strong non web uses.\n\nFor projects you can still build things that stand out without touching frontends. Automation tools to write a Python or C# script that automates boring tasks (like cleaning up files, organizing data, or generating reports). System utilities to build a command line tool for network scanning, log parsing, or monitoring resources. Cybersecurity mini tools which are things like a password strength checker, simple intrusion detection script, or vulnerability scanner. Data focused projects to parse large datasets, visualize trends, or build small machine learning models. Game or simulation projects using C# with Unity or even Python with Pygame, create a small but complete game or simulator. Make the project useful and complete not just half finished code.
