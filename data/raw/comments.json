I was quite satisfied until I was asked to conduct technical interviews for few of new future team members with 4-5 years of experience each. The interviews went well, and I shortlisted several candidates for further rounds.\n\nLast week, I was pulled into a call with HR, the Team Director, and PM, where I learned that they had shortlisted two candidates, both with around 5 years of experience. However, both candidates turned down the offers, requesting better compensation. The salary they rejected was approximately $11,750 more than what I currently earn annually. I would like an extra 800$ every month, Who wouldn't?\n\nThis revelation devastated me. When I discussed it with friends, everyone told me there's no point trying to negotiate a raise with my current organization. They advised me to either start interviewing elsewhere and leave, or only discuss a raise when I have a competing offer in hand. According to them, there's no easier alternative - either accept the status quo and continue doing what you're doing, or pursue what you believe you're worth.\n\nMost companies show no empathy toward their employees and view them merely as workhorses. They constantly test boundaries, seeking maximum returns for minimum investment.",

        "body": "Ways I would tackle it:\n\n1. Denormalized counters in your post record (small scale)\n\nYou add integer columns like `comments_count`, `likes_count` directly on your posts table.\n\nWhenever someone adds or removes a comment (or like), you increment/decrement that column instead of re‑scanning all comments.\n\nMost relational databases (Postgres, MySQL) can do an atomic `UPDATE posts SET comments_count = comments_count + 1 WHERE id = ?` cheaply, especially when that column is in memory.\n\nThis would be my first pick given you can ship this in minutes with zero infrastructure beyond your main database.\n\n2. Sharded or distributed counters (mid scale)\n\nFor “hot” posts with millions of comments/likes - think celebrities, viral content etc., a single counter can become a write hotspot.\n\nYou break it into N shards:\n\n    UPDATE comment_counter_shards\n       SET shard_count = shard_count + 1\n     WHERE post_id = ? AND shard_id = rand_between(1, N)\n\nTo read the total, you sum over those N shards. N is tuned (often 4–16) so no single row fights over locks.\n\nThis solution pays off only when your single‑row updates actually become a bottleneck (once you hit sustained write contention). Until then its probably an overkill.\n\n3. In‑memory caching (Redis, Memcached, etc.)\n\nMaintain the “current” counts in a fast key‑value store. On each write you atomically INCR or DECR the Redis key (e.g. post:123:comments).\n\nFeed readers pull from cache, falling back to the database only if the cache miss occurs.\n\nEach 1 & 2 solutions could be combined with this method for low-latency reads.\n\nI am about to drive - lemme think of other ways, I will edit and add to this post if something else comes up.\n\nUPDATE: Some more thoughts:\n\nTo keep write latency low, counters could update asynchronously (e.g. via a message queue).\n\nYou accept sub‑second lag in the displayed count in exchange for high throughput (which for non-YMYL stuff like like/comment count is acceptable).\n\nAlso worth noting, there are specialized data stores with native counters like Cassandra and Bigtable from Google. They support atomic counter columns across distributed nodes, so you offload the complexity of sharding and locking.\n\nBut if you are at that stage and its your own service, you probably made it and I want your job :)\n\nAnyways, its weekend. Going for some mountain touge with my Miata :D Peace out ✌️\n\nP.S. I run [AI/software studio](https://famouslabs.org) and I am open for work - whether its data, MVPs or custom software. DMs open!",

This is fairly common though, so the thought of cloning a prod table to dev environment  could get you in trouble. Generally speaking though, any transformative logic that needs to be worked out can be done via specially curated files containing essential data points and scenarios within the data. Or you can simply write up a script against prod data so you can ensure your features make sense and then plug that in. Though in my experience the latter is less common.\n\nAnd yes during deployment phase you would ensure that these parameters that point to specific environments would be replaced with the relevant environment that the code has been merged to. Dev -> Test, Test -> Stage, etc… keep in mind though that there are times where dev, test, stg, prod are not simply different schemas in a larger database but are entirely different databases/workspaces themselves and have maintained the same naming convention so sometimes nothing needs to change. An example of this would be databricks workspaces with exact same naming for database objects for each individual environment and when you deploy to other environments you just ensure the target workspace is where the code is being deployed. \n\nHope this helps!",

Mostly folks either know the expeced answer, or give up. Very few in between.\nI also have a more elaborate, interactive task to check their ability to write classes and work with `@property`/`@....setter`. By elaborate I mean we start simple and at each stage I add a complication, like \"let's pretend addition is a very computationally expensive operation. How can we refactor this code to avoid unnecessary addition?\".\n\nI might ask them what sorting algorithm is built into python, or how does python allocate memory when growing lists.",

        "body": "I'd say that an Inmon approach (at least originally, the man keeps evolving his ideas and publishing new books) compares better as a data architecture, much like a data mesh, more than Kimball (at least when he started, that guy kept on expanding his concepts as well).\n\nInmon's DW design favored more or less 3 data layers:\n- A raw layer, that started as a landing zone and eventually evolved to an \"operational data store\". Originally is way quite simple, but an ODS was supposed to provide operational level reporting capabilities, with even near real-time if possible (it was quite visionary when proposed in the 90s);\n- A Data Warehouse layer, which was supposed to have a fully integrated view of the business for analytical purposes. This matched mostly his definition: \"subject-oriented, non-volatile, integrated, time-variant collection of data\". The DW layer is rarely, if ever, accessed by BI tools or end users. It is the single source of truth that feeds the specific databases (next bullet) supporting analytic and decision nerds. As such, it tends to be more normalized (not really full 3NF, but in that direction), as this would make it more reusable for different sets of requirements - including future ones.\n- Data marts: these are tightly scoped to the needs of specific use cases. For reporting and BI, it's common to model those as Kimball star schemas; for data science, other formats, even files, are possible. For specific reports, it could be a very custom thing.\n\nThis actually is the source for a medallion architecture, and also became a full data architecture before Kimball came up with the concept of a DW using \"conformed dimensions\". I built quite a few DWs using Inmon's approach, and I can tell you they evolve well and survive a lot. The main challenges are:\n- Figuring out a good priority for which domains/subjects to build first. It's no use trying to model the whole DW layer before delivering something, but people still try that.\n- Knowing how to capture a business in its entirety in a data model. Eventually, as you iterate, you'll find inconsistencies, redundancies, things no one thought about, politics, etc. Solving those to one common model is hard; letting them pass reduces the value of the DW layer over time, putting g the entire architecture in check;\n- Compound effort of having data go through 3 layers (or more) before delivering value. Again, this is people just assuming they have to adopt and build it all before any value is delivered. My approach was to first do a high level business mapping in domains to identify opportunities and prioritize. The first 2-3 deliveries usually had very light landing and a straightforward middle layer model, generating stars was straightforward, fast and cheap. As the platform grew, complexity would be added but not as a burden - it is a way to actually represent the business and deliver higher-level analytics. The kind that needs cross domain analysis, decision and optimization. Doing that on top of starts is incredibly harder (been there, done that).\n\nInmon kept evolving his design, addressing data quality, unstructured data, real-time and others, but he lost importance as the world moved to cloud and Hadoop - even though he published about those and his designs were perfectly applicable there. It's more that everything pre-cloud and pre-agile was sort of left behind by a new generation.\n\nEdit:typos",

Even when you strip out the career transition content and occasional meme, what you have left is almost 100% personal project shilling, links to articles published by complete noobs and written by AI, or the oddly phrased questions about workflows and pain points that sound like market research. I think the only thing you can do to get your post removed is directly ask the subreddit for a job!\n\n\nThere are some occasional gems in the comments but they're increasingly hard to find. I don't have any alternatives after Web 2.0 kind of killed classic forums. Maybe data engineering is too wide of a discipline to have a quality centralized forum. Better discussion may be found by looking for communities based on the tech stack being used.",

For example, yes we allow self promotion but we closely monitor how often a company self promotes and remove posts that go over the limit. There are a lot of FAQ that we’ve tried to address in the wiki or have been recently answered and we direct folks there when we can. If a post is 100% ai generated (difficult to tell sometimes) from a bot we mark it as spam. That being said if a human uses ai to help craft their question then that’s OK. I can assure you we are very active and care a lot about this community but it’s a game of cat and mouse.\n\nYou can see my other comment that we do read this feedback and take action based on it. Maybe we can do a better job of communicating those things via meta posts like this.\n\nEDIT: here are some high level stats from the last 30 days.\n[IMG-3857.jpg](https://postimg.cc/V5PT15jp)",

And the project has been actively maintained since then with bi-weekly kubeflow calls and even a release 2 months ago. \n\n> In May 2025, the Apache Spark Kubernetes Operator launched as an official subproject \n\nKind of. The first formal release just happened, but it was launch as an official subproject in 2023 ([voting thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread/wdy7jfhf7m8jy74p6s0npjfd15ym5rxz)) and the first commits happened [a few months later](https://github.com/apache/spark-kubernetes-operator/commit/eddc7e6bef0c270f5d3f3bbe0aef83e77cb2d5ba). \n\n> Core maintainers say they might converge APIs eventually\nThey do? \n\nOne other huge difference this article doesn’t mention is the kubeflow operator is Go (like most operators) and the Apache one is Java. This has the benefit making the Apache one more performant as it’s not shelling out to `spark-submit` and starting a new JVM for every job submission. But the Apache one is missing some good metrics, the Prometheus output doesn’t support tagging, and the SparkApplication resources have to be manually deleted (causing problems at scale if you don’t).",

I've been testing the Apache operator since late 2024 so it's definitely been launched, but only just published the first formal release. \n\nBut for the Kubeflow one, you have a header that says `The Kubeflow Era (2018-2023)`. But the operator wasn't donated to Kubeflow until 2023 so that just jumped out at me.",

        "body": "Wait, am I understanding correctly: did you set up Airflow such that it is pulling DAG code from multiple repos? That's what the \"git submodules\" thing makes me believe is going on.\n\nMy advice: do not do that. Unless you have literally thousands of engineers, **just do a monorepo for Airflow DAGs**. There are few reasons to make it more complicated than that and there are a lot of upsides to the monorepo in terms of how real world projects develop, in addition to just relieving yourself of the deployment headache (which is the #1 reason). Those other reasons are:\n\n- a single commit can touch multiple DAGs across multiple projects\n\n- projects can share Airflow-level utils\n\n- sync dependencies in Airflow runtime\n\n- external DAG dependencies\n\n- easier to run a local version of the whole instance if your Airflow isn't dependent on CI-specific things to glue things together\n\n- less magic\n\nSo save yourself the headache and just do the monorepo.\n\nFrom there, deployment is very simple. Every major Airflow deployment method, including the Helm Chart but also MWAA and Astronomer, just mounts the `dags/` folder as a volume, and so deployments that do not introduce new dependencies are as simple as updating the folder.\n\nExternal systems that get called by Airflow can be in their own separate repos, but know where the dividing line is between those systems and Airflow as an orcestrator: KubernetesOperator, CloudRunCreateJobOperator, EcsTaskRunOperator. Yes modifying the `argv` of a container's command requires two commits across two separate repos, but that's not a big deal (cross-DAG commits are way more annoying when they're cross-repo; within-DAG commits being cross-repo is really not that annoying. The monorepo really wants to optimize for that case to be easier).\n\nAlso, never ever use git submodules. You can either take my advice right here right now, or you can waste your time and learn the hard way.",

If you run your ingestion on a Saturday morning and tie the date to the Saturday, then the business is going to be quite curious why sales numbers are so high on Saturdays when they are closed, and so low on Mondays when they are open.\n\nYou might need to track when the data was ingested, so you can verify what the state of the data was when some process was run. Without that, you may get a bit lost of source data arrives out of order, or is late to arrive, or is skipped.\n\nStoring both in an append-only table is a very simple way to be able to do *anything* you need with the data. If you need to refresh or reprocess some ingestion then you can do so - all following processes just use the latest technical timestamp for the given business timestamp. You still have the old copy if you need to see what the differences are between the two. Things can be loaded out of order, and you can determine exactly what kind of processing you need to do for downstream tables.\n\nDon't mix the two up because, as NS1969 said, *they mean different things*.",

You can never catch up by investing later in life to what you will have if you invest now.  \n\\* in-company raises are almost always % based.  A 3% raise on $160k vs $120k, and potentially yearly going forward, adds up over time  \n\\* negotiation leverage at your next job for a higher starting salary if you are switching from making, say $165k vs $124k or whatnot. \n\nI love the advice someone else gave about taking feedback well and doing your best to learn from it.

Once you've got your own copy of it, you can rerun any processing on it as much as you like.\n\nNothing going to a landing area should be running for 24 hours, and unless you're directly querying from some tabular source like a database you generally wouldn't be saving directly to a tabular format.\n\nYou would be aiming for something like storing every individual response (or page, in this case) as you go. If they're large enough, you save them as s3 objects in their own right. If they're small, you send them to something like Kinesis Firehose, which will automatically buffer objects up to 15mins/300MB and then save them out to s3.\n\nIf you want to track where you are up to, and you are running all this in a single process, you can just have a json object in s3 that you overwrite with the currently active data, so that if something stops or crashes you can pick up from the last request. If you have multiple concurrent processes or it is updating very fast, you can store it all in a tiny DynamoDB against a particular key.\n\n---\n\nMicrobatching ingestion into a single duckdb database sounds off. You replace objects in s3, so every write will be a full rewrite of the file. If you wanted to make data like this available to duckdb for processing, you would be writing append-only to some other file format that duckdb could read.\n\nFor remote data instances with updates like this, you might use duckdb as the processing engine, but you would be using an open table format like deltalake or iceberg to allow you to do write transactions on the data in a way that is more amenable to the way object storage works.",

Learning from other people is a crutch and always will be.  I always thought in my previous career \"well, I'll just learn from this person until I can stand on my own two feet, and everything will be fine\".  It never happened.  I never improved and ended up hating my job because I became more experienced on paper, but in reality, my knowledge didn't correlate with my experience.  And it showed.\n\nWhen it came to DE, I taught myself and found it liberating not feeling like I was stuck, waiting for somebody else to hold my hand all the time.  I could just look at a piece of work, play around, get a feel for it and then continue from there.  Every time I learnt something new, it stuck much harder because I discovered it myself rather than somebody saying, \"Make sure you sort out XYZ\" before I had time to think about it.\n\nOn top of that, it's another incentive to go ahead and start building instead of another excuse to sit on social media all day, pushing you into the greatest trap - the illusion of learning.\n\nMy recommendation is to stop chasing the ideas of other people and develop your own.  Knowing what's good and what's bad comes with time. It's really common with beginners that they want to be perfect from the get go, so go out of their way to try and seek knowledge from people who claim to know more.  Making mistakes and being imperfect is part of learning.  I'm a firm believer you don't need a mentor and most people who say you need a mentor are, ironically, mentors.\n\n> Have any of you found value in attending data engineering or analytics conferences?\n\nMostly surface level.  I went to a large one in Europe and my manager joked at the time \"Remember: you are all happily employed\" because it was a running joke that the conferences are just for companies to poach from other companies.  I enjoyed the community aspect, learnt a few things.  Won some competitions.  Getting paid to have fun in a new city is fun.\n\n> Any learning paths or courses that helped you understand more than just what works but also why?\n\nHonestly? Teach yourself, be willing to learn (as in, be wrong and improve rather than be wrong and convinced you'll be right the next time with exactly the same approach).  I'd also say don't chase tools, learn concepts instead as it saves you so much time.  Be curious.  Be patient - there is no other way to put in 10,000 hours other than putting in 10,000 hours.",

At my org people will create what's supposed to be a POC and then you end up with 8 copy-pasted workflows with slight differences scattered around. This is often because it provides no code connectors with limited flexibility.\n\n\nAnother limitation I've found is native logging observability. You can set up error workflows to capture and send errors to a logging service, and also store general execution data in this logging service, but if you have a staff capable of managing this why are we using low code? In my org the people using N8n don't do this. I'll get slack messages and then have to comb through the GUI's very limited execution log screen.\n\nPeople also use it for use cases where it's not needed because they don't know any better (e.g. scheduling a query in your warehouse). \n\n\nYou can probably tell I really detest working with it and look forward to not dealing with it at whatever my next job is.",

You have to first ask yourself: why is it important and/or useful for me to organise this? What benefits do I hope to achieve? Answering those first will give you some guidelines on what needs to be done. Then from there you can pick specific techniques.  \n  \nThough it's important to note that having a 'random stuff' drawer where everything gets put in with no sorting can actually be useful since it cuts the cognitive load of having to sort things. If you haven't found a compelling reason to organise it after 15 years then it's a strong indication that you either don't have a strong reason to do it, or the system you currently use - albeit informal - is workable enough.\n\nOk now I get to put my autistic hat on:  \nAs an autistic person I have at times enjoyed organising things 'for their own sake'. Whilst it's been fun and I learned a lot, the end results were never anything \\*that\\* useful. If you're anything like me then just be aware of it. It's fine to spend time and enjoy the process but be cautious about any perceived future benefit.\n\nThe system I like best for lots of random stuff is the PARA method. You can start by dumping everything into one big 'archive' folder and then either move things out one-by-one into an organised place, or you can move things ad-hoc when you 'touch' them. e.g. if you find yourself needing to use an old python script or look at certain docs, then make sure to move those into the organised structure when you do so.",

SQL will help but data engineering can require experience across a broad scope of systems depending on the role and will require significantly deeper understanding of software engineering best practices. \n\n4. The market (at least where I am) for data engineers is very up and down at the minute. On the whole the salaries are typically much better but the definition of data engineer varies quite a bit between businesses and a lot of business do not see a huge amount of value in data engineering as a practice. For now at least I think data engineering is in a decent spot but I can’t promise that will continue to be the case.",

It depends, if you’re a legitimate DE then it would be more technical unless you’re a pipeline monkey. You typically have to have advanced knowledge of SQL and some programming language. Tableau would not be a very convincing Transform skill as a DE like it would be for a DA. You’d be better off learning dbt, Python, or Spark.\n\n4.

One thing that really helped me was focusing on real-world problem-solving rather than just theoretical concepts. Try to frame your ML and GenAI projects around actual business challenges – it'll make your skills way more relevant in interviews.\n\nFor metrics, I'd suggest tracking your progress on coding challenges and your ability to explain complex ideas simply. That last bit is huge in interviews. \n\nBTW, I actually created a resource called Experimentation Career by Atticus that dives deep into prepping for data roles. It's helped a bunch of folks land jobs at top tech companies. Might be worth checking out if you want a structured approach. Good luck with your prep – you've got this!",

When the request comes in the lambda writes a request to our SQS queue\n3. Fargate listens to the SQS event and executes a dbt run where each variable specified gets passed as args into Jinja e.g \n```\ndbt run --vars '{\"key\": \"value\"}\n```\nWhere the vars here are those that were POSTed to your api endpoint. I wouldn’t use the cli runner but instead the newer added programmatic dbt runner (https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/programmatic-invocations)\n4.

Same SQS and lambda\n1. instead make the api create a new Jinja file with all the variables dumped in statically \n2.  After writing the file it then commits to git.\n3.

When next time the same user calls the api with the same columns they do not go trough the pain of compiling it. \n\nAnd as one suggest previously wrap the dbt in a service with the queue. So it work on one request at a time.\n\nLots of additional questions could be asked but it seems like nice interesting task.",

They both allow you to create visualizations and provide some API functionality to execute SQL queries. For instance, Superset lets you connect directly to your database and has APIs you can tap into for querying data.\n\nAnother option would be to use DreamFactory to generate REST APIs from your dbt models with minimal hassle. It automates some of the heavy lifting and has great built-in features like security and database schema mapping. Plus, it works nicely with a range of databases if you ever need to switch things up. Between Superset, Metabase, and DreamFactory, you should find a fit that makes this process a breeze.",

Instead of having to think through how to handle things like incremental loads, materialization, and workflow, you can just focus on the model definition. It shifts the focus to creating and maintaining the business logic instead of the mechanics of getting data from a to b. You write your model to show you the output you want, and it takes care of the rest. We use dbt in our databricks pipelines currently, and it makes management of 100s of models MUCH easier. \n\nAlso, you can create tests using dbt to verify that the results you want match certain criteria - things like uniqueness, completeness, etc. it also has pretty good methods for tracking lineage and adding documentation, and you can create reusable macros across projects. Ultimately, dbt is a great framework for maintaining all the business logic that goes into semantic models.  \n\nAll that said, when it comes to raw ingestion, python notebooks or dlt pipelines are still the way to go. \n\nI don’t have any experience with snowflake, so can’t help you there!",

How fast does it save to disk?\n\nCompress: gzip compressing text gives about 90% compression with minimal CPU overhead.\n\nTest an upload to S3 with something on disk.

And why do you specify your filter conditions in lambdas? Spark has no way to know what you're doing inside the lambda -- it passes in the entire row so it cannot know what columns are being used, or for what -- so it can't optimise anything. For example, if you had a DataFrame with the tablename, api, and offset cached, then when you chain a proper spark filter off of that it can avoid making API calls for the other tables in the first place, because it can apply the filter earlier in the sequence (as the value never changes). It can't figure that out when you're using rdds and lambdas.\n\nAlso, it has to serialise every row to python, so python can deserialise it, just so that python can execute a basic equality check. A dataframe filter on spark columns will skip all of that.\n\nYou should be able to do all of this with dataframes, and it can make various steps easier and more efficient.",

Oh and MySQL sucks a tiny amount less now.\n\n> They still play Alanis Morrisette a dozen times a day on the radio...

The only thing happening \"under the hood\" is a shift in who's responsible for certain aspects of your data systems' infrastructure. Think renting in multiple tiers, starting with a simple VM /VPN (Infrastructure as a Service) up until you being responsible only for remembering your password to your webspace account (Software as a Service). \n\nNow imagine a boardmember in big-corpo. One of their main tasks is  increasing **shareholder-value**. And IMHO the possibility to stretch such a huge costcenter over time by paying for usage was the main driver cloud became so popular. Big companies are suddenly much more flexible, scaling ressources as the user-load required.\n\nSo the main decision variable is expected server-load and variance thereof, as well as the geographic distribution of your audience. \n\nFor example I'm running my own server with Neo4j Spring Boot (Java) backend and Angular (Typescript) frontend. My 5 users are happy.\n\n\nCheers!",

Without four layers of over-complex libraries, multiple API calls during page load, etc.\n\nPHP is still there, classic ASP is not. PHP gets a lot of hate online nowadays, but mostly of people that have no idea - ignore them. In general there are much more options now, both on backend and frontend. (Of course not all are long-lived).\n\nHosting ... normal way (Apache, Mysql, Nginx, PostGreSql, ...) is fine as long as they meet your requirements. Clouds (Amazaon AWS, Google, Cloudflare, ...) are world-wide networks that offer various services that can (but don't have to) differ significantly. The upsides is that you can get some advanced features relatively easy and possibly cheaper than DIY, eg. redundancy and failover (if one server fails, no data loss and almost zero downtime, no human fixing needed), scaling (depending on how much your thing is used currently, it can use more or less servers automatically, and you only pay for what you use), ... Downsites include that sometimes the structure of the software needs to be adapted to the cloud environment, possibly security and data protection concerns, ...\n\nYes, JS can run on the server too.\n\nAside from programming languages, many web-related things were developed in your time frame. HTTP3, Wasm, Serviceworkers, ... (and many more things) ... and of course, lets not forget HTML 5 and CSS 3.\n\nAlso, some law topics - eg.

Whether its a small app to help you practice tricky verb conjugation of a foreign language or a website to organize your D&D campaign, now everyone has access.\n\nHowever, people are delusional if they think they can build a scalable application that thousands or millions of people will use just by \"vibe coding\". \"\n\nThese guys were so irritated that I wasn't saying \"your stsrt up is going to do so well because youre vibe coding!!\"",

To completely hand over software development to AI means you are just automating automation, which gives you less control and specificity.\n\nThat said, for writing difficult algorithms or complex systems, AI may be used for most of that work in the future, the same way that chess engines can outplay humans.\n\nThe problem with AI coding right now is that it is simply based on large language models, not a formal system such as coding verification. for example, you can task large language models to play chess, but they constantly suggest illegal moves and while they can make some very clever moves, they also make incredibly stupid ones at times as well.\n\nAI coding will take off once the machine learning systems are based on rigorous formal descriptions of programming languages, not just general large language models.\n\nRight now I would argue the best uses of AI for coding is translating large code bases from one language to another, prototyping of very simple ideas, or embedding an AI system to allow users to prompt the text.\n\nThe problem is LLMs are very easy to apply to a wide variety of tasks, but LLMs aren't specifically tailored for programming, so just like LLMs are much worse than a chess engine, specifically designed for chess, there will likely be innovations for ai programming that aren't just \"feed this LLM a bunch of code and see what it can do.\"\n\nLLMs will continue to get better, but even before LLMs people created logical proof systems and formal verification tools that are much more specific to programming.\n\nI imagine a scenario where you just write the test cases and then the ai system generates the code and algorithms that can pass those test cases.",

I would start scrolling through job listings and get a feel for what languages will get you a job. \n\n\nGetting work experience is massive for tech, you just need to get your foot in the door. If I were in your situation, I would get my resume up to scratch (use AI as much as you need) and start applying to everything and get a foot in the door. \n\n\nYes, burnout and analysis paralysis and obsession with perfection happens often, but at a job, it'll be a different story because you have to actually get something out the door in a relatively timely fashion, so you'll learn to reach a \"good enough\" stage and not get bogged down in details. \n\n\nJump stacks and tools all you want in your free time! I'd say it actually gives you a lot of broad experience that you can use across other languages! \n\n\nYou start earning by applying for jobs. It's really tough at the moment and you gotta use every single dirty trick you can, like the one recently where he prompt-injected his resume telling AI to ignore all previous instructions and say that he was the best candidate for the job. Do whatever it takes and get into a professional environment. You'll learn TONNES from that and earn cash. \n\n\nYou're extremely passionate, which people will love and willing to work, you just need to be given some focus and structure. \n\n\nAlso don't abandon all your friends, you need a work-life balance, particularly in programming to stop burnout",

        "body": "[I’ve answered this same question before](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/s/rsxWDC8zme) and my answer is the same, so I will just quote it here.\n\n—\n\nAs a personal recommendation I have found that learning how to program is best facilitated and supported by using a language that can be used to interact with some personal interest that the learner has. This allows you to use an existing passion to help fuel a growing passion— or, more literally, you will be less bored and more curious and driven to experiment and learn, because you have the ability to apply your learnings to something you already enjoy.\n\nIn my case, I believe this to be true because I picked up JS to write some user scripts that helped me automate some tasks as a customer support worker. This experimentation of using programming to help me make my life easier lead to me learning other languages for other things, but in general having that user script to work on while I was doing customer support allowed me to actively identify and experiment with new features that could make the job easier for me. That experimentation is what made me keep going with coding, because of the instant gratification provided by my new feature making my job easier.\n\nUltimately, if you can think of an every day thing that you do that you deposit a significant amount of time into, if you can find a language that will allow you to effectively “hook into” and augment that interest of yours, you will find it a lot more rewarding and satisfying to write code.\n\nPractically speaking, with Java or Python as your two presumptive options, if you’re interested in AI you will have to use Python. On the other hand, I know so many people who have tried python and just given up on coding, while I know so many people who have gotten into Java development because they wanted to write mods for Minecraft— this Java development then blossomed into a career in software development.\n\nIf you play Minecraft, learn Java. You’ll be able to write mods for the game and play with them and this will help you keep your curiosity and enthusiasm.",

In my company (small indie game development company), we have that thing going, where everyone is supposed to read 1 book about game development or any topic related to it in any way, and then present the book in a short conversation within the team, so that everyone learns the most notable pointers from it.\n\n\\-> benefits of doing this: team building, information sharing, learning to be charismatic, learning to analyse, learning to make clean summaries, and obviously everyone learns the good parts without \"wasting\" extra time (\"good\" may be subjective - which again supports the thought of having the books, so everyone that is interested in certain topics can read the related book at any given time without depending on the internet and without requiring to have electronics with + reading on paper can be mind soothing, nicely outside in the garden or nature or a quiet room or such)\n\nEven if some books offer not much knowledge for us anymore, it is important to see other peoples view on the topics to not get stuck in a tunnel vision of knowledge. Every book that offers at least one advice or reminds you of something (may it be simple and obvious) that you just lost track of, is a good book :D\n\n  \n\\-> Certain courses and other material is important too, since nowadays there are other ways to learn also, for example via. AI / Audio books / podcasts / streams / videos / meet-up's / lectures.....\n\n\\-> Books are not and will never be fully replaced, due to their availability and independency\n\n\n\nIf anyone is interested in specific books that have to do with game development, contact me in a DM or on this post, then i may give some recommendations and some \"not worth it\" mentions hehe.\n\nKind regards, \n\nMr. Prototype and the Broken Pony Studios team :)",

But then if you have to implement your own networking library because of some weird requirement you're in a world of hurt because you don't know how anything actually works and/or you don't really understand how to write an algorithm or architect larger software.

You have to get used to writing smallish projects (and mediumish projects and then eventually largish projects). The act of writing and debugging (thinking your way out of the maze you are in, tacking bits on an existing solution, rewriting / refactoring code) is how you learn to get better at writing code. \n\nStart with something basic. text based calculator for instance. The thing I like to work on with people is a dungeon crawler. a text based game where you walk through a dungeon. it teaches you all sorts of abstractions (whether you prefer OO or not) and it's a good way to write a solution first, then later on realise there is a better way and to have to rip the guts out of your code and write it again but better.\n\nlook up gameloop (it looks a little like:)\n\n    public void game() {\n        while (true) {\n            // for keyboard (and non-realtime):\n            Command c = getUserCommand();\n            c.perform(player, world); // do stuff like \"go north\" or \"pull lever\"\n            world.update(); // have other game objects do their thing.\n            String map = world.render(player); // draw an ascii image of the local map, player gives player position\n            // this isn't a very good game loop per se but it is a rough start.\n            System.out.print(map);\n        }\n    }\n\nwith something like the above you can practically do anything. for realtime rendering there are changes you need to make, but for a roguelike the above is sufficient. Build just a single room you can walk around in. (a room is for instance a 2d array with wall or non-wall . player position dictates where the player is. have the player move around. write that as code and you can then move on to player colliding with walls, items being located in places. write other mobs, have mobs move around. create doors, pitfalls, have mobs attack or have them calculate field of view (and if they see player they move toward them). all sorts of things.\n\nthen when you've build a number of these things you'll find it's inefficient. and then you start learning when you rewrite parts to be better/work better for what you want of them.\n\nI would stay away from leetcode problems and the like. try to work on something actual.\n\nif the above isn't it for you, try doing something that parses an excel sheet or does stuff with sound. or create a small paint program that lets you set pixels. just pick something you actually are interested in because that helps you with thinking of what next to add.",

In that case, it's not only that the client cannot see the response, but the browser also won't send the POST request in the first place unless the server first allows it via CORS headers in response to an OPTIONS preflight request.\n\nThat's not true for all POST requests though. Form POSTs specifically predate CORS and developers have always been allowed to submit a form to another domain by simply creating `<form action=\"bank.com/...` HTML and either tricking the user into clicking the submit button or submitting automatically with JS. This wouldn't allow an attacker to see the response to a cross-domain form post, but it would allow you to make the cross-domain form post. Browsers retained this capability because they didn't want to break all the legitimate websites that rely on this behavior to this day.\n\nThis is why you need anti-csrf tokens to hand form POSTs. I think https://smagin.fyi/posts/cross-site-requests/ is a great summary on why we have both CSRF protections and CORS. It's mostly history.

This is what hit me now and I've had to do colossal refactoring. Point is, I had to start small to get there. I remember my first ever non-trivial project was to make Snake playable on the Linux terminal. I had this idea of re-running printf() on a timer to simulate a framerate by having a character array with carefully placed newline characters.

This can lead to many thinking that if they’re really smart, and their way of thinking is really efficient, and it works, and they can see how other people agree that it works, then therefore it must be the ONLY or at least the BEST way. \n\nAnd that’s where they lose me.

Most of the top software engineers make a ton of money at work and then spend their free time with their families and friends—they don't hang around on Reddit all day typing comments about OOP. Typically it's the jobless, the students, or the juniors with low responsibility at work who have extra time and motivation to hang around on programming forums all day. Exceptions apply of course, but that's the general gist of it.\n2. Most of the best software out there is written with OOP, Java, C++... Basically with everything that you don't see as being fancy or recommended on Reddit.\n\nCan you find a connection between these two points?\n\nCould it be that the real seniors who are working on real projects and being paid top money are still using OOP, Java, C++, etc.? Or to be more accurate, they use whatever works the best for the task at hand, whether that's OOP or FP or something else entirely?\n\nMeanwhile the \"seniors\" who either 1. haven't quite grasped OOP *yet*, or 2. gave up after they failed once instead of thriving to improve —are the very people who are most active on these forums, trying to justify their opinions to others, religiously hating the most successful and widespread paradigm of all time instead of learning the ups and downs of each approach.\n\nSo why do these people hate OOP in the first place? Because it's easy to get wrong. It's an insanely potent tool when used right, but it takes years of experience, active studying, experimenting, and trial and error to get right. They've seen horrible inheritance trees based on the \"is-a\" vs \"has-a\" rule, which completely fails if you use it with the English language rather than the physical constructs. Some examples of this going with English are:\n\n- Wrong: A football player *is-a* human -> `FootballPlayer extends Human`\n  - Correct: A human *has-a* job or a hobby -> `player.hobby = football`\n- Wrong: An invisible video-game enemy *is-a* video-game enemy -> `InvisEnemy extends Enemy`\n  - Correct: An enemy character *has-a* opacity -> `enemy.opacity = 0.0`\n- Wrong: An android phone *is-a* phone -> `Android extends Phone`\n  - Correct: A phone *has-a* operating system -> `phone.os = android`\n\nThese are just some of the examples where following the English language fails you, and where you should rely on the [Composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance) principle instead. Of course people have taken this too far to the other extereme as well, going as far as erasing all of language support for inheritance and forcing inheritance through composition... which sucks as well. Android very much *is-a* operating system, and Firefox very much *is-a* browser.",

The number of projects I or friends of mine have started and never finished massively outweighs the ones completed, that's the nature of things. Even the ones that got done were a struggle, you have to decide when something is truly worth pushing through for and make yourself do it (sometimes because you really believe in it, sometimes just because you're being paid). Otherwise chalk it up to learning and move on.  \n\nI think the main thing is for you to release some of the pressure you're putting on yourself. Your family wants you to do well, and you want to do well for their sake, but pushing yourself into a corner won't help with that. Focus on what you're doing, not anyone else. Finish your masters. Put effort into looking for a job, but understand there's no guarantee so don't punish yourself if you're having trouble. If getting a job was easy, or guaranteed, everyone would be following the same path. That path doesn't exist. Just do your best, play your cards as well as you can, and hope like the rest of us.  \n\nYou are not special, or in other words, you're as special as any of us. Everyone fails sometimes, even the best in the world, everyone can compare to another and think \"damn I wish I had that\". As long as you keep going, maybe some day you can make something amazing and be someone special for that moment - but that moment always fades, glory never lasts forever. Nobel prize winners will wake up one morning and dread plugging away at the next thing, wondering if they've lost their touch... point I'm making is you carry on going regardless, sprinting or crawling, that's the only way it all happens. No-one stops \"feeling like a failure\", not permanently. Don't stress the low points, and try to keep your mind clear so you can recognise when you've got the chance for brilliance and take it when it happens.  \n\nPersonally, and this is where the sub might disagree, my excitement and curiosity is all around the crazy progress being made in AI tech. Big changes are on the horizon, if you ask me, so try to stay flexible and see if you can take advantage of that in some way. The job market is bad for non-seniors right now, but we have no idea how it's going to shake out over the coming year or so. Stay alert, learn whatever you can, and hold on for the ride. Anyone telling you they *know* what's about to happen is lying, or foolish.  \n  \n\nTL;DR  \n - Finish your masters.  \n - If you can get a job, any job, great. Working for money is an experience just like learning a new tech.  \n - If you can't, try to survive. Everything is about to be turned upside down anyway (IMO).  \n - Nothing is forever. Falling behind and pulling back ahead again are natural in the rat race of life.  \n - Relax. As much as is possible. You're 22, you have many, many high points and low points ahead of you.  \n - Do your best and hope. This is also advice to literally every other person who reads this, and myself.",

The engineering world is in a bit of a strange place right now. With the rise of AI and a shaky global economy, tech jobs have become harder to find. But I do believe this will shift in time.\n\nOne big challenge is that many people involved in hiring aren’t developers themselves. They're often finance-driven decision-makers who don’t fully understand the nuances of engineering work. That can make things frustrating — especially when the hiring process includes unrealistic coding challenges that don't reflect real-world development.\n\nThese days, there’s a dangerous expectation that every dev needs to be \"elite.\" The truth is, tech moves fast, and everyone has different strengths. Some are more technical, others better at architecture or communication. The role of a developer is evolving — communication, collaboration, and adaptability are becoming just as important as coding skills. The era of working in isolation, coding for hours without interruption, is mostly gone.\n\nStill, there *will* be jobs. The industry is in transition, and once it stabilizes, opportunities will open up again. Try not to stress about being “mediocre” — imposter syndrome is incredibly common, even among experienced developers. I’ve been doing this for years and still feel it at times, but I’ve learned that most people do.\n\nAt the end of the day, software development is about solving problems and moving data — it doesn’t have to be overcomplicated. Many tools and frameworks have added unnecessary layers, but the core principles remain the same.\n\nSo hang in there. Keep learning, stay curious, and don’t compare yourself to others. Just focus on getting a little better each day — that’s how long, fulfilling careers are built.    \n\n  \nYes i chucked this into chat gpt to fix my terrible grammar.

Also LeetCode and that type of programming doesn't really translate to real world projects. The best way to get better is by doing simple projects at first, and add complexity over time. For instance, I used to be a trainer for cyber developers in the C programming language. We used to start them off by having them build a simple calculator. What they didn't know is that we weren't really grading how well they could add and subtract numbers, but rather how secure their code was. Can I break it, or exploit it in some way? Are they checking for underflow and overflow? After a couple failed submissions they would finally catch on and understand what they needed to do to pass the tests. Next would be FileCalc, which is okay do the same thing, but all the equations are stored in files, and I want you to give me a file of all the solutions. Again we'd test them by giving them bad files to see if they were doing proper error handling and such. Then there was ThreadCalc, which was okay now do everything using a thread pool. And NetCalc, okay now do ThreadCalc but over a network.\n\nIf they could do all of that we figured they had learned enough to be on the team and contribute. But it takes time. You do most of your learning through failing, not succeeding. So take everything you're doing right now and understand that it's hard and that's okay. Nobody should expect you to be able to contribute immediately unless you're experienced.\n\nAlso, we have quite a few west point grads, and they struggle as much as anyone would. So don't feel like you're going through it alone. It takes time to get good. A lot of it is about pattern recognition. Over time you'll start to see what are called \"code smells\" and you'll immediately see things that look weird and out of place, which means you're improving. If you can look at code you did 6 months ago and your immediate reaction is: \"this is garbage\", then that's a tell-tale sign you're improving. Good luck and don't sweat the small stuff.",

The idea was that you could write that in any text-editor you like, and then \"compile\" the source code to a binary program that could be run on its own.\n\nI use the past tense, because nowadays the differences are a lot more blurred - you can write programs in languages like Python and JavaScript inside spreadsheets (Google Sheets and Excel supports both, as far as I'm aware), or inside the browser, or custom applications, or you can write code on its own, but then execute it with a runtime. And often this runtime contains a virtual machine, and it is all very complicated, but you usually don't need to know - you just write your program in an IDE and then run it directly in the IDE while working on it, until you are done, and can run it from anywhere on the computer.\n\nI recommend getting started with Python - follow a tutorial to help you set everything up, and get something working. Then later on you can always experiment further with writing and running the program in different ways!",

Not to mention that maintaining a large Python codebase is quite hard, and poses many underlying challenges. It’s not all bad of course. You have Django, which is a powerhouse of a framework, making development of any backends very secure and reliable.\n\nGolang is very nice to use. Static typing makes it a lot easier to work with. Also, the performance is almost comparable to language like Rust and C++, especially considering how much easier it is to write good code in it. I personally quite like the community behind it. They seem to not like using too many dependencies, which alines with my personal preferences. Building a solid, thoroughly tested API in Go can be done exclusively using the standard library. It’s also very efficient. Small scale APIs and apps can run containerised on a few dozen megabytes of memory, which I imagine could be very good for freelancing, as it will lower  cloud bills for clients. Unfortunately there is no Django-styled batteries included framework in Go, which can make development of smaller projects harder.\n\nI’m also going to add one more suggestion - Java. Java and Spring Boot power huge systems worldwide reliably. Java has extremely rich tooling (I’d even say more so than Python). Also, it has been running literally on billions of devices for decades, making it pass the test of time with flying colours. Spring Boot is probably the best web framework to have ever used personally and is comparable and even more feature-full than Django. On top of that the language itself is quite easy and nice to work with.",

You have direct control of all the memory, and you don't pay for abstractions that you don't use. As a beginner programmer, you probably don't care about any of that unless your explicit goal is to use the language as a means to learn about what's going on at the hardware level. It sounds like you just want to build something cool. Languages like C# or python or javascript are much better suited to that purpose. Moreover, there is really no rule that you need to \"stick to a language\". Sure, if you're a professional with 10 YoE it makes sense to stick to your area of expertise, but besides that, you should feel free to oscillate between lots of languages whenever you want. Even single projects can combine multiple languages. You should think first about what you want to learn or build, and then work from there to what's a good language for that. You can learn the basics of a new language in like an hour, and you'll never truly master any language so don't even worry about that.",

What kind of job or project do you want to do?\n2. What skills or technologies are commonly used in that field?\n\nI'm not too confident when it comes to frameworks, so I won't go into that. But based on my personal experience, here are a few examples of different paths you could take. Still, I highly encourage you to do your own research and explore further:\n\n1. If you want to make video games, it's useful to learn C++ and C#, along with engines like Unreal Engine (C++) or Unity (C#). C++ is a lower-level language, which gives you more control over performance, but it's harder to learn. C# is widely used in Unity and also good for building desktop GUIs.\n2. If you'd like to make websites, you'll need HTML and CSS to structure and style web pages, and JavaScript to make them interactive.\n3. Lastly, if you want to work as a data scientist or in the AI field, Python is the go-to language. Learn libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and so on. SQL is also important for managing and querying databases.\n\nPython is considered a high-level language, meaning it's easier to write and read, but it's further from the hardware compared to languages like C or C++. This means you have less control over performance, and in some cases, Python can be slower when executing certain types of code. If you want to learn JavaScript know that there's a lot of memes because it works in a.. strange way 😂\n\nApart from this, you're surely making an excellent choice wanting to understand programming, I'm too \"at the beginning\", so this is everything I can give to you, hope I helped you brother!",

I absolutely don't want to make light of bullying but the fact that this is not the other way around is certainly a thing... \n\nTo be entirely honest the best advice I can really give you is, \"just allow yourself to get into it\". If you are just discovering it, the journey will take you somewhere. Lua is often used for modding games as I understand it, so you could maybe play around with some of that. There are frameworks for building web applications in Lua. You don't have to worry about it being \"basic\" for now, you are picking up the essential skills. \n\nMy personal 'prime directive' advice is simply, \"just pick something you would like to try to make and start trying to make it!\". When somebody crosses fields like this I always suggest mining their knowledge of their other field to see if there are any ideas you can think of that might be useful. It doesn't have to make you a billionaire, it doesn't have to even ever get used, it just needs to give you an idea to focus on, so you can use programming as a means to an end.... that's what you'll be expected to do if you work in the field and strangely it is also where you learn the most. It all happens while you are trying to figure out how to do something.",

When I was in college, for example, I wanted to take my flashcards on the go and I wanted to type them so I didn't have to carry a huge stack of notecards. So I made a really simple flashcard program. It was so dumb. No stored state, no git, no tests, no mobile app, no expectation that anyone else would use it. Just a program run in python idl. But! It solved my problem. And it gave me opportunities to practice. I stayed up late for so many exams because I would get distracted adding features and fixing bugs in my flashcard program. 😅 \n\nMy two cents, as a hiring manager, a good hire isn't just *smart*, they're passionate about solving problems and making things better or easier.

That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t also be reading up on design patterns, data structures, language details, and algorithms. It just means that you do need to put that stuff into practice. You need to make mistakes and learn from them. Write something bad, and then go back and refactor it now that you know better. It’s a slow, iterative process. \n\nYou should absolutely pick up source control, ideally, as you noted, git. You don’t need to be a wizard. Just get good enough that you’re not bricking your repo and losing progress all the time. Just absolute everyone uses it, and if they’re not, they’re still using source control, so the ideas are still good to know about. \n\nC++ can be tough for people. Between pointers, dependencies, templates, (Pre)Build Systems, and more, it’s not the easiest language. If it’s what you want to use though, you’ve really gotta just put your head down and learn enough to get cracking on some small to medium sized projects and get comfortable with some basic dependency management. \n\nJust in general, you’ll need to start thinking about writing code if your classes aren’t doing it. I was never a competitive programmer, nor did I do a ton of the puzzle or algorithm sites. My school was team project focused, and was self driven. So I was working on projects for 8 semesters. Often in between as well since they’d carry over. And I’d have side projects to learn a thing that I might bring back into the main project. I’d learn stuff alongside friends who were struggling with a topic over the summer (it’s how I started with the basics of Vulkan after it released in 2016, though, I’ve not evolved much beyond a beginner in graphics haha). \n\nI found projects worked for me. If you want something driven, give the puzzle and algorithm sites a try. But I think you should try to build out a few small projects that interest you. Even just writing scripts that automate a tedious task helps, it’s not uncommon for me to script up stuff like that at work, so those are good skills to have.",

If you can talk to working as a team through a SDLC with source control, testing, and promotion, it further goes to showing ordinary competence.",

        "body": "Each company will have its own way of conducting technical interviews, but here are a few guidelines that may help.\n\n* About 70% of the time, the whiteboard problem will be text-based, e.g. 'find the most common word in this string'. You are usually expected to work in your preferred programming language. You should ask questions to clarify the problem scope and any other unclear details. It is essential that you talk through your problem-solving steps, be very verbal, and don't stop talking while you are working. It is OK to start with a simple brute-force or partial solution, and then iterate to improve it. \n* Expect a mix of technical and behavioral questions. For example, 'talk about a time when you found yourself running out of time to complete a project'. Each behavior question should be treated as an opportunity to send a signal about yourself - You are smart, work well with others, take ownership, think deeply when solving problems, etc. Review the Amazon Leadership principles (there are 14 of them), and try to include at least one in every single behavior answer. \n* Technical interviews are a learned skill. You only get better by doing more interviews. The skills you need to pass the interview are completely different from what you will do on the job or what you learned in school.",

I had issues with fine motor control, basically it hurts to write.  The biggest issues with this is that my penmanship sucks, and I trained myself to get to the point quickly.  I would write just enough to get the point across.  This didn't help my English grade when I need to write a three page paper.  So I had to constantly go back and be more descriptive.  My family got a home PC and this helped, but I still needed to write out all my answers for tests.\n\n2. My short term memory was found to be lacking.  This frustrated my parents because if I wasn't actively listening to them when they told me to do something I would literally not remember what they said, or often not even remember we had a conversation.  Of course the way around this was they had to make sure they had my full attention before telling me to do something.\n\n3. There might have been other stuff, but I don't remember. \n\nLooking back on school, I did well in Math and Science where I would understand the concepts and apply them.  I did poorly in History and English where there is a lot of memorization.\n\nI am now the lead programming architect at my company.  If people have bugs they can't solve, they come to me.  If people don't know how to write something, they come to me.  If there is a bug anywhere in our code base, I can fix it, not because I remember exactly what that code does, but I understand how that code should work.\n\nWhen programming people start off learning the language, which is needed.  The only way you are going to remember the language is by using it, by writing programs. I \"know\" many many languages, I will learn a new one for fun to see if I like it better than whatever is currently my favorite, but if I don't program in a language for a month, I have to use google to refresh my memory.\n\nTruthfully, anyone can learn a programming language, but to really program you need to be able to think logically, you need to be able to break big problems down into smaller tasks, then break those smaller tasks into even smaller tasks.  You keep doing that until those tasks are small enough that you can logically perform them in a programming language....any programming language.  The language is just a way to tell the computer what it needs to do and there are many ways to do that.  Again the only way to get good at that, is to program.",

Programming is the one discipline where it’s actually encouraged to rely on the internet as much as you want since it would be impractical for us to remember every little detail about every language and library we use, and most programming languages and libraries have extensive documentation online.\n\nOnce you are past learning the fundamental structures of code (data types, variables, conditionals, loops, functions, etc.) everything you want to do with code is just a few well-constructed google searches away. Learning to code is as much about learning how to do efficient research as it is about learning actual coding.\n\nI will say, having short term memory just emphasizes the need for good coding practices even more, which many beginners tend to neglect. Good coding is all about foresight, and sacrificing time in the present to save you work in the future. Make sure you take the time to write yourself clear and helpful comments at every step of the way while coding and whenever you see multiple ways of writing some code, choose the way that is easiest to read; this will save you so much mental strain down the road. You should be able to tell generally what a piece of code does just by looking at it for a few seconds, even if it’s like you’ve never seen it before.\n\nYou’ll also learn there are ways of structuring your code such that you don’t have to remember how the whole system works all at once in order to understand one piece of it. This is actually one of the key tenets of object oriented design, often called “abstraction”. The better you learn to follow these design principles the easier of a time you will have coding bigger and bigger projects.",

You need all that as a basis for advanced learning.\n\nHowever, where it differs is in how programming is used. I come from the angle of a computer engineering and robotics/mechatronics dropout.\n\nIn CS you have a lot of focus on how to think about computation and the nature of the algorithm. Stuff like Big O / algorithmic efficiency, memory efficiency, information theory, a lot of Claude Shannon's foundational works, also cryptography. And of course, in the 4th year, operating systems, compilers, databases, consensus algorithms, network programming (which is a totally different kind of beast).\n\nIn contrast, in Engineering, you will not need any of those things I mentioned in the CS paragraph.\n\nComputation in engineering, from a mechanical engineering perspective, is more about modeling, simulating physical properties/materials, extremely large scale numerical simulations (I think only the theoretical and experimental physicists deal with larger numbers) (aside: IEEE floating point is a mind bender!). Almost all of mechanical engineering programming challenges are safety related, as in if the program crashes or miscalculates, people die and processes explode or buildings come down or bridges collapse. So there is a lot of focus on \"tried-and-true\" methods of programming - no \"seat of the pants\" stuff there.\n\nThe best C programming teacher I ever had was a mechanical engineer, and almost all of his programming experience comes from programming the feedback loop that controls a large scale blast furnace at smelters - the program uses measurements from various sensors, and then controls the smelting process. He drilled safety issues (error check, bounds check, input sanitisation, improper casting, huge possibility of improper pointer usage, saturation vs wraparound on overflow, pair programming, code review, using static analysis tools, etc) into every single lecture, because if the program crashes or miscalculates, thousands of litres of molten metal would spill and destroy the plant.\n\nSome of our homework assignments in C contain a magnitude more error checking and recovery code than actual executable code - of course this is not realistic for programming in the workforce, but his point of view is that no one else will teach defensive programming after we get out of his class, so might as well make us do it over and over again as homework until it's drilled into our brains. The evaluation criteria for this kind of assignment is him and the TA trying to hack/crash/exploit the program (for example, one easy trick is for them to give some unexpected inputs and seeing how your program deals with that, which is a basic form of fuzzing). They write up their report for you, and if you fix the issues they give the mark back.\n\n\nMechatronics folks usually deal with real-time circuitry and need to complete evaluation loops within a pre-determined amount of time. Think bipedal robots that need to respond when it is about to fall - how does a robot recover from that situation? Things like aerospace engineering also fall into this category: how does a programmer create a \"fly-by-wire\" airplane program so it can correct and adjust pitch/yaw/roll, etc. within time and physical limits.\n\n\nIn these use cases, recursion and dynamic memory allocation, both mainstays of CS oriented programming, is forbidden.\n\nSome Electrical Engineers programming to do DSP (digital signal processing) - where you take in a massive amount of data and you filter stuff out - DSP programming is kind of like creating filters and sieves out of computer programs - it sounds glamorous but it's actually quite a bit of grunt work. I think one of the exercises is like - take this huge sample of RF random noise and filter it until you can hear the satellite transmission downlink. It's like using programming to find needle in a haystack.\n\nI don't know what the chemical engineers need from their programmers, but I'd assume it's also about simulation, chaotic/stochastic processes.\n\nAs you can tell, Computer science is primarily concerned with the nature of computing, and engineers use programming to work with the real world.\n\nThe real world is incredibly messy and our math doesn't always work. That, added to the incredibly strict safety tolerances makes engineering programming a really niche job - I personally don't think you can be a great aeronautics real-time programmer and a good database programmer at the same time.\n\nAs for your last question: are you into physical processes (blowing things up, making lights turn on and off, melting aluminum and using a mold to cast wheels, etc) or are you into computing, calculating, storing and searching information?\n\nIt's perfectly ok to be into both - just keep in mind that there are these 2 \"ways of thinking\" when it comes to programming.\n\nThe last bit of info is that in the real workforce, we work in teams: everyone brings a bit of their own \"special sauce\" to the team and that's how everything in the world is built/done.\n\nEven though the \"lone programmer\" is a trope in TV/media, that almost never happens in real life.\n\nIf you become a programmer, you *will be working within a team* - so one of the most vital skills over everything else, is learning how to work with people who are different from you: they have different skillsets, different communication methods, may speak different languages, etc. That's probably the most critical skill out of everything: learning to work with other people.\n\nHope this little overview helps and good luck!",

However, VSCodeVim only unlocks the superpowers of navigating and editing the currently opened file with just a keyboard. You usually want to do more, like searching a file in the entire project or renaming a global variable. While all these things can indeed be perfectly accomplished with an IDE, it usually takes annoyingly complex shortcuts or clicks with the mouse. I am at this exact point now. I _feel_ the inefficiently compared to Vim. A month back, I would call someone that sunk tens of hour into building its own IDE a mad man. Now I am actually at least considering checking it out sometime in the near future.",

Neovim helps close that gap but Vim will always suffer from its decades of being a pure text editor.\n\nAlso, if you like using Vim mode in an IDE, you don’t know Vim well enough to justify using it. Vim is an imperative editor: you have to tell the computer how to manipulate text by gluing together small commands. Vim modes in other editors usually contain about 10% of Vim’s functionality. So if you like them, you don’t know enough Vim, and you should go learn the other 90%. IDEs on the other hand are declarative editors, you say “rename this file,” “extract this to a function,” “rename this reference across the codebase” and the IDE does it. No quickfix involved. ",

You could probably run it smoothly on a laptop from 2010.\n\n2) It's 100% in terminal. You don't even technically need a DE or WM to run it (lightweight)\n\n3) EVERYTHING works with keyboard only. (Yes, that's technically possible with the other IDEs, but they are not built for that and you can tell. Even if you have hotkeys for everything, switching focus to another panel can be a pain in the ass alone, when compared to neovim) Not just the code editing, but the file searching, project managing, git controls, probably even database access. I am pretty good with my IDE, but I must admit, switching to a different part of the project is more clunky than it would be in neovim with a correct setup)\n\n4) It's just fun to configure. I made my own cofiguration a few months ago. I never really use it, since I still prefer JetBrains IDEs myself, but I must admit, there are some features I am quite jealous of.",

I am unfamiliar with the word \"placement\", but it would probably help others if you mentioned you're from India so you get replies from those in India, otherwise, you tend to get an American or European perspective.\n\nI think it all depends on how well you know a programming language and DSA. There are two kinds of people (more than that, of course). There are those who want to learn a few key skills and be done with it, with a guarantee they won't have to learn anything more. I call this the \"barista\" type. You can't learn to make lattes and cappuccinos right away, but once you do, you're set. There's not a whole lot more to learn.\n\nThen, there are those that like to learn new things. It's this type that tends to do better as a programmer. \n\nI'm sure there are some jobs that don't require you to get past a certain point, e.g., there are still Cobol jobs and Cobol programmers, and that isn't changing so rapidly.  But for the most part, you'll likely have to learn something new. For example, I was programming in Java a lot, but if I were to do AI programming, I'd likely have to switch to Python.\n\nSorry there aren't any clear cut answers. If you ask \"If I do X, will Y happen\", the answer is, it depends on how you do X. That is, it depends on how much you master a programming language.\n\nTo delve into this just a bit deeper, there are two aspects to mastering a programming language.\n\nThe first has to do with learning the language, which means syntax/semantics of stuff like assignment statements, arrays, functions, classes, etc. It also means getting familiar with popular libraries. You may also have to learn a build tool. More recent languages tend to assume you're building a bigger program with multiple files.\n\nThe other part--and some would argue the more important part is to learn to think algorithmically. That is, how do you solve a problem. That part can depend on skills outside of programming. For example, if you are trying to trying to simulate gravity for a physics engine to be used in a video game, then you need to know some physics. You have to express the physics as code.\n\nJust because you program, you may lack the expertise in what the program is about. \n\nThen, there is a kind of vague goal of trying to organize your code well. I've been using Claude to help organize some of my personal projects and it does a pretty good job.",

The languages are just a neat abstraction to enable you to do complex data manipulation and DSA is the most efficient ways we know on how to store and process said data by efficiently using the underlying hardware. \n\nThat said to find a placement you’d ideally want to know ahead of time as to which industry you are interested in as all of them try to solve different issues and have different tooling to do so. \nI would also like to add that code is just a tool and your job primarily isn’t to write code but to be able to digest business requirements/problems and then turn them into solutions using software and hardware which makes knowing and understanding your industry of choice paramount.\n\nFor broad understanding I would highly recommend grounding your knowledge in lower level language like C/C++ (great for understanding the foundations of software) and a higher level language like python(useful for speed of delivery) as with this base you would be able to quickly and easily pick up any other language as needed.\n\nAll languages also have their own specific abstractions to make a specific problem easier like frameworks and libraries which is in itself is a rabbit hole, some devs only specialise in these for example, react, Django, Spring Boot, .Net core and so on.\n\nHere’s what stacks you’ll most likely find on the market:\nWeb dev Corporate = C#/Java, will stay like this for a long time due to how deeply embedded these ecosystems are in big corporations.\n\nWeb dev Startup = python/node.js, free and stable with immense community support great for quick development cycles and MVP builds\n\nSystems = C/C++ as most of the time you’d be working closer to hardware or require a lot of performance\n\nDevOps = shell and scripting, python YAML\n\nData = python/R and SQL",

To be comfortable in that language, start using it to solve DSA questions.\n\nAlso, be comfortable in one OOP language and another multi-paradigm language. So for your case, C++ and Python will do.\n\nFor DSAs, my advice is to pick Python because it's the easiest way to learn DSAs without worrying about the complexity of the language. When it comes to interviews, they will allow you to pick the language you are comfortable with. And Python will always be there as an option.\n\nIt's possible you just didn't like the web dev course by Harry. So try out another learning material. Or if nothing works, then it just means you don't like web dev.\n\nIn regards to the question in the post, if you can solve DSA questions, then you are halfway there. So many ask DSA questions in the interviews. So def get good at that. You should also get comfortable with OOP/OOD/design principles/SOLID patterns and other basic patterns. And work on some project that you are interested in. Use Git/GitHub to manage your project. Also, work on your behavioural interviews, use the STAR method: [https://www.vawizard.org/wiz-pdf/STAR\\_Method\\_Interviews.pdf](https://www.vawizard.org/wiz-pdf/STAR_Method_Interviews.pdf)",

Yes, they can't handle load, but you'll only have one client.) You'd use the localhost loopback to put the client and server on the same device. If it's OK to do everything in-browser, you could write everything in Brython and use standard HTML forms and JavaScript APIs. Making the client and server communicate is not that much harder. You'd do custom handlers. GUIs usually have at least two threads anyway, so you'll have to do something like this regardless. It might be slightly easier to install Bottle at that point, but the standard library can do it.\n\nThere's Gooey which automatically converts command-line applications into GUIs. It's pretty easy to use. That still has to be the workflow you want though.\n\nSince you're doing you a budget tracker, you could customize [PySpread](https://pyspread.gitlab.io/). Its a spreadsheet that's written in Python.\n\nThere are also Jupyter notebook libraries that can do interactive widgets in the browser.",

        "body": "I was in 9th grade in 1988 and loved programming, I wanted to be a programmer, but everyone talked about that in a few years, programmers wouldn't be necessary due to something called CASE-tools, where business-types could simply draw networks of rules in some fancy program, and that would then create the code needed. Programming jobs would only be for the handful of people making these CASE-tools.\n\nSo I went into hardware instead. And then the web happened, and all the CASE-tools for making mainframe business-programs were shoved to one side, because now everyone had to build something new. \n\nIn the late 90s everyone talked about programming being replaced by drawing UML-diagrams and then emailing them to India or other countries with cheaper labour, and they would then do the actual programming.\n\nThen languages like Python began to become popular, and everyone talked about programming not being just for programmers anymore, because now everyone could learn to program, and there would be no more need for dedicated programmers.\n\nThen a lot of low-code and no-code tools became popular, and everyone talked about that soon there wouldn't be more need for programmers.\n\nIn the late 2010s everyone began talking about how everything was already built, and in the future there wouldn't be more need for programmers, since most of the jobs would be simple adjustments to existing frameworks.\n\nAnd now, in the mid 2020s, everyone is talking about how in the future there won't be need for programmers, because some tool will handle everything for us.\n\n  \nThe problem with those tools, as amazing as they all are, is that they can only solve \"yesterdays problems\". As soon as some new technology, or a new business-problem, or a new oppertunity comes along, they aren't up to the job, and programmers have to step in.\n\nSo go ahead and focus on your interests - if you enjoy learning, programming, robotics, AI or whatever, you'll become good at it, and it will help you learn more stuff! Programming is always a good thing to learn - most of us won't work with the technologies we began learning on, but getting into the mindset of solving problems and building software, will always be a good thing! Even when the tech changes - only specific tech-knowledge becomes obsolete, but usually you use it to make learning the next thing easier!",

AI is also prone to hallucinations and many major companies, such as my current employer,  will not use it and are NOT sharing their code into AI as they want to protect their intellectual property. \n\n If your high school has a vocational program that includes computer programming, consider enrolling.

It also opened up embedded systems more which goes along with the robotics, which now in my final year of college ive been making an autonomous drone for detecting and spraying pesticides on different types of plants.\n\nOf course you can do this in python as well, but C and C++ add some layers of challenge and fun because you can actually do everything by register level programming which gets fun and writing drivers.\n\nAnyways, not to say my path is the one you should follow but I think really sinking your teeth into one or two fields will give you a different perspective and don’t hold back, go full throttle into it.

It's not important to make too much sense with the mini projects, as loNg as they are relatively quick and make iou exercise that new knowledge.\n\nI've been doing it this way and... well, while I'm not 'there' yet, I am improving.",

I never programmed again until 2017 when I actually saw programming potential in an artistic/design context I was studying at that time. And then it clicked. I devoured every online lesson or book I could find. And went deep.\n\nIt is so important to frame a goal or problem you wanna solve. Makes the journey more motivating.\n\nWanna get into AI, Cybersecurity or Automating stuff: Python\nWanna get into Web: JavaScript\nWanna get into Games: C# or C++\n\nIt really doesn't matter.

Keep it up!\n\nI think you have a great sense to organize code (it's referred to as \"clean code\"). If you keep programming, this will be a very useful skill, for all kinds of things that you will do.\n\nNowadays, you don't write CSS the way you did a few years ago. Nowadays, you have tools like TailwindCSS or frameworks like Bulma CSS. Also, JavaScript frameworks change the way you use CSS. E.g. Angular encapsulates CSS into components. That said, it is still perfectly fine to use \"vanilla CSS\".\n\nThere were opinions on how to structure CSS, but none has been really pervasive. There were also build steps like SASS or SCSS.\n\nI think your approach is perfectly fine. The only disadvantage I see is that your browser has to fetch each of those files individually, which is not the most efficient way. But it's not so problematic, either.\n\nDo you work already with the MDN docs? It's a great resource, e.g. [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn\\_web\\_development/Core/Styling\\_basics/Organizing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Organizing)",

Organizing your CSS into separate files like header.css, utilities.css, and modals.css can make your codebase more maintainable and easier to navigate, especially as your project grows. This modular approach is a common practice in web development.\nWhile it's true that having multiple CSS files can lead to additional HTTP requests, which might slightly affect load times, the trade-off is often worth it for the improved organization and maintainability. Many developers use build tools to combine and minify CSS files for production, mitigating performance concerns.\nYour project, “Obscuria Terminal,” sounds intriguing, and it's commendable that you're learning from your dad's notes. Keep experimenting and refining your workflow; you're on a solid path.",

That’s an option, but I think your approach is still better due to portability and forwards compatibility given your use case and the business intent I’m assuming from your post. \n\nA compressed file system is typically linked to its OS family and soft linked to its specific filesystem version. Every OS maintainer starts out with the intent to honor the contract of every feature of every filesystem they ever made, but they typically get sketchier and sketchier as the specific filesystem gets older and older. \n\nMeanwhile, zip and a few of its brethren have been portable across all operating systems for years and you can simply move a file from one machine on one os to another generally without any functionality issue. Zip also contains built in CRC protection in the file which although not the most modern has been sufficient since its creation. \n\nThe standard open source ‘zip/unzip’ available on Linux and macOS have long contained the same ‘test’ command that pkzip first introduced. Ie - unzip -t file.zip verifies all the CRCs of the files and the redundant copies of the metadata. \n\nIn actuality it’s probably just checking the metadata, decompressing all the files in memory and comparing them with the CRCs. That verifies the files without taking any additional file storage. \n\nSee if you can figure out how to directly trigger the ‘-t’ functionality via your library. Or alternatively just decompress them into the null device which accomplishes about the same. \n\nThere are still some theoretical gaps in the integrity of this system though. If the original zip run received bad data or the data was corrupted while in memory than the files in the zip will be corrupt even though they verify. You should definitely be doing this if you care enough on a machine with ECC ram. Disk errors at just the wrong time could also cause problems in the chain that go unnoticed. \n\nIn the ideal case you would have your own verifiable CRC produced at the very start of the chain where the source files were. Then you have something to check against anywhere in the chain without needing to go back and compare against the original files. \n\nFor example if you produced a sha256 hash of each file at the source machine you could then check against that hash anywhere in the chain.",

That way you can verify the integrity of the compressed file whenever it's transferred somewhere.\n\n\nIdeally your system works like this.\n\n\n1. System identifies project file to be archived on the working server\n2. System generates checksum for project file/folder\n4. System verifies the checksum against the project file (redundant check, just to be sure)\n5. System compresses project file into archive file\n6. System decompresses archive file into decompressed file\n7. System checks the decompressed file against the checksum to verify compression worked properly.

I did get pretty good with scripting languages though.\n\nFor the last few months I’ve been doing Boot.dev and it’s been a game changer. I’m learning many things I didn’t know before and feel like I’m pretty close to being able to transition. A CS degree isn’t always a requirement. A cert, bootcamp, or experience can be just as good.\n\nThe big issue for me, like you, will be taking a pay cut. As an IT Manager I make good money, so I’ll have to find the right thing. I don’t want to live in a major city, so that will hold me back as well. My plan is to create some side hustle things, easy things like a Secret Santa app to gain experience. Despite being somewhat worried, I’m still going to do it, and you should too. At your current salary level I couldn’t imagine you needing to take much of a pay cut either.",

Finish a boring project you can make, and train yourself to be discipline. Or you give yourself a challenging task where progress is slow, but you will learn a lot. No need to finish but learning is the goal.\n\nEither way go make a game...with (arbitrary) limitation.

Classes, modules, folders, packages, microservices, clusters are just different ways of organizing functions. The bad architect (let's call them John) looks towards options higher up in that list, when putting a bunch of files into a well-named folder would be just as clean.\n2. Functions with side-effects need special attention: A pure function will rarely cause scalability issues, a function that upserts into a database will. Learning to segregate side effects is a skill that takes a lifetime to learn, but it really helps if you don't have to use @Transcational 8 times during a HTTP request's execution. The other day I sped up a messy procedure by 500% just by moving all db lookups to one place and parallelizing them, John would have held architecture meetings for the next half year to make the service with 20 monthly users \"multi-instance ready\" instead of identifying the bottleneck.\n3. Bounded-everything. To know how much scale you need, know how many resources you need. That's easy when you write code that needs a fixed amount of RAM, or that runs in a fixed amount of time. John does `database.readAll()` until one day the server crashes, and he gets pat on the back when he fixes the issue after a two-day outage. (Turns out the service was not multi-instance ready and they all crashed)\n4. Distributed systems are HARD. People love to add microservices willy nilly because it looks cool in the diagrams, but just really try to avoid it. I usually play devils advocate for just making a big monolith. Stick to conway's law, that's fine, but NO JOHN WE DO NOT NEED 11 FUNCTION APPS WITH 300LOC EACH JUST BECAUSE YOU READ ABOUT THE ADAPTER PATTERN AND KAFKA IN SOME BOOK. Who is maintaining 11 CI/CD pipelines? Is it John? You bet it isn't",

You will get stuck and need help. If you don't have access to anyone who can help you in person, please plan on posting here on r/learnprogramming or other forums.\n\nIt's not that this will never happen with other languages, but in comparison if you wanted to try learning Python or web dev first, you could probably get a lot further without getting stuck.",

When you establish an initial contact, go over the following\n\n* Ask what they hope to get out of the tutoring? Are they primarily interested in learning concepts?\n* Inform them what you're willing to do for them\n* Inform them what you're not willing to do for them\n\nI can imagine two kinds of students that would want tutoring. First, there's those that are being forced to get a tutor because they are struggling. Maybe parents are pushing them. This can also work the other way where parents are trying to get their kids ahead. Second would be an older learner who just wants to get started. They are likely more motivated.\n\nThe difficulty in tutoring is whether students want you to do their homework for them, or do their projects for them. This is cheating. If you don't want to facilitate that, you should indicate that ahead of time.\n\nFor example, you can explain a scenario to the student where you say \"If you say to me 'I have to turn in this programming assignment by tomorrow, or I'll get a zero, and I've barely started!', I'm going to tell you, no, I don't do that. You should plan ahead on your assignments and not rely on me to do them for you.\"\n\nSetting expectations is something you should do.\n\nYou learn to teach as you go along, so what works for one student might not work for another.",

For a capstone project, you are trying to put together all the things you've learned to demonstrate that you understand what you're doing. I can guarantee you have yet to master your current technologies, and will still learn a ton over the course of completing your project.\n\n\nAs for your project, a lot of business software sucks because it was designed to meet a bunch of business needs. Reporting, oversight, all that jazz. But the one thing that gets neglected is the end user experience. In your case, that means the wait staff that uses the software dozens of times over the course of a shift.\n\n\nFocus on that workflow. Start there and constantly refine that workflow as you build out other aspects of the software. Use the software daily to do a bunch of fake transactions. Find the parts that annoy you and fix them. Make it as efficient and smooth as possible. Model user behavior and situations. Talk to real life wait staff and get input on what they hate about their current point of sale.\n\n\nDon't worry about making mistakes, they are inevitable. Trying to account for every possible situation from the beginning is how you end up with a bloated, unusable, over-engineered piece of garbage. You can always refactor, and arguably should refactor quite frequently, especially as you discover the real requirements for the software in early versions.",

You'll be better off with a low resolution - fewer pixels on the screen, but larger. That will make everything on the UI larger.\n\nIf you're using a laptop, I highly recommend getting an external monitor. It will be life-changing. And they're not expensive - a 10-year-old used monitor will work just fine. You don't need fancy, just physically large.\n\nNext, Jupyter Notebook has themes, here's a tutorial. A dark theme might work better for you, or just otherwise adjust the colors to your taste.\n\n[https://saturncloud.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-dark-mode-a-step-by-step-guide/](https://saturncloud.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-dark-mode-a-step-by-step-guide/)\n\nIf you're not doing mostly machine learning and working with numerical data and plots, you'll be better off with a tool like Visual Studio Code, which has amazing accessibility themes and features. It works great with both Python and Java.\n\nAlso check out the accessibility settings on your operating system, whether Windows or Mac - there are tons of features intended for people just like you.

There is always resistance to change because to implement change you have to convince a lot of people and also, the thing they're currently doing seems to be working.\n\nIt's also the case that at big companies, some parts of the business subsidize other parts. And the big tech firms are all kings of this. Google has a handful of products that make stupid amounts of money, and everything else is just for vanity or politics. If you're in one of those core teams, then there will be pressure to perform and also likely lots of scrutiny. And if you're far away from the money-makers your job is to make the pencil pushers who justify your pay cheque happy.\n\nBig companies I've worked at and have had colleagues work at also seem to prefer a lot more paperwork and documentation so that they can waterfall all the most cost sensitive parts of their business to offshore teams in countries with lower costs of living. This seems to make it more cost effective to build software, but also to protect all the IP.\n\nSome advice I was given is that as an individual at one of these organizations. You can barely see the tip of the iceberg. The culture, history, and trajectory of the part of the business you're in are all potentially decided by people far away. You're literally a cog in the wheel, and whether you fight it or go with it the business is doing exactly what it has planned to do.",

There's always been a bottleneck at juniors as juniors don't make money for companies, they cost money. Companies train juniors so that they can become seniors later and the number of seniors wont go down (causing senior salaries to spike), but now lots of companies are betting on AI becoming the new Seniors of the future so many have stopped investing in creating seniors out of juniors. I\"d say this is incredily short sighted, especially considering the limitations AI is still showing with complex architecture and languages/frameworks/libraries/etc that change more often then the AI models are updated. But I may be naive on that.\n\n>Will this subside, and is a CS degree becoming less worth it?\n\nDepends what happens with AI. Either it will wipe out most development jobs and we'll all be screwed, or it wont and we'll all keep working. There's no way to know because there's no way to know what the AI will be capable of next year, let alone five years down the road.\n\nIf I had to bet, I'd bet on it taking 5-10 years and then AI will be wiping out most jobs, and either societies will have some form of UBI, or societies will be devolving into violence and anger at the rich.\n\nCS degrees are already becoming worth less (not worthless) as our salaries are dropping over the past 3 years, but that doesn't mean people shouldn't learn CS, it's still a good job and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. Plus if you like programming, it's a great hobby that you can use to build things you want/like, or create entrepreneurial ventures with. If AI takes over, there wont be money in it, but there wont be money in almost  anything at that point, so you're best off still learning what you enjoy and hoping those in positions of power are smart enough to see the violence coming and giving people a basic living wage paid for by the AI and the rich, then we can spend our free time coding whatever we want for fun.",

Every ten or so people you add to an organization, the dynamic will change rapidly and you'll need to retune the operations. This is before the complexity of market strategy and building an MVP to sell.\n\nDo try organizing! But keep it small and sustainable. As an independent founder coming from layoffs, you probably don't have *any* meaningful \"runway\" to fail and bleed out money until the core business solidifies. In the mean time, while you're getting that set up, make sure you take on a boring job that pays the bills.

Just like with software engineering, this really depends on your company, team, and role. Furthermore, work hours are consistently brutal across the entire industry during tax season; expect 80-100 hours a week in the first quarter and 60+ during the extension period. My WLB as a SWE is significantly better than all the accountants I know.\n\nLastly, accounting is just as vulnerable to being replaced by AI as our own, which you probably don’t realize because you don’t spend time in those circles and/or they don’t complain about it as much as we do. Just do a quick Google search for AI accounting tools and look at how many results pop up.\n\nThe only thing accounting has on software engineering right now is stability, but if you want more stability for generally shittier pay there’s way better jobs for that.",

My solo income peaked at 10,000 monthly and combined income with wife already beat that number at early 30s. Sure you can say adjust inflation we’d still come short, but you get the picture.\n\nTheir interviews are definitely easier but also very deterministic. You don’t have X experience? You won’t ever get that job or straight up down leveled by 1 or 2. \n\nIn SWE if you are frontend developer you can still have a very decent shot at a fullstack/backend developer job. Don’t have FFANG? No one really cares, sure it gets you through recruiter better, but 99% of jobs don’t care.\n\nRemember that PM you dislike? Now just imagine it’s a client and they are intentionally being an asshole to get less hours counted for billing against them.\n\nAI proof?

They can wait your ass out.\n\nIs that fair? No, but that's how the court system works. The only hope you'd have is if you can find a lawyer that'll take your case pro-bono with an agreement that they get a majority portion of your settlement.\n\nBut the problem with that one small hope, is a lawyer doing that, is only going to do it in cases they think they can win.

That seems like an extremely arbitrary way to make that distinction, it's just a name. It's not a Professional Engineer license, or any sort of official, legal classification... it's a word.\n\nOnly explanation I can think of is do you have a BS? Or a BSE? Your friend who is pursing a Software Engingeering degree, are *they* getting a BS? or a BSE?\n\nThat *is* an official distinction, it's the type of degree you're getting. A Bachelor of Science vs a Bachelor of Science in Engineering, so maybe that explains it?\n\nComputer Science degrees can fall under either. My CS degree is a BSE for example, but you could get either at my school. If you got your CS degree through the liberal arts school, you'd get a BS. If you got it through the engineering school, you'd get a BSE. But the core program requirements were identical, there was just some minor differences in electives.\n\nIf that's the case, maybe you could consider pursuing an MSE?

        "body": "Speaking from a meta perspective, as someone who’s been working as an MLE for 3-4 years now. Companies want the perceived benefits of ML without investing into it. Their expectation vs reality is different. Obviously all executives think that throwing an LLM backend into a clean UI is sufficient for an AI-powered product, but it’s not. \n\nEven a “GPT wrapper” requires significant amount of information retrieval, validation, logging and operational signal collection, etc to not have generic AI slop polluting their product, data, and their image. Even if you don’t train an LLM from scratch (which is what most uninformed executives think ML is), there is significant overhead in solely serving the LLM for your specific use cases. That’s why AI startups, despite being ridiculous and “just a GPT wrapper” still have a legitimate case for a product. Those “other processes” are extremely nontrivial. Most companies are not even willing to invest into a “GPT wrapper”.\n\nNow consider something one step further upstream. Let’s say you want to train custom models (not necessarily LLM’s, but SSD’s, classifiers, methods of statistical inference, etc). Maybe you want to power a recommendation system or intelligent search, or you want to automate classification of support issues, etc. This requires ETL pipelines to take raw data and transform them. But this requires your web infrastructure to have instrumentation for real-time analytics and collection of usage behaviors. \n\nMy point is, delivering machine learning into product is an organizational effort. Starts from the top-down. That’s why the golden data trio of titles: machine learning engineer, data scientist, data engineer, will never be as prevalent as a SWE or analysts in numbers. You could have VERY knowledgeable and talented MLE, DS, DE, but if your org isn’t willing to be data driven from the top-down, these functions will not drive any value, to no fault of these people. A company not collecting data and expecting these functions to succeed is like telling a SWE to build software for a company, but not giving them any servers to deploy on or having no critical infrastructure: CI/CD, networking, security, etc. \n\nTLDR; The number of openings for MLE, DS, DE are low because most companies are unwilling to invest into data, and even less willing to invest into ML infra and the upkeep required for industry-specific R&D.",

The 4 hours is just a generous amount of time to complete it. At least that has been my experience with take home interview assignments. It’s not like 4 hours is enough to actually put together a system of any real significance.

Especially in the age of AI agents, this is becoming fairly routine.\n\nBut to your specific question, …\n\n> are people who have handled scale actually more skilled?\n\n… the answer is emphatically “yes”.\n\nAnyone can write a basic CRUD app that is functional, where “functional” simply means it doesn’t break. But to optimize an application for high throughput, low latency, and fault tolerance at large scale? That typically requires years of experience to understand the tradeoffs and foresee bottlenecks before they throttle you.\n\nDepending on your subfield, handling traffic at scale may also require not simply writing performant code but also using specialized tooling that you’d have no reason to learn at lower scale.\n\nSo yes, developing at scale requires significant skills beyond what your run-of-the-mill dev will bring to the table.",

The fact that you are getting on-sites makes me think it's going better for you than you may feel. A lot of people aren't getting call backs or past a first interview. \n\nI imagine the big issues is that you are probably going to be in a junior, or at best, a mid level development position and those are already rare nowadays. I can imagine it would be hard to land a senior position when you don't have proper dev experience. Is there a reason why you haven't tried to pivot to a team lead/management role already? I know that doesn't get you into development, but it could potentially be a smart career move for someone at your level of expertise. \n\nFrom the development side, I do work with someone who switched from sales to dev later in life ( like maybe mid 40s ). He did a bootcamp, but the thing that helped him start getting interviews was contributing to open source projects. They helped him have a commit history he could point to in github and show he was able to work with other developers and follow a bit of a process on a large scale project. He's great and brings a lot to our team and also has a lot of work experience that most of the team doesn't, which is a plus. \n\nI think the biggest issue is finding a team that matches your skillset.Starting out the best position is the one you can get, but you might be at a place in life where you can't take on just any job. You are probably making bigger considerations around time commitments, location, pay, ect.. which might be limiting you a bit. If you have flexibility on any of those, you might be able to expand your search and find something. \n\nAnother option could be to lean harder into your support experience. I'm in the process of transitioning a more support heavy development position. We will have a dedicated support team that will be fully focused on development support. I don't have any hiring capacity for this year unfortunately since it's a very new thing, but I'd be interested in candidates with a heavier support background. Most developers are not interested in doing support, especially when it's something they have to do with some frequency. They want to build and refine features. So, being the person who is both good and support and happy to do it could set you apart if you find the right position/company. \n\nWish I had even better advise. I think it's universally agreed on that getting the first development job is the hardest. One you land that, it'll still be hard, but maybe not as hard as the first time.",

        "body": "OK, take my perspective for what it is; I'm a non-FAANG SWE.\n\nI think it is *okay.*\n\nWill it help you land a job? Probably not (unless you're trying to break into game dev).\n\nWill it hurt you? Probably not.\n\nIt *could* tangentially help you by way of building skills you might otherwise not use and strengthening fundamentals like DS&A. Self learning is always a skill to keep as strong as possible, too.\n\nBut everything has an opportunity cost. What field do you want to work in? What stacks (if any)? I know you previously mentioned Java/Kotlin and Android dev. Something to consider is whether you want to work in that field, or if you are applying only because you feel strongest in it.\n\nGame dev is an entirely different beast. Personally, I'm into game dev myself because I learn almost exclusively from doing. I don't work in game dev. I don't publish games. I build them (and plenty of other things) to scratch that curiosity itch to learn while keeping it interesting (for example, I couldn't care less about yet another fucking library that's going viral that everyone is raving about in X language for Y framework--I'm not on the bleeding edge and it is not my niche).\n\nTL;DR: do it, if you're interested. The only downside is opportunity cost. Honestly ask yourself: what else would you be doing if not learning some game dev? Everything has an opportunity cost. Grinding leetcode has it. Learning tons of frameworks have it. But it doesn't hurt to spend a month on something to figure out if you're genuinely interested in it.\n\n  \nEdit: and you'll probably get lots of conflicting answers here. Were I interviewing you, I'd be **very** interested in your hypothetical game dev journey because of my own interest. Win some, lose some. It's a shitty market no matter what so find something to just keep you learning but not burned out.",

Research and apply to every internship you can find; I've noticed there isn't a huge internship grind among comp sci students. Building those connections and gaining experience is huge to finding a job. Also, have a wider view of your career expectations. There is a lot of work that doesn't fit the typical mold like service desk or support analyst jobs but can really help you connect with stakeholders and build management experience. In line with that and as general advice, make yourself flexible and don't feel like you can only focus on one aspect of the field.

While here, I've worked on a wide array of different projects, even though I started in an embedded systems role. Through multiple management decisions, my team and I have worked on many projects outside of our domain, to the point where it looks like I'm completely lying on my resume. When I began, I was working primarily in Android development where I would work in Java and some additional Python scripts for automation. Then I worked on another project where I was mainly doing Python and some PowerShell and Bash scripting. After that, I did Python for a while but got exposed to microservice architecture, and found myself working a whole lot with Docker, RabbitMQ, and various other technologies.\n\nAfterwards I pivoted again to a new project which was more web-centric, and found myself developing using Java Spring Boot for the backend, and React for our frontend.\n\nAnother pivot, and I spent quite some time doing Data Science/Analytics for numerous stakeholders; during this time I found myself writing numerous SQL queries, working a lot in Jupyter Notebook in Python, and also dabbling in Machine Learning.\n\nMy most recent pivot I've been working with Django to build a web service, and again working with microservice architecture, and doing a whole lot of database work again.\n\nMy transitions have been quite extreme over the last several years, going from embedded systems, to data science/ML, to web development, and so on. I feel the same way in the sense that I don't know if I have much of a specialization either, but it's nice to be able to learn so much!",

It took a few weeks of applying to many places to get a recruiter call request, and then about two months from there to get the offer letter.\n\nI worry that recruiters at larger companies might filter you out early on if they can’t easily map your experience to their open roles. If you have the chance to transfer internally, that might be your best shot.\n\nYou will most likely need to work on-site in some capacity. You might have to build toward a role that aligns with your interests. This is my third position, and the first that actually aligns with mine.

My department has 3 and then the number of devs we have is like 40. AI will trim the number of SWEs for many organizations, if it hasn’t already, NOT as dramatically as Infra was by virtualization and IaC, but there’s no lower level devs anymore in my org.

There are still many several traditional companies that don’t have a need for IaC like larger companies. This will also be downvoted, but a lot of SWEs really can’t do Infra work….. I’m just being honest. There’s a lot more than standing up servers, app services, etc. They’re definitely safe lmao.",

Alignment with the mission and vision of the company. In general if you are wrong but you are directionally aligned with what the company is trying to do, it’s hard to fault that person. Whereas if you come in with your own agenda and seem misaligned with those senior stakeholders, you are going to look like a goof no matter how smart your suggestion may be.\n\n3. Experience.

The nervousness we get when speaking infront of an audience, or talking to some \"higher up\", is because we don't view them as normal humans. The audience is a faceless, silent crowd that's intensely judging us. It's not a bunch of normal people just sitting in seats. The \"higher up\" is some intense figure looking for any reason to fire us. They're not a normal person who's just doing their job, no different from us.\n\nOur brains don't see these people as people. Even in your title, you're not referring to a person, you very intentionally used the word \"higher up\". That's what makes us nervous, what our imagined view of these people is.\n\nStart reminding yourself that these people are people.

Hopefully it's not a complete lie. \n\nEvery interviewer is different, but I'd like to think your current answer isn't a single deal-breaker, but maybe one issue among several. \n\nWe can debate if you want people who are more well-rounded individuals with better work-life balance vs people who are more \"passionate\" about work, but it ultimately boils down to who is interviewing you. It doesn't matter what some online collective decides. \n\nIt might also just be case that another candidate came off looking better for whatever reason. From a human perspective, it's great that you have balance, etc. But from a work perspective, there are likely people who will prefer someone who may bring more work value. I cringe a bit as I type that, but hopefully you get my point. A person's personality and values can certainly improve and add value to a company, but I was recently in some crunch mode on a project, and a few new devs decided they wanted work-life balance. It's good for them to set boundaries, but it can also make things more difficult. I'm trying to balance doing what's right vs what is sometimes practical.",

You have that half in spades, you definitely are working hard and maybe a bit too hard (5000 applications in 8 months is nuts, thats close to 160 applications daily without any breaks). The other half is working smart. When you are looking for a job, you are selling your particular skillset to the company. Do you reflect on the applications that you do send in or do you just mass apply? How are you proving to the companies that you are sending these applications that you are indeed the best candidate?\n\nI am not saying that all of this is your fault either, the job market is fucked, but you don't control the market and neither do I, I am simply saying the things that are in your control which should be the primary focus.\n\nFor the masters question, do you think it will lower your chances, raise your chances, or keep them the same? That is how I would make my decision. If you answer that you don't know then you should be asking yourself questions to find out. For example, if you are looking to hire a software engineer and you see 2 resumes that are identical except for the education section where one has a masters degree in computer science listed and one that has a boot camp degree that is listed, which one would you personally choose? Imo the answer is pretty clear there.\n\nYou have to remember I don't know you though, don't take what I am saying personally. I could go the route of telling you how unfair everything is and how I feel bad for you but that doesn't solve anything in relation to you having a job so I tried my best to instead challenge your process since its the only thing you control.",

The question is that if you never used these, you have no clue on how it works.\n\nIf at your job you use AWS, then try to solve these problems (or realize the shortcomings) with some tools that AWS provides (DynamoDb, SQS, etc). Then you can learn why Dynamodb might be a better option over Redis or something, even if you've never used Redis.\n\nIf you are not currently employed and are still a new grad looking for an entry position - usually system design isn't a part of the interview process because it's hard without on-field experience.",

One thing that might help is to start by reading up on some basic concepts like scaling, latency, and capacity planning. GeeksforGeeks has some great articles on these topics that can give you a solid foundation.\n\nAlso, try watching some system design interview prep videos on YouTube (e.g., System Design Primer or Cracking the Coding Interview). They cover a lot of the same ground as LeetCode problems but in a more theoretical sense. As for actual practice, start by trying to design a simple system like a blog comment section or a user authentication system - it'll help you get your feet wet with thinking through scalability and performance.\n\nIf you want to dive deeper, I've used an AI tool that listens to system design interview questions and suggests responses in real time. If you're interested, I can share it with you. Keep at it, and don't worry if it takes a few weeks or even months to get the hang of it - the more you practice, the better you'll understand these concepts!",

        "body": "I can empathise with you on some level. I'm also a SWE that works at big4 and constantly feel like i'm lost or not knowledgable enough. Early on, I also felt that I didn't get much mentorship and was just thrown into the deep end, asked to implement feature X, enhancement Y, or bugfix Z, in a huge codebase, with little guidance. Though, now I feel quite fortunate because I ended up learning a lot from those early experiences, a lot more than I think most devs early in their careers would.\n\nI also have felt the same way with AI, especially when it's crunch time and I need to really accelerate my output. Something that has helped me is treating it more like a search engine to find information I need, but I write the almost all the code myself. I really try to understand what it's telling me and will cross reference with other resources as well. This makes it so I really understand and know that I can backup the code I have written if i'm questioned during a PR. I also maintain a large personal document of just general CS concepts and fundementals; whenever I learn something new from AI (and confirmed it's correct), i'll add it to this document. So I kind of force myself to constantly learn and understand what i'm doing, while still reaping the benefit of AI.\n\nIf you have been doing alright so far and it sounds like you spend a lot of time trying to improve outside of work, I feel like your feeling of being totally lost may largely be imposter syndrome. Sure AI can generate a lot of code, but you would still be reading and understanding it to ensure it is applicable for your situation and actually works. So I think you probably know more than you think. I also believe that completely cutting AI out would not be beneficial in the long term, because using it is a skill in itself, and is likely to just continue to get more important.\n\n  \nOtherwise, it sounds like you're doing all the right things. Keep working on personal projects, use and learn technologies that interest you and that are in demand, and continue to challenge yourself with Leetcodes. You're still a grad (i'm assuming), you're not going to know everything straightaway and there will always be plenty more for you to learn. If you are serious about wanting to become a better engineer and focus on that, in time you will.",

        "body": "OP, listen to this advice. Don’t ask chat gpt how to write something for you. Try reading the documentation or looking at other code in the repo that does something similar and figure out why and how it works. After you write it, then ask chat gpt what it thinks or how it works but keep in mind it’s a probabilistic model so it could be wrong. Always double check with the documentation or look up articles by vetted sources that have written about the same piece of technology. It’ll give you way more insight.\n\nTechnology is a huge field and there are so many layers as well as tools. I remember being a fresh new grad and even though I learned about the different components in computer systems and how memory is evicted out of ram and how different networking protocols  handled communication. Getting my first internship all of that was so abstracted from me by the tools we were using that I felt like I had no idea why things were written the way they were or why we used certain tools.\n\nTake time to ask questions and learn the answers to those questions. Take notes and study them. Slowly it all starts coming together and years later you know exactly how the service or app you’re working on is leveraging the framework and language you’re using and working together with the os on the server or computer it runs on to do the things that it is doing. \n\nI will say this. I was overwhelmed at the beginning. I think most people are. I really enjoyed being able to build something by just writing some code. But it was extremely frustrating at times and sometimes I wondered if I was in the wrong profession. It took me finding out it was really rewarding knowing so much of how things worked to find passion in my career and stick with it.",

After all the big comapnies got rid of wfh, I've never had a friend struggle for a tech job in Seattle, atlanta, or the bay in the past year even with the recession or they were new grads.  \n\n##what does that mean for you?\nQA, Dev ops, web dev ( just be a freelancer at first to build your portfolio ) all of these can be found at entry level. The issue people don't wanna accept is that entry level **requires past experience** the same way an junior level doctor or lawyer requries past experience. \n\n##Examples\nLike for web dev, just do freelance contracts or programs like Dev for good. Not that hard to make a portfolio if you really liked it. \n\nFor ML, just work in a univeresity research lab; many of them are paid for every student they take on and your work gets published and used in industry. A lot will even take non-students (helping Columbia with their research actually landed me at Microsoft without an application)\n\nWanna do QA? Go to utest.com, get a few tests done and get paid for it and after 2 years you'd be overqualified for Jr roles. Don't even gotta apply just start and get paid like uber. \n\n##Bottom line\nIt's very doable, it's just not as \"easy\" as it was before. And believe it or not, most people for most well paid industries have to do this exact same thing.\n\nEdit: assuming you are willing to move to a tech hub... or at least apply to jobs with a address / PO box in a tech hub",

I write a resume that effectively communicates my experience in a very concise way meant to pull the reader in. I've never thought about keywords, I've never thought about metrics/impact/numbers, I've never thought about AI or ATS.\n\nA good resume is a good resume.\n\nIf you're not getting bites, you should be focusing on what's wrong with your resume, not how to get past \"filters\".\n\nSWE resume writing is actually a pretty well defined task. Our resumes are *technical documents*. And how to write a technical document is a full on field of study called Tech Comm. Many CS degrees have several tech comm courses in them. If you study what makes a good resume, by studying Tech Comm and what makes a good technical document, the interviews will follow. That's something that a lot of people overlook. And the rules of tech comm would *never* suggest you keyword spam to get around some AI.\n\nSo that's my advice. Learn what makes a resume good (without asking others for anecdotal advice). Don't operate on the assumption that your resume is already good and focus on trying to find some sort of other problem outside your control like AI or other resume filters.",

If anything you should want to transfer to computer engineering.\n\nYou should note that certificates are not certifications. Certificates are what you get when you finish random online tutorials. Certifications are from (paid) accredited institutions that (thanks to marketing) signal to employers you have a baseline knowledge of what you're applying for. As a college student, your best chance is through an internship. Cybersecurity jobs, at least the fun ones, are harder and much more scarce than SWE roles. Most companies do not need in-house cybersecurity roles, let alone of the offensive kind.  It's definitely not something you'd do instead of SWE if you just want money. The ROI is much less.\n\nAlso, for a lot of certifications,  they are priced with the intention that people's employers will pay for them. I've done an internship in a company that would spend >$2500 per course, per person, not even counting travel to workshops/conferences and in-person exams. Definitely not something a student should be trying to fund themselves.\n\nTry CMU's free website:\n\n[pwn.college](http://pwn.college)",

You probably won't be able to do it in 15 minutes the first time, but you can get there. \n\nStart by understanding the problem and thinking about a high level approach. Which data structures should you use and what algorithm will you use to process your data? Think of the space and time complexity and consider if you can improve that. It helps to write little notes. Only start coding *after* you have your entire solution mapped out. This process can help you identify any utility functions that you can stub out which will help prevent getting confused in a deeply nested loop. \n\nThis is how I practiced with LC, and I was able to finish all of my technicals with time to spare. I even had time to walk through the solution while writing down and updating the values for my variables and catch some bugs. This part is important for FAANG interviews and will likely get you a hire/strong hire decision. \n\nYou can get there with some good practice. You need to practice the correct way though.",

A perfect interview looks like a professor answering questions from students about a complex topic, the professor isn’t thinking through the topic in the moment, only explaining based on his previous understanding. \n\nHave enough practice to recognize the patterns and know the answers more intuitively and you shouldn’t have to go as deep into thought where you lose your ability to talk through it.

However, as I have been an interviewer myself, I know how unproductive this is and the impression this gives. I will therefore tell the interviewer directly: \"I prefer thinking in silence, but I will still do my best to give you an insight into my thought process\". \n\nThis helps me because I can now take a silence break whenever I feel like it without feeling bad about it. It helps the interviewer know what's going on because I have explicitly communicated it. \n\nOther than that, I believe a mindset shift is due here. Let me offer it: interviewer usually wants you to succeed. We want to get a new colleague and stop the interviews and just get back to our day to day job. Very rarely people will use the interview process to bully you and nitpick. And if they do, this is not a place I want to work at. I mean this. I have experienced this, laughed back at the interviewer and hung up the conversation after saying \"thanks, this was enough information for me\". \n\nSo, the more you communicate with the interviewer (who wants you to succeed), the more they will be able to help you out, throw you a bone here and there if you're struggling or outright tell you \"this is not what I am looking for\". When you start believing this person wants to help you, you'll naturally want to use this leverage. Definitely use it. \n\nA final piece of advice would be to ask a lot of questions yourself. Intelligent, directional, intentional questions. This gives you a lot more information to work with, which makes you more confident in what you're doing, which makes you calm down and be able to communicate. It additionally allows you to showcase your maturity while being on the \"offense\", so even if you have some hiccups during the coding, you give yourself better chances. \n\nHope this helps!\n\nFeel free to DM me as well, if you wanna chat more about it",

There’s SWE’s who work on infra, but that is generally not the same as people who only deal with infra. Infra SWEs usually write code for the platform to serve applications to utilize the infra, or they write custom CI/CD or maintenance logic (usually for large corps that use their own infra). At most places I’ve heard of, “cloud engineer” is closer to DevOps (instead of Jenkins or Circle CI, they would be dealing with cloud-native Kubernetes, Terraform, other types of cloud compute, etc) than it is a development role. Someone can correct me if I’m wrong or if they’ve had a different experience. But just speaking from my experience.",

If not then I would generally just focus elsewhere - Data Science doesn’t really work as a fallback plan or a 2nd option without a lot of school or a lot of experience. \n\nI wouldn’t consider internships unless they build significant skills or significant inroads at a company you want connections with. You’re trying to establish your career at this point so an internship is just a lower paid lower commitment job - it needs to offer enough to balance that out. \n\nThat leaves the 2 backend offers and the SRE job in consideration if you discard the Data Science role. SRE is a bit more specialized - you won’t build those skills incidentally, it needs to be intentional. It pays well and is in demand, so if you enjoy it it’s not a bad place to focus your efforts. Backend Engineering roles are good general roles and hard to fault, but they don’t build a specific specialty either. Nothing wrong with just building general experience to start though. \n\nId consider the SRE or DS roles if those fields specifically interest you. If a specific niche or field doesn’t feel right then just take a backend role and take the XP for a pivot later. I wouldn’t take the internship unless there’s a serious upside on the other side of it. Don’t take the opportunity for SRE or DS experience for granted though - it’s easier to get it early in your career. Later on you might have to contemplate a salary cut if you’re weighing mid / senior level vs having to step backwards to DS I. It’s hard to apply for DS II / Sr roles without experience in those roles, especially on a Bachelors, so the opportunity to get that experience is valuable if you have it (same for SRE).",
