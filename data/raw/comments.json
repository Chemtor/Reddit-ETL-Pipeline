Monte Carlo seems to dominate mindshare, but the market clearly needs more competition and innovation here.\n\nWe recently started experimenting with **Rakuten SixthSense** for end-to-end data observability especially liked their **dynamic data scoring, lineage across hybrid clouds, and cost observability**. \n\nSurprised it’s not on more radars yet, but I can see it gaining traction quickly given how critical observability is becoming for AI/ML workloads and compliance-heavy environments.\n\nIf anyone’s exploring this space, worth checking out their free tier: [sixthsense.rakuten.com/data-observability]() – would love to hear if others here have tried it.",

        "body": "Hey, [r/dataengineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/)! Hope you're having a good day.\n\nWe are excited to announce Sail 0.3. In this release, Sail preserves compatibility with Spark’s pre-existing interface while replacing its internals with a Rust-native execution engine, delivering significantly improved performance, resource efficiency, and runtime stability.\n\nAmong other advancements, Sail 0.3 adds support for Spark 4.0 while maintaining compatibility with Spark 3.5 and improves how Sail adapts to version changes in Spark’s behavior across versions. This means you can run Sail with the latest Spark features or keep your current production environment with confidence, knowing it’s built for long-term reliability and evolution alongside Spark.\n\n[https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-3/](https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-3/)\n\n# What is Sail?\n\nSail is an open-source computation framework that serves as a drop-in replacement for Apache Spark (SQL and DataFrame API) in both single-host and distributed settings. Built in Rust, Sail runs \\~4x faster than Spark while reducing hardware costs by 94%.\n\n# What’s New in Sail 0.3\n\n* **Compatibility** with Spark 4.0’s new `pyspark-client`, a lightweight Python-only client with no JARs, enabling faster integration and unlocking performance and cost efficiency.\n* **Changes in the installation command** now require explicitly installing the full PySpark 4.0 library (along with Spark Connect support) or the thin PySpark 4.0 client, offering greater flexibility and control, especially as Spark Connect adoption grows and variants of the client emerge.\n* **Automatic detection of PySpark version** in the Python environment adjusts Sail’s runtime behavior accordingly to handle internal changes, such as differences in UDF and UDTF serialization between Spark versions, ensuring that a single Sail library remains compatible across both versions.\n* **Automatic Python unit testing** on every pull request across Spark 3.5 and Spark 4.0 to track feature parity and avoid regressions.\n* **Faster object store performance,** reducing latency and improving throughput across cloud-native storage.\n* **New and improved documentation** with updated getting-started guides, architecture diagrams, and compatibility to help you get up and running with Sail and understand its parity with Spark.\n\n# Our Mission\n\nAt LakeSail, our mission is to unify batch processing, stream processing, and compute-intensive AI workloads, empowering users to handle modern data challenges with unprecedented speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. By integrating diverse workloads into a single framework, we enable the flexibility and scalability required to drive innovation and meet the demands of AI's global evolution.\n\n# Join the Slack Community\n\nThis release features contributions from several first-time contributors! We invite you to [join our community on Slack](https://www.launchpass.com/lakesail-community/free) and engage with the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/lakehq/sail). Whether you're just getting started with Sail, interested in contributing, or already running workloads, this is your space to learn, share knowledge, and help shape the future of distributed computing. We would love to connect with you!",

If you want to tear down data silos, you have to set and enforce standards of data quality. if you want to enforce these standards, you will have to change how a *lot* of people do things.\n\n\nI've only ever been in one organization where there was enough political capital to change how a lot of people do their day to day work and that was because the CEO ruled with an iron fist and wanted it done. \n\n\nThere was a 30 page monthly executive report that came from dozens of data silos. We started with accounting data, because it was the cleanest and slowly migrated the data silos into centralized database. If we met any resistance, we told them that if they wanted their data reflected in the monthly report, it had to come from the centralized database. Since the report was highly visible, they had to agree and after some initial growing pains (mostly historical data cleanup and arguments about what to name things), the automation and built in error-checking won people over. \n\n\nI've worked with a lot of organizations since then and most of them don't have the demand or the inter-departmental communication necessary to break down data silos. It sounds good in theory but if the marketing team only cares about marketing data and doesn't mind getting financial data a month late, then why go throught the considerable time and effort to build a third system to combine marketing and financial data? Especially if after the system is created, you have train people on how to use it, how to keep the data clean, and how to maintain the 3rd system. ",

I could do the fixes on the client-side and call it **backfill-dguid**, so the user is aware they are back-filling the field.\n\n**Edit:** For the DGUID I want to experiment with linking to Overture Maps, as they have boundaries on places/divisions. They have something called GERS \\[4\\] that I can link to, that is a stable ID throughout time. Look at the interactive table that I sent you, there's tons of data from outside of Canada, they just have no idea how to link it to statcan data.

Something like the NY taxi data is fine\n\n* Upload it to postgres in EC2, and Snowflake\n\n* Do some modeling and transformations with DBT, both postgres and snowflake\n\n* Orchestrate with Airflow\n\n* Package it in Docker and make sure it's easy to use and install and run everything from scratch with a few simple commands\n\n* Use Power BI or whatever to build a report\n\nThat's enough work for a month or more, mostly reasearching, reading documentation, and understanding how things work and get tied together.

AI/ML over media files is almost always highly parallelized specialized GPU-based compute.  That's expensive.  It makes sense to save the outputs or cache it.  Even retrieving the color would be cheaper to write out as an: image_url, color then re-compute on the fly.  This type of compute is very different from traditional database model of: retrieve off file system via index, store in memory and then compute over a set.  It assumes quick computation over a large set of small things.  Media files tend to be large.  They take up too much space in memory.  They can easily blow up a hard drive.  So it makes sense to store them on disk or blob storage.  It makes life a lot less complicated.",

Get comfortable packaging Python jobs in containers, wiring them into CI/CD, and writing tests with pytest; that’s the bridge from classic ETL to modern DE. Learn dbt for in-warehouse transforms so you can show you can model data the “analytics” way, and skim Spark only enough to talk partitioning and schema evolution-real heavy lifting there is less common than the hype suggests. Fivetran covers the boring ingestion so you can focus on orchestration; I’ve also kept DreamFactory in the mix when I need instant REST endpoints over old SQL Server tables. With that stack you can pitch yourself as a senior who happens to be deep on Microsoft rather than a mid-level up-skiller.

I personally like Docker even though more for DevOps but it’s great to know also maybe a little bit of Linux.

Yes orchestration like airflow and some knowledge of APIs. I believe you don’t have to be the super expert but knowing how these applications/services work would be a great benefit. Try to avoid buzzwords, HR/recruiter and new shiny tools every 5 mins there’s always going to be something new. Focus on your fundamentals and add databricks DBT? something solid be open and honest and think about what’s useful?

Both of them offer a free account for testing with limitations (Databricks daily limit, Snowflake also limited 30 day trial but you can create a new account later). Databricks notebook / compute environment is very similar to Fabric so that's what I'd recommend.\n\nAlso pandas isn't really appropriate for any of these environments as it not parallel compute optimised (the whole code ends up running on the driver node). You may end up working with some code some data scientist wrote in pandas but you likely shouldn't be writing it from scratch (although pyspark does have pandas api on spark which is mostly cross compatiable). All of these platforms have a variant of SQL and I've found data teams who migrate from on-prem to cloud tend to prefer using it as they're not as comfortable with python, but you could also familiarise yourself with pyspark which will be relevant for both Databricks and Fabric.\n\nFor loading data, I would get comfortable with e.g. using spark.read() for either append, overwrite or merge. Beyond reading CSV, look at reading/writing parquet and look at processing e.g. JSON files and handling semi-structured data operations (e.g. exploding on list elements) as you will often need to ingest from APIs with this structure and then flatten it for a reporting requirement.\n\nI would also familairise yourself with data platform design patterns, e.g. Databricks medallion architecture. In practice companies will implement it in different ways but it's worth getting comfortable with teminology and how it's generally applied:\n\nhttps://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture",

Indexed Views, Filtered Indexes, and Partitioning are some other out-of-the-box features that can help you with performance and data management as well.\n\nI say this as someone who ran OLTP and OLAP against the same SQL Server databases, that had tables which individually had 10s of billions of rows and multi-terabytes of data, on minimally provisioned hardware (8 GB of Memory and 4 CPUs), and most queries ran in sub-second time.",

        "body": "There's a lot of good questions here to unpack. I work in this area, so I can give you an overview.\n\n**What is real time? Is near-real time enough? (tldr; question)**\n\nThis is defined differently for different use cases and there isn't one definition for this. \n\nFor example, the definition of real-time is different for real-time operating systems (think RTOS) or high-freuquency trading (they literally measure cable lengths to minimize propagation delays) and other use cases. For data engineering, \"real-time\" rarely means milliseconds in my experience, but is very often seconds and even minutes, depending who in the org-chart you talk to. \n\nThat said, a lot of large-scale compute workloads we see often do end up in the milliseconds. The most common place I see those is in the security space, but their setups don't resemble a typical data engineering environment. Instead of CDC, Kafka, warehouses and ETL jobs, you will see transactional workloads, APIs, and processes directly talking to one another over HTTP.\n\n**Complex transformations (2)**\n\nIt's historically been pretty hard to pull off but that's changing. The foundational work/papers to do this at scale is fairly recent (I'd say, last 2-3 years), so it's not surprising you haven't seen off-the-shelf solutions here that live up to the promises.\n\nFundamentally, to compute in real-time, you need to be able to compute \"incrementally\". That is, update views over your data in real-time by only observing how the input tables \"change\" (inserts/updates/deletes). No batch engine (like the ones you mention, Trino, Spark etc) can achieve this, because they are designed from the ground up to recompute queries from scratch, which gets slower as the data size increases.\n\nFor an actual incremental engine, I encourage you to give [Feldera](https://github.com/feldera/feldera) a spin (disclaimer: I work there). It let's you define pipelines as tables and deeply nested views in SQL. When the tables \"change\" (get inserts/updates/deletes), the views are updated incrementally. The guarantee is that the amount of work a pipeline does is proportional to the size of the changes, not the size of the overall data. It's main strength is that it can do such incremental evaluation for **arbitrarily complex SQL, including recursion**, not just simple queries (as you seem to have noted about alternatives).\n\nWhat this means is that pipelines do so little work per event, that it routinely hits the millisecond timescales in real-world workloads (users have even reported 4ms latencies to keep views over terabytes of data, with low tens of milliseconds being more common). Of course, it depends on the queries, the arrival rates and what not. But we do see users run some beastly pipelines that update at sub-second speeds over billions of rows (think 10K line Spark SQL code, with 100s of joins, distincts, aggregates, and what not).\n\n**Infra bottlenecks and processing delays (1, 3)**\n\nYou are spot on here, but not due to actual hardware issues (modern hardware is ridiculously fast and if anything, most software and cloud infra sucks at taking advantage of them). NVMe storage and modern CPUs can pack quite the punch.\n\nWhen it comes to building real-time systems **end-to-end** however, you might still end up in the seconds to minutes range, even if the analytics/compute side is instanteous. This is because most data stores and plumbing infra aren't built for high volume real-time ingest (i.e., they cannot handle inserts/updates/deletes to data).\n\nFor example, if further downstream of Feldera, you want to serve the results off of something like Delta Lake, you have to incur the additional latency from having to run Delta Table merges before you can serve this data. We have (painfully) seen pipelines update complex views in milliseconds only for things like Delta Lake and Kafka to add another minute afterwards. There are of course ways to architect around it, but it does take a lot of custom systems work (see the security industry context I mentioned earlier).\n\n**Hype vs reality (5)**\n\nThere is a tremendous amount of hype and marketing here. Don't believe any vendor (including me :)) -- reality about this space is that it is quite nascent, and whether you can hit the right operating points around scale/latency/throughput does depend on your workload and the laws of computational complexity at play. Throw your worst queries and most challenging use cases at them before you make a decision, rather than believe any hype.",

        "body": "First, OP, your post reads like a marketing flyer with all the buzzwords. There are definite good practices for many needs but not a generic one size fits all. There are a list of things I would suggest,\n\n1. Stop calling it medallion architecture (it is a pet peeve of mine). The three tier design has been around for 35+ years. It was originally called staging, core and semantic layers. There are very few hard and fast rules around them; just generic guidelines.\n2. The best datawarehouses don't have any particular purpose (at least not until you hit the semantic layer). This is especially true of the core layer. It should be modeled around the business processes. As such, it only changes as often as the business does. Normally, this is not very often.\n3. Things happen in the processes between layers. It is not very often that things happen inside a layer.\n4. Staging is for landing data and, if desired, keeping the historical feed data. You should always have the original feed from the operational system so that you can trace your data back to it. The data warehouse is considered \"correct\" when it balances back to the system of record (SOR). If the SOR isn't right, you don't fix it in the DW, you fix it in the SOR and let the correction flow forward. When you change source data in the DW, you lose your chain of accountability. The Line of Businesses (LOB) or legal will tell you how long they want you to archive that stuff. Remember, they look at it differently than IT.\n5. The core layer is where data is kept that has been cleaned and adjusted to standard values. Different LOBs may have different abbreviations and meanings for data components. The processes to create and update the core data is where you adjust those to the standards. I tend to make my core layer in 3NF because it shows the proper relationships between the data parts without assigning specific purpose to the data. You make it fit for all purposes. This is where you also clean up things like addresses. (These can be a nightmare. Look at all of the ways Peachtree is used in Atlanta.) You also generalize things like customers, employees, vendors, etc. to generic terms like Party. You don't have to have the entire core flushed out before you use it. Just have the design as far as you can and flush the data out as project come along to fund it.\n6. The third layer, semantic, is where you put your data products, created from core, that the various LOBs need. When you create something like a star schema, you assign specific purpose to the data. It may or may not fit with other LOBs in the organization. Trying to reuse data products across various LOBs can be a tricky proposition and needs a bit of thought.\n7. Traditionally, you would only give access for users at the semantic layer. I tend to break this guideline. While still having appropriate security controls, I give users access to any layer they want. Data Scientists tend to like data a early and close to the operational data source as possible. I give them access to staging with the caveat to them the data is still abit of a mess. Regulatory reporting normally can wait a bit for the much cleaner data in the semantic layer. Those are just two examples.\n8. Don't ignore the other data parts like security, metadata, governance, etc. This is why you want to find an experience data architect to help you. Not a senior data engineer. They are not the same thing.",

Iceberg is designed for, as stated later, \"tens of petabytes of data\" and a few dozen bytes per write is utterly inconsequential. It is less than a rounding error. You may as well be complaining about the unnecessary weight of a heavy duty door on a mining truck - half a kilo isn't going to matter when you're carting 5 tons around.\n\nSo, from a *purely technical* perspective, yes it has a *slight* amount of redundant data, but in practice the difference wouldn't even be measurable.\n\n> \"Tables grow large by being written to, they grow really large by being written to frequently\"\n\nThis relates to a complaint about optimistic concurrency, and again it completely whiffs. I don't know where they got that quote from, but it doesn't inherently apply to the types of uses that iceberg would be used for. Each operation is for updating or inserting millions and billions of rows. We're not expecting to do *frequent* writes into iceberg, we're expecting to do *big* ones.\n\nHe follows up with...\n\n> Did I mention that 1000 commits/sec is a pathetic number if you are appending rows to table?\n\n... and if you'll excuse my language: Who *the fuck* is doing 1000 commits/sec for a use case where iceberg is even remotely relevant, that is completely fucking insane. You're not using iceberg for subsecond latency use cases, so just add 1 second of latency to the process and batch the writes, good god.\n\n> you need to support cross table transactions.\n\nNo, you don't *need* to, because the use case doesn't call for it. This isn't a transactional database where you need to commit a correlated update/insert to two tables at the same time to maintain operational consistency because this isn't the transactional store underpinning an application state as a system of record. Data warehouses can be altered and rebuilt as needed, and various constraints can be, and are, skipped to enable high throughput performance.\n\nIf you're ingesting customer data, account data, and a linking table of the two, you don't need a transaction to wrap all of that because you use your orchestrator to run the downstream pipelines dependent on the two after they've both updated.\n\n> This is extra problematic if you have a workload where you constantly trickle data into the Data Lake. ... For example, let us say you micro batch 10000 rows every second and that you have 100 clients doing that.\n\nWhy write every second? Why not batch writes up every minute? Why have each node do a separate metadata write, rather than having them write their raw data, then do a single metadata transaction for them? Why use Iceberg streaming inputs like this at all, when you can just dump to parquet -- it isn't like you're going to be doing updates at that speed, you can just do blind appends, and that means you don't strictly need versions.\n\nThe writer is just inventing problems by applying Iceberg to things you shouldn't apply it to. It doesn't wash the dishes either, but who cares that's not what it is for.\n\n> I am going to be generous and assume you only do this 12 hours per day. \n\nShould read as: I'm going to be a complete idiot and make the worst decision possible.\n\n---\n\nI'm done with this article, it is garbage, throw it away.",

Sometimes it is deemed useful enough to be shared, and then outside people will more or less abusively reuse them without the context for which they were made: not everyone work with FAANG-scale data warehouses. At the same time, those outsides usually don't have the possibility to rebuild tools from scratch to make them more refined than the original, like Duck Lake is doing. I think that's more than enough to explain inefficient data platforms without personal attacks.\n\nOverall, I agree Duck Lake's management of the file level metadata in a relational database is the way to go, and I think it will actually spread.",

This data could come from a Kafka queue or perhaps some web servers streaming in logs. This is a very common workload and the kind of pattern you need for big data and Data Lakes to make sense in the first place (if not, why didn't you just run a single PostgreSQL on a small EC2 instance?).\n\nTo be honest a lot of people have 'data lakehouses' that could be run out of traditional rdbms or clickhouse on a big server and the reason for that is fashion, but it does make a lot of these issues he mentions not ones that will come up for most practitioners, in the same way that people can rightly criticize transaction wraparound in postgresql but most people will never have 4 billion unvacuumed transactions to know it's even a thing.  So people running at high scale who have hit issues with iceberg may be tempted to look at ducklake or whatever but they aren't compelling to companies like mine who don't actually need a data lakehouse but have one anyway and don't feel the pain of any of these issues.\n\nIt's also kind of funny he complains about the bloat of a 1k avro file, my brother in christ that's a rounding error in s3.",

Hackerrank Advanced SQL and LeetCode’s harder DB questions are solid drills, but nothing matches shipping a mini warehouse: spin up Snowflake’s free tier, pipe data with dbt, visualize in Apache Superset, and wire alerting tests with dbt-expectations. I’ve used Superset and dbt Cloud, and DreamFactory slips in when I want a quick REST layer on top of my practice schemas so a small Flask front end can hammer them with real requests.

And you can't natively refresh only part of the Data, you either need to refresh all of it, or create duplicated code to simulate 'partitions' \n* become very resource consuming. At peak, our main mv refreshed 4 hours, during night. If I refresh it during the day it sometimes timesout because of lack of the resources (I put the same query in dbt and some how it managed resources much better)\n* it's easy to add just another column.

It's also not useful if the user wants frequent updates of the data during the day.\n\nWhenever running into performance issues, the first step is to analyze queries plans and optimize by indexing, partitioning etc. Another issue is typically that many visualization tools pull in everything at the lowest grain level (individual transactions) while 90% of the visuals only need aggregated data. So then create aggregates on the db and use these instead. Only query on the lowest detail level when the user drills down into a specific subset of data and then make sure the data is indexed or partitioned along the attributes on which the subset is filtered.",

PostgREST works fine as long as the query patterns are predictable; cache the common ones at Cloudflare edge with a long TTL so the box only sees cold misses. For uncached ad-hoc queries, set a hard timeout and ask clients to batch. If you really want to squeeze the VPS, move the Parquet layer to a Trino or DuckDB service and only ingest the hot partitions into Postgres nightly; that keeps storage and vacuum overhead low. I kicked the tires on Hasura and Postgraphile, but DreamFactory ended up easiest when I needed a quick autogen REST layer with per-key RBAC. Finally, measure disk random read before anything else-IOPS is what will bite you way before CPU or memory. Cheapest path is well-tuned Postgres plus aggressive caching.",

The most interesting times, in terms of learning and ability to contribute, have always been with either small companies, startups or small (relatively) independent project teams in large corps, where you get to do whatever it takes, when the assigned role is merely a title - what really matters is that progress is made and objectives are achieved. \n\nIn my experience it's best to focus on conceptual know-how and broad technical skills with your main ability being 3 things. \n\n1) listen to and deeply understand what people need, and what they mean by what they say. ask questions until you understand (with a drive to answer these questions yourself or by asking people if you can't).\n\n2) train yourself to be really good at problem solving, with whatever tools you have available. Do expand your toolset over time and if you can, but do not focus on the tool as such. Instead focus on solving the problem at hand with the tool(s) available, as effectively and efficiently as possible. Also keep in mind someone else will eventually pick up where you left off, so document what you've done in an accessible way.\n\n3) know and paint the bigger picture for yourself and others to understand more easily what is going on. This helps you to do a better job and explain what you are doing, but it also helps others to understand and match their skills to the task at hand. \n\nIf you focus on these 3 abilities, you can work in any company of any size. Your experience in some tools, like Databricks, counts of course, yet less so because you know the tool technically, more so because you know how to apply it to the above 3 abilities. Every new tool is just a means to and end. If you can master 1 tool, you can master another one, and another one after that.\n\nTrust yourself. You'll find the right opportunity. Hope this helps.",

I don't really recommend it for most use cases. \n\nConnections and editing in Grafana is a simpler experience but it has its own annoying quirks (the plotting UX is underwhelming and has weird data transform abstractions that I find myself fighting with rather than enjoying) and it's generally not as flexible as I would like it to be. I don't use any of the advanced alerting features. I'd like to, but I haven't figured them out yet. My favorite part of Grafana is the units and formatting support, it really is nice and convenient. It's not great, but it's better than superset.\n\nNiFi gets a lot of hate, but I am a firm believer in \"there's a time and place for every tool\". The time and place that NiFi was developed for was the NSA. A lot of the stuff that it was good at was classified and got dropped when it was published. Now, Nifi is good for moving data around from point to point, not data transformations. You'll want something else for more advanced data transformation, such as something with real scripting language support (nifi's code editor sucks ass. Basic user interface tasks are also hidden behind different context menus and it's a pain to use, generally. The JOLT processor advanced interface is pretty good though). It is however an okay tool for setting up long-running batch processing jobs from your database to something else where you want to have visual feedback. I set up a number of web scraping flows with it (not really a good use case) and I'm looking to migrate to something that sucks less.\n\nDagster and Airflow are the NiFi alternatives you'll want to consider. I have used Airflow in the past, and am considering moving some of my existing data transformations to Airflow.\n\nI have no complaints about Postgres. Postgres owns.",

They can also update a CRM through its API endpoints, but that's not too different from doing so in any other CRUD apps, and your average analyst won't have the necessary permissions nor skill to handle authentication to use those endpoints.\n\nIn a larger context, the unmet need this feature is trying to solve is a common one: analysts often get asked if they can add some kind of write-back to their reports, such as documenting decisions, comments, events.

Its a simple and reliable setup that works well for most common data sources.\n\nIf come across cases where the source needs more customization or a different approach, you can handle those separately using Airflow.\n\nWhile this setup is running, it’s a good time to step back and explore what tools and designs best match your longterm use cases،، before fully committing to a specific stack.",

I would recommend checking out the dbt sql server connector. It is a community project but it has been serving us well enough so far, the eventual goal for us is to move to an OLAP platform and this should make the process more seamless.",

This is perfect for insert-only scenarios, but god-awful for SCD2 tables where you need to update IsCurrent=0 and IsCurrent=1 (or IsDeleted).\n\nMedallion lends itself well, you keep the SCD2 tables in bronze & (some edge cases) in silver, OLTP, and gold is columnstore index.\n\nIf done well, porting to Snowflake from MS SQL can be relatively painless.

        "body": "Hey!\n\nFirst, sorry to hear that. Startups are tricky to get into and until you have been working for a bit, it’s hard to know the right questions to ask to avoid coming in too early.\n\nRegarding what you should do next, I would advise against freelancing. Most companies don’t want to hire freelancers with 10 years of experience as they can simply go with a boutique consulting company. I’m not saying it is impossible, but it is a steep hill to climb and it also sounds like you could benefit working in a team environment and learning from more experienced engineers.\n\nThe top 4 things that will help get the average data engineering job are the following (in this order):\n\n1. SQL\n2. Python\n3. Shell scripting (aka bash)\n4. Data modeling (i.e. fact and dimensional modeling)\n\nOnce you get a good grasp of these, then you layer on whatever are the current popular tech stack tools/platforms like the following (no order):\n\n1. Clouding computing (AWS/Azure) - sounds like you are already good here.\n2. dbt \n3. Snowflake/Databricks\n4. Orchestration (Airflow or Dagster)\n5. Extract Load tools (dltHub, Airbyte, etc.)\n\nThese are going to be your most common tools. While there are things like Spark, Trino, Kafka, etc., not all companies use them so there is limited value in focusing on them.\n\nNext, I’d also pick up good software development tools like:\n\n1. Docker\n2. source control (GitHub)\n3. CI/CD (GitHub Actions)\n4. Infrastructure as Code (i.e. terraform)\n\nThis is quite a bit and I suggest starting at the top of my post and slowly working down. Next, while you can apply to jobs, the entry job market is very strained right now. You need to start networking, ideally in person but if that isn’t feasible then you need to seek out online networking.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any questions.",

This is tough for me personally as an introvert and something I just had to practice over time. I have found this is the best way to just organically grow your network.\n\nNeither of these approaches are quick as it takes quite a bit of time to build a network and get to the point you connect with someone looking to hire.\n\nI also recommend starting to post on LinkedIn. Doesn’t have to be clickbait, but just show some activity. Regardless of how folks feel about LinkedIn, it is widely used and being active on it helps give you visibility. One thing I recommend to folks is as they are learning/working on things, simply post to LinkedIn.",

Feed each block into Splink on Spark; its probabilistic model scales to tens of millions and gives you match weights you can tune without coding pairwise comparisons. If you prefer Python only, Dedupe works well with DuckDB temp tables. Once confident, cluster records, assign a surrogate\\_id, and push that map back to the source tables so future loads are incremental, not full re-dedupes. Use dbt for the cleaning/merging models and git+CI to enforce code review and documentation so the offshore mess doesn’t return.

Methods for measuring and monitoring data quality. Example: routinely sample N records, analysts inspect and flag any incorrect matches and then produce a % accurate metric.\n2. A process for what happens when there are exceptions (if needed). Example: a defined process for analysts to input overrides in particular cases.\n3. Understand the risks when there are exceptions.

The real issue isn't the approach - it's probably the implementation quality given what you've described.\n\nFor the technical side - before you rebuild everything, try profiling the current pipeline to see where the actual bottlenecks are. Sometimes these \"bad\" codebases have one or two critical performance issues that, once fixed, buy you time to do a proper rewrite. We've seen 10x improvements just from fixing obvious stuff like loading data multiple times or running queries in loops.\n\nFor entity resolution at your scale, you might want to look into:\n\n\\- Splink (open source, handles blocking and matching pretty well)\n\n\\- RecordLinkage library if you're in Python\n\n\\- Even AWS Entity Resolution if you're cloud-native\n\nThe blocking strategy is solid but the devil's in the details.

However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it gives you more control and flexibility over the data pipeline.\n\nYou can use a secondary pipeline (could be DBT or custom scripts) to filter and push only the relevant client data to their lake. This gives you the ability to implement data governance, ensure data quality, and maintain audit trails. Plus, you'll have the flexibility to serve multiple clients from the same source without cross contamination.\n\nYou can implement client specific transformations, add data validation layers, and set up automated monitoring to ensure data freshness and accuracy. The slight complexity of the process pays dividends in maintainability and scalability, especially if you plan to onboard more clients with similar requirements. Also consider if your client has other data sources they'd want integrated, platforms like Windsor.ai excel at selective data extraction from multiple channels with proper tenant isolation, which could create a more comprehensive analytics ecosystem alongside your survey insights.",

People can be dicks about \\`minimum reproducible examples\\`, but this is a good example why.\n\nYour question boils down to \"How do I update and filter data?\" The answer is you build new dataframes and join them. You use a group by or windows to only keep the max value, maybe before the join maybe after. This approach scales much further than most people realize, especially with polars.\n\nDoing it this way prevents all the headaches and footguns that come with manually updating slices of pandas dataframes.\n\nIf group bys and joins sound scary or complex, then you're missing the fundamental concepts of data manipulation, and I would strongly recommend brushing up on them.",

I absolutely do think this sort of change, like details of a publication, should be part of a CI pipeline, using one of the tools for managing database migrations. Flyway is one I've used with success in the past, lately I found pgroll (https://github.com/xataio/pgroll) and its innovative take very interesting, I don't have hands-on experience with it, though. Postgres can be started up very quickly in a container (it's what we're using for testing Debezium itself, too), so this can easily happen for tests on CI, too.\n\nOn the aspect of changes to a publication and thus a CDC event stream changing its schema, that's a very large topic by itself. In general, the team owning an application and its database should also be in charge of its change event streams and their schemas, evolving them with compatibility in mind, ideally implementing the idea of \"Data Products\", i.e. consciously designed data streams with a well-defined, documented, and stable contract. Stream processing with tools like Flink can be one way for shielding consumers from the impact of upstream schema changes.",

Ramp up on model evaluation, Docker, and CI before worrying about deep-learning theory. Your Snowflake time still counts-fast queries and cost tuning matter when a model calls for thousands of feature lookups per hour.

Pretty sure [continue.dev](http://continue.dev) is producing chunks of like 2 or 3 lines from the doc files.  It performs better if I use DIFY and force just a 1024 char chunk, with 100 char overlap, but even that tends to return the docs header boilerplate fragments, and not specific code that examples or describes the thing I'm asking about.  This may just be a hard use case, where you want to ask \"how do I use this cli tool to build xyz\", and have it not return \"to use cli tool for xyz do the following...\" but instead, grab the example code and list of command line options.   \n\nProbably would be better on a big organization SOP that had clear things like \"policy on internal document encryption is this and that\".  In a nice clean paragraph.  \n\nAnyways, thanks for the tip, I learned something.",

The business just don't think in terms of \"I need this report to be a 12 month rolling average that can be sliced by location and drills through to existing reporting with colour coding\", and they shouldn't need to.\n\n\nThe communication gap comes from business users having clear understandings of the problem but can't (and shouldn't) be able to solution specifics. But at the same time centralise BI or engineering teams sit outside the business and, having been burned by getting blamed before, want to push the risk and design back to the business as much as possible.\n\n\nSo pretty much every place I've worked has done kind of communications barrier between technical and business but when you get right into it, it's really more about the data side being unwilling or unable to think about the business process and do effective blue sky thinking about how to leverage their talents against a shared problem and pushing the business to become data designers instead and come to them with a spec.\n\n\nI reckon there's definitely some value to be had by getting an AI in the loop somewhere to help translating, but I don't think it attacks the core of why people always have this problem and the model you've described sounds like it's trying to remove the need for data development to understand the business world and problems. I think generally the opposite should hold, which is that data teams who want to only do the tech and not the people work are the problem.\n\n\nNot the worst example of a shitty pitch for yet another data AI tool startup hustle in that you've picked a good problem area, and there'd be an audience for it, but personally I'd give a hard pass to anything selling me the idea that the people problem of business/tech culture clash can be solved with a tech product.",

I’ve had had some success and made a lot of duds when testing and deploying AI/LLM solutions for non or semi-technical SMEs in enterprise orgs, so when I read your idea, I recall a lot of those learnings.\n\nTo me, the communication gap you are looking at is the like, 20% problem that requires 80% of the effort to solve. It’s one of those permutative problems that when solved destroys agility and flexibility of organizations and when pushed all the way in the other direction of giving everyone free reign and no direction can make other orgs look like a barrel of monkeys. \n\nSo all that preface is to say tools that presuppose that you will be able to solve knowledge transfer between more than like 3 layers of a business of how information passes through competency layers (ex in my prev. comment) is a cursed problem. \n\nBecause of that, I see problems with a tool that suggests that a Director can cross 5+ competence layers and genuinely get what they need, because to be completely clear: While data is served at a wide scale to many ICs and SMEs, the general purpose of all data is to help teams inform leaders, because all of that data is meant for those teams to make better decisions, and to then show data of improvement to the leaders. So for a tool to cut across all of this and save money or time or both, you would need to create a tool that solve all of these layers based off of a leader level prompt, which is really hard to do, and I think cost/success% wise outside of scope of existing tech. \n\nWhat I personally see as the clear line path for llm products are places where you can extend a sme 50% of the way in the direction of a couple of other domains that require proficiency and time spent learning. Tools that can take a great manager with ok tech chops, and solve the little simple ad-hoc tasks that you would originally bog down report devs / automation analysts in excel, idk the examples arent always great they are niche and reveal themselves through iteration. \n\nI think that smart LLM practitioners will not try to replace the human in the middle, not because its the right thing to do, but because its the financially prudent and performant thing to do, and they will support SMEs to become more proficient in adjacent domains. More so, at least, than was previously possible or expectable in the past. That will help solve the communication gap (a bit) in these orgs that prevent end to end technical implementations today.\n\nSorry if this was too long! It’s a really interesting topic. I think good historical cues to take are to look at how no-code / low-code tools have started, been hyped, and where they ended up. Sometimes they do pretty good (Power Automate, Zapier), but they never have a “playing field levelling effect” across all layers of an org. Rn a Director could use Power Automate to already pull and transform their own data, but they won’t. \n\nNot to say those loops can’t get better and more accessible, that does seem to be a good use case for LLMs, I just think that it will more often than not require that someone knows something about the field they are using an LLM solution for, even if its an adjacent one (which is the more practical value prop of AI except for OpenAI who get to be the core chatbot, lucky them).",

Which YouTube videos are you watching? There's so much stuff, it's hard to pick. \n\nThere's even a bit of procrastination. Some lay out plans that will take years to complete which means it won't get done. They will add an intro programming courses, maybe discrete math, maybe SQL, maybe operating systems. The fact is, most people never get much past the first course. \n\nLesson: you don't have to plan that far ahead\n\n**Hard to make progress**\n\nIt's tough to motivate yourself. For a handful of people, learning to program is (kind of) fun. For others, it's boring (yet, not easy). You have to learn syntax, e.g., a for-loop in C. You have to learn what you can do with that syntax, e.g., iterate through arrays.\n\n**You fail to learn control flow properly**\n\nIf you're learning a procedure language, or a language that has procedural aspects, like Python, it becomes useful to emulate the computer, going one step at a time. You want to know what happens at every step. This low-level approach helps you understand how your program behaves.\n\nThe human mind often skips steps, making assumptions about what stuff does. This is where it's helpful to learn a debugger, or do the poor man's equivalent and print \"debug\" statements.\n\n**There's not a lot of material on debugging**\n\nAs a beginner, you're likely to write buggy code, ie, code that has mistakes. Fixing those bugs means determining *what* caused the bug, i.e., identifying the bug. Then, *fixing* the bug.\n\nFor as much time as a beginner spends learning material, surprisingly little covers debugging.\n\n**There's a lot of advice**\n\nPerhaps the most common one is \"build projects\". Here's the thinking behind that approach. Beginners sometimes learn from tutorials. However, many tutorials are too advanced for beginners. Worse than that, they tell you *what* to do, but not *why*.\n\nYou might wonder why they don't explain things. After all, don't learners want to learn? Here's the problem. How do you know how much the person watching your tutorial knows? If you can barely program, then you'll spend time talking about programming basics, and the part about building what you're building is now a fraction of the tutorial.\n\nEven if you know programming basics, it's still not enough. For example, you might be following a tutorial on React (not recommended for beginners). It will tell you to do this and that for React, but not the *design* of React. What was the philosophy behind React? Why does it look the way it does (i.e., why Javascript)? Explaining how React does stuff takes time, and tutorials predominantly skip over it, and jump into using it. \n\nThese tutorials fail to show you the big picture. Instead, you're in the weeds (stuck in the minute details).\n\nSome beginners begin jumping from one tutorial to another, building stuff, but not understanding what they are building nor how to change what they are building.\n\nThis leads to the common advice *build a project*. \n\nHere's my beef with that approach. You need to learn basics first. You need to learn basic syntax, control flow. You need a mental model of what the computer is doing. You need basic debugging skills. You need to do small exercises to help you learn, say, for-loops.\n\nThat part, to many, is boring. \n\nThe other complaint I have is you're asked \"find something you're passionate about\". Most beginners have a hard time identifying what they want to build, or they want to build something far too sophisticated, like a 3D game. They struggle with coding tic-tac-toe, and that's far too boring to be fun.\n\nThe analogy I typically give is learning a foreign language. There are two popular approaches. The academic approach teaches it like an English teacher teaches English, i.e., it's about grammar. The other approach is to learn phrases. The second way is meant to avoid long hours of learning a language's grammar so you can take a vacation somewhere and get by with little knowledge of the language.\n\nI liken the second approach to building a project. It only works if the following happen: you have a reasonable sized project (can be hard), you figure out what you need (also, can be hard), you find what you need (also hard). The driving motivation is you're building something you can use. A programming exercise doesn't do that, but I feel it's a necessary prerequisite.\n\nStill, some can manage to learn enough of a language by searching for what they need. But the part they leave out is how they search for what they need. They tell you to build a project, but then no one ever shows you how they build the project. I suspect if they showed the steps, a beginner would say \"but how did you know to do that?\". It requires search skills (or you could capitulate and let the LLM do all the work, but then you're not really learning).\n\n**Staying motivated**\n\nMany beginners burn out. Or they procrastinate and play video games (or something else) or they have family issues that require their time. With no one to motivate you but yourself, many quit after a month or two. It's not fun. It's not easy. The concepts are too hard. It seems like it will take forever to do something simple. There's so much material out there.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nMany things contribute to self-teaching being a challenge.",

I particular like that you didn't fall into the trap that I see a lot of new programmers fall into where they list out _every_ possibility in 9 separate different `if` branches.

If you have a check to see if user loses, and a check to see if user ties, and _neither of those passes_, then the user can _only_ have won!\n\nHave you heard of something called a Python Dictionary? It looks a little something like this:\n\n```\nmy_dict = { some_property: 'some value' }\n```\n\nThe cool part is that you can access properties in that dictionary just like in an array: `printf(f\" {my_dict[some_property]}\") # \"some value\"`. If you make a dictionary of one of the non-tie options (i.e., either win or lose), can you think of a way to make the logic of your RPS even simpler?",

Syntax is not as complicated once you learn it. I think the key is small problems, not projects. Something like a small math simulation.  My favorite was modelling the \"sick hobbits\" problem: \"There are 1000 hobbits on an island. X hobbits begin 'sick'. Each day, any healthy hobbit travels to visit another hobbit. If a healthy hobbit visits a sick hobbit, the healthy hobbit becomes sick. At the end of the day, all sick hobbits are removed. On average, how many hobbits will become sick? On average, how long will the contagion last, how many days?\"\n\nOnce implemented, then vary it up by changing how many hobbits are visited per day, how long the sick hobbits stay around (maybe more than one day). This type of problem is good for learning because the code for it is just a page or two.\n\nBuilding programs into projects is another skill in of itself. To do projects, you need to start worrying about system design, modularity, testing, and more advanced debugging. So, start with something a lot smaller so you can get syntax, data structures, and control flow statements down. Then move on to larger projects where you'll then need to train additional skills. The issue with projects is that you're being forced to learn too much all at once, I suspect a person would feel completely lost.\n\nI'll hate to mention, but the 'easy' leetcode problems are generally good for learning programming language syntax and basics (again, the basics are syntax, control flow, and data structures). I busted leetcode out recently to help learn Python. I don't think leetcode easy problems are necessarily the best or the most interesting; but if you can't find or come up with similar problems to the 'hobbits' problem above, then leetcode could have some decent ones for training/learning.",

The old TurboGears framework (yes I'm that old), Flask, or Django are commonly used with python, PHP is another commonly used one using the Laravel framework for example.\n\n2. API driven, here you serve endpoints (routes) with a web server and various methods just like with the server side rendering but instead of serving HTML you serve some other machine readable media formats like JSON, JSON-RPC, XML, etc. You then combine the \"backend\" with a frontend website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that calls your backend routes and then utilises that data to change the front end.

Essentially, your backend program is responsible for preparing data to be consumed by the browser in some form or another. The simplest web program might look like this:\n\n    print('<head><title>Hello</title></head><body>Hello, world!</body>')\n\nThis can be run by telling your web server to run this script as a CGI program. This is not a modern recommended practice for several out-of-the-scope-of-this-discussion reasons but it's great for educational purposes. The idea is, you set up your web server to serve any given route by running this program and then sending the output to the client. Using this example, Python itself isn't handing HTTP requests, the web server is, and it's adding additional context that can be accessed through environment variables or even reading STDIN to handle posts, etc. \n\nOnce you've got that, you can start doing more clever things, like mapping out endpoints and having the browser make asynchronous requests to those end points to dynamically update already-loaded pages.",

When I see \"Agree\" or \"Disagree\", but they make similar points, then they have a different understanding of what they thought OP said.\n\nOK, so I'll start. I think OP believes learning a bunch of languages just to learn them is not good, at least, not at the start. Instead, pick a language, and begin solving problems, and not just learning how to write \"Hello, World\" in a dozen languages. \n\nOP did suggest that learning new languages didn't teach him more than Javascript did, but he admits that maybe some of that was failing to take a deeper dive in any of the languages.\n\nI don't think OP is saying every language is the same, but if s/he is saying that, I disagree.\n\nAs an analogy, this is like saying, what's important about learning a spoken language is what you want to talk about, i.e., the ideas, and not the words you use (which depend on language), and yet, you can be well spoken in English and don't know how to say the same thoughts in another language.\n\nWhy is it challenging? Natural languages like French or Japanese have a huge vocabulary compared to the syntax of a language. In particular, verb tenses are tricky for most. On top of that is learning the grammar, Is it subject-verb-object? Also, pronouncing words is really hard. Many non-Chinese speakers struggle with the tones in Chinese (assuming they don't also speak a tonal languages). On top of that, there are cultural differences, slang, whether to speak in complete sentences or to drop certain words, etc.\n\nProgramming languages don't have that complexity. But to say they are all the same is also wrong. For example, if you know Javascript well, but tried to learn Prolog, you'd struggle trying to find equivalent concepts. Prolog is that different from Javascript.\n\nHaving said that, I generally agree with the basic premise which is learn a language well enough to solve problems. Don't learn a bunch of languages early on, esp. superficially where you can't solve problems in any of them.\n\nMy minor quibble is the language does matter, at least, to how you think about a solution. Doing OO programming where you create classes and objects differs from doing procedural programming where you don't do that. That also differs from doing functional programming. You need to adjust how you think about programming. But in a sense, it doesn't matter which style who pick, just pick one and don't keep switching languages to know a bunch of them at a surface level.",

The industry has already enough of this kind of dev and has (had?) insatiable hunger for mediocre workers.\n\nIf one wants to gain more insight though, one needs to get in contact with other languages and how they work and solve problems in them. Then out of the specific experiences with different primitives to work with, one forms a more educated overall picture and expertise.\n\nDon't obsess, alright, I agree, but don't assume, that because you have used Java, Python, JavaScript or another mainstream language for a couple of years, you know all there is to know. There is tons you don't know and there will always be tons you don't know. What matters is, that you continue learning. If all you can do is sling around some design patterns, then unfortunately quite soon you may become obsolete.

Some people choose to continue learning, and maybe project Odin could be a place where such people go to learn. Some are even fortunate enough to be able to do so on the job, at some functioning organization. Most others will not or are not at organizations that encourage learning.\n\nExample: In the past I have been at an organization that had fake \"learning days\". I was not allowed to learn about some advanced computer programming topics, but someone else \"learning HTML\", that was OK. Only that I learned HTML a long time ago, at school and over time I mostly kept myself informed about what new stuff is there. I have no need of learning HTML. It is something so basic, that I would be wasting my time doing that. Knowing HTML is such a widespread thing, that it is not even anything to boast about. Yet I was denied learning, because silly middle management did not have the capability to understand the impact of the things I wanted to learn. The perspective was always short term, and they let their own lack of experience and knowledge limit what others are allowed to learn on the job. It was completely dysfunctional.\n\nI think many people in this situation would not have energy left to then learn more in their free time. That is, if they were into being a developer out of passion and learning about computational processes, and not just for the good pay. We have too many of the not passionate devs in the industry, who will jump on any hype train, as long as it pays well, messing up project after project, and being lauded for it by incapable management.\n\nMany will continue to mess up projects, introducing unnecessary complexity at many turns. Management usually doesn't realize this, because they have no proper understanding of the detailed implementation ideas and what their consequences are. Or the ever-present silly phrases like \"80-20!\", \"YAGNI!\", balblabla, which are weaponized to cut against developer concerns. You are a ticket machine! We want you to be a small cog, that we can easily replace with the next generic developer!\n\nThey are not able to distinguish between someone really knowing their stuff and someone just going with the first best idea that \"works\" (until the next requirement change, when they have to adapt their half-assed solutions again). Developing computer programs without \"programming oneself into a corner\" is a valuable skill, but also a rare skill.",

        "body": "You're asking more questions than you think. \n\n1.) Tech is extremely competitive. Many factors contribute to this. It used to be that tech seemed such a brain-dead obvious bet for a lucrative career that it seemed foolish *not* to attempt some sort of STEM career. This means that you can have a CS degree, several fullstack apps in your portfolio, and are able to steamroll the LeetCode 150 and not even get interviews. The constant rejection of any job search process is soul sucking, but the energy that goes into the ground level for software development makes the search a really special journey into feelings of worthlessness.\n\n2.) Gaming is the worst part of tech. That's not even discussing the wild freefall the AAA side of the industry is experiencing. The reason is because gaming is a prestige position. No matter what happens, folks like you are gonna say, \"I don't care. I want to make games.\" Because games are awesome. Since the line to work on projects is out the door, management can pay less and work their talent harder. A normal tech job outside of start-ups can give a really good work/life balance, even more so if you land a remote position. That is considerably less likely for a similar position at a gaming company. Call it crunch or \"Bioware magic,\" but those companies you dream of working for know about your dreams, for better or worse. \n\n3.) As game projects increase in scale, distribution of labor gets more distinct. You aren't \"programming a game,\" you're \"responsible for the flow of the inventory system but not the menu system itself or the actual UI of the system.\" This isn't a bad thing. It's just how the sausage is made. But it can take away some of the razzle-dazzle of \"making a game.\" \n\n4.) This is an incredible time to work in a small group or going yolo solo. Unreal Engine is free, and blueprints make it a lot more accessible than raw-dogging C++. Unity is free (but don't use Unity). Godot is free. Phaser3 is free. YouTube U is free. Check out /r/gamedev and r/IndieDev. There are posts on those forums every other day from folks who are further than you in this process asking themselves, \"Am I wasting my time?\" And the answers may be illuminating. \n\n5.) Game dev just isn't something you should be going into for love of the game if you want to make money. If you shift to the most lucrative corners of making games, you will bleed out your love, and if you focus hard on making projects of love, you won't have as much money or as much help (co-workers), and it's an uphill battle to be noticed. Undertale is the exception. Balatro is the exception. Vampire Survivors is the exception. I hope you're an exception.... but you'll probably need a day job or a rich spouse/parent. \n\n6.) Learning to program is worth it as a skill on its own, I truly believe that. I LOVE that I can have an idea, think about how to make it, and just... make it. It's a really, really fun superpower. It was also really hard won. Understanding how all the pipes fit together beneath the user level is incredibly useful. I think everyone should at least learn to build and deploy a CRUD app without AI so they can just understand what the hell is happening. That said, there are other parts of the game industry than programmers or artists, same as there are other paths in \"tech\" besides engineers, bright-eyed founders, and parasitic C-suite villains.",

Use that to your advantage! Take everything you learn as an opportunity to practice writing code.

In whatever language you've chosen, learn as many built-in functions (and operators, syntax, etc.) in that language as you can (with the theoretical goal of learning all of them). New programmers often make things harder than they need to be on themselves, because they don't realize all of the tools that the language offers (and they try to write extra utilities themselves, or reach for code from the Internet or third-party packages, when the language already offers a helpful tool built-in).\n3. Just like how when you're at the gym, you don't do each exercise only once and move on to a new exercise, apply the same approach to coding. Once you get your code working, start over from a completely blank slate, and try to do it again. See if you can look up even a *little* less than you needed to look up last time, or if you run into a little bit fewer bugs than you did last time. You'll find that once you do something five or ten times, you have a *way* deeper understanding than you thought you did after you only did it once.",

Think of a fairly small project that you would be excited to build and choose a language/framework you want to learn (or ask AI which one might be suitable for the task). Then ask it to break it down in steps and take it slowly, explaining what happens in each step. Also, don't just copy paste, write the code yourself, you will learn much better that way. Ask AI about everything you don't understand, and question why its doing things in a certain way and what the benefit are. Be curious.  \n  \nI wish I had such a tool when I started out instead of boring programming books that left a lot of questions unanswered.\n\nBut still, it will take time.

To print your pyramid, you just need to go step by step.\n\nsomething like:\n\n    for each line \n      print_line\n\nThen how do you print a single line ? Well there a bunch of space before, a bunch of \"o\" in the middle and then we go to next line so the code become:\n\n    for each line \n      print_spaces(numbers of spaces)\n      print_stars(numbers of o)\n\nNow can you do print\\_spaces and print stars ? Well we just need to repeat the same stuff the specified number of time, something like:\n\n    line = \"\"\n    repeat for numbers of spaces\n      line = line + \" \"\n    repeat for numbers of o\n      line = line + \"*\"\n    print line\n\nBut to be more concise, we could write as well:\n\n    line = repeat(\" \", number of spaces) + repeat(\"o\", number of o)\n    print line\n\nwhere repeat would repeat the string the number of time we want. That's not so different than\n\n    line = \" \".repeat(number of spaces) + \"o\".repeat(number of o)\n\nor even:\n\n    print \" \".repeat(number of spaces) + \"o\".repeat(number of o)\n\nNow how many number of stars we have per line ? From the solution it's:\n\n    Math.floor((i * 2 - 1 - row) / 2)\n\nTo really get it, we would need to understand what i and row are as well as floor. But you can likely come with you own way to count the spaces.\n\nFrom your pyramid, to me it look like there zero space on the bottom pyramid and 1 the one before, then 2, then 3. So it like the (max line number) - (current line number) - 1 So the whole for me would be\n\n    for I in range(0, max_line - 1)\n      num_spaces = I + 1\n      num_o = max_line - I - 1\n      print (\" \".repeat(num_spaces) + \"o\".repeat(num_o) \n\nor\n\n    for I in range(0, max_line - 1)\n      print (\" \".repeat(I+1) + \"o\".repeat(max_line - I - 1) \n\nAnyway, what I try to explain to you that you go step by step, trying to solve a complex problem by dividing it in smaller problems and solve each sub problem one at a time.\n\nIt the same even for the Math.floor method you would normally have constructed it step by step.\n\nAnd yes maybe repeat was introduced too fast in their example of maybe, the Math.floor was not well introduced. They gone too fast and you are lost now.\n\nBut doesn't mean you could not do it on your own with smaller learning step and couldn't master all that with enough training.",

Because you've put that in quotation marks.\n\nSadly creativity was always or has become almost a meme, because (as the other posts confirm indirectly) it sounds like some kind of superpower for almost anything, from programming and maths (\"multiple way to solve a problem\") till songwriting and visual artwork (doesn't even need any argument for those...does it?).\nBut actually creativity is something so abstract that one could write philosophical essays about it (no irony here). And in my experience most jobs, even the more intellectual ones (or maybe especially those) have the cliché that they give you freedom of how-to-do-this-task, no monotony but possibility to be even creative, and so on.\nMy experience is that sure some people are lucky and get their visions and wishes related to their job satisfied and most things are as great as they expected, but that's unfortunately more exception than a rule...\n\nI studied chemistry for few years and how did I learn for maths, physics, chemistry modules etc.? By f-ing REPEATING various catalogs of \"questions/tasks that can be asked in the exam\". That's frustrating and I'd hope less people would have to work and especially to learn this way (because it's one of the heaviest turn-offs imo).\n\nBefore I drift off into more pessimistic stuff, one thing I can tell you as a (hobby-)musician and occassional painter that aside from let's say 0.1% of the population who have superpowers, top genetics and were raised very effective & without any damages, creativity is a bit like natural mutual attraction (\"love\") - you can't enforce it. Still you want to achieve it, how you should do that?\n\nBy doing certain activities, which you have to find out for yourself, what fits for you somehow, the newer and the more they differ from each other, the better. Just try things out you wanted to f.e.. You will gain experience, expand your conciousness (literally & still in a natural way), the more contrasts you can gather and experience, the better. Nothing is true, everything is permitted!\nAnd by automatically building new associative nodes & connections in your neural system / \"soul\" through this gathering of new experiences, by natural passive (\"background-process\"-)learning you will already make one step after the other on the way to more creativity. Will, patience and time - I know, we all need especially the second one, but it's possible :)\n\nA bit untypical my whole post, but I hope this gives you some inspiration and new thoughts. I wish you success and optimism for your goals and your future.",

Yes clever code works, that's a big part of why it's so good, but is it readable? Toy projects and leetcode solutions are basically things you do once then barely touch again, so using this kind of code is acceptable. However, code in the real world has to be constantly maintained by several developers. The piece of code that you wrote today should still be understandable to you when you read it 6 months from now (and you've forgotten all about it) and understandable by your teammate who has never worked in that part of the code and maybe has never even met you.\n\nSo your plain loop solution would still be good, and some might argue even \"better\" than the clever single liner.",

But it's rarely (i.e. almost never) important to have the \"perfect mathematical solution\" to a given problem, even assuming one exists.\n\nFor this particular problem, I would personally look at the pattern first. How many spaces do you need to print at each row, if the pyramid has a height of 4? Do it manually first in a text editor: 3, 2, 1, 0. Now, what if it has a height of 5? Manually in a text editor: 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.\n\nNow do the same for how many \"o\"s you need to print. That one is a little easier. It always starts at 1 and then it always advances by 2, to count out all the odd numbers until the pyramid is done: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ....\n\nSo in this situation I would say that the \"goold ol' C-style for loop\" is easier to understand in this situation. Luckily JavaScript supports that style of loop:\n\n    // Pretend that height comes from the user.\n    let height = 4;\n    // Starting out the pyramid with an initial \\n so that it looks\n    // nicer inside the JS Console.\n    let pyramid = \"\\n\";\n    let ohs = 1;\n    for (let spaces = height-1; spaces >= 0; spaces--, ohs += 2) { \n        pyramid += \" \".repeat(spaces) + \"o\".repeat(ohs) + \"\\n\";\n    }\n    console.log(pyramid);\n\nSome people won't like that style and will prefer a more \"functional\" or \"mathematically correct\" style. But at the end of the day your job is to solve whatever problem you have, in a way that is easy for you to understand and which is fast enough. The above solution is perhaps less \"elegant\" but it gets the job done and it's usually easier to debug code like that than to debug code which is too much in a functional \"mathematical\" style.",

That might have been true very very early on, but both have diverged from C quite a bit, some things just work differently.\n\nFind a resource, that teaches C with a proper focus on how to write secure code, having to debug undefined Behaviour, memory leaks and segfaults is no fun if you just came from python. Personally I like the book \"Effective C\" by Robert C Seacord. Despite the name, (effective LANGUAGE usually means advanced in a lot of programming books) it is written for beginners, but it is well written, up to date and doesn't make stupid errors where the example code won't even compile (surprisingly common).\n\nThen, once you have a grip on the language, implement various algorithms, like the problems on [projecteuler.net](http://projecteuler.net), reading and processing some files, playing with raylib (since you came from gamedev with godot). The best way to learn C is writing programs in C, but they need to be small self contained things that compile cleanly and pass through valgrind cleanly. But most importantly, you need to understand various concepts of C first, otherwise the compiler will be like a girlfriend you forget to feed.\n\nIf you have a sound understanding of computer science, you might read the K&R book, but it is written for seasoned programmers that just don't know C, yet. It is from a time when Programmers already went through college and might had a PhD or a Master at minimum, home computers and self-taught coders weren't really a thing yet. It assumes that you know how computers work, potentially already have programmed in some form of assembly. It's more of a historic document than a valid learning resource. Don't get me wrong on this, it's a great read and you definitely should read it at some point in your learning journey, but it isn't the *best* way to learn C, anymore.",

Also, data types are not like Python or other high-level languages. It's basically when you have a chunk in memory, how do you want to interpret those zeros and ones? Individual characters, or floats, or turn them into a struct, which is like a Python class. The point being, start with Python and just translate it and try to get it running and go from there.",

If you look at individual method in isolation they look great, but there are serious issues with side effects, global state, or implicit coupling between methods that would make this code really brittle and hard to maintain in practice.\n\n[https://qntm.org/clean](https://qntm.org/clean)\n\nI think a more charitable interpretation is that Clean Code was very relevant when it came out, but hasn't stood the test of time as well.\n\nIt was written in response to a popular style of object-oriented programming at the time that was resulting in code that was extremely hard to debug and test. Clean Code had a lot of great ideas to course-correct.\n\nHowever, the example code could have been better chosen. A lot of the example code constructs HTML from strings, which was common at the time but seems really dated now because we all use templating libraries for that which are way cleaner and more general-purpose.\n\nIn addition, the book goes into gnarly details of mocking in Java and a lot of that content is totally out-of-date today.\n\nI'd recommend this book instead:\n\nThe Art of Readable Code: Simple and Practical Techniques for Writing Better Code\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Art-Readable-Code-Practical-Techniques/dp/0596802293](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Readable-Code-Practical-Techniques/dp/0596802293)\n\nI think it's designed to be more timeless and applies to lots of different languages and types of code.",

There are some weird sideeffects to everything, and throughout the book he seems to think that sideeffects are okay as long as they happen inside the same object. That was kind of the OOP-way of thinking back then, not so much now. And while I'm certainly not a fan of methods just throwing Exceptions without explaining why or where they originated, that is more of a Java thing.\n\nBut I kind of agree with you, that the entire book seems \"ugly\" - there are a lot of good suggestions in there, but then they are intertwined with crazy \"rules\" that seems made up on the spot, and the strange flow in the text and the small illustrations just makes everything seem \"messy\".",

There are still a lot of jobs available, but the gold rush is over, at least for now. \n\nIf you want to get into development, choose a language and framework and start building applications. Being able to create and deploy software is table stakes these days. \n\nUnderstand SOLID and basic software architecture. Understand SQL and relational database concepts. You should still be familiar with your data structures and algorithms, and having some experience working with LLMs is an excellent idea. \n\nAnd make sure you know how to deploy your apps to the cloud. A good portfolio site will show that you're familiar with all the concepts I list above. \n\nThe bar is higher than it has been in the recent past, which I've seen catch many CS grads who didn't apply themselves off guard. That doesn't mean the bar is infinitely high, though. If you know your foundational skills and you have some experience building non-trivial applications, you should be able to find a way into the industry, although it might take some patience and persistence. \n\nGood luck to you.",

The pressure drove me to pick it up in a month, become proficient by six months, and complete production migration within the year. Now I use Ansible everywhere. That's automation born from necessity.\n\nMore often though, automation springs from fixing daily annoyances. I hate tracking my hours, so I built an iOS shortcut that logs my ins/outs and generates a weekly spreadsheet for my boss. When I used to distrohop on Linux, I created an Ansible dotfiles repo to streamline setups.\n\nThe key is to identify what genuinely annoys you, then ask \"how would I automate this?\" The search for solutions naturally follows.",

Companies generally aren't searching for people who know some obscure language. In the few cases where they are (like COBOL), they're looking for people with 30+ years of experience, not beginners.\n\nI think a better way to approach it might be to pick a part of the world that has a good tech scene, but is not as exciting and fast-paced. In the U.S. an example might be Minneapolis or Atlanta. Both cities have lots of software jobs but nothing like Silicon Valley, Seattle, or NYC. Look at job openings and see what languages, frameworks, tools, and specialties companies are looking for there.\n\nSince you're a CS major, an internship can be the best way to break in. Get an internship at a company doing something a little more niche and you'll suddenly be the top new grad hire for any company in that field.",

Iterative code can sometimes be more performant, especially in programming languages without tail recursion. Anything you can do with one, you can do with the other.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, I suggest iteration unless you're doing something that is particularly well-suited for recursion (like walking a tree or writing a left-to-right parser).",

This is done **within the same stack frame**, and the function does not create new stack memory. Memory stays constant and predictable unless you create new objects manually.\n\nHowever, in case of recursion, each function call gets **its own stack frame** in the call stack. This stack frame stores local variables, return address, parameters, etc., When a recursive call is made, the current function is paused and pushed onto the call stack. Once the base condition is met, the calls start returning one by one as the stack entries are popped.\n\nNow you might understand that if you go too deep using recursion, it will cause too much of piling on the stack and if the input is too big, it would end up creating a **StackOverflowError**.\n\nHope it is helpful :) I'll may be write a detailed blog post on my Substack and a link here later when it is done.",

A typical place to draw this line is at the edge of well defined objects in your domain\n\nLayers help you stick to solving for certain implementation problems related to a subset of the technology. Some common layers are\n- data store \n- data access or orm \n- domain or business logic\n- api\n- presentation \n\nWhat I've found is that the edge seems to be a bit wider in the presentation layer than what you want for the domain layer and to do that you sometimes want to inflate the boundary in the data access layer, but this can introduce problems with the domain layer\n\nA good compromise is to create summary types which you can refer to in the presentation layer without having to load entire objects\n\nHappy to talk through this stuff.

Add a automatic clicker that farms clicks for the user, Etc.\n\n  \nJust start really really really small and work your way up, The hard part is starting, then you can just break it down into digestible pieces and you'll be golden in no time",

You have to use a pointer. Arrays have never become full first-class values in C. You also can't assign one array to another:\n\n    int x[2];\n    int y[2];\n    x = y;\n\nThe reason, 50 years ago, was that it would have required emitting too many assembly language instructions from that one statement (and passing a large array as a value can overflow your stack); the restriction has never been lifted because `strcpy` and `memcpy` work better for most people.*\n\nAs for why it's a pointer to the first character of the string and not to the string: pointers in C are designed to be the interface to arrays. They're how you access any element of an array, any time you do. An array, when used as a value, is always converted to a pointer to its first element; adding (or subtracting) an integer to a pointer moves it that many places through the array, and, of course dereferencing the result accesses the selected element.\n\n`x[i]` is syntax sugar for `*(x + i)`, which means (assuming `x` is an array): take a pointer to the first element of `x`, move that pointer (hopefully forward) `i` positions, then get the element at that location.\n\nSo once you have a pointer into an array, you can access the whole array from there.\n\n\n* Citation needed, according to anyone who's ever passed the wrong length to `memcpy` and smashed the return address on the call stack.

Code and CPU instructions aren't a one to one mapping, the way a language works is it must be translated to CPU instructions. In the case of C the thing that does this is called a compiler.\n\n  \nCPU instructions are whats known as binary code. Assembly language is a CPU specific programming language that takes CPU binary code and puts labels on specific binary strings that mean do this thing. For example ADD. CPUs also have access to registers, which just hold a few bytes of values, for example a 32 bit machine 4 bytes 64 8 bytes, etc. These registers are what the CPU uses to do math with. So ADD register1, register2 would take the sum of these two numbers and put it into register 1.\n\n  \nAssembly is a 1:1 mapping with that architectures binary, meaning if you learn to understand it you can write code that tells the CPU exactly what to do. C is an abstraction on assembly, meaning that it let's you write code, the compiler does something, then you get an assembly file. For your use case you don't need to know how this file works, but the general theory is pretty simple, basically it builds a stack, which is just like a pile of variables, and the compiler writes the assembly in a way that instead of variable int x, it's base of the stack + 10 bytes or something. And that is how it knows where x lives. But again you don't need to know this right now.\n\n  \nWhat you need to know is that when you compile C code, you get an executable, a file you can run directly in the command line, or just run like any other windows exe or other executable I forget the mac and linux extensions. You can do this in command line or depending on the code treat the executable like it's own app.\n\nPython is a little different. Python itself is a language built in C. Python does not compile into an executable, python is an executable. When you click run, all it does is the command python3 yourfilename.py. python3 is an assembly file that opens the file yourfilename.py, reads what you wrote, and then figures out what to do with the text and updates things accordingly. You CAN compile python, but it's not popular, not efficient and kinda weird.\n\n  \nSorry this is random and disorganized thoughts, please if you have questions ask me i like talking about this stuff if you couldn't already tell.",

It's like a IDE blindness. My first step now will be going thriugh my previous projects and just trying to run them from the terminal, maybe changing the code every now and then so the control from the terminal is more comfortable. I need to learn how to see the interactions from the standpoint of the terminal. In the future, I might see the outputs into some GUI as outputs to the terminal, just placed into a different space.

If you mean the order in which they are written, I can definitely see how they may be perceived as messy, though I feel this is very common with tailwind from my experience. There may be a tool that organizes the classes for you that I’m unaware of though. Or perhaps bootstrap just looks organized due to being comprised of pre-built components?\n\nTailwind css is also mobile first, but I inverted the breakpoints to make it desktop-first because I had no plans on making the mobile version of the application.\n\nYes I definitely use the mobile viewports. They’re especially very good on Firefox.\n\nThank you!",

Ideally you should know both.\n\nOne reason is because there's easily 1000x more C++ code out there than Rust code. While people who are starting new projects from scratch might be more likely to use Rust now, most existing C++ projects are not going to rewrite.\n\nEven places that use Rust for all new code use a lot of code written in other languages. Rust programs often call into libraries written in C, C++, and other languages, and sometimes you'll need to read, debug, or modify that code too. So knowing C++ is pretty useful.\n\nAnother reason is that experiencing the flaws of C++ will help Rust make a lot more sense. Rust was designed in particular because it just wasn't possible to write memory-safe code in C++. There's no better way to appreciate that than to try to write C++ and to see how an error can cause your program to crash or corrupt memory, then to experience how Rust prevents that code from even compiling.",

My problem has been escaping tutorial hell and focusing more on building so I actually have something to show for what I know. I have a plan laid out for myself though, and itd be cool to have some people join me on my journey so we can keep each other motivated. Maybe even come together and build out a portfolio as a group. My thought process, is the more people involved the more impressive of a portfolio of projects we could create.\n\nIf you're interested, id be down to help guide you to the best of my abilities, and maybe we'll be able to help each other land jobs in the future.",

A good design gives you that \"ah hah\" feeling when reading through the code, like \"oh, someone really thought about how this was going to work\".\n\nOf the two, I would say that having a good design is about 50x more important than having good \"style\". If you give me a program with bad style but a good design, then all I have to do is run clang-format on it (or the equiivalent). However, if you give me a program with a terrible design, then there's no amount of automation that can fix that. It's like building a house on a bad foundation.\n\nNow, that being said, if you can't even be bothered to run code styling tools on your code, then if you were to give me your code, then it will inevitably create some kind of a mildly to grossly bad impression in my opinion. It's a bit like sending me an e-mail riddled with typos. Sure, maybe I can still read it, but couldn't you have at least taken 2 seconds to press F7 and do the spell check before sending it?

Just learn a few ideas.\n\nHere are some quick ones.\n\n* Learn good variable names and function names (harder than you think, but valuable).\n* Write lots of short functions (a bit controversial), say 50 lines at most.\n* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). Don't copy/paste the same code. If you're doing that, write a function that has that common code.\n\nYou're writing smaller projects that's maybe 500 lines or so. This doesn't require the same level of organization as huge programs with many files. However, it is good to organize the code within a single file.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't worry about how fast your program runs. It runs fast. Until you learn DSA (mostly the algorithms), it's hard to improve the speed, and often meaningless. \n\nOh yes, learn from others. You'll see better solutions out there. Don't beat yourself up that you didn't come up with it. Most people can't come up with brilliant code. Instead, they see others, and imitate it.

I attribute this to two things, one im obsessive but really two is I dont take the time to plan my projects first.  I just jump straight into code.  Can't stress how important it is to have a long whiteboard session at the beginning.  Map out the plan and stick to it until mvp.  Test it, show it to the customer, then refactor only if necessary.   And usually you will only be refactoring for maintainability and readability not for efficiency.   You're just starting so you are a long ways off from needing to write \"efficient\" code.  Most of the time people toil days or weeks to reduce a few lines of code which ultimately saves microseconds.   Not worth it you'll burn out and start accumulating tech debt.  So I agree with the general sentiment of get it working first then tune it only if necessary. \n\nPoint of clarity, im not saying do not write \"clean\" code that's different.

In that case, you'll have to *think* about how to solve the problem you're faced with. And there is always a possibility of making a mistake in your thinking. Those are the mistakes that tests can help you catch.\n\nTo use your example of input validation: Maybe you have a set of ideas in your head about what kinds of inputs are valid, and what inputs are invalid. And maybe you write a regex that matches only valid inputs. The test exists to make sure you wrote that regex correctly, so that its behavior matches what you had in mind.\n\n(You could argue that if the regex is wrong, you'll notice the problem just by running the code and experimenting with it. Doing this kind of interactive testing is good, but on its own, it's a very unreliable and error-prone way of testing. Writing the tests down in an automated test suite helps you make sure you didn't miss anything. And most importantly, it tells you if a later change introduces a new bug, without you having to manually test every single feature every time you touch the code.)\n\nOf course it's possible you'll make a mistake in the tests too.

The reason you write tests isn't necessarily because you want to catch all of the things you already thought of.\n\nWriting tests is inherently tricky. The essence of writing tests is thinking about the ways that your code might fail, and then enshrining that in a test. For simple functions, that's easier than it is for complex functions.\n\nI think the core thing that you're missing is that tests aren't for testing whether your particular slice of code works under ideal conditions; it's often more about future-proofing your code, like when you make changes to variables, or the way that certain key variables are broadly calculated; and suddenly your tests can alert you that your function isn't working as intended because you couldn't account for how your code would evolve in the future.\n\nDoes that make sense?",

Semantics can vary.\n\nEdit:\n\nI also like the answer in the reddit thread someone else linked that mutexs can be reentrant. Reentrancy doesnt really make sense for semaphores.\n\nThe top answer talks more about the fact that semaphores are built for managing concurrent access to a pool of resources (they store a counter for how many \"resources\" are available), where as mutexes are about critical sections. For clean code, you should really use these constructs for only the associated purpose above, even if you can use the other, since the names \"semaphore\" and \"mutex\" come with these connotations.\n\nAdditionally, just sticking to using them for these purposes will basically automatically help you avoid problems with differences in reentrancy and and who can call up()/unlock().",

My method:\n\nWhen I learn a new language I do stuff like Edabit first, maybe two weeks of 1-3 hours a day, just working thru the difficulties. I move up to leetcode easy. The point is to exercise my very meager skill in the new lang with tiny, manageable problems.\n\nLater once I feel bored, or like I'm wasting time with the ease of the problems, or I want a greater challenge, really any negative dull non-transient feeling, I move onto building a very small program. Usually it solves an imaginary problem, but if I could do something I could conceivably use (still small!) I try to do that. \n\nThis approach avoids Tutorial Hell, where you are stuck in analysis paralysis. Bite off small manageable pieces, increasing somewhat linearly in size but with variation in difficulty.\n\nYou can ask me if you sense utility here and you'd like more guidance about the method.",

Note that the last type argument of a `Func<>` is the return type. \n\nSo `Func<SomeObject, SomeOutput>` matches a method `SomeOutput MethodName(SomeObject arg)`\n\nSo instead of multiple ifs or switch statements, you can do something like this:\n\n```\nDictionary<string, Func<SomeObject, SomeOutput>> handlers;\n\nvoid Init()\n{\n    handlers.Add(\"A\", HandlerA);\n    handlers.Add(\"B\", HandlerB);\n}\n\nvoid Handle(string value)\n{\n    if(handlers.TryGet(value, out var handler))\n    {\n        var output = handler(input)\n    }\n    throw new ArgumentOrOfRangeException(nameof(value));\n}\n\nprivate SomeOutput HandlerA(SomeObject value)\n{\n    // Do something for for value A...\n}\n\nprivate SomeOutput HandlerB(SomeObject value)\n{\n    // Do something for for value B...\n}\n```",

Every time a manager schedules a one on one meeting with me, I'm nervous that this is it and they finally figured out that I'm dumb.\n\nThe thing is, though, that to be a good programmer, you have to get really comfortable with not knowing stuff. People naturally get very defensive about not knowing things, but learning about any one thing takes time. For a programmer, there are far too many things to know about any given situation, so your time to learn things is always very limited. You have to budget. \"Do I need to know more about how this platform works, or do I need to know how this one library works, or do I need to know how HTTP is meant to handle this, or do I need to learn how to use that new AI thingy to debug this, or...\" You have to pick. That means you have to get comfortable not knowing some things and planning out what you need to learn.\n\nThe more senior you are, the more this is true. You'll eventually need to start delegating work to others, and the whole point of that is that you don't need to come completely up to speed on all of the details of what they're doing. And in meetings, the new kids will have even worse imposter syndrome than you do, and they'll never want to admit they don't know something, so it's your job as the senior engineer to ask clarifying questions, sometimes even when you know the answer, even if you think it'll make you look dumb, to make sure the junior devs don't have to ask on their own.\n\nSome developers solve the imposter syndrome by cultivating a giant ego. \"I can't be an imposter; I'm a programming god, a 10x hax0r, I look down on fools who use (vi or emacs) instead of (emacs or vi).\" Don't become that guy. Just get comfortable with feeling a little like an imposter.",

Alternately, if you are thinking more about designing semiconductors, material science is probably for you.\n\nThe same goes for networking; if you want to study the physics of signal transmission, go into electrical engineering, not computer science.\n\nMost programmers work with OSI layer 4 protocols, like TCP and UDP, or application layer protocols, like HTTP.

This was widely known as the chill job for SWEs. I worked 20 hour weeks and was an overperformer and I did Scrum master duties on the side. Had I stayed i'd probably be considered a Sr Level 2, or a Principal by now and im only 7 YOE. \n\nI left due to pay (started at 75k and made close to 90k after 4 years) and lack of work tbh.

A significant part of our job is process/red-tape. At startups, process/red-tape can be straight up non-existant. You're lucky if you end up at a startup that has some halway decent dev processes in place.\n\nBut at a large company, process is key. There are very strict best practices in place. There's very strict change management, very strict approvals, very strict boundaries of responsibility, etc, etc, etc. They're simply too large to let devs just cowboy code some stuff into prod that gets introduced to their millions of users right away. They also have internal and external audits to think about, where they're straight up auditing *the process*. If your processes aren't good, you're going to fail an audit, and failing an external audit can have a significant negative impact on the company and its clients.\n\nAll companies will feel slow compared to startups. Not just big tech. Startups are trying to get their code and product out into the world as fast as humanly possible. It's like Facebook's old mantra (which they've since ditched) \"Move Fast and Break Things\". Who cares if what you released into prod broke something? You'll have a patch up in 10 minutes.\n\nEstablished companies are more focused on keeping things stable, not distrupting their user base, staying in compliance with all the many compliance/regulations/frameworks they need to abide to to make their customers feel warm and fuzzy inside. A short downtime can easily lose 6-7 figures for them, whereas a startup DGAF about downtime. The benefit of releasing code quickly outweights whatever negative would come from prod issues.\n\nOne thing that will be very valuable for *you* from a career-growth perspective is seeing what heavy-process looks like. Look at what this company is doing, how it differs from the startup world, what the pros/cons are, etc. That gives you multiple perspectives to view any given problem from in the future. You can consider stability and process, while also considering quick delivery. There's ***a lot*** of companies in-between the 2 extremes that highly value that kind of perspective.",

I'm not stupid, I know the one and only reason you're reaching out to me is to advance your career. You're not reaching out to me because you want to be buddies, or want to form a genuine relationship. You're reaching out to me to use my status for your benefit. The minute you no longer need anything from me, we're not going to continue talking, or having coffee chats.\n\nThe alumni from my University that are a part of my network are the ones that *I knew in college*. My genuine friends. People I directly worked with, studied with, partied with, etc. The fact you happened to go to the same school I did doesn't really mean anything to me, there's hundreds of thousands of livnig alumni from my University. Over ten thousand graduate every year. Can you imagine if even one percent of the alumni base sent me LinkedIn messages asking for a coffee chat?\n\nIf you met me in a bar, or doing some hobby out in the wild, we got to talking, found out we went to the same college, and became fast friends, *then* I would be happy to refer you. We formed a genuine relationship *first*, in an environment where I don't feel like you're using me or the connection was fake. *That's* what I consider networking. Making friends in the wild. This actually happens quite a lot to me, there's a lot of alumni living in my city, and I've made some good friends because of it.\n\nI'm not actively annoyed at getting cold messages or anything, I'm not getting angry, I'm not personally offended that someone tried to reach out to me. I just ignore them.\n\nDon't let me discourage you though.... maybe 1000 alumni ignore you, but 1 responds and you get a job because of it. So it could totally still be worth it, and there's not really a downside. That's just how I personally view cold messaging, and I feel like most of the people I know personally operate the same way.",

It took my heart and soul just to get any kind of offer, and I am so ready to get back to trying to turn my life around.\n\nI wasn't FAANG material, but I worked pretty hard. I graduated w/ a Master's in CS + 2 years intern + 1 year full time -> had a big name F500 100k TC full-stack job lined up before I even finished school.\n\nThat F500 was amazing, but 1.5 year in I got mass laid off. It took me 3 months to find my next job.\n\nMy next job was awesome too (for the most part, 1/4 of it was a tough crunch period), I got in at 105k fully remote security clearance in the same stack. I felt like I was really starting to get the hang of things.\n\nHowever, 1 year into *that* job, I got mass laid off again. Unlucky!\n\nThen I began my descent into the hellish reality of me trying to get a job in 2025. I actually had no issues getting interviews. I have a very strong resume, I was able to secure a couple referrals from my network. I was also pretty resourceful / lucky at just cold dm'ing or trying to be the first 20 people to apply to a job.\n\nMy problem was, I am/was just not that good at interviewing! I was completely caught off guard how awful this last 6-7 months would be. At first, I was like it's just rust and we'll get other chances. I went on to fail A LOT of interviews.\n\nI actually have had 21 different positions that have made it to technical rounds. Of those 21, I got 2 offers and 3 are in progress (plus a 22nd chance round 2 this week for a remote job!)\n\nIt's been absolutely miserable. Some jobs were actually laterals or upgrades in pay / situation, some even remote. Most of these jobs though are pretty sizeable paycuts + bad commutes and I wasn't good enough for them.\n\nI still have a few interviews / leads building up so I'll keep taking them until I actually start my new job, but man I can't wait for this to be over. I'm going to work hard at my new job and establish the workload. If it ends up being chill, I'm going to just go right back to studying for interviews on the job whenever I can and keep fighting until I can get a big salary and/or remote again.\n\nI wish anyone on the journey best of luck and to keep believing in your hard work. I still dont 100% trust I'm actually going to have a job in a few weeks, I've been in survival mode for so long..\n\nFor what it's worth.. I got some pretty crazy feedback at some of these jobs. I got told for a few positions that the people I was competing with had 5+ years experience. Can't confirm that for all of them, but I legit have made it as a top 2 finalist twice and didn't get it. Competition is just insane out there right now.",

I find that startups are more willing to hire. I've used builtinnyc.com, but there are \"BuiltIns\" for multiple cities. wellfound.com is good too. I do find they tend to skew NYC and SF based roles though. \n\n\n- When applying, if there's a section for \"skills\" that's fill-in-the-blank, go back to the job description and make sure to list any skill you find there that you have.

Or React vs Vue etc. If they're that rigid and don't understand what it is an actual engineer brings to the table, don't feel bad about it.\n\n\nI applied to the exact same job twice about a month apart, once without doing any of this and then after doing all of this. First time, email rejection after a couple of weeks. Second time, instant email inviting me to a technical screening. Somewhere in the mix, some automatic filtering must be happening, so try to fight against it.\n\n\nGood luck!",

When I was transitioning from med school to tech, I spent way too much time in forums like this getting discouraged by all the doom posts instead of just focusing on building.\n\nThe truth is, people having a tough time are way more likely to post about it than people who are doing fine. It creates this warped perception where it seems like everyone's struggling when really it's just that the struggling voices are the loudest ones.\n\nI started Metana in 2022 when everyone was saying 'tech is dead' and 'bootcamps don't work' yet we've hit $1M ARR because companies still need good developers. The online noise didn't match what was actually happening in the market.\n\nHere's what I'd focus on instead of endlessly tweaking resumes. Pick one solid project and make it really impressive. Not just another todo app, but something that solves a real problem you care about. Then write about your process, document your learning, show your thinking. Employers care way more about how you approach problems than your school ranking.\n\nAlso, you mentioned 3 internships, that's actually solid experience. Maybe the issue isn't your background but where you're applying? Sometimes casting a wider net geographically or looking at companies that aren't the typical FAANG targets can open up opportunities.\n\nThe market is tough right now, no sugarcoating that. But good developers are still getting hired every day. Keep building, keep applying, and try to spend less time in forums that make everything seem impossible :)",

The rest of the world is generally less so, you will need to achieve a high level of fluency before you will have any luck looking for work and even then, there are some cultures (ex. Germany, Turkiye, most of eastern Europe) that would rather hire someone from that culture who speaks English over an outsider who speaks their language. You will never have priority over someone from that culture, unless you offer a particular technical skillset that they can't find. This is xenophobia imo but it is what it is.\n\n2. People tend to be misled by online courses claiming they can become fluent in 3-6 months. You can learn the basics of many languages quickly, but actual fluency can take years, especially if you want to read and write Mandarin. In terms of professional development and career payoff, the ROI relative to effort is very low. You could learn several new tech stacks well in the time it would take you to learn Mandarin.\n\n3. The tech industry works primarily in English. One of my former employers had teams in China and Portugal that I worked closely with and it wasn't uncommon for them to discuss technical problems in English.\n\nI speak several languages to a relatively high degree of fluency and, while it's a great hobby for personal growth, the payoff is really poor for career opportunities. If you want to do it because you just like those cultures, go for it, but I wouldn't expect to get anything from a professional development perspective.",

While you may not use a B-Tree IRL, understanding Big(O) and fundamentals of how algorithms work, and how you approach breaking down problems is something that's good to understand.\n\nProblem is that then interviewees started memorizing the problems and optimal solutions, and it kinda became an arms race between interviewers and interviewees. There's an entire industry around helping people prepare for interviews with the FAANG companies, and so much resources out there on YouTube and so forth that teach you exactly how to do all of these things, so the standards got pushed up so high that if you \\*can't\\* do leetcode questions, you just look bad compared to someone who can.

For example, the first question we give is to reverse the order of words in a string, e.g. \"The dog runs\" -> \"runs dog The\". Most people solve this by reversing the entire string , then reversing each word. We make it clear that candidates can send us clarifying questions, and to clearly state their assumptions in comments.\n\nIn the interview we will ask questions like:\n\n* Does your solution work for empty strings? Strings with just white spaces? Extra white spaces between words? (I don't care if it does or not, I care that they can correctly identify what their solution does)\n* What happens with punctuation in your solution? How would you fix your solution if we required it to do something else? (We don't make them write the solution, just explain it. They can write it down if they prefer, though)\n\nThe best candidates anticipate these types of ambiguities and either send us questions ahead of time or clearly state their assumptions in the code.",

Put it on your resume as xp, even if you don't use it at the job. This is how I moved up from my junior php job to mid level python and then again to senior golang etc... The big mistake everyone makes is not stacking skills out of band, because once you can confidently be polyglot language/stack its easier to get recruited. The second stack is the hardest, each one after that gets easier. Eventually you can go to an interview and confidently say 'I can learn that no problems if you need me ready to go on the start date' ... managers want you to teach yourself.",

Depending on the place you're employed that may not be an option. IE if you're in a faang and they pay you a dump truck full of money every year that may not be an option for you. If you're expected to push through the burn out or get pipped out, you may want to start looking for a job with better wlb and take the pay cut. There's only a special type of person that can go ham literally 100% of the time.\n\n\nBut, if you are already in a position where you can decide to put up some boundaries when needed then you NEED to do it asap. \n\n\nFor now: Since you are already burned out, you have to stop working at the end of the day AND learn how to turn off your work brain when you do. It is a skill and it takes practice. It's like meditation. \n\nWhen you catch yourself doing a work thought you need to intentionally and consciously think about something else. If that means you go do something else or change your physical location then that's what you do. You need to stop thinking about work in order to recover from work.\n\n\nOnce youve already crossed over into being burned out, it may take some time (weeks or months depending on how bad the burnout is) for better boundaries to start making you feel better. But in my experience it does eventually happen. Just remember for the future that you need to be vigilant about the signs that you're working too much. It's something we do to get ahead and it can be good but if you want to be at your best you have to compromise with what is possible. Don't ignore your warning signs. It will take longer to recover the longer you push past them.",

You're not complaining, you're establishing expectations.\n\nIf anything, *not* communicating that and just bottling it up, and quietly missing the sprint deliverables is significantly worse than if you had communicated upfront that the sprint wasn't achievable.

When deadlines are at risk, management has the power to dial back scope, increase resources, or adjust the deadline. That's project management 101, it's stuff that PM interns know. What us as the SWE's are responsible for is *communicating* when those deadlines are at risk, and aren't acheivable. Our job is communicating the *actual* time to delivery. So when you're given an amount of work that can't be reached by the deadline, *communicate that*. Then your management can do *their* job, and manage that deadline.",

Does your team see issue roll over between sprints as the norm?\n\nBad estimations are common/normal and sprints aren't hard deadlines. You need to get used to estimations being wrong and telling the lead/PM/whoever as soon as you realize it so that everyone can re-prioritize.\n\nFor agile to be done correctly people need to be honest (to themselves and the team) about how much work they can realistically take on. It's better that you over-estimate, finish early and pull in tickets from next sprint rather than the reverse. Unfortunately sometimes PMs get overzealous with assigning work and you need to push back during planning if you think it's too much.",

Contribute to open source projects, build side projects with modern tech stacks, or take on freelance work to expand your experience. Document everything you learn and build a portfolio that demonstrates growth beyond your current role.\n\nA service like Applyre can help you explore opportunities while staying employed.

No one gives a shit about your passion.\n\nHowever don’t go through school half assing things. I did that the first time with a degree in accounting back in 09. Graduated and couldn’t find a job.

It sucked.\n\nMy advice no matter what you do it’ll suck. A lot of posts here complain about work and corporate culture and most of the time people are just not used to working 40 hours a week. \n\nYou just need to find the least amount of suck. Tech is good because at least you get paid well (but only if you can land a job…)\n\nMost other business degrees get paid much less and suck even more. \n\nDon’t look for passion.

        "body": "I love programming, but I find that getting quick feedback really helps me stay focused even on long term projects. I mostly do C++ and usually work pretty close to the iron. Each class I'm working on right now, I know approximately what it needs to do in my grand scheme of things, and usually write unit tests as I go. Usually at any point in my project I can either build my code and run the tests to verify that everything I've built so far builds and works as expected or I'm within an hour or two of being able to do so. There is no \"I'm going to work 3 months on this before I know anything about whether or not it works.\"\n\n\nThe projects you see in CS are not really the projects you'll see out in the industry. They've probably already told you that most software projects are maintenance. You'll very rarely ever see new design, just because on average most projects' lifecycle is 80-90% maintenance. The skill of reading someone else's code and understanding what they're trying to accomplish is not really something I picked up in CS. I had to learn that as I go. I'm not saying wait and see what industry jobs are like if you don't like CS, I'm just saying don't expect anything you do to look very much like anything you've been doing.\n\n\nThey may also have told you that programming languages are as much for communicating with engineers as it is with computers. They didn't go into a great deal of detail about that when I was in school, but a decade after I got out of school a computer program was like a book for me. I can read it and I can tell you things about  what the guy who wrote it was thinking. Probably things not even he was really aware of. Comes in handy, and it kind of feels like a superpower when you get good at it. Not saying you should do anything in particular except keep that in mind if you make a career out of this.\n\n\nIf you enjoy doing this for a living, there is never an end state. It's impossible to know everything that there is to know about computers at the moment, and has been since the '80's. There's a lot of arrogance in the field because a lot of people seem to think that they do know everything there is to know, but it's far more important to have a pretty solid idea about what you don't know. At least as it pertains to what you're doing right now. The landscape is pretty much infinite here, and far more similar to the math landscape than I realized up until surprisingly recently. You probably can find something to explore there that's interesting to you. How easy that is or whether you even want to try is of course entirely up to you.\n\n\nWhatever you decide to do, *you* ultimately set the direction in your career. This is as true now in your academic career as it is in your professional one. You can decide to stay in academia somewhere and explore the frontiers or old problems there. You can go off to the industry and solve math problems for stabilizing fusion reactors or something. You can go grind out enterprise communication code at some company and probably make a lot of money. Long's as you have the rent by Friday it doesn't really matter all that much. But you decide what you're going to do with your life, or you can try to float through it without much of a plan at all. I think a lot of people try to do that. From what I've seen, that path leads to regret sooner or later. Maybe all paths do, but if I end up regretting anything at least I was the one who decided to go that way.\n\n\nHope you find a direction you like. Good luck!",

Its kind of like when you sell something on facebook marketplace and your asking for cash but someone offers a trade but then says \"what do you want\"...i don't know, i wasnt considering a trade how about you offer up what you've got available for trade rather than me just replying i'd trade for world peace.\n\nExample, Are they a crisis management center handling assistance for the community and managing it through a spreadsheet that they share among case workers?\n\nAre they having to track their hours and theres 10 people that email one manager their time sheets and the manager has to rekey all that information into another spreadsheet?\n\nStuff like that is what you have to look for in order to know \"i can do XYZ to make your life easier\". If you just say \"hey, im a developer and would like to volunteer with you\" your going to get blank stares because people either won't care or they don't know what they could use you for.\n\nAlso, don't just limit yourself to non-profits. Look around in your area,  maybe you've got a mom and pop trash guy in the area who runs a trash route with little to no tech usage, see if you can build him a notification service so he can let out schedule changes to his customer base.\n\nMaybe you've got a neighbor who runs an etsy shop but has no way of managing their inventory.\n\nPoint is, get creative, think about whats around you and see if you can fill any gaps, don't just offer your services...offer a solution.\n\nThis is the route i did back in the day and I was always asked why I didn't just get \"a job\" or was told to \"just go get a job\" either related or unrelated and my view was at the time, i could either get experience or i could get money but at that point in time with how the market was i couldn't get both and only experience was what would lead to a career.\n\nBeen at it 14 years now. If this career is something you want to do, just stick with it, stay hungry, find ways to provide value to people...don't just offer \"software development services\"....figure out a way in your area to offer solutions.",

If you're feeling this unprepared, especially on coding which is make-or-break for Meta, it might be worth withdrawing now rather than risking the cooldown period. The fact that you're questioning whether you'd even be happy there makes it an easier decision imo.\n\nThat said, you mention system design feels solid and behavioral is manageable with prep - those are two major components. The coding rounds are definitely the wildcard here. If you do decide to withdraw, be upfront with your recruiter about needing more time to prepare rather than making excuses. Most recruiters appreciate honesty and might be more flexible about future timing. You could also try reaching out to coaches on platforms like prepfully who've been through Meta interviews recently to get a realistic assessment of your readiness in a mock setting.\n\nEither way, don't beat yourself up about it - better to interview when you're genuinely ready than to rush it and potentially hurt your chances for months.",

That is a way to make the WFH day worse than an office day.\n* Wake up at the same time as you would going to the office. It's tempting to wake up at like 9 AM. Don't.\n* Hooray! You have just freed up a block of time you can use to do whatever you want instead of walking to the office and sitting in a bus. I usually use it to start my morning slow. I wake up, go take a shower, put on fresh clothes, go prepare a real breakfast, and then eventually get to work. No rush. I am trying to wake up a little easier and actually fit more into this. Like, if I am able to get up earlier than usual on the WFH days, I could probably get the right temperature for a quick run and bike ride before the usual routine.\n* I have time flexibility. If I wake up early and I don't feel like doing the full morning routine, I just do a minimal one, get to work early, and call it a day early. The only requirement we have for WFH days is that there are two small blocks of time (1-2 hours each) where you **must** be available to answer a call. As long as you are available to answer a call during those two blocks, nobody really cares how you organize your time.\n* Set boundaries with extreme precision. It's very easy both to overwork yourself and work through your lunch break, and do the opposite - just go do something else and take an extra long break that ends up biting you. I try to use timers and alarms.\n* If possible, I try to get out of the house right after work. Quick walk, going to some event or gathering with friends, run some errands, etc. I find it's beneficial if you \"simulate\" the same separation rituals you get from an office day, except they are not time completely thrown into the garbage, but time slots for things that are good for you, or tasks that you should make anyway.\n\nExtra goated golden bonus tip:\n\n* If I want to take a break, instead of just going to get a coffee and use my phone or talk to people a bit as I'd do in the office, I do a quick errands break. Like, I do a part of an house chore I need to make. Load up and unload the dishwasher, clean the kitchen, something like that. This has two benefits: 1) it keeps you active and away from your screen, which is the best way to get a break. 2), when done consistently, it frees up a surprising amount of free time. So, after you work, you have to do less errands and you have more **really** free time",

Networking is very simply *making friends*. Forming genuine relationships with people.\n\nIt's not forming fake relationships where the sole purpose you're speaking is to use them to get you a job.\n\nTech meetups are common suggestions for \"networking\", but that's not because it's a place people go to connect on LinkedIn. It's because it's a place where people that all have a shared interest go to do that shared interest together. When you do that, you *make friends* with those people. When they're your friends, they're now in your network.\n\nYou could go to a rock climbing meetup and it would have the exact same effect. You could go to your local dive bar and make friends with John Doe over a night of heavy drinking. It doesn't matter if John Doe is in tech or not, all that matters is that John Doe *has a job*. Anyone at a company can refer people to any position. Even if John's in sales, his company is likely hiring SWE's, and he'll be happy to refer a *genuine friend*.\n\nIt's not something that really happens overnight, forming a network takes time.

All the information you need is available online for absolutely free, you can also pay for some relatively cheap books to help.  System design is well written about and a lot of free content you can find to fill that gap. System design isn't even taught in most CS programs so if you're expecting that from a CS degree you'll be left wondering why they graduate students with so little system design knowledge.  Most CS programs focus on theoretical foundations and DSA all of which you can learn for free online.",

Totally get where you're coming from :') The jump from bootcamp to senior-level system design can feel pretty overwhelming, especially when you're in meetings and people start throwing around complex algorithms and architectural patterns like its nothing.\n\nYou're right that there's a gap between what most bootcamps teach and the deeper CS fundamentals needed for system design. At Metana, we've definitely seen this progression, people who get comfortable with their first language but then hit a wall when it comes to designing scalable systems.\n\nThe thing is, you don't need to go back to school for a full degree. You just need the right fundamentals,  algorithms, data structures, distributed systems concepts, and database design. Most of the 'scary math' conversations are honestly just people showing off half the time.\n\nAlso worth considering, maybe look into some of the more intensive programs that bridge this gap? There are options between bootcamps and full degrees that focus specifically on systems and architecture for working developers. Way more practical than starting from scratch with calculus and discrete math.\n\nYou've got 5 years of experience and domain knowledge, that's actually pretty valuable. You just need to fill in the CS theory gaps, not rebuild everything from ground up.",

There are various sorts of \"systems design interview prep\" resources you can look into, and that might help you participate in the conversations you run into.\n\nLike many things in this field though, that all barely scratches the surface and there's a lot to learn by just being in the trenches.

That's why we first saw the engineers get cut. The dev owners and leaders get more face time and essentially blamed the engineers. Then after that didn't fix anything the started cutting middle management who told them it was the engineers fault. \n\nNow they don't know why to do so they're bringing in consulting forms and offshoring work to fill in the gaps. From what I can tell these consulting firms as really leaning on the specialized/clear cut responsibilities by telling the businesses it's impossible to higher one expert who can respond to a wide variety of issues and software in today's specialized tool environment in a timely manner. The way to fix that is using consulting firms to bring in say an architect for a month, then bring in a cloud designer for a few months, once the architecture is setup bring in the engineers. Meanwhile now you're no longer paying an architect salary after the main chunk of work is done. \n\nI actually tend to agree with it but it's going to suck for us all around people",

I'm on the team that built a tool for [AI interview practice](http://interviews.chat), and it's actually really helpful for practicing responses to those curveball questions that can throw you off during long interview days like this.",

That time you spent hours debugging a segmentation fault, or when you had to figure out why your algorithm was timing out on edge cases, or even when you struggled to understand a complex concept and had to try multiple approaches before it clicked - these are all valid technical challenges that demonstrate problem-solving skills.\n\nThe key is to structure your answer around the process rather than the complexity of the problem itself. Pick something where you can clearly explain what went wrong, what steps you took to diagnose and solve it, what you learned, and how it made you a better developer. Maybe it was implementing a data structure from scratch, debugging a tricky race condition in a multithreaded program, or optimizing a slow database query. Focus on your methodology, resourcefulness, and growth mindset rather than trying to impress with technical complexity.

It varies by company. But in the end there should be an onboarding of how to build, test, etc.\n\nBefore any of that, your first day will likely be signing up for benefits (insurances), payroll, etc. This shoudl be the absolute first thing you do so you get your money in the bank and not through a check mailed to you.\n\nGet your W-4 completed (takes like 5 minutes tops). Im not a financial adviser in any way but if you get RSUs, i'd suggest having them take a certain amount extra per check to account for the RSUs when you start to get them. I got burned by this the fist time I got RSUs. Because tehy are considered bonus they are taxed differently so I ended up owing a good amount to the IRS my first year. Ideally I try to have them take 100 per check to account for that.\n\nSign up for any 401k accounts too. Your future self will thank you later. Put as much as you think is fair, experts suggest 12-15% a year.\n\nAs for the job. Your first week is usually onboarding and then you get small tasks and build up confidence in the code. Ask your manager when he expects you to start getting bigger tasks. If he/she says in 3 months, try to get ahead of everything. If they say that the first week they only expect you to run tests and build, try to get that doen within the first few days and then by thursday tell them you are done and if you can at least look at the first task to get an idea of where to start.\n\nAsk questions, dont be afraid to reach out to people. it's scary at first but passive devs are the ones that get booted. If you start doing it before your manager has to say it, your manager will thank you. Managers have so much on their plate so they love devs who they dont ahve to say anything to, they just trust the dev will always be ahead of the pack. So if your manager is hoping to get you a task after 3 months, try to be ready at the 2nd month. Better to have him tell you to slow down then having to tell you to hurry up.\n\n  \nEdit: also just to add. To emphasive the dont be a passive dev, report what you do. You have to play a game to a certain level. I once had a seniro dev tell me that it is better to do 2 tasks and report it during stand up and create dialogue about it (take ove rthe screen and show results for example, ask questions about being stuck, etc) than it is to do 10 tasks and just make simple 1 comment about progress that doesnt create discussion. Being stuck on the same task that should've taken a few days, but you are just stuck for weeks and dont say anything in stand up is a huge turnoff. \n\nAlso find a mentor or senior friend you can do work with at a certain point. Someone who will hype you up to the manager and you can work along side with. At a certain point if you can be the guy who gets name-called during stand up, that's a plus. Even in meetings wher eyou are not there. Im talking about when someone has a report and they say \"OP helped me get past this issue\" or \"OP made an interesting observation\" at a certain point someone is going to say \"wow OP is making good contributions\" and someone might be like \"who is this OP everybody is talking about\".",

Would love to hear if there's anything that can be improved, especially regarding my bullet points. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Kq2QqfS](https://imgur.com/a/Kq2QqfS)",

Direct company career pages - boring but effective, especially for mid-size companies that aren't drowning in applications yet\n\n3. Networking/referrals - I know everyone says this but it's still the fastest path through the noise\n\nLinkedIn and Indeed are honestly black holes right now. You're competing with thousands of other people hitting \"easy apply\" on the same roles. The companies I work with get so many applications through those channels that they barely look at them unless you have some serious keywords or connections.\n\nHave you tried reaching out to recruiters who specialize in your tech stack? Not the spray-and-pray types, but ones who actually understand the technical side. We tend to have roles that aren't posted publicly yet.\n\nWhat's your tech stack btw? That might change the strategy a bit.\n\nAre you just applying to big companies or also interested in startups?\n\nGood luck!",

Let's be honest, most of us have days even weeks where we arent our most proactive especially in this career. Some jobs care more than others but when it comes to light it doesnt look great, so i'd say maybe spend the next few weeks/months being the most proactive you could be so that one week is your only small ding. \n\nManagers udnerstand nobody is perfect and if that's your one ding then they wont hold it against you, if you try to do a better job im sure theyll see that and maybe not even put it in your next review or hold it against you.\n\nJust be honest.\n\nIf you dont mind me asking, while you were waiting on it, what did you do that week?\n\nTwiddling fingers is a big thing that happens in this career because a lot of time there is so much downtime and waiting that it's hard to not do it sometimes. Managers know it happens and try to combat that which is why they like when employees try to make up the time doing other things. So maybe if this happens again, bring it up to the manager like \"hey her transfer is taking longer than expected. Any other options I can do to get mine's done if not, what work can I pick up?\"",

If done regularly, it wouldnt take more than 20 minutes to get the CD, transfer it go through protocols and put it in the secure network. But if you let it add up, it would exponentially be slower and slower. \n\nOne time we had to transfer some major data coming in from an even higher network that was barely used but people started to use it more as the project was winding down. We realized that the higher network just was never updated so we had to routinely update it with huge transfers. I put the CD in, it took me half days work to do it. Thankfully one of the Product owners ntocied in the first week it was taking me forever so he told me he had a secure hard drive that I could use whenever I needed to transfer huge data and it cut my time down by so much.\n\n  \nAgain take it as a learning lesson. I've done your same mistake before of not asking on day 1, it's something I am trying to improve to because if you keep pushing it back then it's day 10 and you still have made no progress. Your not the only SWE to make that mistake and it's a common thing that many SWEs go through.",

A fresh program is fine as long as the courses exist; what matters is the network and brand, and McGill opens more doors in NYC or TO than Western. Having no funding hurts, but you’ll finish in 12–16 months instead of two years of thesis work, so the extra tuition is basically the cost of a quicker paycheck. Spend that saved time building a project portfolio, grinding Kaggle comps, and lining up summer gigs.\n\nI tried LinkedIn Premium for recruiter reach and LeetCode Premium for interview prep, but JobMate is the tool I keep running to fire off apps while I focus on networking coffees.\n\nMcGill MEng is the quicker route to a DS/ML industry role.",

If you have a PhD in Physics, you don't want to apply for jobs that are going to emphasize things you cannot bring to the table. So you don't want to apply for jobs where they're going to be looking for you to be a shallow generalist or a specialist in something you don't do.\n\nThis is the trap people fall into - they see 500 jobs that they could technically do and apply to all of them.\n\nInstead, you want to focus on applying to the jobs where not only can someone with your background be successful, but really where almost only people with your type of background can be successful. \n\nGenerally speaking, that is going to be companies working on solving things that aren't fully solved. Some people will call this R&D or research or innovation, but at its core you want to look for things that are not just standard, off-the-shelf solutions.\n\nWhat you want to avoid is generic \"entry level data scientist for Fortune 500 company training ML models\".\n\nNow, what can you do to enhance your resume:\n\n1. Make sure you cram Python hard. C++, C#, Java are all good too, and there might be some niche industries where other languages are relevant, but if you're blindly going to pick one, it needs to be Python, and you want to be able to show up as a very strong Python coder. \n\n2. Make sure you cram SQL. It's not as critical as it once was, but you still need to make sure you are fairly competent with SQL: select, group by, inner/left/full/right joins, partition by/window functions, nested queries, and CTEs.\n\n3. Assuming you're looking into AI/ML: make sure you learn about/brush up on as many of the basics of ML: regression, classification, clustering, A/B testing, NLP. \n\n4. If you want to go for maximum marketability and you have the time/ability to do so: either a) dive into some of the \"under the hood\" LLM stuff, or b) learn how to build LLM-powered applications. There's no easier path to getting a high paying job right now than being able to contribute to LLM stuff. And realistically, it's a new enough field that there should be plenty of room for someone with a Physics PhD to find an area within it where you can get yourself up to speed and be dangerous.",

Positions such as senoir data science frequently have hiring managers or recruiters who only look for experience in industry in the exact right platforms and tools and dont consider anything in terms of applicable skill.\n\nSomeone with a PhD isn't normally going to go straight to a Senior role unless their research experience is directly relevant to a specific industry.\n\nIf I were you, I wouldn't be looking for Senior roles - I would be looking for entry level roles in highly competitive industries. Like, a Senior Data Scientist at some middle tier tech company is probably making less money than an entry level data scientist at a hedge fund, top tier tech company, cutting edge startup with lots of money, etc.\n\nSo again, don't think \"well, I'm smart enough to be able to do something as well as a more senior data scientist who *doesnt'* have a PhD\", because not only is that not right (experience in industry matters), but also hiring managers won't agree with you.\n\nInstead, I would look for jobs where you can say \"typical entry-level data scientist with a BS in CS could not handle this\", and those are the jobs you want to apply for. I think startups would also be a good place for someone like you vs. mega dino tech companies (and I say this as someone who works in a mega dino tech company).\n\n>Also, to be sure, what does llm powered application mean ? Does that mean how to work with and guide and direct llms to build and put together coding scripts and libraries with which to build apps ?\n\nThat means a piece of software that uses API calls to an LLM provider (OpenAI, Claude, whatever) to do stuff. You're not actually making contributions to the underlying LLM model, you're making a piece of software that uses an existing model. There is a spectrum too - there's stuff like RAG systems where you're not retraining the model per se, but you're adapting the model for your own application with your own data.",

It is a tiring, exhausting process but i still apply with hope in my heart to see if i can land a job which might get me out of these paradoxes in 2-3 years. Sad part is, that i've given up on the field i raised myself in.

Maybe it won't immediately materialize into a job in the field and title of \"AI Researcher\" but the barrier for entry to understand what people are working on and trying is not insane. You could probably eventually find some kind of consulting work to use other people's money to train a custom model on their data with some published training technique, or just get hired by a smaller company or internal shop.
