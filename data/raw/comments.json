Either the offshore quality drops due to conditions in their own country deteriorating or individual resource quality drops enough that something triggers a management 5-Alarm fire drill trying to fix offshores output.

The main analyst freaked out, suddenly quit, formed his own company, and poached the entire staff of his original team leaving only the ‚Äúmanager‚Äù for that team. The guy pretended everything was fine for 2 weeks and told nobody that he was soloing all this work. During that two weeks, he fucked up some report for management that made the corporate metrics look absolutely dogshit which triggered an analytics all hands meeting to figure out what was happening. Offshore ‚Äúmanager‚Äù joined remotely and when leadership asked to see the rest of the team, he just said,‚Äù what team? They all quit.

        "body": "Let me take a crack at it with a handful of examples:\n\n**First Normal Form (1NF): No Crowded Rows**\n\nEvery row should be unique, and you can't stuff multiple rows into one cell.\n\n*   **Rule:** Each cell in a table should have only one value.\n*   **Example:** Let's say you have a table of your friends and their favorite colors.\n\n**Messy (Not 1NF):**\n\n    | Name  | Favorite Colors      |\n    | :---- | :------------------- |\n    | Alex  | Blue, Green          |\n    | Bella | Pink                 |\n\nTo make this 1NF, you give each favorite color its own row:\n\n**Organized (1NF):**\n\n    | Name  | Favorite Color |\n    | :---- | :------------- |\n    | Alex  | Blue           |\n    | Alex  | Green          |\n    | Bella | Pink           |\n\nNow, every field in your table has just one piece of information.\n\n**Second Normal Form (2NF): Everything in its Right Place**\n\nThis rule is for tables that have a composite key, i.e. made of more than one part. It says that everything in the table should be about the *whole* key, not just a piece of it.\n\n*   **Rule:** Be in 1NF and have no partial dependencies. This means that all the information in a row must depend on the entire primary key.\n*   **Example:** Imagine a table for pizza orders. The key is the `Customer` and the `Pizza Type`.\n\n**Messy (Not 2NF):**\n\n    | Customer | Pizza Type | Customer's Favorite Topping |\n    | :------- | :--------- | :-------------------------- |\n    | Sam      | Pepperoni  | Olives                      |\n    | Mia      | Cheese     | Pineapple                   |\n    | Sam      | Veggie     | Olives                      |\n\nThe problem here is that the \"Favorite Topping\" is only about the `Customer`, not what kind of pizza they ordered that day. To fix this, we can split the table into two:\n\n**Organized (2NF):**\n\n**Orders Table:**\n\n    | Customer | Pizza Type |\n    | :------- | :--------- |\n    | Sam      | Pepperoni  |\n    | Mia      | Cheese     |\n    | Sam      | Veggie     |\n\n**Customers Table:**\n\n    | Customer | Favorite Topping |\n    | :------- | :--------------- |\n    | Sam      | Olives           |\n    | Mia      | Pineapple        |\n\nNow, the \"Favorite Topping\" is in a table all about the customers.\n\n### **Third Normal Form (3NF): No Secret Information Hiding**\n\nThis is about making sure that the information in your table is only about the main topic (the key) and not about other things in the same table.\n\n*   **Rule:** Be in 2NF and have no transitive dependencies (in other words, each cell on the row should *only* depend on the key, not on other cells)\n*   **Example:** Let's look at a table about your favorite Disney characters. We'll throw in their first movie appearance for good measure.\n\n**Messy (Not 3NF):**\n\n    | Character         | Movie               | Movie's Director |\n    | :---------------- | :------------------ | :--------------- |\n    | Buzz Lightyear    | Toy Story           | John Lasseter    |\n    | Woody             | Toy Story           | John Lasseter    |\n    | Elsa              | Frozen              | Chris Buck       |\n\nHere, the \"Movie's Director\" is really about the `Movie`, not the `Character`. If the director changes, you'd have to update it for every character in that movie. So, we split it up:\n\n**Organized (3NF):**\n\n**Characters Table:**\n\n    | Character         | Movie       |\n    | :---------------- | :---------- |\n    | Buzz Lightyear    | Toy Story   |\n    | Woody             | Toy Story   |\n    | Elsa              | Frozen      |\n\n**Movies Table:**\n\n    | Movie     | Director      |\n    | :-------- | :------------ |\n    | Toy Story | John Lasseter |\n    | Frozen    | Chris Buck    |\n\nNow, the director is in the \"Movies\" table, which makes more sense.",

E.g. you have the patient name, age, gender, etc. The doctor's age, name, gender, specialty, license number, job title, etc. You could store all this data in one table, but it's not very efficient and it may end up causing issues later. \n\nImagine what that table looks like, every time person A sees a doctor, you're writing to the database all the data about Person A, their name, their age, their gender etc. so if person A has 100 encounters, you're storing their gender 100 times. Same with the doctor. Every time the doctor sees a patient, if you store all the data about the doctor, you're storing their name every time. In addition to being very inefficient from a space perspective, it's harder to modify data later. Let's assume the doctor changes their name. Now you have to go back and update the doctor's name at every instance it was recorded in the database. \n\nInstead if you normalize the data, you have one record in a patient table to represent a patient, and one record in a doctor table to represent the doctor. Then you just give each record an ID and \"point\" to those records when you want to reference them from somewhere else in the database. It also has the benefit of conceptually distinguishing the different entities in the universe of data.",

I managed a team doing the platform work in this case, and we did build some great stuff: a linter that would block PRs if the SQL was messy, really useful costing analysis comparing actuals to planned budget, etc, etc.  But it was a brutal fight to attempt to prevent the entire solution from collapsing under the weight of tech debt.  It would have been far easier to have actual engineers build the data pipelines.\n   * In most of the data engineering teams I'm on we also build the platform anyway: all the reusable code, libraries, extra tooling for deploying models, quality-control checks on the data, etc, etc.",

However, that isn't the end of the world at a company like AWS which focuses a lot on working in AWS toolsets. You will learn a lot of the tools on the job if you dedicate the effort and time to it.\n\nSQL knowledge will get you by on a large portion of the job but for the specific things they're calling out like legacy ML code is likely going to be in Python or another language. You can definitely learn to code in those but reviewing, refactoring, and optimizing takes a lot of on the job experience to do well. \n\nI suggest really diving into understanding the broader concepts behind modern data engineering and working on some projects in Python at the very least. Example: build an ETL pipeline to pull data from a public API, shape it, and write it to a database. Then build a simple dashboard for it",

They can continue to work as normal if you don't \"drop in\".\n\n4) We've also had similar success with \"co-working\" hours a couple times a week which is just a zoom that anyone can drop into and chat or just sit and work but be available for others to ping.  If the manager is smart they will ask their Seniors/Tech leaders/wannabe Seniors to make themselves available during this time as part of their demonstration of leadership.\n\nBoth 3 and 4 are intended to help with avoiding constant interruptions for go-to folks so they can get into their flow state, while still helping those who need it by setting aside time to make themselves available for technical help / mentoring / problem solving / etc",

It's in python, so not the fastest, but I did benchmark it with billion row files.  I think it took about 15 minutes, but don't recall of the top of my head.\n\nWith data in a relational database(-ish), I'd probably create the diff using SQL, write the output to tables (except for the Sames), then generate the ids while appending/updating to the original input table.

You get to see a successful production implementation and understand what it takes to maintain one\n* On-prem isn't sexy, but the tooling otherwise seems pretty modern\n* WLB matters a lot to most people's long-term careers. You have to be disciplined about \"coasting,\" but most of us need to spend time operating well below capacity to avoid burnout\n* Data teams functioning as support can struggle for visibility, which means career opportunities can be limited\n\nStartup thoughts:\n\n* Product data roles are relatively rare. I've turned down a few product-based roles and work with product engineers. My impression is that your incentives are very different from internal-facing work\n* It's probably going to be sink-or-swim. They wouldn't have extended an offer if they didn't think you could hack it, but if you like more support, it's probably not a good fit\n* There's likely very little structure around teams, advancement, and growth. It's very common for everyone to believe in \"the mission,\" and your major target is less about titles and salary and more about driving the company to IPO / acquisition, so your equity is worth something\n* If you actually get to work on streaming / near-realtime, that experience is very valuable to a smaller number of employers. Data warehousing / batch processing is much more widely applicable\n\nHow I'd think about the decision:\n\n* Are you OK with being tossed in the deep end and figuring things out? That's likely the expectation at the startup\n* Are you comfortable with more than just doing heads-down work? Startups generally require you to be more cross-functional / collaborative since you may not have mature processes (product management, team leads, etc.)\n* Are you capable of managing burnout? This can be a problem at both places, but your manager at the corpo probably has more experience identifying and heading it off (lowering workload, encouraging vacation / holiday, etc.)\n* Is working on the latest tech really important to you? If it is, the startup is a no brainer. If you're OK with learning more enduring patterns on an older stack, this is less of a differentiating factor",

Hadoop/Spark/Hive experience is still okay, but it‚Äôs much more ‚Äúlegacy enterprise‚Äù skillset. If you want options in NA or EU in a few years, cloud-native experience will open way more doors.\n2. **Customer-facing product experience:** Working on something that thousands of companies actually use is huge. It shows you can handle scale, real-time systems, and impact‚Äîstuff recruiters notice. Internal ETL for business ops at a big company looks nice on a resume but doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúcan build product-grade systems.‚Äù\n3. **Fast-paced, growth environment:** Yes, it‚Äôs stressful and work-life balance might suck a bit, but that‚Äôs exactly where you learn the most. You‚Äôll get exposure to data validation, lineage tracking, fraud detection pipelines‚Äîthese are highly in-demand skills.\n4. **International opportunities:** The tech stack + product experience will make moving abroad far easier than internal enterprise ops work. People hiring in NA or EU will instantly recognize those skills.\n\nIf you want a chill ride and don‚Äôt care about moving internationally or building the ‚Äúmodern data engineer‚Äù skillset, A is fine. But for leveling up, B is the one that actually sets you up for the future.\n\nBasically: stress now ‚Üí way more options later. That‚Äôs how I see it.",

Otherwise, you could just stringify and concatenate them and they'd be human readable. This isn't a question about why compound keys are used it's about why they are hashed.",

Most big BI products (like Power BI) can't use composite keys and want you to turn them into strings and concatenate them instead and join on those, which is terribly bad for performance and resource usage, so hashing to a number and joining on those is preferred.\n\nAnother hopefully rarer case, for columns where it contains PII and they want to hash it to get it out of the dataset. You'd think, \"who stores fucking PII in a key column?!\", but in PICK and other old databases (which might still feed newer databases) it totally did. SSNs? SURNAME F? Phone number?

        "body": "I've been designing DW solutions for 30 years. Up until recently, surrogate keys were always defined as int or bigint and to generate them you used a sequential number generator or similar.  This meant a couple things.  You almost always had to process your dimension before facts (because the dimension table contained the mapping of the business keys to the dw surrogate key assigned).  When processing fact tables, for every fk, you would need to lookup the associated surrogate key in the corresponding dimension table.  In the old days when we were all using OLTP based database systems like Oracle and SQL Server (on-prem because that is all we had), using integer based surrogates added in performance at query time).  Later Dan L came up with Data Vault methodolgy.  That is a very different way of modelling with one of the often listed benefits of being able to process in parallel entities that would be come dimensions from those that were facts.  To do this, he used hashing (of some sort) so that you didn't necessarily have to process data in a certain order (apologies if I have some of this wrong....I only worked on 1 DV project 14 years ago).    The other thing which occurred was columnar database solutions, the cloud and elastic and ultra scalable dbms solutions like Snowflake (and before that Terradata and Netezza).  These systems reduce/eliminate the need to worry about defining surrogate keys as integers and using a hash methodology works fine so hence, you now see many practitioners use a fixed length deterministic hash column as the surrogate.\n\nBTW:  one of the lesser known reasons for using a surrogate (based on a sequential number generator) was that you build in some isolation from the source system.  While not common, systems of record have been known to change the key of a source record (probably seldom happens now) so using a surrogate key meant that it was possible to only need to change the relationship of the dimensional business key to the existing surrogate (no need to update the FK in all related fact tables where it occurred.  By using a hash, that won't work anymore since the source key fields which might change, will result in a different hash.  But since these new systems are so much faster, probably not a big deal (I don't recall ever running into that situation but I recall Ralph Kimball mentioning this in one of his books...I think)\n\napologies for rambling on.",

There are a few advantages:\n\n* Independent processing:  You can generate foreign key without needing to do a lookup. So you could create fact records without needing to join to already loaded dimensions, or satellite and link records without joining to hubs. This allows parallel processing that isn't dependent on load order (warning: it can also lead to including a foreign key that doesn't actually exist)\n* Prevent having to do multi-column joins. For example when you have to do a diff or merge for incremental load, you can join on the hash key. \n* Records from the same source data will have the same key in all environments. This can help in some testing scenarios. \n\nThere are some disadvantages such as increasing storage of the key, risk of collisions, and being less human-readable.",

Please add or correct. \n\nAdvantages of using hash function to generate a surrogate key over creating surrogate key from sequence \n\n1. During table load into distributed system, generating sequence could become a bottleneck where as if we use hash function based on business keys, they could be loaded independently parallel much faster. \n\n2. Anonymization: Hashing protects sensitive data by creating a oneway, non reversible key. By using hash keys, you ensure that the vast majority of your data warehouse users‚Äîwho are simply analyzing metrics‚Äîcan't even see the sensitive data because it's not present in the tables they access. Usually dimensional tables hold sensitive info like ssn, credit card etc. \n\n3. Efficiency while doing data lookups and data integration. Use of hash keyed surrogates avoid the need for what they call pre-join. Using a sequential key requires a lookup against the dimension table to find the correct key for a given business key. But if we are using hashed surrogates, we can derive this directly from the business keys and avoid pre-join. I think what they mean is an application querying with business keys does not need to go to the dimension tables first to find the sequence number foreign key and then use that to fetch fact table details. Instead, the application querying can directly generate a hash from the business keys that the user entered and query the fact table directly. \n\n4. If data is sourced from different source systems, the hashed key approach ensures the same key will be generated for say the same customer whereas if we use sequence, that will end up creating multiple records  for the same customer causing data integrity issues.",

I see plenty of code based ETL orchastration (Dagster, Airflow etc) but less GUI options unless I'm missing something key. The issue I have there is that for bigger places, code based works fine, they can have dedicated DE teams but smaller businesses and onw man band operations definitely get a benefit from simpler to use GUI based tools. I know at one point this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for.\n\nOne thing I'd suggest is trying to avoid a fixed requirement on docker containers or having a sprawl of dozens of individual components needing to run in tandem again for the smaller places/one man bands. They might not have capabilities to run Docker (IT blocking etc) and if the alternative is 15+ individual components all needing to be run at once then it'll be overwhelming.\n\nYour package avoids this currently so definitely worth sticking to that in my view. \n\nOutside of that some way to choose the destination DB engine would be good, Postgres is great and all but again smaller teams/OMBs might not get a choice and might be required to use MSSQL server or Oracle, or even just have a section within a larger warehouse like Teradata/Snowflake/Databricks that they get to use for operations. Don't think I saw anything for changing the write destination engine type so if I missed that then ignore me. \n\nGood work on it though!",

Efficiency and scaling aren't that important when the data you work with is <500k rows per source per month but its worth having something to remove the manual task of loading 10+ datasets. Less worth it when things like Dagster take the process and complicate it to hell with lots of new concepts that mean nothing to a business user. And yeah a python script with pandas and sqlalchemy could do it but that's assuming that the team have a python dev. Lot of data teams are basically SQL and their BI tool of choice only. This is where a simple GUI tool shines. They know the data, they know how they need to get it and where to get it but the how might as well be magic currently but a GUI tool to pick, load to staging and then do a series of basic cleaning steps to get it ready and save that as a flow they can schedule allows them a lot more capability and lets them get a lot more value from their data.",

Like I said, I was dealing with tens of thousands of simulation files regularly on hardware that would make you cry. This volume is nothing for current systems.\n\nSecond. You'll probably have to deal with files regardless. Most simulation software (I'm assuming it's a simulation, Markov chain analysis, probably?) dumps to files, though maybe yours can dump to a db. Doesn't matter.\n\nWhat I would do is let them save everything to a bucket/blob/network drive/whatever then have your warehouse pick it up from there and stuff into a database. You can easily add the filename and other metadata during ingest and then you can serve it up to them nicely from the database. Everyone is happy.\n\nAs for executing over 30 days, that's a single Python/bash/CLI of your choice script. Since it's an optimisation problem, I'm guessing you're setting up hyper parameters for each run. You can do that with a CSV and a short script to pick up the values for each run.\n\nDon't over complicate it. This is a pretty simple exercise.",

There are two main challenges in migrating it to modern systems:\n\n* First - modern systems do not speak the language of structured datasets - so you will have to break it down into two parts - ingestion and transformation, and\n* Second - that typically there are a ton of infa mappings that companies have created over a period of time that becomes a pain to catalog and go through one by one - so bulk migration almost seems like the only way out.\n\nThankfully there is a system that is fully capable of taking on Informatica mapping style pipelines - it is called tabsdata and is an on-prem system that you can run on bare metal or on k8s clusters on the cloud. Bottom line you own it and and run it. This system offers the pub/sub for tables model for ETL. Here is how you use it to migrate infa pipelines:\n\n* Step 1: for every input port in the infa pipeline, you create a publisher that reads the input table and creates a tabs data table.\n* Step 2: for every transform in the infa mapping, you can create a transformer in tabsdata that will take one or more tables within tabsdata and do your join/aggregate/filter etc.\n* Step 3: once you have created the curated dataset, you add subscribers to it so that they can be loaded into the target platform.\n\nWhile this sounds like more work than one-to-one migration of infa mappings, you will be surprised at the ease and reusability that this approach produces and that itself could cut the pipeline complexity and count significantly. Check out [this overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVITxb-HSPQ&t=20s) to see if this is the right thing for you. Hope this helps.",

A lot of companies have several databases, BI tools, and ways the analysts are going after the data. AtScale plays in the realm of Trino, Denodo, and other virtualization layers that aim to provide a single entry point to the company data. That way BI teams and analysts are able to query data that could reside across many systems. They then add on additional benefits like governance, optimization, cataloging, and the like. \n\nIn my opinion their current downside is the number of integrations they support compared to their competitors. Semantic layers really only work if they are the sole entry point, which is only possible if they can sit on top of all the company‚Äôs data sources.",

Backend: tables only on the share. Each user gets a local front end with linked tables. Turn on record-level locking, no datasheet edits, and keep persistent connections. Disable Offline Files on the share and use wired only. Nightly copy + compact/repair on a backup, not the live file.\n\n\\- Python GUI: wrap inserts/updates in explicit transactions, commit, and log the inserted PKs. Add a CreatedAt and a soft-delete flag to avoid hard deletes. Check for cascade deletes and filters that might hide ‚Äúmissing‚Äù rows.\n\n\\- Better: move the backend to SQL Server Express or Postgres on a small VM, link via ODBC so Access keeps working. Add a rowversion/updated\\_at for optimistic concurrency. Point the GUI to an API and keep the search hitting a read-only replica (SQLite/Parquet export hourly).\n\nI‚Äôve used Supabase and Hasura for quick APIs; DreamFactory helped when we needed REST over legacy DBs with RBAC so clients never touched the database directly.\n\nBottom line: put writes behind a server DB/API and keep Access as just a front end.",

Hive is 'simpler' than iceberg, which is both good and bad: **Good** because there is less involved management of the objects (no snapshots TTLs for example) and it is simpler to reason about the partitions and buckets (to some extent) but **bad** because you lack access to operations such as MERGE, DELETE, UPDATE that simplify the logic of the pipelines. In hive if you want to create a SCD2 you have to do it in more steps and always with the mindset that you have to move data to another temp or staging table in order to do a final insert with the data you want to 'update'. In iceberg you can just MERGE/UPSERT.\n\n\n2. Iceberg has more functionalities that enable you to write efficient tables and queries to access their data: z-order, bloom filters (supported to some extent in hive table format) and hidden partitions are a few of them, but now that I think about it not a lot of people used them to get the most out of the hardware. You can achieve great results while optimizing large tables if you use them in the right way (good sorting to improve compression, adding bloom filters for columns often used in equi-wheres, use the right type of merge (CoW/MoR) depending on how the data lands in the table and is queried, etc)\n\nI would prefer iceberg because of the extra functionalities to manipulate data, but without snapshots or at least a very simplified version of it.",

The first push tends to be implementing the documentation and catalogging best practices, which allows teams to get the early benefits of a catalog. \n\nThe challenge comes post-implementation where all of these stuff need to be maintained. This means that after every change to the tables, every new column, every change in team/domain structures, the governance steps need to be kept up-to-date. Someone needs to update lineage manually, change data quality rules, and make this a part of their development process.\n\nMy suggestion after implementing a couple of these types of solutions would be to either have a very clear post-implementation maintanence process mapped out, or to look for solutions that would already integrate the governance within the rest of the development lifecycle.",

We felt it was at risk of becoming \"shelfware\" if we couldn't automate the upkeep.\n\nWe then evaluated a few opensource catalogs, including Amundsen and DataHub, but ultimately, our specific needs took us in another direction. A huge chunk of our data is unstructured and lives in on prem resources. The challenge wasn't just cataloging a cloud data warehouse, but getting a handle on this massive, distributed file environment.\n\nWe ended up using the integrated catalog that comes with our storage platform, DeepSpace storage. It was a good fit because its core job is to manage all of our on prem file storage. Since DeepSpace is already tracking every file for its tiering and archival purposes. There's no drift between the catalog and the storage because the catalog¬†is¬†the storage's metadata. Our resources lean onprom though, we may have gone a different way if we were primarily in the cloud.",

I'd approach this from two perspectives: technical and practical/human. \n\nTechnical: having snapshots that go a considerable time back will lead you to using up a lot of storage (well, that really depends on the table specifications - number of rows, columns, data types etc.). Sometimes even having snapshots up to 2 weeks back may be too much. Every snapshot will have data files associated to it and I expect that running this query to do trending with snapshotted data will be quite slow after awhile. Eventually you will have to expire your old snapshots to optimize the table and you will lose data useful for trending.\n\nPractical/human: writing a query that does trending will be quite messy. You do not want to do trending on data that is \"hidden\" inside some snapshots that do not show up in the simple SELECT *. At the end of th day you should write queries that are simple to communicate to the business and could easily be taken over by other team members if needed. So to keep things simpler you should indeed go towards SCD2. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",

It is a daunting task, as in the act of taking the first step is monumental for a lot of folks (and why creating something you deem a 'stupid website hosted on aws with shitty architecture' is FAR more impressive than doing a calculator app (literally anyone can do it and there is not real value/insight to glean from it). It is like trying to do calculus when you can barely add two numbers. If someone wants to make a game without the foundation then they will most likely flounder about cause they are trying to start on step 10 where instead they need to start at step 1 (what language do you know, downloading an IDE etc...)\n\nBut with the prevalence of AI, the barrier has been reduced down considerably. I condone the idea of 'vibe' coding ie copy/pasting what you see and not digesting (reading what the AI spit out doesnt count). But I do recommend asking thoughtful questions that are small queries to AI (how to do print statement, why is ('hello' + d) not working etc...). And when you get the response back, think about why it is telling you the error is happening. So if ('I said hello' + 10 + 'times') threw an error then the AI might respond you cant add a str to an int. Now think about why that is ie you are adding two incompatible data types (string, int) which should lead you to asking what kind of data types are there and why data formatting is important etc...\n\nWork on the proof of concepts, small building blocks first. Even if it is stupid like learning how to add two numbers literally on some scratchpad of your coding IDE that will help you on your journey. It builds momentum, confidence and skill so you know what to employ .\n\nYour first iteration will suck ass. The first 1000 line of legitimate code will suck ass. Don't try to be perfect.

They're probably not going to read books and do 40 hours of assignments per week for four years.\n\nI'm tired of the \"it's just a piece of paper\" crowd. It \"looks weak\" without it because it is weak. Without a degree you have none of the business background, no math, no probability, no stats, no physics, no engineering, no logic, no years of proofs, no architecture, no operating systems, no systems programming, no threading, nothing.\n\nIt's my job to tutor all kinds of people. I've been watching people self-study vs university students, and the holes in their learning is immense. All they do is WebDev and LeetCode. They think they know Big O but they don't. They don't know that it's worst case and why worst case is the one that matters because they don't know what p and np are. They're failing interviews because they can't explain what a log is from high school math or a limit from Calculus. They think it's not important. They don't know binary or anything about how data is stored. They're grinding \"DSA\" but they don't know that cache misses make a program 100x slower, because they never took \"useless\" courses like architecture or operating systems. They don't really get what references are because they never managed memory. They don't know how to comment or write documentation. They've never seen an actor diagram. There are entire courses on all these topics. This is just off the top of my head.\n\nMeanwhile, cheating has ramped up big time over the past ten years. People were paying Indians thousands of dollars on Chegg and Upwork to do their entire coursework for them. I know this firsthand. That was before AI too. Now it's totally fucked. Teachers literally can't give homework and it's a learning crisis. I don't know why people pay so much for education just to cheat and get the paper but it's not long before employers catch on.\n\nEveryone has it backwards. The degree is what's invaluable, not the paper. If someone actually pays attention in school, they will learn things that others will never know. The reason why so many think education is useless is because so many cheated their asses off. It's ridiculous that people actually think there's nothing to be learned from four years of education, but here we are, defending it again from Reddit.\n\nHere's a link for anyone who wants to self-learn:  \n[https://github.com/ossu/computer-science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)",

        "body": "Do you want to be a computer scientist, a software engineer, or a web developer?\n\nWhen you get a degree in CS, you are studiying it at the level of a scientist, meaning conducting original research is the goal. That means publishing scientific papers. You don't need a degree for this, but if you want to study it at this level, you will also be reading a lot of scientific papers as well.\n\nIf you want to be an engineer, like an actual engineer that requires certifications and to be able to code well enough that you're applying engineering principles to every project. If you want to be a REAL engineer, then that usually means gaining certifications from accredited organizations and/or governments. Think about it this way: A software engineer is, ideally, the type of person that creates software systems for things like nuclear power plants, utilitiy companies, hospitals etc.I look at it as you're working on aserious infrastructure projects and your code cannot break under any circumstances because the consequences could be catastrophic, costing people lives and stuff It always needs a failsafe if bad things happen. Like it still has to work somehow even if AWS or Azure servers go down. Multiple redudancies and all that.\n\nIf you simply want to code, you're a developer that mainly works n consumer grade apps. You don't need a degree or even necessarily certifications. You just need a somewhat robust portfolio, personal and volunteer projects, getting your apps into app stores, etc. IF things break down, people are merely inconvenienced.\n\n  \nDon't listen to all these others about a CS degree being meaningless. Even if you never work in industry, the benefits of being able to understand parts of society at a funademental level is valuable in and of itself....kind of like how a philosophy degree is a great investment in that it teaches you critical thinking skills",

Like I had tons of friends in college who liked the idea of making software, working from home or making good money, but few of them liked reading docs, trial and error, and learning DSAs. Not saying you 100%  have to like all these things, but if you are lacking, you better do them like you love them. \n\nHere‚Äôs what you need to do, even if you don‚Äôt like it.\n\nLeetcode is a terrible assessment of ability, but I do believe you could get up to speed in about a month of regular study, at least enough for interviews. Go to neetcode, learn the algorithms first for the section you are about to try, then go do them. 30 mins is your max timer, if you get there, look up  the answer, and move on. At the end of your session go back and do the ones you missed. It took me about 2 weeks to get up to speed. \n\nPick a language, and ‚Äúmaster it‚Äù. What I mean by this is find a language you actually enjoy, who cares if it‚Äôs the most practical. Learn the basics, tips and tricks, become familiar with the standard library, build a pair with it, connect to a database with it, etc etc. roadmaps.sh is a good resource for what order to learn things. Being very capable in one language does help as you are aware of what is possible, then you can go translate it into another language. \n\nYou like frontend? Pick 3 popular websites, and remake them. For each use a different frontend stack if you don‚Äôt know what you like. I‚Äôll choose them for you, tailwindcss with svelte, bulma with React, and plain CSS with vanilla JS. Don‚Äôt stop until you have a working homepage and links. Add to GitHub and repeat. Obviously go expand on this as you go but these are starting points. Along the way take the time to explore and learn. \n\nSince it seems you‚Äôre still in school, get a tutor, join clubs, make friends to program with, go to hackathons, go to game jams, job fairs, etc etc. \n\nIf you really want to do this, write down a plan that would make it seem silly if you didn‚Äôt make it and then go execute. Stop saying you like the idea and go become one. \n\nCheers, if you want more specific advice regarding what to do let me know. Best of luck.",

It's a useless metric for actually working on code.\n\nImagine programming as a gigantic space of possibilities. You're searching for positions (programs) in that space that fulfil certain functional (the thing the program should do) and usually some non-functional requirements (memory/time constraints, being readable and maintainable). There's not one solution but many, but they are far out (as far as lines you need to write to get there). Each line you write gets you closer to some solutions and farther from others.\n\nUnless you have decades of experience and the program is quite small, it's usually not possible to just \"see\" a good solution and write it down in one go. You need to iterate on it, write parts of it you know will likely be part of a good solution. And even identifying those is lots of experience. Often you'll have to rewrite parts to make it work.\n\nThe first running prototype is usually garbage because it shows the meandering path you took to get there. Restructuring and cleaning up your solution is still expected when you work on large programs, so that the overall commit history doesn't look like a rabbit on acid typed it. This is something that is discussed in professional settings as well. If coders think refactorings are necessary, who will pay for them? Some teams just silently do them as part of other tasks, others try to communicate the need to higher ups.\n\n>  I've tried the Algorithmic thinking tip from the FAQ to help me plan the processes, but I don't notice classes and objects immediately\n\nThat part of the FAQ is not for planning programs. It's for translating doing something into a series of steps that a complete moron (i.e. a computer) can follow and not missing anything in the process. It won't help you with planning ahead.

Even if I don't have a project at work, I find other projects to do.\n\n5. Keep learning. I like to read blogs and post about new and old coding ideas. \n\n  \nI hope this helps! Happy coding!",

No one here has done any of these fire-and-forget cloud apps, and I haven't had a single interviewee with such a portfolio. The problem nowadays is more that nearly everything that one person can do in a reasonable amount of time is already out there as a neatly packaged tutorial, so it's not easy to distinguish whether the person has actually done that themselves or not. It helps, but it's not as indicative as it used to be.\n\n> On the job market, you are not a ‚Äúprogrammer‚Äù anymore. You are someone who is familiar with a very narrow set of tools, and need to market yourself accordingly.\n\nSadly true, but it's a bit more nuanced. There are tons of coders out there, so if you have an open position, there is no reason to not take someone already familiar with the needed stack - and in turn people who don't market themselves as that won't register.

Set a time limit for your project, then once done or time has run out reflect on what you wanted to achieve, what you did achieve, what problems you encountered, how you solved them and what you would do different next time, afterwards, move on to the next project.

Your brain just gets lazy and used to it. This isn't even unique to AI, this is just how learning works, reddit can do the same if people wouldn't be so openly hostile towards people asking for help with minor issues.

It is in part because children aren't self-conscious about trying to talk - they'll just say shit and if they say it wrong, whatever, an adult will correct them. Whereas adults will be hesitant to even try to speak until they're sure they'll say the right thing, which slows learning right now.\n\nYou really do need to work from the bottom up mastering the basics first.

        "body": "There's a concept called the Entity Component System model, or ECS which solves this issue in a way that also makes writing high performance code much easier. \n\nThe idea is that instead of having discrete classes for different kinds of creatures, items, or other game entities with all sorts of complex logic attached to them, you create simple data structure called an entity. An entity is usually nothing more than some kind of ID value, like an integer, UUID, or even a string. You then \"attach\" additional small components to that entity which give it additional properties. It's these components that hold the data that would have been held in the class. So the `hasHealth` component would hold maybe 2 numbers, max health and current health.  \n\nAll of the logic for the various components is handled by a set of \"system\" classes. Their job is to handle the logic associated with the various components. For example, the health system would handle adding or removing health on entities with a health component.\n\nTypically the way ECS are written let you query the world for entities with specific components (or the components of an entity and such), or sometimes more complex conditions like \"has components x y and z, but not a\". This query then will find the components that match and produce a list of entries which can then be processed by the system.\n\nThis is probably complete overkill for what you're doing, but it's becoming a very popular way to write games. It gets rid of the awkward problems that come from a more object oriented approach, and completely strips all dependencies between components and entities. This allows you to build up unique entities simply by combining different discrete components. Of course, for unique interactions you would occasionally still need to make 1-off components, but a *lot* can be done with only a small collection of basic components when you can freely mix and match everything, and implementing new kind of entities is often just a matter of figuring out what components they need.\n\nThis roguelike tutorial in Rust does a great job of explaining/teaching how you might use an ECS in a roguelike game: https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/chapter_2.html\n\nRoguebasin has a very basic Python implementation of an ECS: https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Entity_Component_System\n\nThere's a ton more information on ECS out there, this was just meant to give you a very very rough idea of the overall concept. There are quite a few ECS libraries out there in a whole ton of languages, but it's not that difficult to write your own either (at least as long as your not trying to squeeze every bit of performance out of it).\n\nHere are a couple blog posts that explain ECS and implement one:\n\nC++ - https://www.codingwiththomas.com/blog/an-entity-component-system-from-scratch\n\nC++ - https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/\n\nC# - https://matthall.codes/blog/ecs/\n\nHere's an ECS FAQ: https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq?tab=readme-ov-file",

But with #define it will just put in whatever you typed, say 1.1 but with const it will put '1.1d0', this is just a short hand for 1.1000000000....\n\nThis kind of thing matters for precision calculations.  If you use only 1.1, the compiler will automatically choose the lowest precision for you, so it is 1.100000.  \n\nNow, you may be wondering how about \n\n> \\#define N (1.1d0)\n\nThe problem can be shown with this:\n\n> printf(\"%f\", N)\n\nThis will work if N is 1.1 but it will fail when N is 1.1d0.  The reason is because when it is 1.1, the C standard automatically casts it as float by detecting it as a decimal number.  But it doesn't know how to handle 1.1d0 in this context.  In fact most functions don't even do casting for you.  However with a 'const' the standard knows exactly what to do and printf's templating macro code knows how to pick the right printf to be linked into your program.",

As a QA you probably don‚Äôt need to know more than the basics about docker and kubernetes, but things like APIs and webhooks could help you test more.  So pick like a small subject area then expand. \n\nAs an example you want to learn about APIs so break that down, let‚Äôs say you have a JSON rest api.  Ok first look at the definition of rest.  Then at api endpoints, each has a http verb and a route and will return a http response code.  You don‚Äôt need to know it by heart but look at what response codes could be returned, look at which verb each route uses and understand why - then you can build test cases to hit each one, like what data gets you a 200 ok response vs a 400 error response and how can you make each happen. \n\nKeep a notebook with everything you hear that you‚Äôre not sure about and Google.

APIs are how systems are made to be interacted with, think the buttons on the remote of your TV. *A Philosophy of Software Design* makes some interesting points about API design, but I think you'll need to progress a bit more before going into it.\n\nWebhooks are just a call back address for inter-service communication, the only trip up here is how more complex ones are implemented in code, but I don't think this should worry you at this point - the gist of it is \"Here's what I want, call me back on this number when you have it\".\n\nFor the rest, there's no specific order you have to learn things in, nor is there an expectation that you will instantly develop a deep understanding of any of these topics, as long as you understand how they fit together. Might as well focus on learning things that will help you be better at automation and save the deep dives for later\n\n1. TCP/IP, REST + others, if working in web\n2. Database basics, lock contention, ACID (if your work has you interacting/testing databases in any way)\n3. What does it mean to actually deploy something, what's going on behind the scenes (ssh, cp, configs, env vars)\n4. The basics of your language of choice, most common data structures (arrays, lists, maps)\n5. Once you're comfortable writing some code in the language you'll be using, go into whatever testing framework you'll be using (selenium?)\n\nNo one knows everything, so I suggest focusing on things directly related to what you want to do and then slowly expand your knowledge out of professional curiosity and/or to upskill.",

Can't remember if it's on Steam, though...\n\nShenzen I/O - Has you build some gadgets - programming is in an Assembly-like language. IMHO good for training problem solving and debugging skills, as well as some logic (AND, OR, etc.).\n\nTIS-100 - Somewhat like Shenzen, but more simplistic. Has you program the fictional TIS-100 chip for various purposes. Uses an Assembly-like language.\n\nWhile true: Learn(); - Primarily visual programming, teaches AI and neural networking concepts.\n\nGrey Hack - Very nice hacking game where you can build your own exploits and helper programs. Uses its own scripting language, but does teach you problem solving and how to help yourself with code.\n\n\n\nThen there's the real kicker - try to program simple games in C# yourself while learning. One of my firsts was a simple hangman/wheel of fortune game that I made as a console app. Trying to render simple console stuff and text graphics is a good way to start out learning the fundamentals of graphics programming.\n\nAnother good start could be making a simple 2D engine for a shoot-em-up, which can teach you how to manipulate graphics, make sprites and move stuff around. My first one back in the day ran inside a C# form using GDI - it was a b\\*tch to program, but included a very simple AI, parallax scrolling and some other neat stuff.\n\nBack in CS class, I had a semester project (actually two), that consisted of a tile engine running a sort of educational RPG. It was written in C# and ran on the now-dead XNA framework...\n\nIt's probably the harder way to go about things, but it's something you can do as side projects while learning the basics of C# before moving on to Unity.",

Preferably `subprocess.run` with `check=True` so that any errors that occur will get raised into exceptions.\n\n  \nUsing `Popen` directly is useful if you don't want the function to block while the program is running, so it's useful for opening a program for the user that will stay open for some indeterminate amount of time, like opening a text editor, the calculator, etc. (if this is your intention, do NOT use Popen in a with statement, just call it directly.) `subprocess.run` is probably what you usually want for command line utilities because you'll actually be able to see the results.\n\n  \nThere is also `subprocess.call` and `subprocess.check_call`, these are okay but the docs describe them as an \"older API\" meant for use by \"existing code,\" so I'd probably just stick to `subprocess.run` for anything new\n\n*also, `Popen` and `subprocess.run` will let you pass strings as the first argument like you can with `os.system`. Don't do this, because then you're back to that same problem you get with `os.system`. Stick to passing them sequences like tuples or lists, and don't use them with `shell=True`.\n\nIf you feel like you have to hit the shell, you probably can work around it. One time I thought I had to hit the shell was for a cross platform way to run the \"default program\" for a file, via `start` on Windows, `open` on Mac, or `xdg-open` on Linux. However, the latter two are actual binaries and not shell commands so they can be opened via `Popen`, while the former has a dedicated Python function, `os.startfile`, so in all cases it is possible to avoid hitting the shell.",

Though, some interviewers seem to be looking for that skill for whatever reason.\n\nBut in an interview situation, it's really hard to tell.  Who knows, if I'm the interviewer and I have a fishy feeling that you're not \"up to snuff\" as it were, maybe I'll throw you a random algorithm question and see how you respond. And if you don't get the job, who knows, maybe you'll go off to Twitter or X or something and whine about how company Y wants people to memorize algorithms or something. Really? I don't think it's that simple in an interview situation.\n\nPersonally I think you should be able to program an implementation of something, given a description of an algorithm. All non-trivial programs that we are making nowadays are essentially algorithms to solve problems for which we (almost never) have a truly complete specification. The \"Algorithms\" in algorithms books are simply smaller problems which have been studied thoroughly, for which complete specifications exist.\n\nFor example, we know 100% what we mean to say whether a sequence is sorted or not, so it's easy to specify that a sorting algorithm takes a sequence for which that property may or may not be true and produces a sequence for which that property is true. \n\nThough even in that problem there are sometimes overlooked edge cases. For example, occasionally the difference between stable sort and unstable sort crops up naturally. If you have never studied algorithms, how likely is it that you would even understand the difference between a stable sort and a non-stable sort. Also how likely is it that you would know which algorithms guarantee stability and which ones don't?",

But we've all heard the mantra - those who don't know the past are doomed to repeat it.\n\nThere is a root to this wisdom that applies to all fields of learning - knowledge builds your intuition. Intuition is knowledge you don't actively think about. It's implied. It's inherent to your thinking. It silently informs you and influences you. If you watch a master of his craft, any craft, you will see they make it look so easy. They don't \"just know\" better, it's not merely muscle memory, it's a career of lessons learned, and decisions made, and fundamental concepts wholly and completely understood.\n\nSo a master developer can get cracking at code in an instant, whereas you might have to spend a lot more time trying to understand the problem and design a solution. The master can do it because all that understanding and design work? Yeah, they already did that - same as you, even for this very problem today, they just did the work 20 years ago...\n\nSo you learn this stuff not because anyone gives a shit whether you can actually implement a binary tree in an interview. RARELY do we implement primitive and fundamental data structures ourselves. The point is that you understand it, and you end up leveraging that intuition in all your thinking for the rest of your career.",

Being a competent programmer is to change how you think. Which is something anyone can learn. You just have to be patient and be open minded and it will eventually start clicking. \n\nBreak every problem down to tiny micro steps and tackle each one. Want to move a character? Well how do i read what button to input? How do I set the velocity of the character? How do I animate it? Three little problems from one problem that sounded small in the first place. \n\nDon't let perfection be the enemy of progress as a professional programmer i still look at my code and think I can do better.

The same thing happens in our brain with code. \n\nEven very successful games have had a history of terrible code. Pok√©mon sun and moon is a very famous example of poor project organization and I'm pretty sure eve online had to rewrite their engine before because of how much spaghetti was in it. It happens and you will learn with experience. Just keep making your games and more will click\n\nAlso, I do want to address the anxiety here. If you go in to every hobby and skill wondering if it's for you and get analysis paralysis then you will never truly enjoy anything new and give it a chance. If you have a hard time addressing this i do recommend seeking help and learning to be more comfortable in your own head and getting some confidence",

You need to understand concepts that simply don‚Äôt exist in Python. You need to understand pointers and pointer arithmetic. You need a better understanding of memory management. Stack vs heap. Call by reference vs value. So many more. Sure, Python has its own things like decorators, descriptors, etc, but you can be proficient without a full understanding of them.\nExpect learning C++ to involve some core concepts, not just language semantics and common libraries.

        "body": "Massively simplified analogy: You need to find the email of Professor Dan to beg him to let you into his full class next semester. There are a number of ways you can go about getting that:\n\n1. Ask your current CS teacher what Dan's email is. He says \"I don't know, Professor Smith might know though.\" So you go ask Professor Smith what his email is and she says \"I don't know, but Professor Stevens might know.\" You go ask Professor Stevens and she says \"I don't know, try Professor Jones.\" You keep going down the chain, each person telling you to go talk to someone else, until you reach someone who knows what the email is, and who knows how many people you're going to have to talk to and you just don't want to do that.\n2. So you realize that oh wait, you can just look him up in the staff directory and find the email that belongs to him. You know he's a CS professor so you can just start with the CS directory instead of scanning down from Dr. Aarons in Academic Advising, and you already know the guy's name is Professor Dan so you can just jump to D.\n\nThat's basically the difference between finding something in a linked list vs. hash table In reality it's a bit more complicated:\n\n3. Suppose you go to the staff directory and it's not in alphabetical or department order -- it seems totally random. Also, it's split into 20,000 pages. So you have no idea where Dan is and you're thinking you've got to just work your way down, and you really don't want to do that. But then you see that the directory is maintained by the department weirdo Dr. Bryant. You go ask Dr. Bryant, who tells you almost immediately \"Dan? He's on page 56.\" You ask, astonished: \"You just memorized that???\" Dr. Bryant: \"Nah, I just multiplied the letters of DAN, so 4 \\* 1 \\* 14 is 56.\"\n\n4. You go to page 56, and sure enough there's Dan's bio and email. Problem solved! But then the next day you have a realization and go back to Dr. Bryant: \"Wait a minute, what if you hire another guy named Dan? Only one of them can be on page 56, your system won't work anymore.\" Bryant goes \"Uh..... wait, I know, his employee ID is 4LBA8F, and his ID is unique so I can just use that instead!\"\n\n5. Satisfied, you leave his office, then 2 minutes later turn around and go back in. \"But that's not gonna work either, what if you have employee 222 and 22B? Or 2BB? What about 6666, 666F, 66FF?\"  Dr. Bryant says he needs to think about that.\n\nThis is also massively simplified and obviously the actual calculations are more complicated, but that's the general idea: since your data is probably not going to be perfectly ordered, you need to come up with a function to map each item to a numerical value, and that value will be the index to the \"bucket\" of memory that data will go into. You don't want that function to come up with different values because that makes things complicated, but unless you have an infinite amount of space, it's impossible to prevent that completely. All you can do is try to limit how often it happens; there's mathematical theory for the best ways to limit that and various implementations for how to handle whatever collisions do happen.\n\n\"OK, why not make it ordered then?\" You could do that, but then you'll have to continually fix the order every time you insert new data, instead of just crunching a number for where to insert it. So if you're doing a lot of insertions compared to lookups, that may not be ideal.",

Very sophisticated CPU caches do have the ability to notice that you're chasing pointers (they correlate values previously loaded with the addresses fetched) but that's most helpful if you repeatedly access shallow data structures.\n\nThere just isn't much that can be done to hide memory latency when the data structure is really deep.\n\nIf a linked list is the best choice it's probably because you need a LIFO or FIFO queue and search is rare.\n\nOther points in favor of linked lists\n\n* concurrent LLs (multiple threads will access at the same time) are easier than concurrent hash tables and compete with concurrent ring buffers\n* The objects you intend to link are members of some other data structure and the LL acts as an alternate way to access them.

Before compilation  you can allocate as much memory in it as you think the program will need for its entire lifetime, like few megabytes (mebibytes). But you need to manage memory inside that buffer by yourself and what if you need more memory during the execution of the program ? Here comes the heap memory that OS manages by itself, you just request memory allocation to it. The C/C++ runtime code now manages the heap memory regions that it controls, you just call \"malloc/free\" in C or \"new/delete\" in C++ and they return a \"pointer\" to this new memory pages. It's just a number to that memory address. Now you can refer to data outside memory constrained \".data\" section and have dynamic data allocations. Each memory section have pages of memory allocated to them, so they all may have access attributes associated with them. \".data\" section is readable, writable. \".text\" code section is readable, executable. So you can't ovetwrite the code that your program is dependent on. \nC/C++ without understanding OS concepts would be hard to understand cause many APIs rely on understanding them.",

Since there are conflicting views of how advanced AI is now and how quickly it can learn and develop much further, I wouldn't stop learning just in case the idea that AI will take over everything in 5 years is wrong.\n\nBesides, there is not enough fresh water in most countries for the water needs of AI facilities in addition to supporting humanity. That may slow things down. Since the facilities need more land area but also cool temperatures, why can't they be built at least partially underground to conserve both land and water?\n\nPerhaps u could focus on building things that would help build up city services or get things modernized for underdeveloped areas.\n\nI understand that everyone wants to make lots of money, but since u have found a full-time job already, u have set yourself on a good path to make a life u want. Maybe your idea for using IT could help u work with non-profits and places that can't pay hundreds of thousands up front, but that u can help because u want to serve the public. \n\nTry to think of longer-term projects for your skills. \n\nI wish you the best and am happy that u have already accomplished so much.

Case in point, my entire cycle has been spent refactoring something that was written in January (I'm guessing with AI tools) that is beginning to break in subtle ways.\n\nThough the job has undoubtably changed with these new tools at our disposal, I think there will continue to be software engineers for the foreseeable future. So from that perspective, there's still a value to learning your craft.\n\nAs for the market, there's nothing I can say but I feel for you- I hope openings for juniors open up again. I think the decision to stop hiring juniors is incredibly short sighted, but it is what it is. Do your best to network and turn non-leads into leads. Listen to whatever career progression framework your bootcamp offers.\n\nAs for burnout, take a break if you can- try and think about this from a long-term perspective and try and enjoy learning and making things for their own sake. That's what this career is about at the end of the day and there's nothing wrong with giving yourself space to reconnect with that. Good luck.",

At the end of the day, AI can walk the walk but you as a professional should know what AI has written and then use your creativity to tweak the code to better suit your needs. An inexperienced coder would not be able to keep re-iterating to an AI how to work a code into a website without breaking it but you with the knowledge will know how to.\n\nWhenever AI gets brought into conversation re: industry/ jobs, I always bring up the fact that once Microsoft brought in Word and WordArt - suddenly small businesses didn't need to hire/train to be graphic designers as their basic logos, menus, business cards, etc could just be done via Word.

Plenty documentation, plenty tutorials, and a very welcoming community.\n\nIf you want to venture outside game development, look into *Python* as it is a great starter language, high in demand, very versatile, multi purpose. In that case, start with the MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki.\n\n\"Hard\" is debatable. Programming *languages* by themselves aren't \"hard\" or \"easy\". *Programming* is hard - but by creating things with Scratch you've basically already covered that base. Even though Scratch appears as childish, block based system, it is still real programming. It has every single fundamental concept of programming, only that it is presented in a graphical manner. If you are competent programming in Scratch, you have the programming *logic* down. Now, you only need to learn the vocabulary and grammar of textual programming languages (which is actually the easier part of learning programming).",

The staging area acts as a temporary safe space that is not a full commit and to which you can restore your tracked files if for some reason you aren't happy with the latest changes, and the changes saved to the staging area can also be restored. When you make a commit, only the changes tracked in the staging area are used.\n\nCommits in a repository are uniquely identified by hashes, which look like long strings of random characters that are in fact generated from all the information that they save. Commits contain the hashes of their immediate ancestors, the differences in the code between them and their immediate ancestors, the names and E-mail addresses of their authors, a timestamp, a message explaining what they change and why so that other people in the future can gain a deeper understanding of why specific changes were made, and optionally a digital signature to reinforce their authenticity. Commits represent snapshots of branch states at specific times.\n\nSince commit hashes aren't easy to remember, git provides the ability to tag them with more remarkable names. Tags are often used to record milestones, like the official version of a project at that point, but they can be used for anything you want, and can always have descriptions independent of their respective commit messages.\n\nBranches represent distinct and possibly concurrent development paths, and every git repository has at least one conventionally named main these days or master in the past, however branches can have arbitrary names. Branches are simply alternative HEAD pointers, you can create a branch from any commit in the repository, which will result in its HEAD pointing at that commit, and after that every commit you make to that branch will have the original commit of the branch as an ancestor in its history. Branches are typically used to avoid cluttering the main history of the project with irrelevant versioning information related to refactoring, bug fixing, feature development, or even to continue developing old versions of the same project concurrently to the main branch.\n\nRemotes provide the ability to name external repositories, and are intended to synchronize with the work done by other developers. Each branch can also track a single branch on a remote repository, which is typically used to synchronize with an upstream source of truth, and doesn't really need to have the same name as the local branch. Pushing to a remote branch attempts to append your changes in a local branch to the remote branch, whereas pulling attempts to append the remote changes of the remote branch to your local branch. If this succeeds then the resulting trivial merge is called a fast forward, otherwise you will be required to resolve the conflicts before the local and remote repositories can be synchronized. The HEAD of a tracked remote branch is pointed at by REMOTE_HEAD\n\nMerging is a process in which two divergent branches, both local or one local and one remote, are synchronized by a commit that addresses all the conflicts. Since only local branches can be written to, the merge commit is always created locally. After a merge all the concurrent commits are added to the history of the local branch, which can make the commit history rather confusing to understand. A different option to merging is rebasing, where all the divergent changes in one of the branches are added on top of the other branch, but this too can mess up the commit history, because if both branches have been getting concurrent commits, the timestamps in the resulting history where all the commits to one branch are logically applied after all the commits to the other branch will result in a history of commits that are not progressive over time, so git also provides the ability to squash commits, which can be used to coalesce a range of commits.\n\nReverting is the process in which the changes made by one or more commits are applied in reverse to a branch, effectively resulting in those changes being removed from the code. Reverting commits does not alter the commit history of a branch, instead a new revert commit is created specifically to remove the changes, at which point the author of the reverse is given a chance to address any conflicts that might prevent the operation. Switching is a process in which git is instructed to go back to any commit in the repository. If the switch is made to a branch then the local files will be updated to the HEAD commit of the branch, otherwise the switch is considered headless and no commits can be made until a branch is created to track them. Resetting moves the HEAD of a branch to any commit on the repository, which can result in some commits becoming unreachable and eventually garbage collected.\n\nStashing is the concept of committing your changes to a local commit tracker and restoring everything to how it was in the previous commit. Stashes are global and as such are completely independent of branches.\n\nOther concepts like pull requests, forks, and releases are specific to GitHub. Pull requests are just regular posts to a repository linking to a branch on your own repository whose changes you would like to get merged with the remote repository. Forks are just other developers cloning your repository under a new repository on their own account. Releases are essentially tags on steroids that you can use to provide ready-to-use builds of your project.\n\nGit is also quite versatile when it comes to rewriting history, however this is a fairly advanced subject that I'm not going to touch on here since it requires a good understanding of its fundamental concepts. Rewriting history can sometimes make commits unreachable from any branch, and These commits are kept around for a while but eventually git's garbage collector gets rid of them, however this grace period makes it possible to recover them, so even if you completely mess up a repository it's almost always possible to manually recover everything back during this period.\n\nHopefully this comment covers all the basics with enough detail but without being overwhelming.",

Just to clarify, I'm not some kind of genius, this is all pretty standard stuff that would be covered in digital logic and computer architecture courses in a typical CS curriculum.\n\nTo thoroughly answer your questions I would basically have to teach one of those courses, and I'm not going to try to do that. Instead I'll just try to clarify my previous comment a bit.\n\nYou have to distinguish between the *simulated* CPU (the custom 16-bit design that the Youtuber you linked came up with) and the *real* CPU that is being used to run the simulation.\n\nA real CPU is made out of many millions of physical logic gates. All of those logic gates operate simultaneously. But they work together so that the real CPU executes one \"instruction\" at a time. (This is a massive oversimplification, but it's good enough for this discussion.)\n\nLet's say that the simulated CPU needs a few hundred logic gates to make a 32-bit adder. If you write a gate-level software simulation on the real CPU, the simulation will have to process each of those logic gates one at a time. So like I said, it will take many hundreds or thousands of real CPU instructions to *simulate* a single addition operation on the simulated CPU. That's what I meant by \"iterate\". The simulator has to go through each logic gate one at a time to compute its result.\n\nIf instead, you write an emulator that runs on the real CPU, then when it needs to add two numbers, it can execute a single `ADD` instruction. Now, *physically*, that `ADD` instruction is still implemented within the CPU by many logic gates. But because those gates are real physical things, all operating simultaneously, they don't have to be simulated one at a time. They all happen in parallel. So the execution is much faster. (But the physical arrangement of the CPU's logic gates is fixed in hardware. You can't customize it the way you could customize a gate-level simulation that's performed in software.)\n\nI'm just using addition as an example, but the same principle applies to other things too. The 16-bit CPU has lots of other control circuitry that decides *what* instruction to execute at any given time. That control circuitry is made up of many logic gates. But the work that is done by a large number of logic gates can alternatively be implemented by a smaller number of CPU instructions on the real physical CPU, doing the same work directly, without simulating the behavior of all the individual gates.\n\n> And why does the guy‚Äôs actual processor itself get to skip over all of those logic gates that logism can‚Äôt?\n\nThey're not \"skipped over\". But when you take the logic design that was being simulated in Logisim, and build it out of real physical logic gates, then those gates are all operating in parallel. So you don't have to wait for a software simulation to process them one at a time.\n\n----\n\nIf you want to learn more about this topic, I would suggest going through the free self-guided [Nand2Tetris course.](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)",

The advice I would give to a beginner would be something more like this:\n\n1) Have a specific goal of what you want to accomplish by learning programming\n2) Make sure that what you're doing is moving you towards that goal\n\nSo many people skip (1) when they're asking for advice on what to do, but it's super important. Why *specifically* do you want to learn programing? Is it to make video games? Or is it to automate business processes at your accounting firm? Or is it to hack your smart-fridge? Those are all vastly different skill sets, with different paths you'll need to take in your learning. Knowing what you want to do is so so important to making sure you're learning the right things.\n\nOnce you've figured out (1) step (2) is a lot easier (still hard though!). Usually, step (2) starts with following one comprehensive course on the relevant programming language / framework / environment. Make sure it's a high quality, modern course on the topic. As you go, make sure you're doing exercises, and writing code independently to test that you're following along. **Once you've finished this course, you should have the \"vernacular\"** that you're talking about in your post. At that point, you can start building (small) projects.\n\nOftentimes where people get stuck on (2) is that they jump around between too many different tutorials, they don't learn things on their own, or they don't focus on the learning that will actively help them achieve their goals. But doing a single, high quality course is definitely not \"tutorial hell\".\n\nPeople who suggest doing projects are right that the true, deep learning comes after you've taken the training wheels of a course or tutorial off. There's a lot of important and valuable struggle that comes from putting the pieces together yourself. But you really want to go into your first projects with a decent understanding of the fundamentals, otherwise it will be hard to see the forest for the trees.",

You get 80% of the benefit from just picking up heavy shit and putting it back down, and 18% of the remaining 20% from doing the easiest optimizations (alternating which muscle groups are worked + watching your calories).\n\nThe obvious thing everyone can agree on but gets lost in the argument is that it's pointless to focus on your diet, get perfect sleep, and buy the right supplements... but never actually go to the gym.\n\nWe can (and do!) argue on and on about if it's optimal to build projects, watch presentations from industry professionals, focus on languages versus abstract CS ideas, learn through integration or building from scratch, if you should focus on learning functional and declarative paradigms, philosophies of state management, keeping up with industry standards...\n\n... and the advice of \"go *practice*\" gets lost.\n\nGo. Try to build something. It'll be bad. You'll probably get completely stuck at some point. Research how other people solved the problem. Watch some tech talks or YouTubers, read a blog, whatever. Find a library that does the thing. Try again. It'll be better. Still bad. Rinse and repeat.

Since you have an Arduino, you could start with a simple programme that uses the Arduino to control an LED.\n\nHere are some things you can try in order:\n\n- Make the LED switch on after a second (a basic \"Hello World\")\n- Make the LED flash on and off (teaches loops)\n- Add a push switch to the circuit and have the switch cycle the LED between on and off states every time you push it. (teaches you events)\n- Use the push switch to turn a flashing LED on and off (combines events with loops)\n- Add multiple LEDs and build a binary counter from 0 to `n` (teaches `for` loops specifically)\n- Pushing the button resets the counter.\n- Add a second button that changes the behaviour of the LED (e.g. switches between flashing and counting; teaches functions/separation of behaviours).\n\nEverything you do with the LED, you can do with a servo, relay, transistor, or anything else that can be connected to a circuit.\n\nOnce you've worked out how to control output with a button, you can think about using different kinds of input, like using a thermistor to react to a temperature change, or an LDR to react to light levels.",

Don't jump from one language to another just because you think you understood the basics. Use the basics to build projects that get more complex from project to project.

Sit down with pencil and paper and work over the assignment. Analyze it, break it down into steps. Solve each of the steps **your** way, don't even think about programming at that stage. Track the steps. Once you have a working solution, test it. Then, when the solution is confirmed, start *implementing* it in code. Ideally, when you've done the breakdown right, the code should come naturally. Use whatever you can think of: bulleted lists, flow charts, pseudo code, anything to write down what the program has to perform.\n\nCode is the end, not the beginning. Analysis, breaking down, planning, solving are the beginning. Code comes later.\n\nJust *reading* completed code will not help you building the ability to solve problems. Reading code is like looking at a complete car in order to learn to design a new car. You miss everything important: analysis, decisions, considerations, compromises. You might get an understanding of the *immediate* solution, but not the skills to apply this to even slightly different situations.\n\nBuild your own projects starting from something as small and simple as Tic-Tac-Toe and working your way gradually up to larger and more complex. Yes, this will take time, effort, determination, discipline, and patience, but that's the way to go. Not the easy road to use google, AI or tutorials for everything.\n\nProgramming is lifelong learning. It takes months to build up basic competence, years to obtain some proficiency and a lifetime for expertise.\n\n-----\n\nAbout your task:\n\n> i had to create a license plate checker which would output valid or invalid.\n\nWell, not much information you give here, but still:\n\nWhat do you need for your program?\n\n+ You need some form of getting the license plate - user input\n+ you need a place to store the license plate - variable\n+ There are some rules that you need to follow (which you haven't told - so, I'm blind guessing)\n   + most likely, you will need to extract each character from the license plate - you will need a way to split the entered data and a store for it - maybe an array - could just as well be that you only need to loop over each character\n   + you need to perform some action with the character - maybe some summing, multiplication, etc.\n   + At the end, you will get some checksum or some indication\n+ you will need to verify that indication (conditional)\n+ you need to output valid or invalid\n\nThat's the way to break down a problem. The more detailed you do it, the easier it will be to implement the code.\n\n-----\n\n\nI'll leave some comment from a [former, similar post](https://redd.it/1mhcd21) here:\n\nHonestly, most of it is down to practice. Use sites like [Exercism](https://exercism.org) for ample practice exercises.\n\nThere are several books commonly recommended:\n\n+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul\n+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas\n+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman\n+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles Petzold\n\nAnd finally, I'll leave some of my comments to previous, similar posts, as this is a very frequently discussed topic:\n\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j9ezmx/getting_better_at_coding/mhdna2e/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1iz7wv3/how_to_become_a_better_engineer/mf10qbg/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j3w7x9/how_to_actually_learn_problem_solving_skills/mg3q9ya/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ioehwa/struggling_to_put_together_my_own_code/mcirhxq/\n+ https://redd.it/1jyd36k",

For example i usually have a good idea how to sketch that code.\n\nthe palidrome one was rather easy in psuedo, yet in execution i have no clue what to do, simply cause i don't know the functions to use or how that for loop worked.\n\nbut yeah it certainly seems to be alot of jogging the brain.

If you want just 2d art, Krita on pc is a free drawing program that works well, I'm mostly on ipad so procreate is what I often use. If you want 3d, blender is free and great, it has a good community and a lot of tutorials, it can be a bit hard to learn but it's a nice skill to have.",

If you read about [the semantics of a semaphore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_%28programming%29) you'll see that the behavior doesn't depend on what that initial value was. So at the implementation level, the current value is all that matters, and the OS doesn't even bother to remember the initial value.\n\nThe only purpose of the semaphore is to prevent the *current* value of the semaphore from going negative, by blocking when the value would otherwise drop below zero. Aside from that, it's up to the application programmer to decide what the semaphore's value \"means\" and to increment/decrement it correctly.\n\nSee, for instance, the \"producer-consumer\" example on the Wikipedia page I linked. In that example, you use two semaphores tracking two \"resources\": `fullCount` for the number of items in the queue, and `emptyCount` for the number of available slots in the queue. If the queue is initially empty, then the `fullCount` semaphore is initialized to zero, but its value can later increase when items are added to the queue. It doesn't make sense to limit the semaphore to its initial value, because it would prevent use cases like this.\n\nIf there is only a single resource being managed then it's up to the application to ensure that it never increments the semaphore above 1.",

I do have a name brand employer, but I am a bootcamp grad with a BA from a known California party UC, not known for CS like Stanford‚Ä¶ \n\nFirst year was causal and brushing up on DAS. \n\nThe start of this year I went all in learning and studying. Now compared to a year ago it is night and day in my interview knowledge. \n\nI‚Äôm in a similar boat of being full stack but I lean front end. \n\nI‚Äôve applied for close to 500 at least. \nI‚Äôve gotten close to 100 interviews and then cut it in half for each phase after that. None with referral. \n\nI‚Äôve gotten to the final \n\nJust within this year I‚Äôve gotten 4 offers. C1,  Apple and Walmart and a startup. \n\nWhy didn‚Äôt I take them? It didn‚Äôt meet my requirements which was a higher position with slight higher TC or at least 20% higher TC. \n\nYes it‚Äôs been a struggle but most of those no offers were on me and lack of preparedness. There‚Äôs such a large bell curve in learning what I didn‚Äôt learn for those that have a CS degree. \n\n\nLooking back at my failures if I had the knowledge now then I would have easily gotten 15+ offers since I know where I fell short. \n\n\nAre there more applicants than jobs? Yes. \n\nAre we cooked? Not yet. \n\n\nI‚Äôm in the final round of 4/8 interviews I have lined up now and half way point for the other 4. \n\nKnocking on wood I‚Äôm hoping this is it. If anyone wants me to post a full journey post mortem like this and lmk. \n\nMy advice for those that are still looking. Be prepared,  you may get one shot a quarter and you don‚Äôt want to miss it. Once you have your new job work on features that will make you look great. I‚Äôve had a friend with same years of experience and similar background but can‚Äôt get interviews because they became complacent with doing little to no meaningful work and now that they became unemployed they have little to show for it on their background.\n\nEdit: if you‚Äôre going to reac out please say more than just ‚ÄúHey‚Äù.

As a person who has been in the military, construction, CNC machining and now currently a truck driver I started getting into computer science 3 years ago and will graduate with a BA next December. By the time I started AI wasn't out just yet and I was learning Python, C++ and Java. Let me just tell you how disheartening it is now that most of my simple ideas and projects are capable of being done by a prompt rather than the hours it takes to study, understand the material, research libraries and cross reference other methods in order to create some code. I fear that the kind of jobs I wanted to have won't exist by the time I get out there. I enjoy trucking but there is no industry that AI will not touch.  My employer has implemented a camera in our trucks that already use AI and it's capable of detecting our eye movement to know if we are distracted, drowsy, and tracks our following distance, speed, braking, turning and any other metric you could imagine to gauge the competency of a truck driver. Then gives us a score and compares us to other drivers in the fleet. I dislike it but it's the future. I hope you find the job you are looking for but this is the end of an era and the birth of something we cannot stop nor fathom the implications and what will be on the other side of this. I wish you well.",

It's always been like this and probably always will be, because *ML work is difficult to evaluate from the outside*.\n\n* From the POV of someone not deeply familiar with ML, it's hard to distinguish ourselves from people less qualified, who might be liable to commit rookie data leakage/confounding/etc mistakes, and be none the wiser until the model is in production. Without stars and citations, GitHub repos and arXiv papers are laborious to evaluate and are indistinguishable from slop.\n* Our work inevitably requires some research, which usually doesn't pan out. If a manager makes a bad hire, and they're not competent in ML themselves, they have to wait through a long string of failures in order to decide \"okay this person is incompetent\" and finally fire him.\n\nSo hiring managers have to be very, very careful. In such murky circumstances, it's rational to resort to costly social signals. Publications in conferences, placements in Kaggle competitions, and of course experience at prestigious companies are reliable signals of competence, only because they are so costly to fake. They'd rather overpay for a highly-qualified candidate (not you or me) than gamble on someone less-credentialed who passed their interview (which they know isn't terribly high-signal to begin with).\n\nThis is all many times more extreme for researchers, for whom a PhD is mandatory.\n\n>But i see people doubling their salaries all with just taking a single course on basic ML....how???\n\nThis would be news to me.",

The fear of the online and offline world judging your every parenting skills and then having the fear of being lambasted because you make 1 mistake out of a million times when your kids usually don't \"misbehave\", its tough.\n\nAll I can say is, yes being a good developer who can code and everything is fantastic to have.  Have you had one to ones with your seniors or bosses recently? One thing that came out of a meeting I had with my boss, when I said I was shocked at how good the new hires were compared to me (3-4 yoe) and my boss remarked that if I felt that way, what the company saw was that I am a really good person to have in meetings, in projects, who could understand the scope needed for a project, who could bridge communication between stakeholders and developers, and people just felt knew that I was like a go to person when there was help needed etc.\n\nIf you can, do your best and find ways and opportunities to develop your coding skills.  Your soft skills from something as simple as communication between teams, don't neglect or underestimate these either, these can also help you stand out as a senior dev or higher",

        "body": "Some companies have a formal process to graduate engineers to senior and beyond as individual technical contributors. But I feel like many go based mostly on feel and perception. If you feel you are stuck and will have a hard time being thought of as senior by your peers because you can't keep up in architecture and design discussions that might hold you back and force you to job hunt.\n\nI agree you should talk to your manager and try to feel out how likely it is you can meet their expectations to stay on assuming you enjoy the work aside from the new hoops they want you to jump through.\n\nI saw some others suggested asking more questions to keep improving your skills. Many people are afraid to ask dumb questions too often as it can make you seem too dependent on the other engineers. But these days honestly you can try talking to an AI about technical details. Most software design and architecture is very well understood and the AI can easily walk you through design questions and help you understand any parts that don't make sense so the next time you have a discussion you are more clear about what is happening.\n\nJust a month back there was a discussion at work explaining a mesh network setup for one of our products. And my networking is super rusty. An hour conversation with the AI and I was following their mesh design much more clearly and asking their team good questions, not the dumb ones where I was unaware of basics or some lingo. Most designs in software aren't super novel or deviant from knowledge the AI has.\n\nThe AIs can still lie so I do recommend double checking it's statements if you are going to put your reputation on the line defending a claim it made. But I feel like there has never been a better tool to help drill down on some \"dumb\" questions we all have.\n\nI will say I am generally perceived as very good at my job and I love software and design discussions. I am totally not immune to feeling stupid or inadequate. Especially on newer projects. Imposter syndrome creeps up on most people unless you have a godly ego. So it's hard to say how you feel really equals no hope of reaching senior in your current role. \n\n Also I don't do side projects. Clearly they are great if you can. But software is just a job and I love my kids more than I love my work. Most people I work with take this stance. I put in extra time to make sure stuff works during crunch time. And I do occasionally enjoy software arch videos on YouTube. But otherwise I enjoy my family and my personal free time. Don't let people make you think you have to give up a decent work life balance.",

        "body": "  \nI've been on both sides of this. I started my career as an 'ambitious overachiever,' burned out hard, and then tried the 'maintain boundaries' approach. Here's what I learned.  \n**As an Ambitious Overachiever:**  \nFrom my personal experience, going above and beyond only **works if you're able to \"showcase\" your work.** That is, people in the company need to actively **see you as someone who goes \"above and beyond\"** in order for it to matter. You should also make sure to **document your achievements and positive feedback** received so you can later present them to management when discussing raises, promotions, and so on. I would also say, though this is also another personal experience thing, that **going above and beyond in every category is both ineffective and leads to burnout.** It's better to **have one project which you own/lead and excel** **at** at a time, and do the \"regular\" amount of work on your other projects.  In addition, it is important to build rapport. You don't have to be an extrovert per se, but **people should leave feeling positively after talking with you.** \n\nOn the downside, **career progression** at any one company inherently **depends on how much room there is for promotion** and the budget of your department. Plus, overperformance makes you advance faster but rarely do you ever skip progression tiers. You may be a truly stellar, outstanding, junior engineer, but you won't get promoted to senior engineer immediately. You'll likely just spend one year less in junior, one year less in mid, and so on. It also only partially protects you from layoffs--**you'll be the last junior engineer laid off**, but if they're **laying off all junior engineers you're still gonna get laid off.**\n\nSomething I learned the hard way is that no matter how much of a \"go above and beyond\" employee you are, **one period of poor performance**, even if do to extenuating circumstances, **can very quickly destroy your reputation** as an overperformer. If this happens, you should immediately look for a new job unless you really love your current workplace. I also found that **opportunities to truly excel can be difficult to find and sometimes even be gatekept.**\n\nIt is important to remember that much of **your excellent performance will evaporate** when searching for a new job **unless you're able to show public artifacts** which showcase it. Maybe references can do this too, but you need to tell the new employer to actually contact them. I got laid off without any public artifacts to show off, and it made job searching ***much harder.***\n\n**Do great work but maintain boundaries approach:**\n\nI took this approach after burning out, though that burnout was partly due to a toxic coworker.  \nI found it to be less stressful and often my outcomes became more consistent, which many employers value more than someone who does overall better work but in an inconsistent fashion. In general, it's only seen as a bad thing at (healthy) companies if it's the kinda role where overtime is inherently expected or a startup. How your work itself is recognized largely depends on your manager and how well they understand it. I'd say your manager's **subjective perception of your work matters far more than the actual work quality.**\n\n**Advancement** felt like it **depended** more **on the state the economy**. Good economy, relatively normal advancement rate. Bad economy, slower advancement rate and layoffs. \n\n**Summary/takeaway:**\n\nBrute-force 'tryharding' is rarely worth the investment and often leads to burnout. If there's a project you can take ownership over, do that and make sure to 'show it off' like a salesman.  Make sure to have evidence to support your skills for both internal promotions and getting jobs elsewhere. **Be an intelligent, strategic achiever who works to own and lead projects while building the skillset you want, rather than an overachiever for the company you work for.**",

The question should be more nuanced though- people (especially engineers) LOVE to microoptimize on a single variable when that isn't actually productive because our lives are multifaceted (e.g. either minmaxing saving money, or being a yolo spender).¬†\nMy practical recommendations are 2 things\n1) oscillate based on priority. Some projects are important, high-vis, high-impact and will leapfrog your career more than the rest of your work combined. Spending a bit more effort here pays dividends. Similarly, if you're close to a promo you care about, it's worth doing a bit extra. Rest of the time, it's okay to just do enough.\n\n\n2) understand the rubric better. Unlike school where assignments are graded 0-100%, work is very ambiguous. Understand who controls your career trajectory (usually your direct manager and maybe skip level), and optimize for success. Find ways to proactively make your manager's job easier, and make your manager look good to their management. This will do the most.¬†\n\n\nOne anecdote I've shared a few times: I grinded really hard when I joined this job, manager denied my promo again and again based on random nitpicks from career ladder doc. I eventually threw in the towel and said fuck it, that manager left, my new manager was chill and I kept sandbagging. I'd be responsive and helpful on shared projects, but I was also literally playing video games during the day (wfh). Despite all this, my new manager pretty soon put me up for promo successfully without me asking, and handwaved a bunch of career ladder \"requirements\". I did have to do a bit of extra work since manager asked me to draft my own promo doc (usually manager duty, but fair enough trade lol). It's all fuzzy and hand wavey end of day as long as those in charge approve¬†",

It's difficult to tell the difference between early career and experienced commenters, and good advice is often counter intuitive. \n\nThere are two pieces of bad advice I am constantly trying to correct. First is learning more skills won't lead you to being overworked. People complain about the rising popularity of full stack development. They say they refuse to learn frontend or backend because that will just lead to your employer expecting you to do two jobs. That's not true. Learning more skills will make you more efficient at your job, saving you time. It will also make you more competitive on the job market, meaning it will be easier for you to find a job with good WLB. There's more than enough dedicated frontend or backend work. If an employer is going to overwork you, they're going to do it regardless if you know full stack or not.\n\nSecond is becoming more senior destroys your WLB. That's again not true. The things that destroy your WLB are getting a senior title before your ready and getting a senior title at a mismanaged company. Some people get thrust into a tech lead role 3 years into their career. These people are usually stressed AF because they don't have the experience to do it effectively, and the fact that they were promoted means the average level of experience is lower then theirs. That means they're going to be even more stressed trying to bail out all of the people on their team, because they also don't have the experience to do their jobs effectively. Don't try to avoid promotions. Avoid premature promotions and take on a senior/tech lead title when you feel comfortable you can do the job in <40 hours per week.",

Keep conversations up with your manager (ask for skip level 1v1s) to ensure you stay in communication so your manager can continue to gauge how you are doing vs. what your lead is saying. That then allows your manager to know how to work with the lead to make them a better leader as well. It is not being arrogant when you say I‚Äôve worked on this and this and this and these are the outcomes. If you mess up, own it and say I learned my lesson and don‚Äôt do Y again. That goes a long way and gains lots of respect, which helps with stability.\nIt doesn‚Äôt hurt to put feelers out there for other jobs, but each job has his own crap to deal with. I would evaluate the opportunities you have and get vs. this lead being a pain. This lead may not be here for forever either. If the lead is your only problem, do skip level 1v1s and go from there. Remember, everyone is learning. The lead, yes is being not a great lead, but likely it‚Äôs their first time being a leader and trying to figure it out and needs some guidance. Just like you when you first started. Try to highlight the wins with the lead too! Maybe that will get them thinking more positively as well. And maybe the lead is thinking of you as more senior than you are due to the work you are doing. So reminding them how young in your career you are can help.\nRegarding leaving the field, this is more of a corporate life issue than the field. I deal with this in cybersecurity (got a degree in compsci so why follow) too. You will run into these issues no matter what field you are in. Unfortunately school doesn‚Äôt teach you how to traverse corporate life. I say it sounds like you are doing a great job and have a lot of opportunities to grow. Do skip level 1v1s with your manager, communicate what work you are doing and the outcomes with both your lead and manager, and see what happens. Best of luck to you!",

But now as soon as actual evidence was required, he's realizing the team lead is scapegoating you. Given all this, I would be surprised if he isn't massively pissed at the team lead now and you are probably mostly fine. If I were the manager, I would not believe anything. The team lead says about you from here on out and I don't think the team lead has a ton of discretion on your career trajectory. \n\nThat being said, it would be totally understandable if you're not comfortable and look for a new job. I guess the big question is how much of this is company culture, and how much is one jerk?",

I‚Äôve grieved the career, considered leaving it repeatedly, panic applied to dozens of jobs from many different industries, considered sizable pay cuts, schooling, etc. I have found new success ( we will see how long it lasts though ‚Ä¶) with the following thoughts and plans\n\nI objectively cannot make this much money doing anything else in a different field, or if I could there would be at least a few years of building up. I lack formal education and am in a rural LCOL area. \n\nEspecially reading this sub I have developed even more extreme imposter syndrome and anxiety about losing the job and never finding another tech job bc of competition and industry trends. who knows I could get exited from the industry before I‚Äôm fully ready to leave anyway, so I need prepare and plan accordingly\n\nI have personal traits that lead me to burn out, and that‚Äôs in any job I will ever have so I need to address that if I‚Äôm going to last doing anything. \n\nMy current plan is to stick it out another 7-10 years in tech. If I can do that, without lifestyle creep, I will pay my house off and be 100% debt free and will have been able to sock away a decent bit of cash toward retirement and toward investments I could potentially draw some interest off of. THEN, I can work literally whatever job I want. I will need to bring in some nominal standard income but I could certainly stand to lose my tech level wage. It‚Äôs the plan that feels most plausible and future proof both from an industry perspective and just how long I can put up with this career field. Im pretty tired of it \n\nMy advice to fellow burnouts, make a goal and an exit plan. Having the goal for me has been extremely motivating in the short term, and you can always continue working in it after if you have a change of heart. Just know if you exit, weigh the re-entry cost if you think it‚Äôs at ALL possible you‚Äôd ever want to come back.",

I sprinted away from law to keep my sanity and got lucky enough to group up with 2 friends from work/school to cofound a  legal tech startup‚Äîno, it's not an LLM wrapper‚Äîthat, while still early, is showing promise as we start to get demos in a few smaller firms' hands.

For example, a lot of the complaints people on this Reddit often echo‚Äîannoying/incompetent managers, unreasonable deadlines, leadership with no vision, etc.‚Äîare present in virtually every industry; I got lucky with the partners and senior associated I worked under in law, but others at my law firm would routinely get screamed at by partners for minor issues.",

Almost every major fintech has an office here and its the 2nd largest tech hub. It also is the largeast finance hub.  Also NYC the sky is the limit so you can really use this as an oppurtunity to spring board.\n\nIts  very likely you will be making double to tripple what you are currently making within 5 to 8 years.\n\nWhat life style is like in NYC at that salary? 120k in NYC is around  a 6500 month net salary (due to city taxes).\n\n1. If you want to live somewhere fun for singles in their 20s, you would need to eitehr pick between living alone, living somewhere nice with roomates. You'd qualify a miximum of 3k a budget rent and at that price you can live alone. But you have to choose between  living in a nice apartment in jersey/outer areas or in a pre-war shoe box in the nice trendy neighborhood. Nice in NYC is 'mid' in other cities. Its usually means you have a building with some amenities like laundry room or laundry in unit (rarer) and a dishwasher. NYC is a story of under consturction. Most apartments here are 100 years old (prewar) and lack modern conveniences like laundry, dishwasher and central AC. I picked the shoe box, its more fun to be in a good neighborhood if you like to go out and party.\n2. A lot of people your age would choose to live with roomates in order to be  in a nicer apartment in a good location. Generally apartments are a lot mroe cost effective in a 4 bed 2 bath or 3 bed 1 bath situation. If a studio in an apartment building is renting for 4000$, there is a good chance the 3 bed is only 8000$ and the 4 bed is 10,000$. So a very common strategy for young professionals is to just have roomates to live in a nicer apartment in a fun location.\n3. You can afford to live alone and somewher nice, but it would generally be in outer neighborhoods that are either gentrifying or in places like jersey city, a part of New Jersey that is connected by Manhattan via a subway called path.\n\nThe biggest cost in NYC is rent.  Almost all of the cost of living is real estate. That effects things like entertainment and other stuff, because bars/coffee shops/ restaurants and gyms are paying even more per sq feet than you are. But outside of that the cost is the same its not like Amazon charges more here when they are deliving goods to you. Groceries can be all over the map, but trader joes generally is cost effective as they use national price\n\nTo give oyu some idea what prices are like.  Manhattan (you can take off 20 percent for other areas\n\n1. Hair cuts 40 to 75$\n2. Gym depends on which but 50 to 300$. 125 would be mid-tier\n3. Fast Casual lunch  15 to 20$\n4. Street food from a take out only operation  8 to 12$.\n5. Specialty  Coffee from a cafe   (6$ - 7$ before tax)\n6. Dinner at sit down casual restaurant with a waiter  40 to 80$ per person.  You can easily spend 150$ per person at more upscale. This is assuming no alcohol.\n7. Alcohol  6 to 10$ for beer, 10-20$ for wine, 16 to 25$ cocktails. Non-alcoholic options will be offered at most bars.  NYC has a BIG drinking culture. Tech community in particular has a lot of happy hour networking and social events that they host through apps like Luma, Posh VIP, Super Momos, Partiful. So even if you don't drink a whole lot, its in your interest to go to bars and get some non-alocholic drinks.\n8. Ubers 20$ per mile in Manhattan south of 96th street,  10$ per mile in Brooklyn/Queens/Bronx without manhattan entry.\n\nThe other thing thats nice about NYC, because the city is so expensive you won't have pressure to be extravagent which happens in middle cost of living cities. This is a place where people who make 300k a year might live like college students and no one would bat an eye.\n\nTLDR: 120k is a great salary for someone your age in NYC in the fin-tech space. You will ahve enough money to go out quite a bit, save adequately for retirment and you can essentially pick  where you want to live. It is a place where you will need to budget some and not be extravagent, but you can enjoy some luxuries. From a career perspective its also great, the only city that is better for Tech is SF and NYC is good at multiple industries. Fin-Tech space there is always the option of just transitioning into tech roles in finance and NYC is the capital of finance. You can basically live your best life.",

My short opinion is \"yes, but a bubble doesn't mean the technology is worthless\". \n\nRight now what most people call \"AI\"  (which is really just a small subset of generative AI) is almost definitely in a bubble. There's an unbelievable amount of investment in it, a ton of business ventures that use it without a clear plan or analysis, and a lot of integration in places where it doesn't add much value.  There are also a lot of people banking on it doing things in the future that it doesn't do right now, and putting money into it based on an assumption that \"it'll do everything we need soon\".\n\nThere's also an issue at the very top. Companies that provide the service are not making money off it yet, and they will need to either raise their prices or lower their costs to make it profitable in the future. They're all hoping to win a market share and then hike up the prices. This is disastrous for businesses which are, by-and-large, planning as though their current rates will be stable forever.\n\nUnlike blockchain/crypto, however, AI does show many profitable use-cases. AI does work that would cost money, and it provides services people will pay for. Business analyses DO show that AI is successfully being used by businesses sometimes. It's just that most businesses don't know what works or doesn't work, and are using the technology blindly.\n\nI would liken it to the \"Dotcom Bubble\". The internet as a business technology was absolutely in a bubble in the 90s, and that bubble crashed. It wasn't because \"having a website for your business\" was a bad idea, it was because people were trying to do it without a good plan. Nowadays every business has a website, but unlike the 90s we've established clear use cases which provide value instead of just guessing what works and what doesn't.\n\nI expect AI to be the same. AI will \"crash\". There will be downtime where a lot of businesses disappear, and from the ashes will rise a few clear uses where generative AI is used by almost every business.",

Whether you would call that a bubble depends on what you think will happen when the market for the technology moves beyond hype into a mature, useful stage. There are many realistic and valuable business applications for LLMs, computer vision, etc. These tools are incredibly powerful and will only get better as the models get refined and as more skilled developers work on them (whether they are newly trained in an ML-specific context, like me, or they're crossing over from more rigorous, traditional SWE backgrounds).\n\n\nI'm currently a manager in a non-technical role but taking point on some exploratory AI projects, and I'm looking for a role as an ML engineer down the road. What I'm paying attention to, both in my current role and in my job search, is whether the product brings real business value. Investors and execs don't understand this stuff, they see how quickly and confidently chatgpt spits out text and they believe it's magic that's going to relieve them of the burden of workers. Dishonest hype men are more than happy to take advantage of that.¬†\n\n\nBut if you actually understand how these models work on even a rudimentary technical level then you can smell the bullshit from a mile away. I'm not going to peddle bullshit and I'm not going to go work for bullshit except as a last resort. I think that very few companies can survive selling bullshit (though some do) but I won't be surprised to see a lot of snake oil AI startups go under in the next few years, so I don't want to bank on that for my future.",

If I don't *see* or *speak* to my manager in weeks, not a big deal. They're still doing the job I expect of them behind the scenes.

Notably that paper wasn't about money, it was about me wanting to go into CS, and all the really cool things I can do with a CS degree. I wasn't thinking about the money.\n\nOne big difference about my approach, and the approach I see a lot of people on this subreddit taking is I chose the degree *first*, not my job.\n\nA lot of people here decide they want to be a SWE first, and then work backwards to a CS degree. This hyper-focuses their career path and job search, which can make it significantly more difficult. Especially early career where they may not land their ideal role right away, and because they worked backwards from their ideal role, they view it as a failure and get depressed, and give up.\n\nWhereas with me, I would've been happy with *any* job remotely in technology. I would've been *totally fine* with help desk. When I was in college I was applying to every internship under the sun. IT, Help Desk, PM, SysAdmin, QA, whatever. If it was tech-related, I applied. Since I didn't have tunnel-vision on any specific role, this gave me flexibility. I couldn't get a SWE internship after my sophomore year, but I did get an offer for a PM internship. As a new grad, I only had 1 SWE offer, and that came pretty late. But I *did* have backups. A return offer from my PM internship, other IT offers, etc. If that late SWE offer never came, I was totally prepared to take one of those other offers, and been completely content with it. I got my CS degree, and I got a job out of it. Goal met. It's much easier to meet a goal like that than it is \"SWE at FAANG\".",

Look for cloud support engineer, junior cloud engineer, sysadmin with cloud exposure, or solutions engineer positions. Those can be solid entry points while you rack up the kind of hands on projects that lead into solutions architect jobs. Also, check out [Cloud Strategy Labs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhSfe40GX9gqDkFvvURNJA) for clear plans for moving from certs to your first cloud role to an architect track as they've got roadmaps and tips that could help.",

They can even say \"Great!\" and not be lying, because what a \"Good WLB\" is is very subjective. They may genuinely think their WLB is great because they only have you working 60 hours instead of 80.\n\nSo instead, ask them about stories. In the exact same way they use \"tell me about a time when...\" questions on *you* to gain insight into *you* as opposed to directly asking. \"When was the last time the team was missing a deadline, and how was that handled?\", \"How are deadlines decided, and who decides on them?\", \"When do most people generally come in/leave for the day?\", \"When's the last time the team got an after hours support call and how was that handled?\", \"What's considered 'crunch time', and how often is the team doing that?\", \"What are your expectations of \\[role\\]?\", etc, etc.\n\nThere are many, many different answers to those questions. It's up to you to decide if you think their answer demonstrates the kind of WLB/culture you're willing to join.\n\nIf from any of the questions it sounds like this is a \"work hard play hard\" team, you reject them.\n\nI've worked for 2 startups, and they had amazing WLB's. I joined them *because* of that, it wasn't a surprise after-the-fact. Almost all of my reverse interview questions are focused on WLB/culture. Not all startups will make you burn the midnight oil.",

Your brain is not as \"plastic\" as it once was, so you will need time to get this stuff locked in (and that is OK).\n\nThe way I'd go about it is to seriously try the Leetcode Easy. Why Easy? Because a lot of the Mediums are generalizations of Easy problems, and the Easy problems give you a good foundation of key techniques.\n\nOnce you find a solution to an Easy, take around 10-15 minutes and think if you can find a faster solution. On Leetcode it is usually to tell if there is a faster solution by the speed/memory distribution.\n\nOnce you get the hang of Easys, then start doing Mediums that are semi-related to the Easys you've done. (For example, if you did an Easy in strings, do some Mediums in strings. If you did Easies in arrays, do some Mediums in arrays.) Your mind will be somewhat attuned to possible patterns and techniques.\n\nWRT AI... please don't. People will find out. If they don't find out then, they will find out at the interview when they make you code in front of them. And once recruiters find out, they tell other recruiters privately that this candidate used AI. Even if you somehow make it, you'll be miserable. You will have a case of impostor syndrome that you've never believed can exist. You will know inside that you're way above where you are, because the work will be assigned based on the AI version of you, not you. And if you think you can use AI at work... sure, I'm sure people will not mind as much, but you will NOT be happy in that role.\n\nEDIT: A lot of ppl have some flavor of what I said. I wanted to add. Please make sure you know basic Data structures (Arrays, Lists, Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks, Hash tables) and Algorithms (Sorting, Binary search, divide and conquer, BFS, DFS, Binary Search Trees and Tree Traversals, etc).",

Do not try to solve as many questions as you can, but look at a question, understand it, and work your way not just to a solution, but to understanding what it does, and why, and how, and explain why that is better than sub-optimal alternatives.\n\nOnce you're good at that, you should have very few problems with leetcode anymore.\n\nThere are problems that you'll absolutely have to memorize. Dijkstra's algorithm is named after the dude because it is nothing short of brilliant. I know I am not that clever, so I won't come up with that solution to that problem. but i don't have to memorize how to scan an array for the largest value, because I actually understand what is going on, any way,  and can rebuild the solution when it is needed.\n\n\\*: Fun fact, chicken sexing is one weird exception that nobody has an explanation for yet. But, without doing any research, I suppose that is by design. There's money to be made from keeping the knowledge secret and mysterious....",

        "body": "The \"open-ended\" questions typically involve market-making scenarios, probability puzzles with multiple valid approaches, or trading situations where you need to make assumptions and justify your reasoning. They want to see how you break down problems, ask clarifying questions, and adapt when given new information mid-problem. You can't really drill these like you would technical coding questions, but you can practice explaining your thought process out loud and getting comfortable with saying \"I'm not sure, but here's how I'd approach it.\"\n\nJane Street's bar is high and they're looking for a specific type of analytical thinking that either clicks with you or doesn't. But the uplifting part is that if you've made it to round three, they already see potential in you. Focus on being genuinely curious about the problems they present, don't be scared to ask questions, and show them how your mind works rather than trying to guess the \"right\" answer. The topics can range from basic probability and statistics to market dynamics, so having a solid foundation there helps, but your reasoning process matters more than perfect recall of formulas.\n\nI'm on the team behind [interviews.chat](http://interviews.chat), and we built it specifically to help with these kinds of challenging interview scenarios where you need to think on your feet and articulate complex reasoning clearly.",

The downside is that you might feel like you‚Äôre spending a lot of time on modules you‚Äôre not passionate about if they aren‚Äôt data focused.\n\nThe Statistics & Data Science MSc is more specialized. It shows that you‚Äôre committed to a career in data and analytics. This can help you stand out if you‚Äôre going straight for data scientist, data analyst, or data consultant roles. But data science is competitive as many people enter with a PhD or years of experience. So, with just a master‚Äôs, you‚Äôd want to build a strong portfolio of projects, maybe internships, and show you can apply your learning to real world problems.\n\nIf you want maximum flexibility and aren‚Äôt 100% sure whether you‚Äôll go into pure data or something adjacent, stick with Computer Science. If you‚Äôre confident you want data focused roles and want your degree title to reflect that directly, then go with Statistics & Data Science. Since you‚Äôre also open to more human facing roles like data consultant, either degree could work. Employers will usually care less about the exact title and more about your ability to explain data clearly, work with stakeholders, and use tools like Python, SQL, and visualization platforms.

If employer is paying for then still fine, is an accomplishment you can list on a resume. But they're not paying so you better pass.\n\n>Are more AWS certs or other certs worth it?\n\nNo. I almost say AWS is worthless but I worked at a company that liked seeing AWS Associate. I didn't have it or any AWS experience and was hired since I used Azure at my last job. The cloud certs are the only ones I ever see and only about 10% of the time. Less relevant for that 10% if the company uses 1 of the other 2. So you see, low value but not zero.\n\nRest of certs are scams.\n\n*How do you stand out more after graduating?*\n\n1. Work experience. Nice if the job is a similar industry. List technology you used on the job because no one wants to train you. Make the hiring manage believe you can make significant contributions with minimal training. Easy to get the chance if they like you resume.\n2. Greater than 1 YoE, resume can be 1 or 2 pages, or 1.5 is okay white space kind of looks bad. Use a big font if 2 pages. Honestly, big font is underrated. Eye tracking surveys you can search for show HR reads you resume for less than 8 seconds. Don't make it an adjective fiesta. I list the tech stacks both in the job descriptions and in a separate section at the bottom for ease of reading.\n3. A select few companies like seeing community involvement such as volunteering. Can attend young professionals events and maybe make friends at companies that are hiring. Adult kickball leagues, I know multiple married couples that met on teams.\n4. Sounds obvious but be within driving distance of the office. I don't list my full address, just City, State, Zipcode. Remote jobs all well and good but those get the most applicants. Almost every company I know went back to 3-4 days in the office.\n\n>still managed to hit \\~120 applications. No job still.\n\nIn 4 months, that is slack. 10 applications a day = 300 a month is still slack. You have no idea how overcrowded CS is. Pick it up.",

        "body": "Wanted to give some perspective as a SWE that left Squarespace earlier this year (based out of the NYC office). Squarespace definitely has a pretty chill wlb and has a good engineering culture + you should have a very supportive engineering manager. There were regular company-wide panel meetings for engineers to showcase their recent work and share interesting news and upcoming tech. However, from my own experience, the product management and roadmaps can be a little shaky and if you are the type of dev that prefers autonomy and moving at your own pace, you might feel bogged down by all of the meetings and politics between different teams & departments.\n\nAs the other commenter said, options are definitely a crapshoot and thats part of the reason I left for a startup where my options would have a little more upside + I could have more eng & product ownership. By the time I left I had a few years of stock refreshers that were worth about 75k a year in straight up equity which were then converted to plain cash payouts after SQSP went private. The change to options was def a downgrade for me given that any potential value hinged on growth in valuation and going public again or doing a stock buyback/other liquidity event. At the time that I left a lot of people viewed the valuation target from the company leadership as a bit aggressive but who's to say that they can't meet it with some aggressive catch-up against their main competitors (eg. shopify with a current valuation \\~25x that of Squarespace when it went private).\n\nI'd say to not make the jump just because of the potential value of the equity, but if you're looking for a good engineering culture and interesting product to continue your career growth I would definitely suggest considering Squarespace",

        "body": "For software development, the languages that companies value most right now are Python (super versatile: backend, automation, data science, AI, security), Java (still huge in enterprise and backend), C# (popular for backend and enterprise systems), C++ (more specialized, but strong in systems, embedded, and performance heavy apps). You might find backend, automation, or even systems programming a better fit. Python is especially powerful because it crosses into both software development and cybersecurity. For cybersecurity, it‚Äôs useful for scripting, automating scans, and working with security tools.\n\nIf you‚Äôre interested in cybersecurity, focus on Python scripting for automation. Networking basics (which you‚Äôve started on). Linux security and command line skills. Certifications like CompTIA Security+ or CEH (these can help open doors). If you‚Äôre more interested in software development, building a few solid projects (maybe a command line tool, an automation script, or a backend system) will help you stand out.\n\nEU companies often look for flexible engineers who can do multiple things. Stick with Python as your main tool, add depth with either Java or C#, and build some focused projects. Also, check out [Cloud Strategy Labs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhSfe40GX9gqDkFvvURNJA) for more clear roadmaps and step by step guides for both software development and cybersecurity.",

C# shines in desktop applications, enterprise software, and especially in game development with Unity. So even if you‚Äôre not into web dev, both still have strong non web uses.\n\nFor projects you can still build things that stand out without touching frontends. Automation tools to write a Python or C# script that automates boring tasks (like cleaning up files, organizing data, or generating reports). System utilities to build a command line tool for network scanning, log parsing, or monitoring resources. Cybersecurity mini tools which are things like a password strength checker, simple intrusion detection script, or vulnerability scanner. Data focused projects to parse large datasets, visualize trends, or build small machine learning models. Game or simulation projects using C# with Unity or even Python with Pygame, create a small but complete game or simulator. Make the project useful and complete not just half finished code. If you can also write a short readme explaining what it does, why you built it, and how to use it, recruiters will notice.",

If you can support your lifestyle on your salary (maybe even with savings etc) then you are taking a chance at what might be a bigger payoff down the road vs what you would get at a public company.\n\nFor example, I joined a D round start up, worked there for one year but exercised my options when leaving, then the company was acquired one year later. So I made 1800% in two years. You're not going to get that kind of return at a public company, though the value of the stock would be available sooner and guaranteed. \n\nPersonally, young people should take more risks. The really small startups might be such a gamble they're not worth it, but I think going for a private company that has a good trajectory and is well established is a fantastic idea and a risk younger folks should be willing to take. These opportunities are not available to the public and they are what separate capitalists from laborers.\n\nMost important is finding somewhere you can tolerate going everyday where your manager has your back and people aren't dickheads.",
