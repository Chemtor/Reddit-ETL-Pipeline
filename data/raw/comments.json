With so many applicants being shrunk down to 21 people I imagine you were able to pick exactly who you thought could just slot right in with no training.\n\nYou had 9 out of 21 fail the phone screen.  I assume this is mostly vibe based and general work based.  So I can understand why 9 failed.\n\nYou then had 3 out of 12 people fail the data challenge.  I assume this was a basic data challenge to ensure you weren't just lying about credentials.  Which makes it odd that 25% failed, but again I can understand it.\n\nBut then 5 out of 9 failed the tech review.  I find that odd that so many failed.  Was it an experience issue with the tech stack.  Is this where technical questions about the tech stack were asked?\n\nAnything you would have wished gone different?  I find the funnel here to be very lopsided.  Do you think it would have been better to start with more than the 21 initial candidates?",

Sure you can argue that the \"medallion architecture\" is just marketing crap rebranding an idea that's been in use for decades, but pre-aggregated data serves a vital purpose when you're serving data to analysts. Just off the top of my head:\n\n- To make calculations consistent across teams. If teams across large orgs aren't sharing code with one another (as what typically happens), one team might calculate the same KPI slightly differently from another. This is just an extension of the single source of truth logic that guides a silver layer.\n\n- Not all analysts on all teams are going to be technically proficient enough to produce the aggregated data they need. That's a great aspirational goal, maybe FAANG gets there with their amazing pickings. But for 99% of orgs, that just isn't happening.\n\n- Some analysts re-query the same data sets *a lot* during development. Do you really want them running a monster query with tons of joins repeatedly when you could just save compute by pre-aggregating the data for them?",

You need experience as the end consumer of a data stack (or lack thereof), have some comfort with software engineering as opposed to simply \"knowing how to code\", and put in the work to learn how to build and maintain the plumbing that enables data to make its journey from source to business value. This last part takes years of work.\n\nThe most common story I see (and mine is more or less the same): STEM major works as DS/DA/BI analytics/similar position. Slowly starts contributing to the data stack, at first with small contributions and incident reporting/response, then with more substantial contributions. They either make the switch in-house or move jobs and suddenly find themselves in a position of autonomy to build. From this point you become a DE in a few months, by definition.\n\nI suggest you *don't* look for DE positions. Look for any other job as a data practitioner, and try to slowly move upstream on the data stack from there. It really does take years.",

I think consulting is honestly a very good way to get into DE. You get exposure very quickly to different industries and business functions and so you develop intuition for drilling down on and solving real business problems. You are given much more autonomy than working in house because your client assumes you know what you're doing based on your price tag and the fact your sales team probably sold you to them as an \"expert\". You also gain broader experience and it's a place where being a jack of all trades and self learner is greatly appreciated, which is kinda rare in UK companies.",

It is called “pocket mining” and I am not aware that any of it is done outside of that little corner. ...\n\n>Pocket hunting is an ingenious process. You take a spadeful of earth from the hill-side and put it in a large tin pan and dissolve and wash it gradually away till nothing is left but a teaspoonful of fine sediment. Whatever gold was in that earth has remained, because, being the heaviest, it has sought the bottom. Among the sediment you will find half a dozen yellow particles no larger than pin-heads. You are delighted. You move off to one side and wash another pan. If you find gold again, you move to one side further, and wash a third pan. If you find *no* gold this time, you are delighted again, because you know you are on the right scent.\n\n>You lay an imaginary plan, shaped like a fan, with its handle up the hill—for just where the end of the handle is, you argue that the rich deposit lies hidden, whose vagrant grains of gold have escaped and been washed down the hill, spreading farther and farther apart as they wandered. And so you proceed up the hill, washing the earth and narrowing your lines every time the absence of gold in the pan shows that you are outside the spread of the fan; and at last, twenty yards up the hill your lines have converged to a point—a single foot from that point you cannot find any gold. Your breath comes short and quick, you are feverish with excitement; the dinner-bell may ring its clapper off, you pay no attention; friends may die, weddings transpire, houses burn down, they are nothing to you; you sweat and dig and delve with a frantic interest—and all at once you strike it! Up comes a spadeful of earth and quartz that is all lovely with soiled lumps and leaves and sprays of gold. Sometimes that one spadeful is all—$500. Sometimes the nest contains $10,000, and it takes you three or four days to get it all out. The pocket-miners tell of one nest that yielded $60,000 and two men exhausted it in two weeks, and then sold the ground for $10,000 to a party who never got $300 out of it afterward.\n\nMark Twain, \"Roughing It\"\n\nAbout sums it up.

Start small with just loading some files to a storage location (S3 or blob) and learning how to work with them there (read and write).

This makes me wonder if a pivot into Inside Sales or Pre-Sales might be a better fit, since it combines technical skills with people skills.\n\nFinancially, I’m not very stable right now — more or less living hand-to-mouth while supporting my family. This makes it harder to take big risks, though I am eager to find a path that brings both stability and growth.\n\nSo I’m torn: should I double down on becoming more technical (even if it’s a longer climb), or pivot into a solutions/Pre-Sales role that might leverage my natural strengths and offer quicker growth?",

And the latter is sometimes difficult because although every manager loves the idea of pay-per-use, they soon find out they actually have to pay for what they use, while in the old system they did not have that dynamic. \n\nGiven the amount of overhead of running something yourself, I would definitely not rule out Snowflake. It really is a breeze, you data size sounds like you are always in a small warehouse. One important aspect is your query patterns. A warehouse starts running with a single query and remains running for at least a minute after the last query (if configured to auto suspend). If you have something that queries the data periodically, like every five minutes, this will add up very fast. The smallest warehouse is like 3k per month full time running at the higher plans, so keep that in mind.\n\nWhat I think I would recommend is a combination of Snowflake and something opensource you can run yourself, using Iceberg tables. Do the heavy lifting in Snowflake, doe the simple querying with your own computer. We are eying that currently, and I think we will save around 50% on our Snowflake bill.",

It costs $X for Y compute, and $2X for 2Y compute, and so on.\n\nThey give you a free trial to figure out your estimated costs for your usage. It's easy to determine $X/Y ratio.\n\nIt scales up and down so you can match supply (Monday morning rush, end of month workloads, that new ML experiment you want to try, basically turn off on nights and weekends) with compute demand. The important thing about the cloud is you can rent compute elastically.\n\nBUT\n\nthat $X/Y ratio for compute in Snowflake (compared to other options including DIY) is a bit of premium, because it's a SaaS and everything is managed for you \\*and\\* they are offering a lot of functionality - particularly GenAI, enterprise-grade DR, data sharing, etc - that you may not need.\n\nIt's up to you to decide if you'll avail yourself of that functionality to justify the premium pricing Snowflake charges.\n\nSo the math is simple:\n\nDIY/open source/IaaS is lower capex (\"Free!\\*\\*\\*\") + a lot of opex (\"pay people to manage it\") for ... a highly variable set of functionality. (Good luck doing AI on open source Postgres)\n\nPaaS/SaaS is higher capex (\"Snowflake is expensive!\") + very little opex (\"this thing runs itself\") for ... a fairly robust set of functionality.\n\nSo in my opinion it's not really about the size of your data and more what you (and in your case, your tenants) intend to do with it.\n\nWhen my old boss was buying new chairs for the office, he said something that stuck with me: \"When you buy something cheap, and you use it every day, you start to hate yourself for being so cheap. When you buy something expensive, and you don't use it at all, you start to hate yourself for being so careless. Be sure before you buy something you know how often you're going to use it.\"\n\nPS: I work at Databricks where basically the same logic applies, so you can trust what I wrote here, I don't say nice things about Snowflake as a rule, but they are a high quality product at a high quality price. Don't think of it as \"needlessly\" expensive  -  think of it as \"am I going to use it in a way to deliver the value I'm trying to pay for?\"",

In snowflake it's around $40 and no free storage.\n\nAnd as long as Postgres is concerned, you can use a hybrid in which you can use it for smaller transactional data which you might not want to store for longer period, like logs, sessions, and sometimes historical data, you can use it for quick processing for your SaaS and use Data Warehouse for analytical use cases because as your data will grow Postgres will start to slow down in processing, but data warehouse will be great for processing big data, using this approach will significantly optimize your cost and boost your use case.",

The rest is compute, so that’s hard to estimate, but I don’t think your use cases will be too heavy.

We've seen tons of companies move from exactly your setup (PowerBI + expensive compute that runs 24/7) to ClickHouse and it usually works really well for retail drill-down scenarios (we have a very large retail customer at Tinybird doing exactly that - unfortunately I can't mention them by name).\n\nClickHouse is that is quite literally built for this kind of workload - fast aggregations across massive datasets with arbitrary groupings. Your use case (drilling down by UPC, store, category, department) is pretty much textbook OLAP stuff that CH excels at.\n\nA few things to consider though:\n\n1. You'll still need to think about your data modeling. ClickHouse works best when you denormalize things into wide tables, which might mean rethinking how you structure your retail data\n\n2. The PowerBI integration exists but it's not as smooth as native connectors. You might want to test the performance of PowerBI queries hitting ClickHouse before committing\n\n3. Consider whether you actually need PowerBI at all for this. Are you embedding a PowerBI dashboard into a user-facing app? If so, any reason not to ditch it and just build some data APIs and a custom dashboard UI?\n\nDruid is also solid for this but ClickHouse has better SQL support and is generally easier to work with imo.\n\nI'd definitely recommend spinning up a ClickHouse instance and loading a subset of your data to test query performance before making any big decisions. But yeah, this seems like exactly the kind of problem ClickHouse was designed to solve.",

Challenges with OBTs include:\n\n   * Some reporting tools prefer or expect dimensional models\n   * Even with columnar storage there are performance impacts from having a large number of columns, especially high-cardinality, long strings.\n   * If you are keeping raw data so that you can rebuild your OBT, then you already need versioned models, which is the hard part of dimensional modeling, to support rebuilding it.\n   * Without dimension tables getting a consistent cross-tab with all possible dimension values isn't possible.  The best you can do is spend too much time querying to get all dimension values found in your dataset, which may be missing critical dimension values.\n   * Redacting PII or other data is vastly simpler in a dimension table of 100,000 rows than in a OBT of 400 columns and 10,000,000,000 rows.\n   * Sometimes people want to see dimensions associated with an event from some other time then when the event occurred.  For example, what's the contact for this customer *now*, or name of this company *now*, or what was the industry category for the customer at the end of last year?  All of this is trivial for a dimensional model and impossible for OBT.\n   * Usability sucks with a OBT with 250+ columns\n   * etc, etc, etc, etc\n\nFor this reason I see OBTs as an occasional early version, but dimensional models as the feature-rich mature version of most analytical databases.",

Alternatively, having a mentor-type person who can give you direct feedback.\n\n- Talking with people directly, asking: \"hey, I just gave you this explanation but I want to improve and want to know which information is useful to you and which one isn't. Knowing what you know now - what would the ideal explanation be for you?\"\n\n- asking directly how technical the explanation should be, and adjusting on the fly.\n\n- slightly different background (R&D) but I learned that explaining the thing that happened in the order that it happened makes for terrible story telling. You need to figure out what the value is for someone, and then cut all the explanations that are not useful in, well, explaining it. That's a tough one for me because it also meant having to let go of my ego - as in: having to drop some information and explanations that I really found good / useful when they don't help in making the messageseven clearer.\nMaybe \"Storytelling with data\" is helpful for some situations?\n\n- I'm not saying that's the case for you but for me one big learning was that I'm probably not the most important person, and that what makes my job interesting to me is not relevant at all. It also doesn't matter whether my solution is picked - not whether it's implemented in the way that I envisioned it. What matters is that the team as a whole benefits from an idea - I had to shift to a broader view of things rather than just of me and my work. This takes self-reflection and it also takes experience. \n\n- Also, what I do is a service to others. Have a look at leaders who have a service-mentality to their leadership style and try to emulate them.\n\nGenerally, what helped was direct feedback and interacting with colleagues. What worked less is trying to figure things out by reading and thinking it through - that useful sometimes but it doesn't cut through my echo chamber. What's still missing for me, some people need an explanation that's not an explanation but a story that they can digest on their level of understanding - I sometimes struggle if I have to simplify it so much that the story stops being meaningful to me.",

To me what sets candidates apart is to talk about where dbt can go wrong in a project and what are the best practices, alerts, and team education you can put in place to help manage dbt complexity.\n\nFor example, people often complain about dbt’s spaghetti DAGs where model lineage is impossible to trace. I would ask a candidate 1) what is the software engineering concept not being followed that is causing this mess (my answer: lack of DRY models and not having one purpose per model) 2) How would you go about fixing this? (my answer: start with a model used for BI consumption, understand its source tables and columns, check column level lineage for each column, come up with a plan to consolidate intermediate models after understanding each column calculation) 3) How do you prevent this in the future? (My answer: create a strong culture of preplanning and peer review, alerting based on some measure of DAG messiness in the CI pipeline)\n\nGoing from “I just know general dbt concepts and execute them” to “I can make your data ecosystem stronger with my dbt skills and promote of a culture of engineering excellence” will take you way further.",

Keep doing this until you can look at data and understand the whole business use case and story behind the data you're looking at.  \n\nThis takes a long time.",

For example the NFL starts next week, you could scrape fantasy football rankings from multiple sites and calculate each player's average rank (or some other analysis). Matching the players will be non-trivial, because different sources aren't consistent about use of nicknames, suffixes like Jr., or exactly how to write names (Ja'Marr vs Jamaar).\n\nThen it's reasonable to build a medallion architecture. Bronze layer is raw html snapshots (or maybe jsons from an api). Then have an ETL process to turn those into tabular data with a consistent format and names (and/or an arbitrary player id) and store in the silver layer. If you want to get fancy that could be a sql database with a few tables (rankings, sites, players). It could also be a csv. Then another process to aggregate by player across sites and store in the gold layer (if you want you could automate collecting daily snapshots and analyze the change over time). That might be something like another sql table that exists to serve a dashboard.\n\nSports is just one example, there are lots of domains where you could scrape (or otherwise obtain) multiple sources of data then (fuzzy) join and aggregate them. If you don't want to do fuzzy matching and multiple scrapers/interfaces, you could do daily snapshots of something like pokmeon card prices or the weather and aggregate across time. This sort of thing is a common use case for a simple but non-trivial data pipeline.",

Don’t shoehorn your functional requirements into a framework that wasn’t built to meet the functionality you need from your system.\n\nI personally like the medallion architecture in principle, but this is the classic issue with it: shoehorning your specific use case into a framework that doesn’t work for you. \n\nThe medallion works well for what it’s meant to because it encompasses separation of concerns, e.g. land raw, untouched data in ‘raw’, cast, parse, and make data workable in ‘stg’, then join and aggregate data into usable datasets in ‘gold’/‘marts’. This makes trouble shooting easier and pipeline creation systematic. \n\nYou architecture says to hell with that but let’s call it “medallion”. It’s not, when you modify data in “raw” it’s no longer actually… raw… the medallion architecture also wasn’t built with data catalogs (thinking catalogs in the observability sense, I.e a data dictionary, you may have a different meaning. Too many new buzzwords) or semantic layer in mind. It was built as a framework for what are now data/analytics engineers to systematically build pipelines. \n\nWith that being said, forget the idea of using medallion architecture for your use case. Don’t shoehorn your functional requirements into a framework that isn’t meant support your functional requirements. I don’t like the idea of joining tables or building incremental models in “bronze”, but if it makes sense for your use case then great. Is it because you need that data for backfills/full refreshes of your catalog layer? Maybe use s3 to store that in partitioned files instead. Have a team super familiar with sql/dbt but not familiar with how to integrate with s3 and would be a hassle to train? Then that solution is out of the picture. \n\nOne last thing: report specific layers are dumb imo. Don’t do that. That’s how you get one report that says revenue was X and another that says revenue was Y because analyst B was working with VP C who doesn’t believe GAAP needs to be followed precisely and wanted his dashboard to make him feel good. Or you’ll just get duplicate queries/tables. We have an “analytics”/metrics/semantic layer organized by what fact table it stems from. That’s what works for us, it may not work for you, but we designed it to work for our use case and tech stack",

        "body": "I'm not sure where the confusion is. We are exactly making sure not to shoehorn our requirements to fit into a framework that isn't built to meet the functionality needed for our system.\n\nThat's the entire point of the post and my comments here. Whenever there is a use case that comes in front of us that doesn't fit into the way we've structured our DBT project, we figure out how to fit it in, we don't change the requirements to fit how we're doing things.\n\nMaybe someone can actually expand on the downvotes to my comment instead of pointing out other things instead? I could be completely wrong with what I said, but I can't learn anything if we're not actually responding to anything specific in my downvoted reply. Only thing I can think of is that maybe DBT's recommendations have evolved since they've added semantic layers, since you would generally want to build semantic layers on top of your silver layer, so it should definitely fit somewhere into the DBT project.\n\nAs far as how the medallion architecture works, I've seen what I've said recommended here and elsewhere before. It's like you said, just do what fits your use case. When you say raw, you mean something more raw than I might. When people at my company say raw, they mean something that you can use to rebuild anything that's raw. That might be renaming fields back to their original names, reconstructing an original field, or casting numeric columns back to varchars.\n\nThat being said, I agree with you that once you starting doing more complex stuff like incrementals, joins, etc., it stops being a view into the original raw data and starts to become something more.\n\nHowever, if you asked me if these models more closely represented raw data in a bronze layer or business entities in a silver layer, I would tell you that these models more closely represented raw data. This is because the entire intention of these models are to surface a more curated view into the raw layer. They answer questions like \"I see that X from this data source is being mapped to Y in this other data source, why are these data sources related this way?\" Then you can go into the models for each data source and see how they've been transformed so that those models can be related together.\n\nFor example, maybe there's some fuzzy search logic that builds an incremental mapping for related columns shared by the 2 data sources which then gets joined into each model. Does this change the raw data in any way other than adding new fields to these datasets? No, but is this logic that we think is simple enough that we would justify doing it on top of our source data? No. And does the result represent a business entity? Still no, because the business entity would probably be these 2 datasets joined or unioned together.\n\nHaving said that, if your problem with my original post and not my comment is that I classified that layer as \"bronze\" and don't want me to call it that, that's fine. That's not my intention and frankly I don't care what it's called, I just chose to call it (in parentheses) something I thought others would understand. Maybe I didn't explain it very clearly in my original post, feel free to let me know.\n\nFor your last note, thanks for the suggestion. I agree, we try to shy away from report-specific stuff as much as we can unless we have a really specific use case that really doesn't fit with what everyone else is doing (some nasty period-over-period metrics for example). I like your idea of an \"analytics\" layer instead, makes perfect sense.",

Also pulsehook is much easier to setup compared to cloudwatch. \n\nI got perplexity to do some research on it comparing the two. Here is the short excerpt from it:\n\nIf you just need to know whether your cron jobs or data scripts ran and succeeded (plus error details for debugging), PulseHook is way simpler and cloud-agnostic. It’s built for developers who want fast setup and easy alerts. AWS CloudWatch is much more powerful but focused on deep infrastructure/app monitoring for everything in AWS—great for big teams, but overkill if you just want lightweight job status alerts. PulseHook works anywhere; CloudWatch is best if you’re already all-in on AWS.",

If a specific data model is being refreshed then recursively traverse through the depends_on field until each path ends, then sort them. You can also group data models together by a tag and filter to that tag.\nI’ve used this in other contexts, but never actually for managing data models, so you should consider the maintenance considerations and whether it would work within your context.",

If you happen to experience bugs or anything weird please report as a Github issue or in the #dbt-fusion-engine community slack channel\n2. you're right to call out that the Fusion CLI and VS Code extension are different things, but overlap slightly.\n3. Forgive me if I get long-winded, I'm a former teacher, so always love a good lecture / teaching opportunity. Please let me know what of my explanation clicks (and what doesn't!)\n\nOn launch three months ago, we published the blog: [The Components of the dbt Fusion engine and how they fit together](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-fusion-engine-components). It's worth a full read, but I wanted to paraphrase the section about [the VS Code extension and Language Server](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-fusion-engine-components#the-dbt-vs-code-extension-and-language-server).\n\nThere's actually 3 components worth calling out:\n\n1. The Fusion CLI binary (basically the equivalent of dbt Core but in Rust)\n2. The Fusion Language Server binary (a.k.a LSP)\n3. The VS Code extension\n\nA language server share a great deal of code with the Fusion CLI but it's intended user is not a human in a terminal, but rather an IDE who can talk to it on behalf of the user. When you download or update the VS Code extension you might notice that in the bottom status bar it will say: \"Downloading file\" that's the extension grabbing the latest version of the Language Server from our CDN.\n\nIn it there's a pretty diagram (made by yours truly) that shows that the VS Code extension has two buckets of features broken out by the binary that powers them\n\n1. **by the CLI**: running commands, previewing models\n2. **by the LSP**: intellisense, lineage, go to reference\n\n  \nIn a comment \n\n>So can I access the enhanced features in fusion without using the extension in another IDE?\n\nTheoretically, the Fusion LSP could be made to work with and distributed such that it could work with other IDEs like you say. However, the reality is today that it only works with VS Code and VS Codium-based IDES (i.e. Cursor & Windsurf). If we hear of enough demand for other IDEs (emacs, JetBrains), we'll certainly make it happen there as well.",

You highlighted my exact concern, bringing this up in the regular meetings is basically pointing a finger at someone and that's not my intent but right now is the best time to fix this as we just redesigned and I don't know how much is dependent on it yet. Unfortunately the people id have to pull in to answer those questions wouldn't consider it a priority.  \n\nI took this job to learn about organizing, culture and workflow of larger teams and unfortunately it's been more frustrating than educational. By the time the problems get to the devs it's far too late to do anything about it, I really wish we could have useful design reviews but that was something I was hoping to learn at this job.

They also take the flak when things are slow, don’t pan out, or aren’t as useful as they expected. Ideally, with good leadership principles, this is transparent to the rest of the team but also not in a way that makes the team feel unsafe. These relationships are built on trust, good examples, work ethic, and competence. \n\nBut that good leadership is VERY VERY hard to find. Even at big FAANG companies.

Some of our biggest challenges are mapping CCDA's (QHINs have a million special snowflakes), FHIR, and EDI X12 (claims). While Synthea can build CCDA and FHIR, we also are lacking EDI X12's big time.\n\nThe MS CCDA/HL7 -> FHIR converter is meh. We still hit the same issues... mappings mappings mappings.\n\nAs someone who interviews DE's in this field (in the US)... if you want to demonstrate you understand these datamodels, just put a bunch of ADT's in a dataframe and display a chart. Doesn't need to be more than that. If you wanna do something fancy, you could do something with CQL on FHIR (this would cover all kinds of topics and show you know how to work with a real world problem/scenario).\n\nGood luck homie.",

Synthea produces pretty clean data, at least in the sense that I believe it places data in the fields where they need to go, the fields are used as intended, and the data is relatively predictable. \n\nDo you have any recommendations on how I could implement the types of issues that require mapping the data to expected outputs?",

Perhaps different to where you are in the world, although realistically speaking you better be pretty fucking good and experienced if you're going to demand contracting rates which are typically quite high for an engineer.  For example, I have a friend who contracts for a big pharma company in a Senior position managing clinical trials.  I have looked at day rates for a standard DE role here in the UK.  Our rates are not a million miles off each other given the gulf in responsibility and impact.\n\nAside from that, this requires a mindset shift.  As somebody who was self taught, I had the same problem of trying to measure myself and going down the very dark hole of asking, \"what jobs am I good enough for?\" which eventually devolved to \"will I ever be good enough?\".\n\nThe cycle is this - you apply for jobs.  You get nothing back - you go away and improve your existing code, take another look at your CV/resume, you continue learning.  You get something back, your profile and the job market conditions are in the right place.  You keep repeating until you get something back.\n\nThere are no secrets, hacks, or shortcuts.

You can read Athena tables in Glue because it reads the underlying S3 data, but you cannot write to Athena tables the same way you do in the Athena console.   \n  \nThe recommended approach is to perform the transformation and insertion entirely within Glue: first, read the source data from S3 into a Glue DynamicFrame, then apply any necessary transformations using PySpark, and finally write the results back to the target S3 location in the correct format (e.g., Parquet). This way, Glue handles ETL, and Athena is used for querying, avoiding the unsupported pattern of executing Athena queries from Glue.",

This is actually a recommended approach when you need to split data from a single collection into multiple destination tables.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. First, you need to define logical partitions in your collection by specifying one or more fields as partition keys:\n\n```\ncollections:\n  acmeCo/user-sessions:\n    schema: session.schema.yaml\n    key: [/user/id, /timestamp]\n    projections:\n      country:\n        location: /country\n        partition: true\n      device:\n        location: /agent/type\n        partition: true\n      network:\n        location: /agent/network\n        partition: true\n```\n\n2. Then, in your materialization, you can use partition selectors to direct specific partitions to different tables:\n\n```\nmaterializations:\n  acmeCo/example/database-views:\n    endpoint: ...\n    bindings:\n      - source:\n          name: acmeCo/anvil/orders\n          partitions:\n            include:\n              customer: [Coyote]\n        resource: { table: coyote_orders }\n```",

There are plenty of ways to add additional capabilities, for example the different serdes for file formats. And you can bring in different libraries from the jvm.

I'm not sure what exactly *the* small files problem is or what *your* problem is in particular, but if you're looking to, say, keep only the latest values based on some key across multiple files, you have a few options.\n\nOne option is as I described: compaction. Go across your files and grab only the most recent data you want/need, merge into a new file, discard the old ones. Whether you want to implement this and how kinda depends on your exact data needs, so it's hard to say. At the very latest, I'd do this before archiving any data.\n\nThe other is to just track all changes in the data in your silver layer and grab the latest value. It's not really solving the small files problem though. Worst case scenario is just appending the files into a large file and keeping track of the file from which it came (or timestamp, whichever is more important).",

If traffic goes via a NAT Gateway, it can be a bottleneck (and pricey).\n* Avoid casts/joins/orderings in the UNLOAD query. Precompute into a temp table, then UNLOAD.",

        "body": "It looks like most answers here are talking about programming-specific reasons, but here are examples where even non-programmers, and you too, 'naturally' start with zero:\n\nWhen someone is born, they are 0 years old. Their \"first\" year of life all takes place while they are '0' years old. Interestingly, there are some cultures that start *this* indexing from 1, e.g. in traditional chinese age counting, a baby is 1 when they are born. Even then though, you can generalize this to other time periods. A person's first 'decade' of life all takes place while they are 0 decades old. This is the same reason why we are living in the \"21st\" century even though the year begins with \"20\" and not \"21\". (Although note there's some annoying aspects of the definition of this type of 'century').\n\nIn many buildings throughout the world, the \"1\" floor of the building is the one above the ground floor. More rarely, although I've seen it, the ground floor may even be labelled the '0' floor. I suspect this probably has other reasoning behind it, but it's at least tangentially related. Here's some simple reasoning for why counting floors like this works and might even help you to see what's \"nice\" about zero indexing in the first place. The ground floor is \"0\" floors above the ground. The second floor (labelled 1) is 1 floor above the ground. And so on, the nth floor is labelled n-1 and it is n-1 floors above the ground.\n\n(Side note: This \"number of floors offset from the ground\" idea is how arrays are implemented in C and many other programming languages. The first element has offset 0 to the 'start' of the array, the second has offset 1, and so on. So the reasoning and math lines up exactly with this floor offset stuff).\n\nHere is some mathematical reasoning for why such indexing is nice. Let's say you have 100 people and you want to split them into groups of 10 each. You could label them 1 to 100 and then split up the groups so that people labelled 1 through 10 are in the first group, 11 through 20 in the second, and so on. However, there is a nice property that you are *almost* able to exploit here... What if everyone in the first group has a \"0\" as their tens digit, everyone in the second has a \"1\" in their tens digit, and so on? We can't do this because the first group has the person labelled 10, the second has the person labelled 20, and so on. You *could* get this nice labelling if you instead labelled everyone from 0 to 99, so the first group is people labelled 0 through 9, second is 10 through 19, and so on.\n\nIt might seem like the example above is contrived (and it does work 'extra nicely' cuz I chose 100 and we use a base 10 numbering system), but you can generalize it as follows. Say you have n people (and n is divisible by p) and you want to split them into p groups. Say that n = p \\* q, so that each group has q people in it. Then, if you label these people from 0 to n-1, you could ask each person labelled i to find the result of i / q (truncated), and that gives them the \"group index\" they are in. So group 0 would be for people that are labelled 0 through q-1, group 1 would be for people labelled q through 2\\*q -1, and so on. We wouldn't get this nice scheme if we labelled our people from 1 to n (in fact, we would then have use the equation (i-1) / q, which is effectively re-labelling our people with zero indexing!) Another interesting thing to note here is that not only does this setup work nicely with zero indexing, but it also naturally *results* in a zero-indexed group numbering system.\n\nThe above example is related to why, when working in modular arithmetic, let's say the integers mod N, the 'canonical' form of the elements is usually considered to be from 0 through N-1. When you start to learn more algorithms, you'll see that many algorithms will work nicer or the algebra may be neater if we use zero indexing. (Note that there definitely are algorithms which work nicer with 1-indexing too, so this is more anecdotal than anything, but I think it'll still give you a feeling for why zero indexing is nice). The last example also relates to why using half open intervals i.e. \\[0, N), is such a common paradigm in programming (for example, a python range includes the 'start' but excludes the 'stop'). The 'niceness' of using half-open intervals (which may also seem strange at first) is somewhat related to the 'niceness' of using zero indexing.\n\nI'm sure there's more such examples, but hopefully this answers your question in a more broad sense, and you see that 'indexing by zero' is not just limited to programming, and, perhaps unintuitively, feels more 'natural' when you think about it.",

Way back, programmers were trying to make use of every bit they could because so little memory was available. This is the reason for two year dates and the Y2K problem. Back at the time, programmers thought \"Hey, that's two whole bytes I could use somewhere else that could actually be useful.\" I think starting from the first available byte value, instead of skipping it, appeals to that tradition as much as it's just natural to do.",

What actually keeps you moving is discipline and consistency. Make a schedule, stick to it, and just keep showing up.\n\nHere’s the thing: once you stop, it’s surprisingly hard to come back — even if you used to love coding or learning before. That’s why it’s so important to stay connected, even on low-energy days. Watch a CS video, read an article, or just mess with some code. The longer you’re away, the bigger the gap gets, and the harder it is to return, so you need to do something no matter however small that might be. For God sake even just opening vs code & browsing through the code for couple of min also counts.\nAlso,  a little arrogance is actually useful. Not just belief in yourself, but that competitive arrogance of “I want to be better than others.” When everything else feels low, that pride can keep you grinding. And don’t underestimate daydreaming. Imagine what you’ll be once you finish this project or learn that new concept. Sure, it’s mental masturbation, but it feeds your feedback loop and keeps the fire alive.\n\nAll these factors — discipline, arrogance, dreaming, consistency — they don’t always burn equally strong. Sometimes one carries you, sometimes another. But they only start working for you once you actually start and keep going. You might feel like some of these things don't apply to you but they will in their due time when you are at it.",

It's unproductive, disruptive and will likely cause you to make strange learning decisions instead of rightly pursuing what is relevant or interesting to you. It is a journey and you should celebrate your milestones, even the little ones, rather than wasting energy by lamenting the fact that you haven't magically become a programming savant overnight.\n\nIt's a marathon, not a sprint, do not burn yourself out trying to 'catch up', but do be diligent as there's more than enough to distract us all these days. Anything you learn, even if not immediately applicable, is very rarely a waste of learning.\n\nLastly and probably most challengingly, really reflect on that hatred for maths. Maths is a lot like programming in that, for the most part, it's dozens if not hundreds of fairly straightforward concepts all stacked on top of each other and its the concepts you misunderstand / misapply that trip you up. If you dislike maths I'd have a good think about whether you dislike actually puzzling over it or whether your education system has constantly thrown you challenges beyond your comfort level and never given you the chance and support to address your weaker spots.\n\nSome actual learning advice / resources:\n\nOn the maths front, Engineering Mathematics by K.A. Stroud is my top pick for a zero to hero maths book if it's of interest as it really starts from the fundamentals.\n\nIf you like Python, automate the boring stuff with python is a fantastic resource, available as a website, courses on Udemy, a book, whatever floats your boat.\n\nOutside of that, honestly just do some coding puzzles online. Codingbat, codingames, codewars and loads more. Leetcode is there too but is probably best left for later once you're feeling up to it.\n\n3 months to do some well directed self study is gold.

        "body": "Here's a secret: Jobs don't want specific degrees these days, they want you to 1. be college/university graduate, preferably with a Master's degree. 2. Have a crap ton of relevant certifications. Certifications are great because you can do them on your own time, and they are basically diplomas that prove to the job market that you have specific knowledge they can use, not just general knowledge in IT.\n\nCheck out this to find out if you want to get an idea on which jobs you can do within IT:\n\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/career-paths/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/career-paths/)\n\nAlso, and I cannot stress this enough: Make a Github profile, and start making hobby projects. The sooner the better. It took me three weeks to create my first game in pure HTML/CSS/Javascript using MVC pattern (don't even worry about what that means, you'll find out). The game SUCKED, but it was mine, and I loved it. And I published it on Github Pages, and it's still up.\n\nMastering programming is all about solving problems. Well, your problem right now is that you only know basic HTML. That's fine, because if you're a programmer you understand that the position you're in right now is exactly where a seasoned senior developer is, but from a different vantage point. Whereas they have to solve huge problems that can make companies lots of money, or save them costs, the only problem you have to solve is how to get better at programming. Take it as an enormous privilege and get started.",

Some people advise starting on a project immediately, but I personally disagree with this until you have some fundamentals under your belt. (Just my experience). Also, another piece of advice, find a language and stick with it for awhile. When I first learned programming, I kept agonizing on which specific language to learn, but the reality is that really doesn't matter all that much. Most of the concepts you master in one language will translate to another.\n\nOh and 17 is not late to start coding, I didn't start to learn how to code more than a tiny bit until I was in my late 20s. I'd say you're doing quite well :)\n\nEdit: One other thing to note. You might find in college you might grow to like math more btw. When I was in high school, I also hated math a lot. What I realized later on, was that a lot of that was how it was taught in my high school. A lot of my math classes in high school were just straight memorization of formulas and I despised every moment of it. Once I got to college though, I actually learned how to think mathematically, how those formulas are derived and proven, and learned that math is actually quite beautiful. Just a thought to consider.",

The difference is just what you need it for. The biggest thing you need to get comfortable doing is breaking things down into smaller steps. Say you've got a project in mind, something simple like making a little calculator app with HTML and JavaScript. Maybe you don't know how to do this at all. Well, how do you break that down? You need a webpage with buttons and display, and you need some JaveScript to do some work for you. So, how do you make a webpage? You can look that up. See what HTML is and how to use it. Then you can design a really simple looking calculator. How do you get javascript running on a web page? Look it up. It's simple, but you won't know without looking it up first. Then, how do you get javascript to know when you press something? How do you get javascript to change the display somewhere? You can look these up, and suddenly you know what you need to make the app. Now it's just a matter of making some simple functions to do your calculator's math and you've got something you can be proud of.\n\n  \nThe trick is, look up how to do the concept, not the specifics. So, don't look up \"JS how to add 3 + 5\", look up \"JS how to add two numbers.\" Then apply it to your situation. You get a little thinking involved, and you get a little better. Keep at it and it won't be too long before that kind of stuff is easy and you're struggling with harder things. And APIs? You'll always have to look those up. Not because you won't understand them, but because the specifics are always unique to whatever you're doing.",

They are really not that helpful at the stage I am at. Normally I go through the following, roughly in order: \n\n1. Libraries. Most projects require (or are made significantly easier) by using libraries. I start by looking up what is available, because that gives me an idea both about the problem, and about how people normally go about solving it. \n\n2. Documentation. When I have decided for a library to start with, I go over it's documentation. I specifically look for setup and \"first steps\", but everything that seems remotely interesting I will take a quick glance at. \n\n3. Forums, Blog Posts, Stackoverflow. At this stage I will probably have some questions, so I look for people who have either had the same questions and found answers, or I will look for blog posts trying to explain it. This is the only stage where I sometimes use AI, but very very rarely. I have gotten pretty good at getting to the answers with classical search engines, and getting the answers that way is normally better, since I stumble upon a lot of other information that might prove useful later.   \nAnother important skill is to find good blog posts. I blocked [medium.com](http://medium.com) completely in my browser, since it's just 95% time wasting blogs that copy and paste directly from the documentation in order to farm clicks. Self hosted blogs, especially those with a long history of similar topics, are the best. Reddit ranks somewhere in the middle. \n\nAnd the most interesting links get bookmarked and downloaded for offline viewing, especially all documentation I need. There will never be a stage where you know all of this by heart, the best thing you can do is make sure you keep access to it, even without the internet, and you should know where the information you need is located.",

        "body": "* **_Code Complete_ by Steve McConnell.** Strengths: provides a strong, comprehensive foundation for how to think about programming and software engineering that I recommend to all developers. Weaknesses: the book is on the long side; the book is a bit dated, so no mention of open source, cloud, CI/CD, TDD, etc; focuses mostly on OO languages (C++, Java), with no mention of functional programming. \n\n* **_Clean Code_ by Robert C. Martin.** Strengths: an excellent guide to writing code that is readable, maintainable, changeable, and testable; includes tons of examples, so instead of getting just a list of \"rules\" to follow, you get to see how to iteratively improve code, step by step. Weaknesses: has taken a lot of flak recently for some of the recommendations (e.g., very short functions), or perhaps due to hate for the author (who admittedly can be off putting), but I still think it's well-worth reading for all programmers; focuses mostly on OO languages (C++, Java), with little mention of functional programming.\n\n* **_A Philosophy of Software Design_ by John Ousterhout.** Strengths: does a good job of defining complexity in software and the key causes of it; good discussions of information hiding, error handling, and conventions; contains some interesting counter-arguments to the practices in _Clean Code_, so it's good to read the books side-by-side. Weaknesses: focuses mostly on OO languages (C++, Java), with little mention of functional programming; the discussions of strategy vs tactics and trends felt a bit weak.\n\n* **_Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests_ by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce.** Strengths: the best book I've seen on teaching you how to write automated tests; makes a compelling argument for how tests lead to better software design; includes many examples, and shows you how to use tests to iteratively produce better code. Weaknesses: the book focuses entirely on Java and OO, so yet again, functional programming is ignored; the book can get boring at times when it gets deep into the weeds of the Java Swing threading model.\n\n* **_Seven Languages in Seven Weeks_ by Bruce A. Tate.** Strengths: a fantastic way to get exposure to not only multiple different programming languages (Ruby, Haskell, Prolog, Io, Erlang, Clojure, Scala), but also multiple different programming paradigms (OO, functional programming, logic programming, meta programming, concurrency constructs, type systems), which is a terrific way to become a better programmer; lots of great exercises in the book that give you a taste of what makes each language and paradigm unique. Weaknesses: it's hard to be an expert in so many different languages, so some of the chapters are stronger than others.",

        "body": "It can be hard to put these into practice. You end up picking a few things and trying those out first, then slowly add other ideas. \n\nYour priority should be readability first, then maybe make it efficient. Why? Some beginners (more true 30-40 years ago) believe the most efficient code is the best code. Maybe when computers were slow, this was important, but today, it's far less important.\n\nAlso, unless it's an algorithmic improvement, most programmers don't know what is causing their code to be inefficient. They make a guess, and hope that it works, but often, they can't tell a difference. The code runs fast to begin with and whatever fraction faster it runs is not even noticeable.\n\nSo, readability first. You may think coding is for computers, but it's also for humans. When you opt to make things run fast or use less memory, then you write code that's harder to read. Others will find your code confusing.\n\nMy advice is to learn how to write good function and variable names. This is not at all easy. But good names act as documentation. Many developers are lazy when it comes to documentation. They find it a waste of time. At the very least, getting good function/variable names does improve readability.\n\nYou can see beginners opting to pick variable names like `x, y, z` because they struggle to come up with good names.\n\nThere's this idea that functions are meant to reuse code. That's true, but it can also be used as a kind of documentation.\n\nFor example, I encountered something similar to the following:\n\n    code == 10 || code == 12 || code == 30\n\nLet's say these codes indicate someone is tax-exempt internally in the database. They serve as a classification of the person's status, and numbers are used to be precise.\n\nIt would read better as\n\n       boolean hasTaxExemptStatus(int taxCode) {\n          return taxCode == 10 || taxCode == 12 \n                   || taxCode == 30;\n      }\n\nEven if you only call that function once, it makes it clearer. I was originally going to call this `isTaxExempt`, but I renamed it to `hasTaxExemptStatus` because that felt more accurate to me.\n\nThe other common tip is: DRY. Don't Repeat Yourself.\n\nIf you see yourself copying-pasting the same code over and over, then make it into a function and refactor all of that code.\n\nThere are other more sophisticated tips, but I'd say start with those two.",

        "body": "Some thoughts on what you have so far:\n\nI'd say 1 isn't too important, to be honest. Sometimes it's nicer to have hairy code inlined for developer sanity. Code that tries too hard to separate every little thing into a function is often much more taxing to read. It depends what you're writing. Long functions aren't intrinsically bad. Minor idealism.\n\nIn 7, avoiding unnecessary assignment is fine and can be very beneficial, but this is getting into the functional realm a bit. In other styles/paradigms, and in practice, assignments are often done for readability where there wouldn't otherwise be a need to create a local to hold temporary state for the computation. Again, depends how general you're looking to be with these rules. Same with 8. Lots of useful functions will never be deterministic. E.g. a function that timestamps something couldn't be considered good here. This works fine for canned computation but can break down in real software.\n\n9 also has lots of exceptions. There are many reasons you may want an infinite loop and you rely on them often without realising. Yes, you probably don't want to write one very often in general application dev. It's more important that infinite loops don't block event loops, UI threads, don't spin-lock (unless you intend) a core, and that when errors occur in code that runs as part of the loop, they're handled properly (e.g. recovery if possible/desired) or the process exits, or device is reset etc. Sometimes there is no useful work to do outside of a loop, the whole program is a big loop, etc.\n\nI'd add:\n\n\\- Function is necessary and worth the extra code. Compilers are pretty good at inlining but that doesn't help me reading the code. E.g. You rarely need to pull a single operation into a function (e.g. n << 1) or something. Just write it in place.\n\n\\- Function interface is fully documented. This includes types of inputs/outputs, and full details of any possible exceptions (and their types), behaviour on error, error codes etc., what behaviour is defined/undefined for given states. Reentrancy (if it isn't, e.g. stores state elsewhere!), thread safety (if it isn't). Locks it will take on resources etc...\n\n\\- Function output params are reasonably obvious too (not just input params).\n\n\\- Function code is all roughly the same level of abstraction. E.g. a syscall (or C library call for a syscall) in the middle of some UI object method that handles a button click would likely be unexpected...",

Yes, controlling your side effects are important, but unless you're working in a functional language, things like printing and logging can be ignored 99% of the time, and the better visibility you gain into how your code functions is well worth it. If you're working in object oriented, sometimes you need a void method that operates via side effects, and that's okay. Not everything makes sense to have an output. Knowing what they are, documenting what they are, testing what they do, that's what's important",

Although the main way to control for maintainability and correctness should actually be the testsuite.\n\nSure we can observe various attributes that functions tend to have in a maintainable and largely correct codebase. And I think you hit some good points, but for many of these points I would actually say there is a 80%/20% or 90%/10% rule, etc.  \nFor example, X% of functions should be deterministic and Y% should be non-deterministic. And X% of functions should always terminate and Y% should loop forever.\n\nFor example, when using the actor model, it is expected and useful to have exactly one forever-looping function (with exception of its shutdown mechanism) per actor. It would make sense to have all the other functions guaranteed to terminate. For other paradigms, the rules should be different.  \nIn async based projects for example, it makes sense to have rules when a function is allowed to be async. Many projects make all (or most) of their functions async by default, but that actually tends to introduce unneeded complexity. Limiting stuff like this requires a bit more thought when creating the system, but saves a lot of time on maintaining, debugging, and refactoring later.",

Depending on what you’re trying to do, the loop may be necessary.  \n\nAlso, half the point of OOP is that systems are dynamic, so having all inputs passed as parameters might be shooting oneself in the foot.  I would slightly amend that to say “minimal global parameters.”  Otherwise I agree, though.  I like being able to match what goes in with what goes out, not having to guess which method or global parameter caused an exception because, idk, wrong type or something.  I used to get so frustrated as a beginner with divide by zero exceptions and be like HOW???  WHERE?   It would often be something external, and cleaning up doesn’t hurt anything.  But you also sacrifice functionality.  I just don’t like documentation/commenting, but you can solve a lot of problems like nan exceptions when comments draw your attention to the workflow.  I honestly (besides commenting) don’t understand why I don’t have more exceptions than I do other than just building some good habits over time.\n\nAbsolutely agree on unnecessary side effects.  I do keep a lot of stdout printing at first so I can focus attention on the flow, but if it works, it works, and I delete all that stuff.  You need it for debugging.  IDE’s catch exceptions.  But just because something doesn’t return an error doesn’t mean it does what you want it to do.  But if it works, it works, and you don’t need a lot of side effects beyond that.\n\nOverall, this is a great list!  I’m gonna copy this and keep it handy.",

You want logging, don't you? This approach to writing functions is more from a functional programming language view where functions should be side-effect free, but honestly, it's a pain to accomplish that.\n\nYou can strive for it, but many don't seem to care about side effects. The ones you hear more are avoiding the use of global variables (passing stuff through parameters).\n\nIt would be nice if certain languages could return tuples instead of single values.

There is mostly \"better\" or \"worse\", where \"worse\" is still far better than nothing.\n\nIf you just worry about \"wrong\", you won't get very far. Be curious. Experiment. Try things. Figure out what works, what doesn't, and how you could optimize it, once you've got it working and if you see that there is room for optimization.\n\nA good approach is that whenever you learn some major subjects (e.g. arrays -> lists -> dictionaries/maps) you revisit your old code and see if you could use any of the new found knowledge there. This will not only show you how much you have improved, but also force you to rethink and to try different approaches.",

If you wanted to change the UI, you should be able to do so without going near the program code.\n\nGood examples of this in the real world are games and websites. A game calculates the stuff you see separately from the stuff that makes the game work. In a modern 3D game, all the “stuff you see” happens on the GPU, but the game functions run on the CPU. In a web app like Reddit, the UI runs on your browser/phone and gives you a text box to write a post, but when you hit submit a whole other computer (the server) handles that text you enter, storing it in a database and making it visible to other users each running their own UI.",

The first is to write a test harness that, once it passes, then you know the task is done.\n\nLike today I was stuck trying to build this new user story and ended up just making a really long cypress test that setup the environment to where the feature was relevant and walked through all the necessary steps. It failed (of course) but it failed quickly and showed the exact spot where it was failing so I could keep changing something, run the test, change something, run the test until it could run all the way through.\n\nI think that solves one cause of this which is constantly trying to remember how to get to the spot where the thing you’re working on pops up.\n\nAnother cause is when I have to make something that involves several layers of abstraction. For that I like starting on one end and just sprinkling assert statements with detailed messages as I go. That way I don’t end up with a spaghetti mess of code that I’m trying to fix across several files.\n\nHope that helps :)",

Add something like accessing a database and learn how to deploy the database.  This is just an example of how to build out what started as a simple application.\n\nThe first time you do something, it may not be the best, but you will learn.  The next time you can try changing things to compare until you find a method that works for you.

You bring the game/sim loop, and basically everything else. You call it to get input, or ask about events, or render something (if you're using it to render). It's basically a cross-platform platform layer that you can build a game engine (or whatever you like) on top of.

        "body": "Let's first define what inversion of control (IoC) is so people can understand why this is a good definition for frameworks (if you ever used one).  \n\nThe best analogy I have ever read for IoC is a breadboard that one uses in an electronics project.  The easiest example of a breadboard is one with a single input of DC current and a ground, aka a simple circuit.  Along the path of the current you can add devices to split it, devices to merge it, devices to redirect or terminate it, or devices to do something like making a beep sound.  We can think of the point where we apply the current as input and the ground as output but it doesn't matter because you can think of the ground just another device that kills the current while doing something else.  The key is the input.  \n\nWhat a framework is someone giving you a breadboard with all the wiring done for you and telling you that you have device A, B, C, etc. that can do X, Y, Z respectively and the final result is G (ground).  \n\nThis is how many JS web frameworks work, the circuit is designed for you with a few switches here and there but your primary job is to insert your devices at various spots (aka put in hour data and code).   The point is all the logic is worked out for you so you can just ***plug and play***.  \n\nA library is more like an auto-mechanic's toolbox.  It is a set of tools (or APIs) that are related for accomplishing a set of related tasks.  A good example of this in JS is JQuery.  They are typically very specific uses and very tiny.  You have to know each tool in the box well to really make it shine.  SDL is a library because it mainly provides a thin layer allowing you to manipulate the hardware through an abstraction layer.  \n\nA game engine is a very complicated IoC with a bunch of tools in a library that allows you to manipulate the breadboard so to speak so that you can write your own breadboard logic.  Of course it also has something like SDL for controlling the hardware.  \n\nIn general, unless you are paid to do something using either a framework or an engine, you should avoid wasting time on them.  They are hard to generalize and hard to learn because you have to learn the underlying rules and logic.  Learning them is like learning how the internal of Window works just so you can use a browser on your computer.  You should aim to learn through libraries and the smaller the better because then you can figure out how to write and modify them if you ever need to.",

Think of the browser and its DOM and JS API. It handles the JS event loop, and fires events. The interface it presents you is that it will read and run your code on page load, and if you happen to attach any listeners to targets it will run your custom code when events happen on those targets. Frameworks are like this. When your problem is the problem they're built to solve everything is great, and when you need to do something bespoke, it can be very difficult unless the framework provides some escape hatch. E.g. When Angular 1 was popular it had two-way binding, and you very much had to write your front end \"the angular way\" to keep everything in it's digest cycle (or whatever, it's been 10 years) or it wouldn't know state had changed etc. Digging into the same page with jquery often backfired.",

I don’t know, but you and your students probably do.\n\nThen, with your students, meet the unmet need.

And in this space, PHP is still a powerhouse. From WordPress, Magento, Drupal, Laravel, Symfony, and countless premium solutions, PHP continues to fuel a massive chunk of the internet.\n\nThat said, the current tech landscape is evolving. The spotlight today is on scalable, secure frontends, and that’s where JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Knockout dominate. Add to that the industry’s move toward headless architecture and microservices, and you’ll see why frontend innovation is driving a lot of excitement.\n\nMeanwhile, Python has carved its own path. Thanks to the AI/ML revolution, it’s become the go-to language for data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The beauty? If you know Python, you’re not limited—you can work on AI/ML and build web applications too.\n\nIn short: PHP isn’t going anywhere, but the battlefield has expanded. The future belongs to those who can adapt across ecosystems—whether that’s PHP, JS frameworks, or Python.",

That was ok for me though, because I liked the challenge and learn how things worked under the hood, like how computers manage memory with pointers and all that.\n\nToday I program mostly C# and it's a fantastic language that's quite easy to pick up and very powerful. You can also use it for Unity or Godot game engine.\n\nYou can pick Java too which is very similar to C#, but I like it slightly less for some reason.\n\nPython I usually advise against as a first language, because of its dynamic typing and you might learn some things you may have to unlearn later on. On the plus side, Python is very good to know for prototyping and automation and it's very popular and you should definitely learn it at some point. I think it will be the most similar one to Lua, so if you want to try something a little more challenging and new, maybe pick something else.\n\nDefinitely dm me if you would like to chat or would like a code review or something.",

May require research. \n\nThen pick an important item and start coding. \n\nThis process will help you understand what you actually want to accomplish, learn about solutions to common problems, and save you tons of time reworking things you hadn’t thought out yet.",

Computer science is more than coding.  Trying to pull trig and algebra patterns out of your head to solve a calculus riddle is math I don't like.  But doing reductions of digital logic circuits using math algorithms was fun for me, and I did better some some people good a traditional math.    \n  Solving computer science homework/exam problems was hard for everybody, and I had my moments, but you have to picture in your head where you want to go, write it down in pictures, then you can conjure up the code to get there.   Well, at least for me.  Sometimes my code was called \"brute force\", but I didn't care, it worked and computers are large and fast these days.  \n\n  Sometimes  you have to take \"poetic license\" with the requirements of the problem to solve it.   I once had a class problem involving recursion.  It said each iteration had to spawn the next using the previous values.  The entire class literally had the method spin off another thread, until the computer cried out for mercy.   I just sent the values of the output back home to the main, made junk collection destroyed the method and recovered the resources, and created a new one, with the saved values.  Yeah, sound obvious to you now.  :)   The rest of the class thought I cheated.  The professor gave me a strange look, and said it was OK, probably because I had the only working solution.    Just solve the problem.  That means first map out how to get from here to there.  The coding actually becomes a bit relaxing until you reach compile time, and moment of truth.",

In this way, it is its own documentation; whenever you're unsure how your system would behave for a given set of inputs, your unit tests should clue you in, either through static analysis or by failing/succeeding.\n\nAs you point out, having tests gives you a level of security knowing that new changes don't introduce unexpected behaviors.\n\nWhat you say with regards to losing your \"feel\" for the code, that can happen and arguably is a \"feature\" of having excellent test coverage and architecture. If you're soloing a project by yourself, you might not see the immediate benefit. But if you work on an incredibly complex code base with multiple contributors, it's actually a great thing for you not to just rely on your feel. In the \"real world\", imagine you're pulled off a project and someone else takes your place. This person will have no \"feel\" and will rely on test coverage to ensure they're not breaking anything.\n\nAnd finally, from my experience, relying on tests hasn't necessarily diminished my feel for the code. I still know what it does and where it does it, but I have the extra validation that I have the test coverage needed to make changes.",

Having the path and following it are two completely different things.\n\nAlso, being around computers is something most people do now. Playing video games is being around a compute a lot, but just loving video games doesn't mean you'll be good at programming. To be fair, being afraid of a computer isn't great news.\n\nWhat's difficult to assess, and you won't know until you start, is how well you'll figure things out. Some people have a knack for programming even if you wouldn't expect it. Maybe they've seemed very artistic, but they also have the kind of mind to program.\n\nSo, you have three resources. The question is what do you expect from each resource?\n\nI'd probably suggest (and you'll get others, so you have to decide)\n\n* MOOC with Python (https://programming-25.mooc.fi/). Free (it's also a college course, but you won't be a student earning credits).\n* cs50p (CS50 is a set of courses offered from Harvard via edX, a consortium of universities offering college-level courses for free)\n\nYou could do those two at the same time. The goal is to get good with Python (or good enough).\n\nThen, CS50w, which gets you into web programming with Python and Flask. It's the same guys that made CS50x (which is Scratch, C, and a few other topics) and CS50p (the Python course just mentioned).\n\nCS50w covers some backend stuff.\n\nYou could use FreeCodeCamp to learn HTML/CSS/Javascript to learn some basic front-end technology. They do also have Python, but I don't think it's quite set up in a course format.\n\nOf course, someone will suggest you dive into projects, but I think it helps to know some basics before you do that. The belief is that a good project will keep your interest because you'll be interested in what you build. But that's kind of a big \"if\" (to find a project you'll be interested in that isn't impossibly difficult).\n\nAnyway, good luck. You'll have to sift through a lot of advice and decide what to do.",

The feeling might even be mutual!\n1. My impression is that there seems to be something for programming that's similar to dyslexia or dyscalculia, as in, there seems to be some people who just don't get it, for reasons that appear incomprehensible to people who don't have the dysfunction. Having been an assistant in some courses, my impression is that it's very rare, but that there are some people who seem to get an experience that's a combination of [it goes in the square hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUbIkNUFs-4) (as the piece-tosser, and don't understand why the girl is upset) and [computer says no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0YGZPycMEU). I think it's unlikely that you'd last several years if that applied to you.\n1. There are several different types of programming environments, and what clicks for someone might not for another. As in, I have small experience with [LabView](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabVIEW) and don't want any more, but I have a friend who loves that and detests \"ordinary\" programming. Similarly, I find some languages like JS very hard to reason about because they're so … sloppy, and prefer rather strict languages; but there are plenty of people with the exact opposite preference.

To keep knocking out frameworks, courses, whatever, without ever getting the confidence to dive in and start building. You probably have the requisite knowledge, training, and ability to go off-piste and stop just checking boxes to check them. \n\nI’m not saying don’t learn React or whatever thoroughly if it is applicable, but I am saying you are at the point where you may have more success if you start deciding for yourself what is applicable and what isn’t.

Something down the line needs to be written in machine code so that the computer can understand everything else that we write in human code, right?\n\nThe OS is not **written** in binary code. But because it is **compiled** to binary code, which the CPU directly understands, there doesn't need to be any other layer \"underneath\" it.\n\nThe compiler, too, can be written in a high-level language which is compiled to machine code.\n\n> Or are these fundamental softwares written in high-level languages on an already functioning computer and then compiled down to machine code which gets installed on a new computer? \n\nYes, this is basically it. You can compile an OS, and you can also compile a compiler, but you have to have an existing compiler to do this. So there's a *historical* question of where these compilers came from. And the basic answer is that if you were starting from absolutely nothing, you would have to work your way up from very simple compilers/assemblers, and use those to compile more complex ones.\n\nFor instance, you start out with a system that has no assembler at all. It only understands raw binary machine code, fed to it using some input method. This might be a paper tape reader, or a punched card reader, or toggle switches that let you manually enter data one bit/byte at a time.\n\nThen you write an assembler in machine code, and feed it to the computer. Now you can write programs in assembly code instead of machine code. Then you can write a C compiler in assembly language. And so on.\n\nOnce you have a C compiler, you can rewrite that compiler in C instead of assembly, so that it's easier to maintain. And then it can compile new versions of itself. This is called [\"self-hosting\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_%28compilers%29).\n\nBut remember, this is a *historical* account of how programming languages were \"bootstrapped\" over the last 70 years or so. Once you have a self-hosting compiler, you no longer need all of the previous layers of bootstrapping.",

Computer hardware and software is largely designed as a big old stack of layers, and understanding roughly what they are will help you understand things tremendously.\n\nIn this case, the bit you are missing is that a computer program, once compiled, is already machine code. You write a program as a text file, the format of which is the C programming language. A special program, a C compiler, takes in this text file as input and outputs a file that contains the machine code that is equivalent to what you wrote.\n\nWhen you tell the operating system to run the program, it reads the file and puts the machine code section of it somewhere in memory, then points the CPU to that spot in memory and says \"run the machine code at this address.\" The computer hardware, which knows how to run machine code, takes it from there.\n\nThe operating system itself works the same way. You write the operating system as a C program. A C compiler compiles the operating system into machine code. That machine code gets shoved into the spot where the hardware expects the operating system to be (let's ignore how that works for the moment), and so when the computer starts, it finds some machine code and runs it.\n\nEven the C compiler works the same way! You write the compiler in C, then you turn it into machine code by running it through an existing C compiler, and now you have a nice new C compiler. You may ask \"well, where did the first C compiler come from, then?\" and that would be a great question. The answer is a system called \"bootstrapping\" in which, yes, somebody had to actually write out some machine code by hand at the very start of all this.",

It’s not the same as a programming language, because you’re not programming instructions, but manipulating data. \n\nCompiled programming languages like C, C++, and Java take a different approach, where instead of directly manipulating the data programmers are given access to more abstracted tools, like variables, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and nodes. \n\nComplied languages like C still give you more control over the hardware then interpreted languages like Python, but there’s still more abstraction then you’d find in Assembly. But in the end, it’s all complied down into machine code. \n\nFor clarity, compiled languages are not a step above Assembly in the sense that complied languages are complied into Assembly which is then complied into Machine Code. They’re two different branches of programming with different levels of abstraction, but both lead back to the same root. \n\nNow compilers are generally written through a technique known as bootstrapping, where the first version of a compiler is written in one language, and then the second version is rewritten in the language it’s meant to compile.\n\nFor example, the first C compiler was written in Assembly, but all subsequent versions were written in C.

So we may have to talk about \"free-standing\" versus \"hosted\" environments if we want to make our operating system, and yes, we're more likely to talk about that in the context of a language like C that's widely used both ways and even enshrines the difference in its specification.\n\nBut the real reason C and C++ (and increasingly Rust) are used for OS development is that they give you tight control over how you use memory, and there's a well established tradition of actually using that control to do things people don't typically expect to lean on other languages for. You can grab at arbitrary bytes of memory through pointers and do things that might be \"undefined\" i.e. specific to your hardware and your compiler. A lot of other languages expect that some kind of runtime environment is running under the hood, maybe including a garbage collector that cleans up memory for you, so it's more like the language tries to bring along all this infrastructure that you might want to implement yourself or do without.\n\nAlso you've got to keep in mind that there are many different levels of writing an OS. There's the kernel which can be complicated in its own right. Then there can be lots of drivers, utilities, shells, and built-in apps. A lot of the \"OS\" might be more or less just normal application code running in a hosted environment. That stuff can be written in anything, so a whole OS is not necessarily written in just one language. For example, Google did a huge project to try to start writing more of Android in Java, Kotlin, and Rust a while back, though there is still a lot of C and C++ in it. IIRC Android 13 was the first version to be less than 50% C and C++. (Edit: They were less than 50% in [new code](https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/memory-safe-languages-in-android-13.html?m=1) that version.)\n\nThe point is it's all machine code in the end. The only question is if the language is accustomed to letting you do practically everything the machine code will allow, or whether you would be fighting the language's built-in assumptions to implement the OS's most basic functionality for yourself.",

I'd have replied to your comment but the thread's too old now I guess.\n\nYou explained exactly what I was confused about, thank you! I was partly under the impression that there was some sort of 'translator' layer between software like the OS and the hardware, actively turning the OS's system calls and such into binary code for the computer to understand.\n\nWell, there sort of is, it's called a compiler and it just translates everything beforehand instead of in the moment. So the OS is *written* in an HLL but *functions* in binary. Which is possible because 70 years of computer development made it easy for us.",

Or learn security or blockchain?\n\nLearning a high level overview is the first step to learning programming. \n\nThen u pick a project and start slowly, youtube videos might be only 15-20 minutes long but the creator comes from years of experience and training to get to those 15-20 minutes. It will take time and patience\n\nDont give up and start copying blindly, learn about every syntax, constantly google and ask on forums how and what to do stuff. \n\nAnd use AI to learn. Its an amazing tool for learning and teaching syntax especially",

In the second one you ask what a \"beginner\" should do. The term beginner suggests to me a person who is learning to play the piano. Learning programming is nothing like this. It is more like learning calculus. If you are trying to learn programming this way, I cannot advise you, because I don't believe you will succeed no matter which language you learn. So let's assume you are not a beginner.\n\nIf you are a scholar, I recommend that you learn LISP. Every language that is considered a \"scripting\" language owes everything in its feature set to LISP. If you complete all of the exercises in ANSI Common LISP by Paul Graham, you will understand most programming languages better than 90% of all programmers. It is kind of like learning Latin. After this, every language will be easy.\n\nIf you are an engineer, I recommend that you learn C. Every language that is considered a \"scripting\" language (and even most that are not) directly or indirectly calls the C standard library, and thus C. In fact, C has practically a one-to-one correspondence with assembly language, which means if you learn C, you can learn assembly and understand computer hardware quite easily. By extension, you will understand everything running on your system, even if you don't know all of the details of that particular language.\n\nIf you are neither an engineer nor a scholar, I recommend that you learn Python. It is the simplest, most logical, most approachable, and one of the most popular languages. Anything that is worth doing can be done in Python, and if you cannot learn Python, you cannot learn to program in any language. However, if this is what appeals to you, I think you will be better off in another field, like data science.\n\nIf you are only interested in computer science for the money, I recommend that you learn Java. You will have no trouble finding work, and you will never truly understand anything about programming or computers. Since that wasn't your goal anyway, everything will work out fine.",

And even if you had the audio, automatically determining the chord progression isn't simple or straightforward at all. There may be some advanced AI audio algorithms that try to do it, but I'd expect them to have errors.\n\nHonestly the most likely approach would be to fetch the playlist from Spotify, then search for online libraries of lyrics and chords, then try to analyze the chord progression from there. That would be complex but at least plausibly doable. I'm not aware of a centralized database with chord progressions for most songs, but there are plenty of places online that have them in nonstandard formats (often text). Then you'd have to parse various ways to write chords, transpose into the same key to normalize, and count how many are the \"same\".\n\nEven determining which is the \"same\" isn't easy. Do you count I, V, vi, IV the same as vi, IV, I, V? What about I, V7, vi, IV? There are lots of chord progressions that are very similar but not identical.",

The answer I got from my professor actually made quite a lot of sense to me. According to him there are a lot of fields in CS that require a bit of knowledge of other fields such as biology (bioinformatics) and chemistry. Studying them now makes it easier for us to go in depth later if need be.\n\nAnd when it comes to coding what worked for me was finding what I personally enjoyed and doing personal projects related to it. Speaking from experience, coding just for assignment and stuff will drain the life out of you and you'll come to hate it. So find something you're interested in and make a personal project for yourself. I really liked gaming so how I started coding was by making a 2D platformer game from scratch in Unity.",

I went to a mid school, so I actually did not get taught programming the best, but by getting AI to teach me how to create things, I now have an app on the App Store (its called GradeGrind if your curious since it helps students succeed in university). I think AI will just reduce the number of jobs, but if you position yourself at the top, then it won't be a problem for you, and you may end up creating something that makes you more money than you would have made in a job anyway :) Good Luck!",

They may have \"skills\" that make them better suited for managerial or leadership roles. My manager says he has development experience, but he can't parse simple emails coming from Vendors informing us that they are changing their API tokens etc, and needs a dev to explain what is needed.\n\nPeople who are good at the technical stuff generally do not want the additional responsibilities, stress and the need to deal with other people that comes with being a manager. As an IC, my only interaction is with my team and with my manager, so around 6-7 people in total, and maybe 3 on an average day. My manager on the other hand, on average meets with 10 different people a day and maybe 25-30 people in total over a month. I never see myself as having the bandwidth to be able to tolerate that.\n\nIn short, tech leadership requires a Goldilocks person who is both reasonably adept at the technical side of what they are managing, and has the managerial and leadership skills that are needed for the role. These people are likely rare and are already at highly compensated roles, and they enjoy what they are doing. That means the rest of the market has to make do with the average and below average candidates, many of whom are the aforementioned people who convert from technical roles to leadership.",

I was able to get a new position relatively quickly.\n\nMy strategy:\n\n1. Go onto LinkedIn, filter by recently added, apply to pretty much anything relevant with under 100 applicants. The lower the better. Do this multiple times a day, since postings get updated all the time. Don't even bother with anything over 100 applicants. 0-10 is the sweet spot. \n\n2. If you really see a position you like, tailor your resume to fit it. Use keywords directly from the job description and remove things that aren't relevant. I kept separate resumes emphasizing separate skill sets I have (e.g. a resume for AI skills and experience, a resume for web dev skills and experience, etc.). I found it worked much better than having a single resume with a combination of different skillsets. \n\n3. Mention things you did the past directly, and use numbers to support them (e.g. \"Delivered a system that reduced customer errors by 50%\"). One of the big things you want your resume to emphasize isn't just that you have experience in coding/data science/whatever, but how your experience was able to make an impact and deliver value. Don't be afraid to stretch out your experience to make that point, just be able to actually talk about what you did and how it delivered value.\n\n4. If a job requires a cover letter, it usually has less candidates. It sucks, but it's usually worth it. Don't use AI, just write about how your skills that are relevant to the position helped you deliver results.",

You need to be able to do the work, and you need to be able to get along with people.\n\nLook at what you wrote:\n\n>I think the core of the reason for this is that the ones doing the work are often smarter (or at a minimum, smarter in that area/ task) than the ones doling out or judging the work. See: the slew of MBAs/ executives trying to slap Cloud/ Blockchain/ AI on everything without understanding the costs and limitations of doing so.\n\nThis is a classic engineer/programmer mindset. You're assuming you're smarter than everyone else, and that's the reason you're having a hard time at work. I worked with someone whose first reaction to everything was seethe and talk behind people's backs. He complained once our manager didn't understand something and was just making things harder. I told him, \"why don't you just talk to him?\" Our manager had been technical in the past and was generally pretty easy-going. He went to talk to him, and they switched how they were going to do things. Some people get busy or can't spend the focused time to think through every detail. That's why they're assigning the work to you. While there are extremes, as in the case of the MBAs, there are a lot of senior technical people who are less hands-on-keyboard than they used to be who do understand all the work you're doing, but their time is better spent elsewhere.\n\nYou will run into people who argue the technical work is the easy part. In a lot of cases, you're working on something that is a known thing/solution/pattern. Think about all the people looking for jobs right now? A good portion of them are nearly interchangeable skill-wise. So other things have to help differentiate them, along with a little luck.\n\nYou should work on building relationships with people. This can be done in parallel with hard, technical work.\n\nSo many devs like to trivialize the work of others. Try working in an environment with great management compared to bad management, you'll see a world of difference. Try leading a team and not being allowed to be heads-down working on code day after day. You'll be doing very different types of work, and a lot of people struggle with the transition.\n\nThe dev work you're describing for building a website or an API is easy. Others have done it before, you can follow examples/instructions, etc. Yes, there start to be complications if there are some specific requirements, etc, but you're trying to either overstate how difficult it is, or you're not experienced with it.",

Part of our job is to help stakeholders understand what they’re asking for.

As a lead dev, I mostly do requirements gathering, overall solution architecture, give status updates to directors and up and do code reviews for more  junior developers.

As a developer, spending less than 10% of my time actually developing (and instead wearing mostly Ops and BA hats because the employer doesn't want to actually have Ops engineers or BAs).\n\n6. The bureaucracy - Agile in name only, sprawling meetings, seemingly random change moratoriums, sudden drastic changes in policies, etc.\n\n7.

I was completely in panic mode and had a ton of anxiety around it. I’ll tell you what i did that helped me the most. \n\nI immediately got my resume updated and reformatted it. I used the pragmatic engineer’s template. Some here may frown on this, but asking ChatGPT for help writing bullet points was helpful for me. Not your entire resume, but just help summarizing things you want on your resume. \n\nApply for unemployment. It’s there for things like this, use it. \n\nReach out to your network. Nothing panned out for me within my network but reconnecting and chatting with colleagues was massively beneficial to my mental health. If you’re anything like me, it’s easy to think “im not a good developer, I’ll never convince another company to hire me”. Meeting with former colleagues and friends and hearing from them what I was good at and that I’m a good developer helped a ton. \n\nStart applying. I used LinkedIn (avoid easy apply. I’m convinced those are ghost jobs and scams) and Indeed. I kept a spreadsheet of places i applied. Mostly for my personal use but it does come in handy when filing your weekly UE certification. In my state, they require 5 weekly job search activities. Having this info handy makes it easier to file. \n\nWhile applying, spend time learning or working on interview prep. Have your story prepared and ready. Recruiter screens will usually be a general history of you and a high level overview of your experience. Be prepared to explain anything that might raise questions in your resume, good and bad. \n\nI used ChatGPT for technical prep. It was a massive help. Once you land technical interviews (and you will soon with your experience), use ChatGPT to help you prep. I pasted the job description into chatGPT and asked it to give me technical interview questions based on it. \n\nYou’ll also want to read Glassdoor reviews for the company you’re interviewing with. I wouldn’t have gotten the job i have now if i hadn’t done that. I learned they place a very high value on your “why join (company)” and going back to the prep, having that answer practiced and ready was massively helpful. \n\nI was laid off early May and started my new job, that is better in every way, at the end of June. While it’s true the job market is tough right now, it’s still pretty good for mid+ level devs. I got a decent amount of interest and actually landed a job I never thought I could get. \n\nYou also might look into contracting with your local/state government. There were a bunch of those in my area that would be perfect as an in between while you find something more permanent. \n\nLastly, just know that your worth as a person isn’t based on your job or title. I learned that I placed way too high of value on my job and being a provider for my family financially. Being able to step back and be that parent who’s there for the family and provides value in other ways helped me be a better dad and husband. You got this!",

A lot of those listings aren’t even real, and many of the “applications” are just auto-apply clicks. That’s basically spam, and these platforms aren’t great at filtering it. Even when a post is legit, most applicants aren’t actually qualified for that specific role. I’m not saying the job market is healthy; it’s tough. I’m saying a lot of candidates are taking the wrong steps.\n\nInstead of relying on LinkedIn or Indeed, follow sites that pull openings directly from company career pages and look for roles that truly match your skills. Create a resume and cover letter tailored to each posting. Optimize for ATS and naturally include the right keywords from the job description, both the job title and the required skills, then apply.\n\nIf you’re focused on remote roles around the world, check out a creative method in this Reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).\n\nMass-applying to thousands of jobs is just noise. In a pile of 1,000-plus applications in a couple of hours like the one here, I’d bet barely one or two actually meet the stated requirements. Be one of those.",

Sure, few interviews let me *literally* Google (some have, I just have to let them know I'm doing it), but every other interview has always made it very clear that I'm welcome and encouraged to ask syntax questions to the interviewer.\n\nNo interviewer I've worked with has ever been caught up on if I remember `.length` vs `.length()` (which I still get caught up on because of my heavy Java experience and my kinda recent transition to Node/Typescript). Nobody cares if I've memorized any of the syntax of the language I'm programming in. They care that I can program. That's why they're willing to answer syntax questions, which I've asked many times, and gotten offers from.\n\nI also don't recall a company that *forced* me to use a specific language. Hell, back in the pre-covid days we all whiteboarded in pseudocode anyways. But since I've been doing remote interviews, companies have always made it clear I was allowed to program in the language I was most comfortable in. Again, nobody's paying attention to syntax memorization, they want to see me solve a problem via logic. Not rattle off something memorized that the worst programmer in the world could memorize.\n\nSame for BE vs FE.... My current company is an example. I knocked the BE interview portion out of the park. I killed it. Then I got to the FE portion in React.... and I didn't do too well. I had to ask *a lot* of syntax questions, needed some nudging, some hand holding, and I didn't even finish the whole interview before time ran out.\n\nAnd yet, they gave me an offer. My resume made it very clear I'm mostly a BE developer, I made that very clear in the HR interview, I made that very clear in the HM interview. They knew what to expect, they just asked the FE questions as a formality. It may very well be the case that you're not doing as well as you think you are in the Java interview. That, or you're not making it clear that your strength is BE/Java, and not FE/React.\n\nI'm just surprised your experiences interviewing are literally polar opposites of mine. Literally everything you brought up, I've experienced the opposite of. I have 12 YOE, so I've been around the block.",

A college friend took nearly ten years to get LCA (labor certification the old process) because he had about the most generic Unix and Ingres job possible, and a moron lawyer who wouldn't know an LCA if it apparated in his office...\n\nThe system is screwed as long as loopholes like these remain open.",

When is AI gonna make money?\". Meta is paying several millions of dollars for individual AI researchers. Warren Buffet liquidated over a billion in shares and is holding cash. *Nvidia alone accounts for 7.3% of the entire S&P 500*, which is insane.\n\n\nThere are a dozen signs from employment to inflation that were already in a recession. The current administration's desperation to lower interest rates shows they know somethin bad is about to happen, and they're firing anyone who threatens to break the dam by being honest about the numbers (e.g. the Labor Bureau head).\n\n\nSo it's gonna get worse. It's going to get a lot worse... And then it will get better. But, there's signs this is going to be the big one. The president controlling the Federal reserve threatens to cause hyper inflation. Our debt to GDP ratio restricts our ability to print money and bail out failing companies. I think we're really going to struggle to spend our way out of this one, because foreign interests aren't buying our debt.\n\n\nSo my advice is pay down debt. Save aggressively if you can.

CS is kind of in a perfect storm environment. I think we are in the early stages of a recession, combined with us having high interest rates and over hiring in pandemic has made the job market really tough for entry level talent. I don't think tis going to get better in 1 to 2 years.  \n\n\nHowever, what I do think is that tech and CS is not going way. My personal educated guess is that there will be new types of roles emerging that will be more like product person + roles. Essentially where you would be expected to do project managing plus software development with AI tools. \n\nI don't think software engineering that requires extensive OOP experience  are going anywhere.  I think AI is going to make certain areas of tech explode that people aren't thinking about enough today. The biggest one is I think cyber security, fraud detection etc.  The thing is the tools that tech has pushed the last ten years (AI, Crypto,  Payment servies like cash apps) are eco systems that have encouraged sophisticated criminal activity and thats only going to grow. That also means the opposite is true jobs meaning to minimize fraud risks, protect data are probably going to grow.\n\nPeople talk about AI automating jobs, but most of the people doing the talking have never even sat in a labor economics or macroeconomics course. AI is the type of technical innovtion that compliments the skills of some workers and replaces the skills of others. USually what these type of technologies replace are repetitive tasks. So the more your job is doing the same repetive task (i.e. generating the same reports/analyitcs over and over again) the more likely that job is replaced by AI. This is why I think the future is being more in the product type roles (which are the ones getting laid off the most). However, these jobs will evolve into something like product + software, instead of just product,\n\nI also think the industries in general are going to reward people who think outside fo the box and push creative boundaries. AI is very good at creating simple designs. I think any company that is relying on AI to be the drive for their innovation will probably fall behind in the long term.",

People who are thinking that we will see a return to the mid-2010s tech scene are kidding themselves. AI, outsourcing, and a glut of talent mean that people who went to decent schools for a CS degree, which would have been a sure bet ten years ago, will now flounder in the job market.\n\nThe days of being an average, generalist CRUD app or devops developer and pulling good money are gone. Only established people and the 10x devs will survive, and they will earn bigger paychecks than ever. \n\nTech as a field will continue to grow, and there will be ways to profit immensely from it. However, simply being a decent developer in a certain tech stack is no longer sufficient to stand out. Sure, some people will get lucky and land good roles, but that's what it is: luck (but they will still delude themselves when they come on this sub and call it hard work).\n\nI like to compare it to the DBAs of the first dotcom bubble. Tons of companies had large in-house IT teams and DBAs who made good money. The rise of cloud services and MSPs made them less relevant. Obviously there are still jobs in that industry, but it is more competitive and less lucrative today. Only the best survived and the mediocre people moved on with their lives and found other fields.",

We haven't used it for years.

With a slow interview process, I was able to get up to speed on all the other parts, and by the time I got to a a hiring manager I felt pretty good. Now I'm a team lead at that job, lol.\n\nThe biggest difference, is that to be successful today, versus in 2020, is that companies are being a bit more picky. Whether that's judging pedigree/experience with more scrutiny, or making the interview process longer and involving more steps with higher bars.\n\nEither way, making a step up is very much possible, but you'll likely have to learn the interview process and invest time into the various skills: pitching yourself, LC (or whatever knowledge base is required for ML), systems design (esp. LLM serving, ML systems), and finally behavioral.\n\nPersonally, I'll jump in about 18 months if I don't make Staff and can't switch orgs, and I'm planning about a 6 month period of interview prep, some LC, lots of sys design, and really focus on behavioral. I'm definitely a corporate-type, neoliberal and process-based thinker, and if you can lean into that it really helps.",

In SCRUM meetings you're just supposed to say you did so-and-so or a single task and today you will be doing another task - so you state what that task will be. Probably if I was the manager I might wonder what are you going to be doing today? You kind of need someone in the team you are on to be a mentor to you so reach out to some of the other team members and try to become friends with them.

So, this may be out of date; sharing in case this is helpful.\n\nFor juniors I hire for attitude, passion, and ability to learn.  My experience is that most Juniors don’t know much coming out of college and that is ok.  \n\nBut, if they are passionate and approach things with the attitude of “I don’t know this but I can learn it” then they generally do pretty well.  So, in the interview if you are interviewing with someone like me you get extra points for admitting you don’t know something and taking a stab at it if you have an idea or saying you can ramp up on it.  If you follow up after the interview with a well researched answer as well as your thoughts it will make you a top candidate in my eval.  Just don’t copy/paste someone else’s, this includes AI, answer.  I need to see that you taught yourself something.\n\nAlso on my teams I want people to be willing to ask the “dumb questions” they think everyone already knows.  More times than not it clarifies what we are doing and fills in holes I didn’t realize were there.  Sometimes I just completely missed something and it is my turn to learn something.

Your question, taken at face value, makes no sense. Why would an employer willingly choose a candidate with less demonstrated experience? The answer to this question is \"get more experienced\".\n\nI say this as someone who entered the industry in my 40s, with no CS background, no college, no bootcamps, no professional contacts in the field. \"How do I get hiring managers to consider me?\" was a question I asked myself, fruitlessly, for years. But as a hiring manager now, I get it. Why would I have considered me? And even if I have a disposition to consider more oddball candidates, given my background, there's still an ATS and a literal army of recruiter between me and our candidate pipeline, so I really never even get to see candidates who are oddball. Those are filtered out long before the candidate is talking to me.\n\nI'm interested to hear what other people here will say. I'm sure there are other ways to skin this cat. But the solution I settled on was to change my approach and expectations. I stopped applying for SWE and started applying to roles that were adjacent to, or had some plausible path to, where I wanted to be. I had zero impressive experience you could put on a resume, so I had to start far away, in (non-technical) customer support in my dream company. If you have some impressive experience but not impressive enough for a SWE role, you might consider something like Solutions Architect if you're more into operations, or some kind of Data Analyst role if you spike on the SQL/mathematical/statistical side.\n\nFind companies you think would be good to work for, and start looking through their open roles. Don't limit yourself to only the specific role you think you want next (and for which 100% of employers are ghosting you on).\n\n\\*Sure maybe once in a blue moon this happens for mostly unique or at least impractical reasons (\"candidate has 200k followers on Twitter and a strong social media brand as a SWE influencer\", \"candidate is a maintainer on some piece of OSS that is important to us\", etc), but by and large it's not a thing.\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*Also my answer is calibrated specifically for your situation: breaking into the industry. If this question is coming from someone farther along in their career, the answer is different.",

Normally, hiring folks out of university is seen as an OK investment. The hiring pipeline assumes that for every university hire, maybe 80% of them leave (voluntarily or otherwise) before 5 years. Those 80% give you workhorses that aren't exactly cash cows, but keep the business running. The folks who stay on long term tend to be high performers who carry onward business knowledge.\n\nIt's no longer acceptable to just have an \"OK\" investment from the budgeting process. I've been involved in presenting proposed bodies of work all the way up to the CFO of a F500. Effectively, the view from executive management is that every project needs to be a home run out of the park in order to get approval in the current environment. That means you need to staff it with experienced people who already know the business domain, and can execute quickly without any hand holding - because the promised timelines  to executives are aggressive. I've directly been told by middle management to \"accelerate\" certain projects because other initiatives got approved, and that meant ripping our existing juniors off and re-staffing them on other work.\n\nThat means as an engineering manager, that you no longer want to hire juniors. There is really nothing you can do - because the roles don't exist in certain companies now. The only thing that will fix that are lowered interest rates, or you try to apply for companies which aren't cash strapped. That inherently means AI or crypto companies at the moment, which in themselves will have stability issues.",

Pick up any projects you can that will get you working more closely with dev teams.

Agile practices help inform frontend devs what works best by having a tight iteration process with customers. Though I’ve never seen that practically work out well. The best is to have dedicated UX people, who work with product, customers, and engineers to come up with a solution. Then hand that off to engineering to actually build it.

You can code in ServiceNow, but it's not required, depending on your specific task. A lot of it can be configuration. Also, the ServiceNow market is hot right now, but much of the work is in consulting, which can be total ass most of the time.\n\nJust find an avenue you're remotely interested in and find jobs related to that. It's just a job to many people. You're not alone in this feeling. To kind of answer your question, the grass isn't always greener, especially if you can't find yourself doing a 9-5 regardless of the pay. Treat it as a job to fund what you actually want to do.

I find I have a better understanding of how to setup containers due to my sysadmin experience\n\n\\- I'm a much better devops developer because of sysadmin and dba roles I've been in. Most people who say they are \"devops\" don't have sysadmin experience and can only write simple database queries.\n\n\\- You are much more valuable as a senior because during design and security assessments and client meetings you can bring all your experience.

We are in a market with so much uncertainty ahead. \n\nStudents need to operate on what's probable, not on what's possible, as they progress through their educational journey. \n\nHighly unlikely you will be a software engineer without internships your junior and senior year in college. \n\nYou have to be exceptional today when everyone is inflating their resumes with made up metrics and insane resumes. \n\nTech has always been high risk high reward. Now it's even more so.\n\nThose that get the reward will live comfortable lives for the most part. Those that won't will either keep pursuing the reward as they grow older and more obsolete, or pivot to a career with a barrier of entry that isn't batshit insane. \n\nMy advice to you if you want to pursue software engineering is to leverage further education to become eligible for internships again.

Doesn’t need to be huge, what matters is having some results and something public to point to, or offer your skills to NGOs you care about, there's a platform called catchafire, that's skillbased volunteer matching, nonpaid of course, but if matched, you get to work on a real project, tbh, if you have a cause that you want to help out, just reach out to the local ngos, they would mostly likely love to have you and didn't even have the HR capacity to run and recruit proper internships prograns  \n  \nor you can look into job simulations experiences from forage or springpod, they're pretty much the same, 2-3 hours long program in different fieldds for you to test out and list on resume, not work experience, but as ECA or project experience, low impact but very low investment so still pretty good ROI, or the longer externships, they're mostly 8-12 weeks, proper professional experience that supports backgorund checks, but you need to actually do 50-80 hours work on the platform to list this on your resume as work, you might learn something while donig it, and they’re short, flexible, and give you real-world bullet points fast.  \n  \nand don’t limit yourself into SWE only. Apply to product analyst, technical program manager, ops/automation roles or data, they overlap a ton with software and can get your foot in the door, pay and outlook probably less than top SWEs, but at this point, I would say anything in tech would be a win, later, pivoting back to SWE is much easier once you’re “inside.”\n\none last probably bad idea but good if you have the money, if you’re strong academically and open to it, a master’s can reset your “new grad” status, that puts you back in campus recruiting pipelines with way better odds, think if you can get into CMU for machine learning, that's a totally difference picture now",

He can do his work autonomously, but he doesn’t actually think about the business and what we can do to improve, he is technically strong. He takes something from the roadmap and kind of drives the execution, but he puts no effort into understanding why we are trying to do something or how something can be improved. He has to ask us for basic business context, which shows he is only focussed on a solution, he doesn’t actually care about the teams goals.

        "body": "I’ll try my best but in general the definition is fuzzy. When I interview with a senior engineer I tend to look for:\n\n1. Experience. Not in terms of years but in terms of lessons learned. I tend ask what project stays with them and what lessons they learned. How does it inform how they review designs and code. I’m mostly looking for people who have learned from their failures and can debug their code and designs and do the same for others. Do they have a story where they may have changed their mind after new information was gained or is it a constant stream of “my way or the highway.” This also means as a senior they do have a bit of a network and will have stories of how they talk to and manage people.\n\n2. Technical communication. As a senior, I expect them to be able to communicate not just for themselves but for the team and to be an advocate for reasonable designs while keeping the schedule in mind. I need them to tell me why things will take x days, not just that things will take x days. I want to know why they came to a specific decision and what other decisions did they consider. For people who have had a ton of experience doing this they will have a good signal to noise ratio.\n\n3. Team advocacy. Ultimately trust-worthiness and energizing a team are part of being a leader. Are they going to be a net gain of energy across the team under tight deadlines or are they going to be toxic? It’s hard to determine this within an interview, but as you work with them it gets easier to see. If they are motivated to work as an engineer usually that passion will come out in an interview and is actually hard to fake across multiple interviews. How do they interact with their maybe peers in the team/peer interview?\n\n4. It’s really corny but leadership. What I mean by this is that senior engineers shouldn’t argue from a stance of authority. Authority is given to someone because of who they are not because of the title they wield. How do they make their case? Is it with evidence and data or because they fall back on “experience?” This falls into the communication pillar too. If you have the experience you can tell stories and don’t need to say “because I’m senior.”\n\n5. Understanding of the scientific method. What I mean by this is I see engineering as the practice of making the same behavior repeatable. This means similar to science everything is a hypothesis to be continuously tested. SLIs, KPIs, etc need to ensure that we continue to be good. A senior engineer advocating for manual testing is fine as long as they have a plan for how we maintain that process and why we need to. Do they question our accepted reality or do they accept it without thought?\n\n6. Hard skills are a given and they should be fairly proficient in at least one language. This means they should be able to tell me how the language works and what it’s good for and not good for. They should have tried and tested ways to debug problems in said language and have a reasonably good understanding of how the language runs on a computer. Ie if I get a resume where the guy tells me he is a C++ expert of 10 years I expect him to be able to explain things like how vector or shared_ptr work or how exceptions work and how memory works for C++. They should have stories of how their language of choice is annoying or incomprehensible at times because with enough projects and lines of code all projects become annoying to manage in some way.",

Instead of focusing on every technical detail, think of the story. What problem you were solving, why you chose certain design or tech decisions, and what the outcome was. Hiring managers often care more about how you think than whether you explain every technical term perfectly. Mock interviews, even with a friend or through platforms like Pramp, can also help you get more comfortable.\n\nBlanking out happens when your brain is overloaded. Try breaking things into simple, clear steps in your answers, and don’t be afraid to pause for a second to collect your thoughts. Interviewers usually don’t mind a short pause if it leads to a clearer answer. Over time, with practice, that blanking moment will happen less and less. Also, [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhSfe40GX9gqDkFvvURNJA) shares a lot of tips like this. Breaking into tech, career advice, and handling interviews.

Most of them have PhDs, and the ones with a masters came from a top Ivy then straight into FAANG. No opinion on the matter, just providing some perspective. My team is also not Canadian, so unsure how different that is in Canada. \n\nThere are benefits of staying in Canada. Not being an immigrant on a work visa is eliminating a source of mental strain. Canada is generally speaking more politically stable, and I find the Canadian cities I've lived in (I've lived for extended periods in the top 4 cities) to be much more chill than any cities i've been to in America. There is definitely a cultural shift. Safety is another one, if you compare a city the size of Toronto to any similar sized cities in America, it looks insanely safe. Violent crime rate is almost incomparable. We also have better labour laws, and great unemployment. If I get laid off here, I am entitled to like 45 weeks of unemployment pay of like 700 a week or something like that. All in all, personally as a Canadian I just cannot bring myself to want to grow roots in a tech hub in America like SF or Seattle due to the cultural and safety concerns. It might be irrational, but I genuinely like being in Canada, so I am willing to tank the downsides of it. \n\nDownside is obviously the pay. I worked in an Amazon subsidiary for multiple years and my American colleagues of the same level were being paid almost double what I make after you convert USD to CAD. That being said, that is not a good way to measure pay as our COL is high, but not as high as some would think. We also obviously have less companies to choose from, and the middle tier companies pay significantly less than the top tier ones, so you are going to need to bust your head and rely on luck to get into the top tier companies. \n\nThat being said, its completely reasonable to get a good career and life working in tech in Canada. I have worked completely remotely for my entire career, going from a known Canadian tech company, to Amazon, then to a big tech company offering more pay. I was able to relocate to a MCOL city due to the remote job and I'm almost mortgage free before turning 29. All this is to say that its going to be hard to break in, but its definitely still a good way of life. \n\nIf you got any more questions I can answer for you just go ahead and shoot!",

If the work is satisfying to you and tickles your brain don't switch career paths to do something you don't enjoy, there's value in doing something you like. It's also difficult to find a career with this type of opportunity (even if you might struggle to find a job initially), you can work for a FAANG or F500 company without necessarily having to know the right people or live in the right place. Regarding your concern about actually finding a job, here's what I'll say:\n\n**You'll find a job**. If you're passionate and put in the work, you'll find a job.\n\n**Don't rely solely on your degree(s)**. Do what you can to stand out from the competition. Don't wait until you get your bachelors degree, don't wait until you get your master's, start *now*. Everyone applying for the same job as you has a degree (mostly). Build something and put it somewhere hirers can see, prove that you can do the job that you want. UBC is a good school, but honestly most company's don't care where you graduated from. Having a strong resume is 100x more valuable than the school you graduated from.\n\n**Apply for CO-OP's/Internships**. Realistically this is the best way to get a job when you graduate. Get an internship and do a good job. Not only does this gain you real world experience that can go on your resume, but you pretty much get a 4-8 month interview where you can prove to the company that you would be useful as a permanent employee and hopefully you have a job when or before you grad. \n\n**Finding a job is a numbers game**. Apply everywhere, you won't hear back from 90% of companies, it's just how it goes. Just apply everywhere and familiarize yourself with the hiring process, it will help in the long run even if you don't get the job.\n\n**Take what you can get.** It's mostly only difficult to find a Junior position right now so don't be picky when you start your career. Work somewhere for 2-3 years then search for the job you always wanted. Right now you aren't *that* valuable to a company (no offense). Maybe take a job at a small unknown company for a few years and view it as an opportunity to learn. \n\nIf you're passionate about CS all of this won't feel like work and it will get you a job.",

Everyone I graduated with ended up fine. This includes people who did stuff like polisci.\n\nRecessions and slow job markets come and go, the entry level job market sucks right now everywhere and its not good in any field.\n\nThe last thing is I would have a healthy degree of skepticism towards what people say in tech about their own job market. The field is very prone to coming up with stories and drinking their own koolaid. You will read everywhere about AI, but reality is you have several compounding factors that makes the job market suck right now. This includes high interest rates, which effects tech more than other industries as that means there is less startup money and financign out there, over hiring during the pandemic, general economic uncertainty due to tariffs and current immigration system in the u.s.  All of these things in the short term, but will go away at some point in the medium term.\n\nThe last thing is that I live in New York and regularly attend UBC alumni events. The recent graduates I've met have it so much better than 10 or 12 years ago. The one thing is UBC is a lot more recognized in the states as a university today, especially among tier a corporate companies. It used to be the case that the main way UBC students succeeded in U.S market wasa via american grad school, because professors knew of UBC students. Now a  days your seeing UBC students get jobs directly from undergraduate in Quant Firms, FAAANG and financial firms. THe one thing I will say is that almost everyone successful from UBC, leaves Vancouver.\n\nThe other thing to get is tech is never going away as a field even if all the doom and gloom is correct. You are going to one of the best universities in the world and its academic brand is extremely strong. As long as you can keep your grades up, pretty much every graduate school is fair game for masters and paths to any university exist for Ph.D. (this is not always true). The reality of the world is there are MANY paths to success for someone who is determined, has some luck and siezes an oppurtunity. UBC is a place that you definitely can find a path.",

Regardless of all this, I do think you are doomer posting a little, but I understand and sympathize. ",

Clearly the projects on my resume are nowhere near good enough but I have no clue what a realistic \"good project\" is that I could make.\n\nWhy is it clear to you that it's our projects?\n\nIt could be the market; it could be that if I googled your name, a story about a serial killer shows up, it could be your grades, or your English, it could be bad luck...\n\n>It feels like they only care about projects that make significant money, or have millions of users or performs the exact thing their product already does and better.\n\nHow do you know this? I suspect all you do know is that you aren't getting any interviews, or some other, high level metric, that has no causal, isolated connection to your projects.\n\n>But all of these things feel completely outside of my capabilities? It just feels impossible, like I'm supposed to replicate the efforts of 10s to 100s of expert developers (and people in other disciplines like marketing, graphic design, etc) just to even get some people to look at it and still reject me.\n\nHow do you think anyone else is getting interviews?\n\nDo you honestly believe that the majority of applicants meet these criteria?\n\n>The projects on my resume already took a while to make but even then they aren't \"impressive\" in any way in the grand scheme of things. When I try to imagine the type of things new grads are \"expected\" to have they just don't measure up at all.\n\nYou have just given us a taste of your imagination. Why the quotes around \"impressive\" and \"expected\"? Are those the measures that you think exist, or are they not?\n\n>I don't know what's wrong with my attitude either, it's obviously wrong to be delusional about the quality of my resume, I have to look at it from a very cynical perspective because hiring people have that exact perspective against job seekers nowadays.\n\nWell, then either, you are correct and everybody that does have a job is simply amazing - in which case: if you want to flip a burger right, it's all in the wrist action!  \n  \nOr you're full of shit and overly dramatic, and that's cool and all, but it will not actually help you to get a job.\n\n> If there were any hiring people looking at resumes in a charitable way then I would've gotten a job several months earlier, but that's not the reality we are living in.\n\nCompanies do not give out jobs due to the goodness of their hearts! News at eleven!\n\n>No amount of thinking \"My ideas are worth a million dollars\" is going to change peoples minds if in reality they are not million dollar ideas, so it is just stupid and delusional to think like that.\n\nYou forgot \"pointless\", because the vast, vast majority f developers is not getting hired for their million dollar ideas. and I honestly have no idea what could possibly make you think otherwise. If that was even remotely true, the majority of developers would not be employed, or seeking employment - we would all be independently wealthy with out own products.",

Learn React, HTML, CSS. Fire are you getting data? Learn hire to build an API in the language and framework of your choice. The more popular and standard you are, the better your chances of finding a job. \n\nWhenever I see a resume that focuses on what was built vs what tools were used, I get sad. Making a monopoly clone isn’t the important part. But knowing how to build the different parts is. \n\nWorking on game mods is great and can be supplemental information, but unless you’re trying to work for a gaming company or work with that tech, it’s not that helpful. Oh, you made node for World of Warcraft using Lua. That’s great, but we’re need someone who knows Python and has used Pandas. \n\nIf you’re building “the next great thing,” you shouldn’t be working for some random company. But most of us won’t be building that next great thing. If you want a “normal” job, show some familiarity with the tools and concepts. It’ll make you a better candidate than the one building abstract school projects. \n\nPS - you can continue working in the next best thing in your spare time. \n\nThere’s still a numbers game going on right now, but you want to get the numbers aligned with you as much as possible. ",

Even when they ask about projects I don't really have \"good\" answers, I can't tell them how I singlehandedly drove the group project forward and became the project manager because that didn't happen, I can't tell them how I made unit tests to make my game mod completely bug free because that didn't happen. There isn't really a lot of impressive things to talk about any of them in the grand scheme of things, especially in the extremely narrow view they usually take on things, if I'm not solving the exact problem their product is made around or using every single technology they use then they don't really care at all.",

(It's either that or making up lies about my experience which also seems like a bad idea). You agree that hiring people don't look at resumes charitably which leaves the uncharitable perspective as the more accurate one (So it isn't \"my resume is good and the hiring people are wrong\" instead it is \"my resume is bad and I need something to make it good\")\n\nThere's not much else I can do than make assumptions about why I'm not getting anything. If sending my resume out to places gets nowhere then the rational conclusion to draw is that the resume is not impressive to employers in any way. If hiring people aren't impressed by my projects than the only logical assumption to make is that the people being hired have significantly better projects in every way (more users, more profits, more relevance to each company).

However, if you’re working alongside other Seniors and they’re not doing the level of team management you’re doing, then it might be beyond what a Senior does at your org. Similarly, are there other Leads around that you can compare with? If your org doesn’t have Leads, that’s a very different situation.\n\nThere are a lot of different implementations of this. At some places, a Lead is a line manager. Other places, you have a Tech Lead, who is essentially a particular archetype of Staff, but people stuff is handled by someone else. At some places, there’s what’s called a “Tech Lead Manager”, which is sort of in between the two – usually they have project-level accountability and input into performance discussions, but maybe they don’t do salary review, etc.\n\nOne useful way to frame this is, “I’m enjoying the work I’m doing to lead (or ‘help lead’) the team, and I’d like to talk about my growth path. How close would you say I am to being a Lead Software Engineer, and what are the areas I need to put in work to get there? Can we plan out that journey so that I’m doing the highest impact things?”\n\nBasically, it gets you a lot more information while looking really good and not coming off as a squeaky wheel. A lot of the other ways to approach this can come off as whiny / demanding, which can be totally fine, but is sometimes not fine… and is often not fine for reasons that you don’t have visibility on. Framing it as about your growth gets your leadership thinking about ways to grow you lest they lose you, but in a non-confrontational way. Also, if there’s something fundamental that you’re missing, you’re better off knowing before you spend a year wondering why you’re not being promoted.\n\nDepending on your relationship with your boss / skip-level boss, that might be a good conversation to have with both of them.",

The warehouses are made for humans, so there's a lot of \"wasted\" space and energy put into lighting, climate control, space for humans to walk around, safety, human-readable labels, etc. If a robot has to dodge humans, keep them safe, and read plain-text labels, it's going to be less efficient and a lot harder to program than a dense structure that \\_only\\_ accomodates bots and works by perfectly orchestrating them from some central computer. \n\nCoding languages and our entire tech stack are built for humans in the same way. They try to bridge the gap between natural language and machine language so humans can guide the machines. That's why most devs use higher level languages even though assembly is way more efficient (if you know how to work with it). This is a huge bottleneck for LLMs, because they have to use their computer-language brain to translate your natural langauge into a programminmg language only for it to end up back as a computer language, and that's only for coding itself. IMO, \"beyond human\" programming would cut out the middleman (programming langauges) entirely and work purely on CPU instructions. Data would be densely packed and would not be human-readable, \"code\" would be pure binary, there wouldn't really be a distinction between API, Database, Frontend, etc. \n\nBasically it would look a lot like how ML \"brains\" look to us now: we can't really look at the data they're made of and trace exactly how input A leads to output B, because it's all just inscrutable math to us. We just have to give it in the input and tell it if it got the output we expect. A beyond human program would work the same way, a black box that we just test until it does what we want it to do.",

That all goes towards how affordable and scalable a codebase may be. And \"stability\" strictly from a codebase perspective (ignoring infra) is again mostly a human concept. How bug free is it, how easy is it to catch *human mistakes* that create bugs before they get released. And it ties back to extensibility, how easily can features be added without accidentally introducing regressions that slip into prod.\n\nUnit, integration, and regression testing are *all* concepts built to catch *human mistakes*. It's so when I make a change, I can click a button and see if my change broke anything, and we can enforce passing tests before PR's get merged to prevent mistakes. Remove the human element, and none of those concepts serve a purpose anymore.\n\n\"better than human\" programming, is programming without bugs, or need for simplicity/readability, or need for extensibility, or need for maintainability.\n\nOne example of what that might look like would be a codebase with 0 testing, and that's extremely abstract and difficult to read, to the point it might even be non-sensical to a human reader. I'd know it was either written by a \"better than human\" AI that has no need for the fundamentals of human programming, or by a bad SWE that isn't aware of the fundamentals of human programming.\n\nBetter than human programming is when AI has reached a point where 99% of the issues/concepts that this industry have literally evolved around simply no longer exist. \"Difficult to extend\" is strictly a human problem. If AI coded itself into a corner, it'd just rewrite everything from scratch. It doesn't *need* an elegant solution that doesn't need to be re-written with every little change.\n\nYour chess analogy isn't really that great here. All the elements of chess are inherent to the existence of chess. An AI is just learning to play the game. But a significant amount of the elements that make up *human* programming are not inherent to *programming*.",

It's same the logic with going to college instead of working somewhere right out of high school\n\n>So, at interviews, I know the programming languages, many of the challenges, and how to answer questions about how frameworks and APIs work, but they only ask about what projects I did and then agile related questions and nothing about coding, so I've not been finding any reason to take more interviews.\n\nThe way people on this sub bemoan coding interviews ad nauseam, I thought this was a desirable format for interviews\n\nI don't think you're being a negativity spreader. The fact that you're asking that question makes me think that way\n\n>You're still not the ideal candidate unless you have a lot more.\n\nIt depends on the role, always",

That meant ramping up on learning the code base, writing bug fixes, maybe getting a feature or two to \"own\" and automating things where able. Over time as you get more senior there is more and more bureaucracy because in many of these companies (like the one I work for) design decisions go through what seem like never ending discussions (often it's design by committee, which is unfortunate). Then you eventually get more and more meetings, and you find yourself programming probably less than 30% of the time, and the rest is all meetings and \"investigations\". But you do get more money, and more say as you get more and more senior (generally).\n\nI said \"pre-pandemic\" in the previous paragraph because post-pandemic I feel like it has changed for those just entering the industry. I'm seeing a lot more people join our company and then just immediately go into coast mode. I think it's a bit of a side effect of being so remote (it's a lot harder to train/motivate people remotely), and a bit of it is being brainwashed by social media to believe all you have to do to make the big bucks in tech is show up.\n\nI will say in my experience things have gotten more boring over time. Even though I control more \"high up\" decisions, it means now I have to talk to a bunch of different people/teams before I can really get anything done.

The reason being that your current employer might resent you for forcing their hand and look for a way to get rid of you later. I wouldn't necessarily agree with that, and have taken the counter-offer in the past without negative repercussions. I did leave that employer 6 months after taking the counter-offer when I got an even better offer, so it didn't really work out for them, but it was good for me.\n* Your compensation is on the low end for the senior SWE in a super expensive city, especially given the RTO requirement. The fact that you secured another offer, and your current employer wants to keep you, means you could likely do better.\n* Outside of compensation, there might be other benefits to working at the current company. E.g. You might get good leadership experience in the new lead role. Think about whether it might be possible to move within your current company to work under a different manager.\n* If you aren't able to switch teams while staying at your current employer, I'd probably recommend taking the other offer, based solely on the fact that you described the current team as \"quite toxic\". Hopefully the new role will be pretty chill, and you'll have time to upskill on your own, then seek out an even better offer.",
