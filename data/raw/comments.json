Hell one of my current 6 main projects is building a Data Lakehouse on AWS for serving business data and reporting.\n\nThe difference for me is we are a global SaaS company, but even one of our data scientists has come to me for pipeline dev and recommendations for data arch for a function in a chatbot they are developing.\n\nFortunately my direct superior is on the same page and helping advocate for a title change (which would get a raise with it per company policy). But what I did was took the job description, broke the tasks in the job description down into 'typical role of task' (ie dashboarding and light analysis is typically a data analyst, building and maintaining pipelines via script and platform engineering is data engineer, but more fleshed out than that), I then added in any tasks I do that are not in my job description. I then gave a percentage of my time spent on each domain to illustrate that 90% of my time goes to tasks that are firmly in the domain of a Data Engineer. Fortunately my boss is chill and an advocate and he took that and actually added supporting examples of tasks I have completed that are outside of my job description and is taking it to the C-Suite person he reports to so we can get me a title that reflects my work. \n\nI recommend doing something of that nature with some added answers to what is the value add for the company of each of these tasks.",

I’m assuming you want a DE career path; if not shut it down and stopped doing the extra work. Generally speaking DE is not an entry level position. And with this economy even so called junior roles are asking for a lot of experience/skillsets. It sounds like you have a great opportunity to shape your own career and have on the job training/experience without much restrictions. Start offering to make everything you built so far, more efficient, more analytical, more robust, more real time. If they like what you’re saying, then you have free rein to set up traditional DE systems and architecture, giving you experience people would gladly pay for. Once you feel you’ve nailed down the experience and skillset, go and explore the market.",

They want their report to be beautiful and nice.\n\nAnd engineers once to achieve only provide things that work all the time.\n\nTo make this happens you obviously do less fluff and do more boring thing but then they never break, they are robust, the are fast and you never have to touch it again it just work.\n\nThe stack is cool but I think what we usually look for in Junior role is someone that will take time to review himself. I know it sounds boring but I’ll rather hire a junior which return me a take home test without spelling errors, with a ok code but that’s structure and well explain than someone with awesome code but that’s all over the place that didn’t have description on topics and that did way more than expected.\n\nIn terms of stack focus on SQL. Not because it’s the best but because it’s the easiest. And because it’s the easiest It’s the most used. I’ll rather use a transformation framework with SQL than pandas for example because I know anyone in the company will be able to use it and so some simple transformation. Even if something it would make more sense to go the other way.\n\nGo read DBT best practices docs. They have a bunch on their site. Read them multiple times. Understanding the structure is th le best thing you can do.\n\nThen python. Maybe learn the request framework and how to dump a response to json or parquet in s3.\n\nThan prefect, Dagster, mage, Luigi are good candidates for orchestration. Learn the basics. I don’t think you’ll find a project which give you enough things that you’ll hit common business issues with them. But having an overview on how you structure your things is already great.\n\nGood luck",

It’s very powerful and flexible, but still has quite a bit of abstraction/simplifications via snowflake and prefect. \n\nWhere are you hosting and executing your prefect code? Is it all on your local machine? If you become a full-time data engineer, it’s definitely not going to be on your computer. You’re going to want at least some basic understanding of how cloud services work, probably UNIX operating systems, and different ways to manage remote devices. A lot of data engineering is infrastructure \n\nIdeally you won’t have to worry about this too much as a junior. but that really depends on where you go.

On the one hand, if you actually manage to create some kind of long-shot digital transformation and data driven success story, that'd be pretty strong for you... OTOH yeah I think the odds of that succeeding are 0.01% given the factors you describe + your own lack of commitment to actually turning things around (you make it sound hopeless, which makes me think you yourself lack the grit to make a successful pivot happen).\n\nIf you want to stick around and try, you'll probably need to suck it up and pay out of pocket for some cloud subscriptions, buy your own Mac laptop, etc. The silver lining thing about a company with bad IT practices is -- you have the freedom to just go rogue, and \"probably\" no one will stop you if you intentionally build out your own shadow IT environment. Go sign up for a free Snowflake account ($400 in free credits), go hook it up with your own GitHub, and load up data from SharePoint by just downloading CSV files to your laptop... Yeah that would be all terrible and not best practices, but in this situation, it gives you autonomy and frees you from being blocked by IT. Then, with your rogue shadow IT environment, go BUILD something useful and amazing and revolutionary... You're trying to foment a rebellion here, but for your vision to win, you have to actually demonstrate something meaningfully different and revolutionary that COULD NOT BE ACHIEVED in their legacy stack -- if all you do is say, \"look guys I put our code into git, see this is better now\", then no one will give a shit because that by itself doesn't matter, doesn't change the business. \n\nBut I don't think you are going to be able to pull it off. So jumping ship seems like it would be better for you, but to be totally honest and blunt, your post gives me a weird vibe of someone trying to \"shortcut\" the career ladder by looking to be opportunistic about what's-best-for-your-brand, instead of someone who's actually sincere about putting in the work, engaging with stakeholders, learning how to dig out of a hole, etc. If you really want to be a director, you're supposed to learn how to overcome adversity, and not just look for the smoothest easiest path to inflate your title as high as you can with as little work or struggle as you can.",

As someone who's navigated this evolving field, I'd suggest focusing on the core skills first: SQL, Python, and a solid understanding of data pipelines. Then, gradually branch out based on your interests and industry trends.\n\nFor beginners in 2025, I'd recommend:\n1. Master SQL and Python\n2. Learn one orchestration tool (Airflow is still relevant)\n3. Understand basic data quality concepts\n4. Get familiar with cloud-based distributed computing (e.g., BigQuery)\n5. Build a simple end-to-end project\n\nThe key is to start small and build incrementally. Don't get overwhelmed by the expanding landscape. I've seen many successful data engineers start with these basics and learn specialized tools on the job.\n\nBTW, if you're interested in the analytics side, I write about career paths in data on my Experimentation Career Blog on Substack. It might give you some ideas on how to approach your learning journey. Remember, the goal is to build a strong foundation and stay curious!",

Moose as an \"ORM\" is one approach (I know of at least one smallish company using it, they seem happy)\n\nWe've done something \"similar\" at Tinybird (similar in the sense that it's a CH abstraction designed to make it easier to integrate into the application), but our approach is more API-centric. Basically make it dead simple to turn a SQL query into an API, and then integration really becomes a question of how you handle your API routes in your backend code and doesn't really require you to \"think\" about the database.\n\nI'm genuinely curious to know how people would compare Moose vs. Tinybird - do people like the ORM approach?

From there, the sky is the limit.

He was an MBA who got dumped on the data team because he was the CFO's buddy who had fucked up one too many times on the finance team.\n\nThings he did while managing the small data team:\n\n1. Set up the initial infrastructure as a single prod database that read directly in from sources. No stage, no transformation layer, just source straight into prod. No backups either, and he thought backups were an extra expense we didn't need.\n2. Stored patient phone numbers and zip codes as numbers, dropping all leading zeroes for about four months' data until he put that into a reporting table and freaked out about why so many rows were wrong.\n3. After fixing the phone number issue, he decided to use phone numbers as a patient table's primary key, \n4. This is my all-time favorite: he put unhashed SSNs in a table that was fed into Tableau, so that all of our practice administrators could see the SSNs of all the patients across all of our practices. *Huge* security issue.\n5. Lied about a dozen times on a questionnaire about security practices for a data sharing deal the company wanted to do with BCBS. We were incredibly lucky that our privacy officer caught that on the way out and corrected things, although she ended up being the one who took the heat when BCBS said \"Oh *hell* no\" to the deal after seeing how sketchy things were.",

We had a few late night surprises there. Integrate.io’s worth a look. Handles PII masking and lets you tweak backoff/retry per connector, throws alerts when throttling hits, and has row-level tracking so you can pinpoint what went wrong. \n\nYou can also look into dlt if you are already deep in the Databricks ecosystem.\n\nAPI reliability and incremental syncs are way tougher than people think especially if your SLA’s under 15 minutes.

That's why here I replace all the deals every time the script is ran, instead of doing incremental loading, because we have only around 200 deals in Hubspot so it takes a couple of seconds.\n\n    url = config.endpoints['deals']\n    \n    @dlt.resource(max_table_nesting=0)\n    def extract_data(url):\n        data = config.make_v3_api_call(url)\n        yield data\n    \n    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(\n        pipeline_name=\"hubspot_deals\",\n        destination=\"postgres\",\n        dataset_name=\"hubspot\"\n    )\n    \n    load_info = pipeline.run(\n        extract_data(url),\n        table_name=\"deals\",\n        write_disposition=\"replace\"\n    )\n    \n    logging.info(load_info)\n\nAnd the API call function if you need it :\n\n    def make_v3_api_call(url):\n        headers = {\n            'authorization': f'Bearer {api_token}'\n        }\n        all_data = []\n        logging.info(\"API call started\")\n        while True:\n            response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n            reponse.raise_for_status()\n            data = response.json()\n            all_data.extend(data['results'])\n            if 'paging' in data and 'next' in data['paging']:\n                url = data['paging']['next']['link']\n            else:\n                logging.info(\"API call finished\")\n                break\n        return all_data",

This works for some businesses but is a huge no go in regulated setups. \n\nWe hacked together a quick Python layer that sits before our ELT tool. Does SHA256 hashing, drops raw fields and dumps into a locked-down staging schema. It’s not perfect but it keeps us compliant without blowing up our whole pipeline.\n\nIf you don't want to maintain that layer long-term then you might want to explore hybrid models. If you don’t wanna deal with maintaining that forever, look into hybrid setups. Something like Kafka + Flink for real-time masking or dbt with staging schemas and tight permissions (still after load but manageable). The whole point is that you need PII masked before the warehouse or you are screwed. Either build this yourself or hunt for a tool that does inline transform.",

SCD2 via dbt also works but adds overhead fast.\n\nAirbyte gives you the control, especially if you're self-hosting, but the PII masking and SCD2 will be on you to build or glue together. That gets messy if you're trying to hit a 15-min SLA with high reliability and source API quirks.\n\nHave you considered using a streaming CDC layer like Debezium or a change-data tool in front of the warehouse, and doing light pre-processing (like hashing) inline before landing to Snowflake? Or using something like Estuary, which can do incremental syncs, apply hashing inline before data hits the destination, and supports low-latency replication with built-in schema drift handling. Bonus is no maintaining connectors or DAGs.\n\nQuick q's: How often do schemas actually change in Salesforce for you? And are the PII fields always in fixed locations or could they appear in custom fields too?\n\nI work at Estuary, so naturally I'm biased, but it's built exactly for this kind of setup where off-the-shelf tools either fall short on compliance or require too much engineering lift. Also, we're adding true source-level masking functionality very soon, it's already being build",

Shallow learning curve, juniors can do senior work with it. Supports parallelism etc, it can scale to faster than the tools you mentioned. Much cheaper than the more expensive tool you mentioned (about 1-2% cost, idk about the other tool)\n\n1. you can [pseudonymise](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/customising-pipelines/pseudonymizing_columns) before loading. you can even load to a local duckdb and then [sync](https://dlthub.com/blog/datasets2) to your final destination after transforming if you prefer to hash in sql.\n2. Here is [SCD2](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/merge-loading#scd2-strategy)\n3. dlt is self maintaining with [schema evolution](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/schema-evolution#alert-schema-changes-to-curate-new-data) and offers you hubspot and salesforce [sources](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/) too. Community loves schema evolution because it takes most of maintenance and hard repetitive work away.\n4. if you don't have a run environment you could use[ github actions](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/deploy-a-pipeline/deploy-with-github-actions) or any runner, we offer deployment helpers.\n5. dlt is a full toolkit for just about any other common requirements you might have, and when it misses something you can just use python to bridge any gap",

I don't think it is as easy to maintain as compared to Fivetran, but then Fivetran probably costs more.\n\nRe: API rate limits (for SFDC): we have never had an issue with this.  However, our account is allocated a very large quota for this.\n\nYou can setup a new Fivetran replication to Snowflake in 15min as long as you have setup the requisite security in SFDC and in Snowflake.\n\nin terms of SLA.  Fivetran offers various plans. We use the 'standard' plan and it provides for a 15min sync time.  Any lower than that you you need the 'enterprise' plan (I think).\n\nFivetran will not directly help with building SCD Type 2.  However, you can do a couple things here:  1) you can have it run in history mode, in which case it will not update in place rows that have changed. It will create new versioned rows as needed.  2) you can let Fivetran update rows in place but then use Snowflake STREAMS to detect the changes and then use that to drive any sort of SCD Type 2 dimensional needs (with whatever etl tool you have).\n\nFivetran also supports Schema Drift (for SFDC and other connectors).  You can control it so that FT will add new columns but not new tables (unless you want that).  It also handles cases where column datatypes change (although that can still break downstream etl).\n\n  \nFivetran or Airbyte the best pick for this? \n\n\\>>> I see no reason why Fivetran would not work for your needs but you need the budget.  For SFDC replication, budget for $800 USD per month (depending on what objects you need). Hubspot maybe less per month.\n\n* Have you dealt with PII masking before landing data in a warehouse? How did you handle it?  Fivetran handles this OOTB.\n* Any experience building or managing SCD Type 2? Not really a function of Fivetran or Airbyte \n* If you have pulled data from Salesforce or HubSpot, were there any surprises around rate limits or schema changes? We have had no major issues with Fivetran replication of SFDC.  However, as mentioned it will not do formula fields.",

So if you have data whose cardinality you don’t control, this will always be a risk.

Works surprisingly well since we sat it on top of a pretty clean denormalized data warehouse. New queries that work well are given a thumbs up on the UI and get marked for review before adding to the FAQ. It’s not generating reports on top of the SQL, but it’s giving some basic analysis to get the user started. Automated report building probably comes next. These tools seriously need handholding from architectural guard rails, but the potential is there.",

This works good enough when users understand that they can ask only things that are relevant to the concrete dataset. Some users trying to ask questions that only, maybe, deus ex machina can answer ever. In general, this function is good for non-experienced users and helps them to build their first reports. For advanced report options it seems a classic UI (report builder) is still more useful and less painful that typing prompts.\n\n- Report-specific prompts: when prompt's context is a report data itself (tabular data) and users can ask their own questions to this concrete report. Typical prompts like \"discover insights\" or \"find anomalies\" are available via menu items so this is just a one click and doesn't require any efforts from end users. These predefined prompts may be specific to the concrete dataset or usage of concrete dimensions/measures - for instance, when report uses \"Sales\" values and \"Year\" dimension, admin-configured prompt may compare values according to company's specific analysis. This function helps users with interpreting reports, especially if they are large tables.",

This isn't always possible, but I run into a ton of teams that think that as long as a job is batch performance doesn't matter.  They're not thinking about cost, usability benefits of lower latency, or deployment/fix implications of their slow batch jobs.\n   * Missing bells & whistles: simple logging & alerting is fairly easy to address, monitoring can be more, but also driven off logging, etc, etc.\n\nSo, if I ran into a team that wanted to show results fast, this is what they knew, and wanted to defer for a bit trying to figure out best way to run jobs, I wouldn't be too concerned about this approach.",

For some of the smaller-scale ELT pipelines in our data platform, the final tables are exported to GCS in Parquet format.\n\nIt’s extremely convenient for downstream analytics; DuckDB can attach directly to the Parquet files, has solid support for partitioned tables, and lets you skip the whole \"import into a db\" step. It also makes reusing the datasets for ML much easier than going through db queries, especially with local prototyping, etc.\n\nDuckDB on top of these modern table formats is a really powerful, especially for analytics workflows. I’m always weighing querying BQ directly (from where our data is exported) vs. just reading an exported, e.g., Parquet file. In the end, the final tables already contain all the necessary transformations, so I don’t need the crazy compute capabilities of BQ at that point. The native caching is nice though.",

Technically data engineer is in the job title, and it would probably be the best title of the options except for maybe Machine Learning Engineer - but that seems like a lesser requirement. \n\nCould be a good role to build out a tech stack, but not great for really specializing. I'd treat this as a decent entry level role, if not underpaid and underappreciated. Eventually you'll need to find a specialty to really advance in your career.",

So, there's always a small (nonzero) risk of losing data if the system instantly crashes. Postgres doesn't really have this problem, because it doesn't complete the transaction until the data is safely on disk.\n\nBecause Mongo just appends to a file, you may have to deal with compaction, which is when old entries get garbage collected (more or less). This isn't a problem if you're always creating new entries, but if you update or delete entries often, compaction can take time.\n\nPostgres also has compaction, but it's called vacuum and is done differently.\n\nIt's supposed to be easier to use partitions/sharding in Mongo. You can distribute your data across multiple clusters.\n\nYou can partition data in postgres, and that data can be queried in parallel, but I'm not sure if you can actually split partitions across clusters.",

Always remember to not bring in any PI data and leave it at source if not needed. It avoids whole lot of hassle and pains later. \n\nPI data has to have lots of checks in place from the model level and during DML. I'd create a word document and submit to cyber team on what AD groups, what roles, which tables access to be given to who and fields that needs to be encrypted. Document like that can be used for tracking. RBAC or column level access can be controlled and automated after identifying PI data. \n\nWe have model versions in Erwin for back tracking, use GitHub PR for approvals. After our PR is approved then we merge feature branch into main branch and merge our modeling Erwin model mart. This ensures both GitHub and Erwin models are in sync. ",

But it also generates 'run\\_results.json' for each of the models separately in temporary directory. Now we can always use callback to move it to any place we would like, but then we have run\\_results.json for each of the models.\n\n  \nDo i simply have one last step to merge all of the run\\_results.json files or there is an alternative strategy?",

It should bring back chunks semantically related to health checks. From the metadata of these chunks, you can get what tools are bound to be useful for this task. Notice I didn't mention the LLM yet, we'll circle back to it later.\n\nOk, so you have a few chunks from man pages and pointers to various tools. Passing all the man pages may be too much, so, what to do? One option is pre-generating one summary per tool, including things like required arguments, and sending it along with the chunks you found. That's a middle term between option A and B.\n\nNow going back to the LLM call in step one. Why do you need that? You need it to generate good questions, not good answers. The vector store will bring you the answers, but if you only send the last line the user types, it can be something like \"What flags can I use to format the output?\" It's lacking content. The LLM is there to read this, along with all the conversation, and turn it into something like, \"What tool do I use to run health checks, and what flags can I use to format its output?\" That has a much higher chance to bring the chunks you need. It doesn't need to know your tools, only how to formulate a good question to surface those chunks from the vector DB.",

I’ve lived the nightmare with MariaDB on a payments system. No matter how much you tune it, it just drags. Sql Server and others handle cdc great. No matter what you do, you must not affect source systems.\n\nI try to keep it simple:\n• API when available.\n• If you must hit a critical DB, use a read replica.\n• Be aware of replica lag and don’t rely on it for anything that needs read-after-write.\n\nIf you’re lucky enough to be on RDS or similar, spinning up a read replica is dead simple. It costs a little more, but it saves you from nightmare scenarios, and your DBAs will actually like you better.",

Populate this schema once a day using stored procedures from your transactional tables. You can put all the complicated joins and stuff in these stored procedures.

Direct being key. That should answer your question regarding Google.\n\nIf your job is specifically within the software for a sales team I would argue you as revenue. They couldn’t do their sales jobs as good without you \n\n2 is a hard distinction, almost all cost centers support the revenue business in some way as all companies exist to make money. You wouldn’t have them in the first place if they contributed nothing. I think the way to look at is do you fully support the revenue cycle or do you support everyone. IT desk support can have higher overall job security even being a cost center because a business cannot afford to fire all of them \n\n3, it depends on how much of your time is spent on the chargeable service. Sometimes you can think of it this way. If the business fires your whole team would there be a way they could continue to survive without you be it outsourcing, praying, etc. that question may cause more questions because certain sales guys could be fired in that context. And guess what, sales guys do get fired in hard times, but the top/critical sales guys usually are not. Once a company intentionally negatively impacts revenue they enter a tailspin and they have a finite amount of time to correct\n\n5 I can answer this directly. Yes.

Same thing with your salary, or an AWS bill, they need to go to a cost center.\n\nFinance people/executives understand that you literally can’t run a company without cost centers. Even if you were a one person remote consulting firm you’d have your salary cost.

It’s more that if given the choice it’s (usually) safer to work in a profit center. I’d argue that working in a profit center comes with its own problems though.",

A data engineering profit center should be churning out valuable data pipelines, minimizing time to market, working closely with stakeholders, etc. \n\nOr you can have the worst of both worlds where you have the expectations of a profit center (build things fast, enable the business, etc) but then get treated as a cost center when budget allocations come around. \n\nProfit centers are more fun to work for, but they are also going to be more demanding. Cost centers are usually stable employment, but with outsourcing, it is much less so.",

Profit = income - cost. You can break costs down to things like operating expenses and taxes if you feel fancy. \n\nIf the business unit you work in brings in more money than it costs, you are a profit centre. There are no second order effects. When the business wants to lay people off to improve the numbers for a quarter, those business units will be amongst the last people they lay off. \n\nIf your business unit has a red number next to it in the monthly P&L meeting, that will be the first thing to go unless it’s deemed essential. You’re absolutely right that the real picture is far more nuanced, and many essential teams are cost centres- accounts, IT, facilities, and usually. the executives themselves. If your work has no price tag, it has no value in MBA math. \n\nTo reiterate, essential things are still costs. Buildings, utilities, salaries, so on. But the business will generally look to keep costs low.to use your example, the IT department is like rent- it’s an unavoidable necessity. \n\nThe trick as a cost center is to make sure your work gets properly credited to you, often through internal billing, sometimes via other KPIs and metrics. And there is still very much the risk that the ‘true’ profit centres complain that you’re a cost to *them*, bringing their numbers down come bonus time.",

In fact, many do.\n\nProfit centers are used to categorize the products or services that a company sells. By using profit centers, when examining a business you could say one division is more profitable than another division, etc.\n\nYou might try to say oh well Jeff is responsible for increasing profit through his role, but that’s an indirect thing. Jeff has to be paid a salary and the accounting line for that gets assigned to a cost center. Jeff probably isn’t a product, though I guess you can stretch this to say it’s possible when talking about a person who is a model, or stripper, or something like that haha. Then they are what’s being sold. But so long as Jeff is something like a sales manager a logistics director, he’s not the product. It’s not that he doesn’t matter, but on the books, he doesn’t get to directly be tagged like a product. Now, his work is more directly involved in transactions that do get tagged with profit centers, though, than someone who is, say, in human resources. \n\nTransactions for inventory changes of physical consumer goods often end up getting tagged to both a profit center and a cost center. The profit center is just related to what the good is. But the cost center is usually location based. Factory A and Factory B are different cost centers. This becomes important because other costs are posted to each factory and can differ, like labor costs and electricity and rent. So when doing financial analysis we can say that one product, while worth the same end sale price, might cost differently when produced in different factories.",

        "body": "Sorry, contract with employer doesn't allow me to, and she sql produced is snowflake-specific (uses as-of joins)  \n  \nI can describe the steps of the algo, though.  \n  \nyou start with a collection of events. To make examples simpler we will assume you only have one entity that produces the events, and all rows (events) represent states of that one entity.  \n  \nIf the terminology is confusing, just think that event can be pressing a lever to open a door, and the door being open or cloded is a state.  \n  \nlet's say event a (little a) causes state A (big a) to begin. If the entity (e.g. door) already was in state A, then it continues to be in that state.  \nEvent b causes state B, etc.  \n  \nFor further simplification, we will count time in integer numbers 1,2,5,...,8,12,... . In reality time is usually a date, or timestamp, but anything that is orderable can be used here.  \n  \nSo assuming our times and events look like this:  \n\\`\\`\\`  \n1, a  \n3, a  \n4, b  \n5, b  \n7, a  \n9, c  \n\\`\\`\\`  \nWe have contiguous repetitions of events a and b, and we have non-contiguous repetition of a (at time 7)  \n  \nWhat we want to get is a table representing the states and their durations  \nstate, start-time, end-time  \n\\`\\`\\`  \nA, 1, 4  \nB, 4, 7  \nA, 7, 9  \nC, 9, Null  \n\\`\\`\\`  \nWe kept the non-contiguous repetitions, but ignored the contiguous ones.\n\nThis is close to our real end-result, so how can we get from there to here?\n\nFirst find all consecutive pairs. More formally - pair each row with the row that has smallest time which is still bigger than this row's time. This can be done with a self-join (or two), join + window functions or as-of join.\n\nGet rid of all result rows, where the event is the same, we only want transitions.\n\nWe'll call this data set Transitions. \n\n\\`\\`\\`  \n3, a, 4, b  \n5, b, 7, a  \n7, a, 9, c  \n\\`\\`\\`\n\nFrom transitions we can take the earlier time + event in a separate CTE - these will be our state endings.\n\nYes, endings, even though we thought of them as the earlier ones. Since we listed state transitions - then it follows that the last event representing some state will happen BEFORE the first event in the next state.\n\nAlso, from transitions, we take the later time + event and call them Beginnings, due to the same reasoning.\n\nEagle eyed reader will have noticed that we are missing the first event of the first state. We should add that to Beginnings (e.g. with a union all)\n\nNow that we have beginning and endings of each state we join each beginning with the next consecutive ending (again, smallest time, that is larger / later than that if a particular beginning)\n\nthe time of beginning is the island start time, time of ending is the island end time. the state, that corresponds to the beginning event is the state of the island.\n\nOf course that was a simplified example. In reality, the state is an ensemble of various fields, but these can be hashed into one, or compared one to one.\n\nUsually we also deal with more than one entity (think many doors and their corresponding levers), but to accommodate that, you just group your CTEs by the columns that constitute the entity identifier.",

ClickHouse community is strong and growing. The number of contributors and commits to ClickHouse has grown so much over the last 5-10 years. Just look at the contrib chart: [https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/graphs/contributors)  \n  \nPinot not so much: [https://github.com/apache/pinot/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/apache/pinot/graphs/contributors)  \n  \nIf your main concern is maintenance and operational overhead, to me this is the most important thing. I think the ClickHouse community takes the cake.\n\nPersonally I also think that CH is just easier to reason about. The SQL is mostly standard with some CH-specific stuff, but if you know SQL you can be productive quickly. For logs specifically, it handles high-volume ingestion really well and the compression is excellent.\n\nI don't have as much hands-on experience with Pinot, but from what I understand it can be more complex operationally - more moving pieces to manage. The trade-off is that it's designed more specifically for certain real-time analytics workloads.\n\nSince you mentioned you're starting with logs and might move to business metrics later, CH might be the safer bet. It's proven at massive scale (we have customers running trillions of rows) and the operational complexity is manageable. Plus if you're planning to eventually query business metrics alongside logs, having everything in one system can simplify things.\n\nWhat kind of log volumes are you looking at? And do you need real-time ingestion or is near real-time ok?\n\nBtw, maybe you'll find this template interesting or useful as a starting point -> [https://www.tinybird.co/templates/logs-explorer-template](https://www.tinybird.co/templates/logs-explorer-template) (if you're worried about operational overhead, maybe Tinybird could be a landing place for you... lmk if you have questions about it.",

For hands-on learning, practice with real scenarios on platforms like LeetCode's database problems, study case studies from companies like Netflix and Uber about their data architecture decisions, and get familiar with both OLTP and OLAP system design patterns. The key is understanding not just how these systems work, but when and why you'd choose one approach over another.\n\nThe reality is that interviewers will throw curveball questions about specific trade-offs between consistency and availability, or ask you to design a system that handles both real-time and batch processing. They want to see you think through problems like choosing between row-based and columnar storage, or explaining why you'd use a particular indexing strategy for a given query pattern. These conversations can get technical fast, and having real examples from your experience combined with solid theoretical knowledge makes all the difference. I'm on the team that built [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat) because these database design questions can make or break data engineering interviews - having a tool to help you navigate the technical depth and articulate your reasoning clearly can be a game changer when you're in the hot seat.",

I personally reviewed a few Synapse specific PRs this week, actually :D. \nAnd it's still Generally Available with no deprecation date set. \n\nAnd I wholeheartedly would agree new development should go to Fabric instead.\n\nI also think most customers of Synapse would benefit from migrating to Fabric when they feel ready to do so; it has many major improvements, both to performance and to the architecture. One of the big ones is that Fabric Warehouse uses Parquet as it's on disk format accessible in OneLake - no more \"best performance or least duplication\" tradeoff.\n\nWhy wouldn't I blame Fabric for Synapse not seeing much feature development?\n\nWell, designs of Synapse Dedicated and Synapse Serverless respectively had limitations that weren't practical to address without a major rearchitecting under the hood. \n\nSynapse Dedicated, for example, is the result of over a decade of incremental improvements that did not change its fundamental architecture (APS/PDW was released in 2012); we basically took it as far as it could go. \n\nSo we had to do some fairly major rearchitecting to make something fundamentally better than that; the result is Fabric. \nCould we have called it Synapse v2 or something? Maybe. But it still would have been a migration to move to it, so I'm not sure that would have been any better. And marketing isn't my area :D. \n\nIf you have questions on migrating to Fabric, or on Synapse, you can find me and many other folks who work on both Fabric and Synapse in r/MicrosoftFabric or lurking here.\nOr just tag me or message me, though there's no Service Level Agreement for my response times on Reddit :P",

Works pretty well in terms of writing SQL, but in practice you have to tweak the hell out of it to get it to consistently write the correct logic based on the data concepts.  In production it's even scarier as companies often refer to business concepts with different descriptions (hell, I don't even understand the ask sometimes because their description is so bad).  Then the feedback they get is often the SQL itself, which is gibberish to most people so they can't validate that the LLM got it right.

Vanna AI approach is solid for this. Also worth checking out tools like Waii or Text2SQL.ai that specialize in this problem.\n\nThe real issue is that business users describe things completely differently than how the data is actually structured. Like they'll ask for \"revenue\" but your table has \"net_sales_amount\" or whatever. You almost need a translation layer between business language and actual schema.\n\nHave you tried fine tuning a model on your specific schema with lots of query examples?

Not sure about Athena and the like, but databases like Snowflake support column level security through things like projection policies, which hide columns which users should not have access to entirely. As far as stacking DBT on top of this, although I haven't tested it, you can probably write queries similar to this:\n\n```sql\nselect\n    colA,\n    colB,\n    colC,\n    * exclude (colA, colB, colC)  -- Include additional columns if you have access to those columns.\nfrom\n    {{ ref('my_model') }}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can dynamically query what columns are available using DBT's `adapter.get_columns_in_relation`:\n\n```sql\n{% set columns = adapter.get_columns_in_relation(ref('my_model')) -%}\n\nselect\n    colA,\n    colB,\n    colC,\n    {% for column in columns -%}\n    {{ column.name }} {{- ',' if not loop.last }}\n    {% endif -%}\nfrom\n    {{ ref('my_model') }}\n```",

Similar concerns exist for change management: if your analysis depends on the internal workings of that database, they will very easily introduce breaking changes. \n\nThe API serves as a contract to stabilise the interface in both scenarios. If you want an odbc connection, the operational system should at least provide you with the views that form the contract so their changes won't break your system.\n\nMCP would just layer on top of the view or the API.

But the main thing I think is that in many careers including tech, these LLMs have no judgment, it's all just guesswork. Humans actually have judgment, they can be put in charge of things and knowingly take calculated risks, I don't believe LLMs have any real concept of this, when you ask them questions regarding more soft skill type stuff instead of strictly technical, they just BS you and basically answer the question however they think you wanted them to answer it, or they give a non-commital answer, etc. They can't really be trusted for anything serious and I think that will remain a huge gap for decades at least.",

Those of us who've been around a while have likely seen and held all of those titles and done the same, and differing, day to day work. Different orgs refer to people and roles slightly differently, absent protections for certain professional titles (e.g. Engineer).\n\nIf you want to say that it takes a programmer (or coder, or software engineer, or developer...) to be able to evaluate the output of LLMs in a particular context in order for LLMs to be useful for building complex software, just say that. There's no need to start splitting hairs over terminology.

It might be interesting to use for reviewing code, but I really don't understand the mindset of those who think it's anywhere near able to replace anyone in this industry.\n\nPeople are turning to AI to solve problems that can and should be solved by actual deterministic, properly thought, and battle-tested frameworks instead, and I think this is wrong in many ways, because at the end of the day it's not deterministic so the same prompt is totally unlikely to generate the same code twice, unless you run the model locally and always provide it with the same seed and prompt sequence, but most people don't even do that. Not only that but as of now AI doesn't even come close to a proficient programmer at any meaningful task as the AI generated code that I've read so far suffered from being extremely verbose, lacking proper structure, and containing lots of useless comments, which considering that we have already been suffering from a huge code quality problem due to businesses making it normal to focus on developer experience instead of user experience for decades, means nothing good for this industry.\n\nPeople using AI to take on tasks that they are not versed in are also hurting themselves, not only by letting it produce potentially crap code whose correctness they can't really verify, but because by letting the AI do it, they are also missing out on potentially insightful learning opportunities. AI might be able to generate lots of code very fast, giving people the impression that they are actually saving time, while in reality the brittle nature of that code couple with nobody really having a deep understanding of the train of thought behind it means that technical debt is accumulating very quickly, leading to whole projects having to be scrapped and rewritten from scratch once the codebase becomes unmanageable.\n\nWe might also already be witnessing the dawn of a new job title that I would call AI janitor, where some companies vibe code their way to success, the resulting mess becomes totally unmanageable, and they end up having to hire humans to rewrite everything from scratch. I am actually positioning myself to take on this role at some point in the future, by continuing to learn, keeping my brain sharp, and also taking advantage of AI to learn about AI itself and the use cases where it has already largely surpassed human intelligence and can actually be helpful, because honestly when it comes to this technology, I don't think this is the time to relegate myself to the passenger's seat when I can instead take it up to the next level by becoming a pilot.\n\nAt present, companies are collectively spending 10 times more on AI than they're making back, and that's not to mention our consumption of natural resources, so while it's generating revenue, it requires an insane and totally unsustainable amount of investment to do it. The hope is to eventually come up with a way to build an AGI, but since nobody can really predict the consequences of that, I don't think it's realistic to plan with that scenario in mind, especially when other scenarios like model collapse due to the phenomenon where AI slop in training data makes models significantly more likely to hallucinate are a lot more realistic, so I think it's safe to say that we're collecting betting our future on finding a pegasus unicorn.\n\nLastly, there's also the fact that, at present, AI still lacks human curiosity and drive to try new things, so if most people decide to rely on it, once the investment tap is shut, no new innovation will actually be achieved, including on AI itself, since no new problem-solving paradigms will be attempted as AI is only really able to shuffle combinations of the same old strategies. Therefore in the end AI might replace many jobs in this industry not because it became smarter than us but because we collectively decided to get dumber, and while I don't personally mind this scenario from an economical perspective, because I am positioning myself to not only survive the devastation resulting from the explosion of this hype bubble completely unscathed, but to also thrive by providing a helping hand in the aftermath, I am still concerned about the permanent damage we're doing to the natural resources on our planet which we're still totally dependent on for survival.",

There's still room for mathematicians, writers, researchers, mechanics and map creators, and of course software engineers.\n\nFor people who want to create software, either for money or passion, of course they should learn in-depth knowledge about how software works. But I think it is important for people to realize that the landscape of software development is just as large as any of the other fields I mentioned. Merely understanding code compares to software development as changing a tire compares to being a mechanic, or how being able to calculate compares to being a mathematician. Or even between being able to read (and post on reddit) versus writing a series of fiction books. Creating a fictional world requires a huge amount of skill beyond knowing what the words mean.\n\nFor the last couple of years before AI, there was such a huge demand for software developers that job positions were constantly filled with people who had basically just learned how to read code (and write a simple program at best). Which happened because digital literacy is so low and the demand for programmers was so high. That's good for those people, but I don't think it could have been a stable dynamic into the future.  \nNow that decent coding AIs are available, people simply don't know what the future will look like. The AI doesn't neatly fit in the corporate structures that have been built about working with a massive number of junior developers, so the industry will change. It is hard to know what skills will be desired for software development 5 years from now, so my suggestion is to maybe not chase the money right now, but definitely chase the passion.\n\nBut again, \"learning to code\" itself, I would say that everyone should do that, just to understand the very basics of the dozens of computer chips around you every day. (Even the notion that a person today interacts with up to a 100 different programmable computer chips every day is probably weird to many people. If you include internet servers in the mix, the number shoots up to thousands.) The world is still getting more automated every day, and digital illiteracy will eventually became as limiting as normal illiteracy is today.",

I routinely get a laugh out of the “I’m `round(random.normalvariate(27, 2))` years old. Is that too old to learn Python?” questions. Just go for it!\n\nOn AI, I’ve seen a lot of tech hype over the years, but it seems like the right answer is to try what’s new. LLMs are interesting. Writing serious prose, I dislike pretty much everything I get out of them. But, by having something to react to, I more quickly clarify my own logic and get more done. Code completions are often not great when changing tasks, but they’re often good at making coordinating edits to match the one I just made. Generating longer code ranges from not all that useful (particularly specialized uses or where I have a clear idea of what I want) to massively productive (using a new to me package or things with a lot of boilerplate/structure like dashboards/web frameworks). It’s nuanced and not always predictable, so you experiment and build intuition. \n\nProgramming is great outside of work, too. I wrote a Python program to help us name our first child and made it (minimally) web-based to help us name our second. My five year old wanted to learn some Python (she saw it in VS Code while we were working on a short book we had an LLM write with her input), so I sat her in front of a terminal interpreter and had her type simple expressions like math and using string methods. The artwork on our walls is all on the same centerline, because I wrote a function to translate picture frame dimensions and the center of the stretched picture wire to a wall location for the hanging hook. I cant count the number of times I’ve whipped up a personal project that analyzes some data or written some abomination of a regex that reformats something mangled into a structured form.\n\nOne of the amazing things about programming is that failure is frequent and relatively costless. Imagine if you messed up a cooking recipe and could simply edit and reprocess it with no ingredient loss and millisecond cooking time as many times as needed. That’s why diving in is the right approach. You’ll answer your “should I” question quickly, and you may love it. The many small wins are really gratifying.",

People look out for you and you can sometimes get a small job squeaked through even though everything is booked.\n\nBut you have to remember that everything goes both ways.

Well with AI, the coding aspect is kind of ruined in my opinion, like being a good coder gives you very little edge, and on the job the coding will become more and more prompt engineering stuff which is just whatever, and the job will reduce down to just the other aspects.",

I'd say for the first few years I was like you and didn't like it and tried to avoid, but finally I got over some hurdle and things clicked and now I love it.\n\nI think it can be daunting when you're first trying to learn it because it's different from normal coding and everything feels like some kind of black magic, and it's not really clear what anything is. But once you actually get what problem SQL is trying to solve, how to databases generally work, and what are the general things you do with SQL like joins, aggregations, etc. then it becomes much more intuitive.\n\nI highly recommend looking at [https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2025/](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2025/) \\- it goes way more in depth than what any beginner needs but even if you do just the very first lecture and homework that already makes you more competent than most",

It takes a certain analytical mind to enjoy coding, but it also takes a creative mind. You have to enjoy making things and solving problems.\n2. Naturally, at first you're going to suck at it. This applies to anything new. When I just started, I was terrible. I once \"randomized\" an array by generating random numbers and putting them in each slot, waiting longer and longer for the correct unused number as the array filled up. You need to push through this learning curve - there's no way around it. It took me about 6 years to become even moderately decent.\n3. You mentioned switching from one language to another. Here's the thing about programming: it's way more about understanding the concepts than memorizing the specific language syntax. If you understand how variables work, how if-else statements function, how loops operate, etc., you're already 80% of the way there with any language. The remaining 20% is just syntax differences you can easily look up when needed.",

At the time I was working on it, VB6 was already ancient. ClearCase is what big companies used before git.)\n\nTo tie all this random crap together, I wrote a Ruby script that applied labels, downloaded snapshots of the code, then either pushed the code to a Linux box to be built there, or built it locally on the server. It was an insane, janky, Rube Goldberg setup. And to drive it all, I wrote a DSL in Ruby to tell it what I wanted it to build. \n\nAs horrible as the whole thing was in retrospect, the DSL was incredibly easy to understand. Nobody working on the project would have any difficulty understanding what it did, even if they didn’t know precisely how it was doing it. I could have made that whole thing just take a JSON file, but it would probably have been just a little more confusing for users. \n\nAlso, at the time, JSON was only three years old.

The port is dictating that you can plug any usb cable/device into it and \"something\" happens, at a minimum the device could probably charge. Well the port remains fixed, but the device you plug in could change, it could be a phone, a watch, a controller, a keyboard, etc. Or another analogy is a car, you could probably swap out the engine or the muffler or something, Idk I'm not an expert, but basically you still have a car, it still is this big carriage that can transport itself.\n\nIn your OOP program, you could for example have an object which is a component that can be responsible for interacting with a database, for example. Let's call it the DBManager. Now, normally your app logic would say \"hey, DBManager, get me the account info for user x\" or something. So that would work as expected, but now you could also for instance write a unit test that says \"ok the app will handle a request, and it will go to the DBManager, but instead we're gonna plug in a fake DBManager which just serves up some canned response, it doesn't have to query a real database\". We just swap out the components in the test only, without having to hack up all the code, and we are able to test our app logic without dealing with the database specifically.\n\nThis, to me, is the essence of the types of problems OOP is aiming to solve. I glossed over some details for sure, but this idea helped it click for me when I was earlier on in my journey.",

It can be applied wherever you might want to do that. \n\nFor example, in the context of back end web dev you've used Express to specify a chain of handlers/behaviour that each request will pass through at runtime (using .use(), .get(), .post() for config etc.). One way you could build this (I haven't looked at the Express implementation) is using OOP and the Builder pattern. You could store the chain of behaviour as state on an object, e.g. an array of objects containing callback functions and metadata or similar, and use Builder to repeatedly add to that state at runtime. The mutations happen through those methods mentioned above. Once all the top-level calls have finished, Express has an object that can be given a request to process, and some code associated with the object can dispatch the correct series of calls based on conditional logic over the received request.\n\nIt contrasts with viewing code and data separately like in other paradigms. Ultimately it's just a way to organise data and code in a program.\n\nMaybe looking at the GoF design patterns will give you ideas about how OOP is applied to problems commonly faced building software.

This is a 3-case lex, 3-function recursive descent parse, then single-function tree walk situation, if you want a proper solution. I'd expect the first solution to be some awkward/inflexible string splitting which broke the second the input changed slightly. If I had more than 30 mins I'd ask how it could be made more robust, at which point I'd expect a suggestion like mine above. I probably wouldn't make them code it up though. Just knowing tells me what I need to know about them for the purpose of the interview.  If I had to suggest the improvement, I might see if they could work with me to code it up by asking good questions etc, almost pair programming style.\n\nMy advice in these is always to use the interviewer as a resource as much as possible. Lots of people go very quiet and try to mentally brute force, then fail, when they could have asked for more help from me. I don't know what they need help with specifically without them asking. On the job, it's fine to ask colleagues things, so it's generally not frowned upon in interview either, as long as you're not asking for the full solution etc.",

It's only easy from the human perspective. It doesn't take you more than a minute to do that calculation, but you process the string in whatever order you want.

Because it's infix, it's quite a challenge to do it accurately. As you yourself said, it took half an hour even after you Googled for the C functions you needed.\n\nI suppose the tip is to know you C string functions. \n\nThere is a bunch of ways to solve it. If you could create a second array, you could have replaced +/- with spaces, and then split on that. Then pull out the integers into an array, then process the +/- from the array.\n\nI don't think this is an easy programming problem at all.\n\nAnother person suggested creating a binary tree.

Create tight feedback loops. Run your code often.\n2. When experimenting or debugging, create hypothesis and then systematically test them\n3. Write more documentation, learn to tell the difference between good documentation and bad documentation.\n\nTo create tight feedback loops, you need to have a very short time between when you've written a bit of code, and find out if it's working or not. There are a lot of good strategies for this, and you can mix and match them according to your needs. A few I like are: Static types, tell you a lot of information about your program's correctness at compile time. REPL driven development, run snippets of code in a REPL to get immediate feedback on whether they're working as you're developing more complex systems. Good testing practices, writing tests as you work let you run the test suite as a very good way to get fast feedback on your code. When coding, I start to get nervous if I've gone more than a few minutes without running some of the code I'm writing.\n\nFor creating hypothesis, I see way too many new developers just randomly change things whenever they get stuck. If you can't clearly communicate why you think the change will fix a problem, or what the expected result of a change is, that's a sign you need to take a step back and do some thinking / learning. It takes discipline, but forming explicit hypotheses and then testing them drives you to actually understand the how and why of your code.\n\nWriting good documentation doesn't mean just adding comments to your code, but thinking about how other users of your functions / classes / projects will use them, and giving them all the necessary information to be successful. This means beginner guides, project overviews, as well as function / class level documentation. Writing good docs makes you really think about your API design and software usability on a new level.",

Respect the the house coding style (very important on so many levels), resist the urge to \"be clever\" even if it causes pain! LOL. Save the clever stuff for your own stuff.

        "body": "I used to teach at a real-life bootcamp and we also did 3 back end languages: Ruby (later switched to Python), Java and Node. \n\nThe point was indeed to maximise exposure to different languages without expecting students to become experts in any of them. We wanted them to come away with “programming mindsets” where they could solve a given junior-level problem with loops, conditionals and functions, and an awareness that different languages have different “quirks” in the syntax for these concepts. \n\nFor example, all these languages have for loops, but Python has list comprehensions, JavaScript has array methods that take in callback functions, Java has implementations of the List interface…\n\nGoing further into back end dev, Ruby on Rails defines endpoints as methods on a Controller class, inheriting from the framework’s built-in ActiveController. Java Spring Boot does a similar thing but with decorators, favouring composition over inheritance. Node Express doesn’t have Controller classes/prototypes, instead endpoints are just function properties assigned to an instance of an App object with callbacks to define their behaviour. They all have the concept of endpoints, they all have HTTP verbs and request/response objects, they all push you more or less to an MVC architecture, but very different implementations. Knowing the concept is way more important than knowing only one implementation.\n\nWhen you move to a language you don’t know - say Rust - and you try and implement an endpoint as a Node Express style async function, you’re gonna have a bad time. But if you google “rust post request endpoint” you’ll get example code for the Actix Web framework.\n\nKnowing the concepts are way more important than learning the syntax.",

You'll have to learn about databases, SQL and how to make an API, but that's fairly trivial.\n\nFor example, learn about the [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) package and read [Best practices for RESTful web API design](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design) and boom, back-end achieved. Next step is about actually saving that data.\n\nTo save data, you need a database and you'll need to talk to it through a Structured Query Language called SQL. You can learn SQL [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/), but then the database stuff gets a bit complicated. You can install MariaDB locally and learn on that, then in the future you'll want to learn about Docker Compose to avoid having to install the DB locally during development and you'll probably want to use PostgreSQL, but right now it doesn't matter. Just go with SQL/MariaDB and learn the concepts.\n\nOnce you've got a database, your Node.js app will need to somehow connect to the database you just installed. For MariaDB, there's a [package](https://mariadb.com/docs/connectors/mariadb-connector-nodejs/getting-started-with-the-node-js-connector) for that.\n\nBoom, back-end with API and data storage achieved, without tutorial, all by yourself. It's the same steps for any programming language.\n\nAdmittedly, that route is what a tutorial would give you, but anyway. Concepts are what's valuable at the moment. Or if you feel like you'd have more fun in Go than TypeScript, then just go for it, it'll be roughly the same thing.",

You can’t contribute meaningfully to something you have never used.\n\nAfter using it for a bit, start looking through the codebase. Get a feel for the main language and all the supporting technologies (frameworks, libraries, build system, etc). If you’re new expect this to take a few weeks. \n\nThen download the project and try to get it running locally. Make a tiny change (change a text) and see if you can get it to show up.\n\nThen try setting a debug point. \n\nNow go and trace a specific feature and see how it works.\n\nIf you want a cheat sheet look at recent PRs that got merged and see what changes were required. \n\nLastly pick a smaller project rather than a huge one.

But, once that is done, ask the AI to explain the concepts that dont make sense. Then go through old PRs to make sense of what work has been done before you came along and tried to contribute, and when that is all over, just take on a ticket and start working through it. Each step sounds awful, because it lowkey is, that is the pain of dev onboarding. You also will need to be patient with yourself in the beginning as you try to figure out where to even make code changes given an issue to resolve and how to actually resolve it properly without over engineering.\n\nGood luck, though, working on intense projects helped me get a job at amazon, so hopefully it helps you out with ur financial goals too.",

Create your own small project and structure it the same way. Add basic tests, use basic GitHub actions, create a CONTRIBUTING.md. Then create an issue, assign it to yourself. Complete the issue and submit a PR like it's someone else's project. \n\n\n3. Review your own PR like you're a maintainer and approve it when it looks good. At this point you at least understand the process of contributing to open source, now it's about finding issues you can actually handle.\n\n\n4. Find a small project that has some good first issue tags. Usually this is someone just trying to do what I outlined above for themself. The codebase and issue should be simple. Work on getting assigned some easy issues and getting your PRs merged. \n\n\n5.

In these contexts, projects and open-source contributions can help, but HR filters simply will block applications without formal education.\n\nIn contrast, startups, scale-ups and smaller companies often prioritize skills, portfolio projects and interview performance over formal credentials.\nMany US tech companies (see Google, IBM, Apple) do have officially dropped strict degree requirements, though competition means degrees still give an advantage. Also countries with high demand for developers will sometimes hire based on bootcamp training or self-taught experience.\n\nIf you look globally, there’s a shift toward skills-based hiring in tech. Portfolios, GitHub contributions and competitive programming results (from LeetCode, HackerRank) can open doors. Networking and referrals indeed do often bypass degree filters.\n\nWithout a degree, you will need a strong portfolio, relevant certifications, and networking to compete. In markets with “degree fever” (as one commenter called it), getting past automated HR filters is harder. In more flexible markets, you can get hired without a degree, with proof of skills and good interview performance.\n\nBut even with a degree and relevant certifications, you will still have to prove that you have been able to apply the knowledge and expertise you acquired, combined with quantifying the use and profit your work has. Nobody will give you a high paying job just for waving with degrees and certain alone. Amassing a ton of certs without any real work done and lacking a strong focus will also do the opposite, making you look like a “qualifications hoarder”.",

I'm not entirely sure on how to do it in the second example.\n\nAnd you can have private variables in classes - which isn't immediately possible with functions.\n\nIn my view both are \"classes\" in that they define a prototype that every new instance inherits from - and I insist  that you can actually draw a class diagram of your React components, even though they don't use the word \"class\".\n\nSoooooo, to answer your question: most web developers don't use the `class` keyword regularly, but they do use the concept of *classes* all the time, although maybe more as types or interfaces in TypeScript.",

Each of your 4 sections has a very different width, it just looks off-putting. Make some kind of a wrapper and make sure all sections fit and take up as much space in it. OR you could embrase the chaos and do something unique, but you wont be doing that with a typical SPA with 4 vertical sections, if you want to be unique, change up the layout entirely\n- I get the idea of having one section on a screen, but that doesnt really work well for bigger resolutions. Responsiveness doesnt just mean that nothing breaks and overflows, it needs to be proportional and usable on all devices\n- As cool as the nav is, it suffers from poor UX, because its highly unclear what it is, and once you click on it to figure out, at that point you dont even need it. One thing that came to my mind is putting it vertical on the left side for example. That way you can show the section names on hover, and keep your original design. \n- Same UX applies to your technologies. Always write in words what the technologies are. This helps searchability and makes it clear for people who do not know what a whale with boxes on it or an elephant mean.\n- 2/3 of your listed projets require login (or something adjacent), no one is gonna do it. Either make sure these projects have a landing page, preview, or anything else. Or make a showcase with pictures and videos in your portfolio \n- For some reason the whole website feels cheap, i cannot quite explain why objectively.

But could also be the overal color scheme and font\n- Last but not least, i would put maybe a little bit more information about yourself and in general, its kinda empty\n\n\nAnd one note, whatever the SEO situation is, you probably don't need seo at all for a personal portolio. No one who you didn't already send your portfolio website is gonna look you up on google and search for it.\n\nThis is all constructive criticism. Hope the post doesnt turn into a [deleted] and you actually make some improvements and update us. Good luck!",

In fact they're probably a good idea!\n\nWhen you start to work with other people, the rule is \"Good code is self-documenting,\" meaning it should be obvious what the code does without needing explanatory comments.\n\nUse variable names, data structures and encapsulation to minimise the amount of thinking that a reader has to do. For example, I'd refactor your code to make `Card` a class:\n\n```\nclass Card:\n    def __init__(self, cardString):\n        self.name = self._getName(cardString[0])\n        self.value = self._getValue(cardString[0])\n        self.suit = self._getSuit(cardString[1])\n\n    def _getName(self, cardFirstCharacter):\n        if cardFirstCharacter in v.faceCards:\n            return v.faceCards[cardFirstCharacter]\n        elif cardFirstCharacter.upper() == 'A':\n            return 'Ace'\n        else:\n            return cardFirstCharacter\n\n    def _getValue(self, cardFirstCharacter):\n        if cardFirstCharacter in v.faceCards:\n            return 10\n        elif cardFirstCharacter.upper() == 'A':\n            return 11\n        else:\n            return int(cardFirstCharacter)\n\n    def _getSuit(self, cardSecondCharacter):\n        suits = [\"Hearts\", \"Diamonds\", \"Clubs\", \"Spades\"]\n        return next((suit for suit in suits if suit[0] == cardSecondCharacter), None)\n```\n\nThen `hit()` becomes easy:\n\n```\ndef hit():\n    drawnCard = drawCard()\n    v.cardIdens.append(drawnCard)\n    card = Card(drawnCard)\n    return card.name, card.value\n```\n\n**Variable names** - `drawnCard` and `cardString` are the exact same thing, given different names in different contexts. The `Card` class doesn't need to care that a `cardString` was just drawn from `drawCard()`. Similarly, `cardString[0]` might look a bit mad, but when we pass it to a method we rename it to `cardFirstCharacter` in the method, which clearly tells you what it is.\n\n**Data structures** - I'm really bad at this to be honest. I'm a JavaScript dev, and JavaScript only has arrays (lists) and objects (dicts), so I tend to think only in arrays and objects for any problem.\n\n**Encapsulation** - `hit()` doesn't need to know or care how a card's value is calculated, because that implementation is _encapsulated_ in the `Card` class. If `Card` is assumed to work fine (because we also wrote tests!) then a developer debugging `hit()` can ignore it. Similarly, `Card._getSuit` contains some _really_ funky code, it's borderline unreadable. But if we only care how a card gets its name and value, we don't have to read any of the funky code that gets the suit.",

        "body": "Hey don't apologize. You're asking good questions!\n\nI would forget about hosting for now. That can come later once you actually develop the app, and shouldn't have much bearing on how the app is developed. \n\nWebb apps have 3 main components. A backend of some sort (usually some kind of API that serves JSON, but depending on your design it might also serve fully rendered HTML), a database that stores persistent data (user info, product info, user content, etc) that your backend interacts with, and a frontend that consists of HTML, JS, and CSS (this frontend may be served by the same backend discussed before or could be served by a different service. Doesn't really matter for development.\n\nSo how do you pick what to use? You'll get tons of answers. One answer could be that you should use whatever your team currently uses. Another might be that you have really specific performance requirements that demand a certain stack. \n\nFor you, the answer is \"whatever you want\". Really. I would look up some common stacks that maybe use languages you're already familiar with and then just pick one and go with a getting started guide. \n\nLike javascript a lot? Use MERN. More of a Python guy? Use Flask or Fast API and pick either Vue or React for the frontend. Want to learn more vanilla javascript and not bother with frameworks? Cool. You don't need React or Vue or any other framework. \n\nFor other tools, make sure you're comfortable with git, github, working in bash or zsh or some other *nix shell. Once you actually have an app developed, you should be in a good place to figure out how to actually deploy it.",

It doesn't have to be bound to a controller. It can be, but a DTO is just that: A data transfer object. It is a box of properties that simply moves data from A to B. It can be used to move data outside of the application, but it can also be used to simplify transferring data from one side of the codebase to the other.\n\nHowever, if we assume that a DTO in this case always correlates with some data being returned in a controller, then you'd most likely want to do the mapping in the controller. Being dogmatic about this can be a little difficult, as you'd quickly end up making DTO objects between the service and the controller layer for situations where you have to join together data from different sources (which can be fine as well).\n\nThe issue with having the service layer coupled with API DTOs is that other parts of the system might want to use your service without being coupled to the API (which you point out in your post), which can become a problem. However, if that doesn't happen, then there's no issue.\n\nMy point is that there's no single rule. It depends on the dependencies within the system, as well as how the system will develop over time. \n\nMy general advice here is to push everything outward from the core of your application until it starts to become annoying. When you've found the sweetspot, then keep it there until other things start making it annoying, then consider pushing it further out (or pull it inwards) depending on how it is annoying. Don't be set in stone; instead, be pragmatic and flexible.",

To transfer this to a persistence layer, DTO is used and in the ORM context, they are entities. Without it, we have to do this mapping on our own.\n\nThen we can can make a simplified DAO service, which provide CRUD operations we can use in the controller (presentation layer). It's already possible to use the ORM operations directly in the controller, but I prefer a service class to make this cleaner.\n\nSomehow, we have to map from entityDTO to presentationDTO. The presentationDTO is used to return a response to the client. \n\nI read that this mapping is done in the service layer, the problem:\n\nIf we map the entityDTO in the service to the presentationDTO, the service will always return a presentationDTO that is expected to be used in a controller or view.   \n  \nFor example, in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) core, we do not want to return a response from the entityDTO directly, since they contain navigation properties. We want the JSON output to exclude the navigation props and instead translate type references to foreign key fields. That is why we map to a presentationDTO.\n\nBut sometimes we want to use service class in another service class and we do not want to already return a presentationDTO from the service. In this case, the service should return an entityDTO so we can use this data in the other services if necessary. Then if we want to map this entityDTO to a presentationDTO, it's best to do this in the controller.\n\nDo you know what I mean?",

You *can, it's possible,* in the same way anything you want to code is possible. The convention is to not return these in this form. They are mapped the moment they are retrieved from a database, so by definition they are returned from the Data Access Object (or DB layer) and this is unavoidable - so you always start by mapping the data from a persistence driver to a language class instance (or dictionary).\n\n  \nWhile controllers return a *response* that can easily just be whatever the service returns wrapped in whatever response your protocol expects. The response from a service is what is in question here.\n\nIn spring for example, you will commonly see in a service:\n\nexample() {  \nvar stuff = repo.getStuff();  \n...business logic...  \n\n\nreturn stuff.stream().map(StuffToDtoMapper::EntityToDTO}....;\n\n)\n\nThis is done in the service layer because the service doesn't want to return the entire entity model to the controller, assuming it's a service method that is called directly by a controller, often times, the service might not even be receiving the entity itself, but rather an intermittent object still on the database side (e.g. spring projections) which it would still want mapped to a presentation DTO, as you said.\n\nWhen you want to use the entire entity in a different service, which is completely normal, you define a separate method in your service (some even opt for different services, but that's overkill in my opinion) that returns the entity itself, indicating that it is used for inter-service communication and not to be routed back through a controller.\n\nAll these things are just conventions, you can technically do anything you want, but this communicates intent to other developers who are familiar with the convention.",

I guarantee they didn't have complex hit boxes for old-school games. \n\n\nPy-Game might be a good place to start.",

I'm not trying to sound like a smartass or anything, but sometimes the most simple route can be the best! You can learn stuff like design patterns and algorithms and stuff, but if you feel like you are too heavily reliant on AI I'd suggest trying to make a simple project (like a sudoku or a simple calculator ) and just turn off copilot or anything of the likes and just start googling (the AI from Google also doesn't count) learning to use documentation and efficient research helps a lot for becoming a better programmer especially if you try to dissect your problem in smaller bites and start to get hang of how you could figure out problems by pure logic it will then only make you stronger in coding when you do allow yourself to use AI. But practising is the best medicine imo. You seem like a smart individual but don't get yourself twisted over achieving stuff like becoming a 10x developer, I'm guessing a part of having that amount of skill is also part of just loving to code and doing it a lot (of course there are cases of people who just inhale knowledge and have such a robust logical mind that it comes easy to them but that is besides the point) and if you can think of the logic how to tackle problems during coding before even touching your keyboard then you're on the right track (not a must but is nice) coding is just logical thinking. Hope this kinda helped, i kinda rambled myself too",

If someone just wanted to vibe code their way into software that's going to be riddled with problems that's probably a different story.\n\nAssuming AI is going to reach the point where it's actually useful at scale then you'll want to be in a position where you can still read, debug, and modify whatever code the various models you use will output.\n\nAt the moment AI isn't really a net benefit for a lot of companies or projects that are rather large, but realistically with the amount of investment they've seen they likely will be. To clarify a bit, they're decent at writing a number of things, but I've also seen them do a number of dumb things that cost more time than they've saved.\n\nThe other rather significant problem is that while you can use them to build a number of things by piecing things together it starts to fail when you have to debug even relatively small programs. Even if you've all the features enabled to have it try to analyze, run, and test a program it will still often fail somewhere. Though it will completely confidently proclaim that what it wrote it works properly when it definitely doesn't. I've seen this just trying to get it write unit tests for things that are only mildly complicated. Other times the project is just too big to fit in the context window. A bit of an anecdote here, but I still find it humorous seeing certain models try to run code (not written using Python) in a Python interpreter even when you explicitly told it not to.\n\nI expect we'll see a shift from monolithic to more microservice based programs to help meet AI in the middle, but we're not there across the industry today.",

It just has to make some sense to you somehow and you alone.  Think of it like your subconscious working for you.   And once you have enough pieces built, everything will just click and make sense.   \n\nIf you ever watch an artist working on a brand new piece, you would understand what this is about.   Professional artists always do a super rough sketch skeleton first, then they work a bit here and a bit there, but never complete.  The process would look very strange to everyone including the artist.  But when it is all done, the artist would look back and think about how he/she actually arrive at the final piece.  From that experience, he/she would rationalize what must have been going on in his/her head.  And that's the story he/she tells the world.  Same thing with novel writers, this is why most good writers are constantly revising, never satisfied.\n\ne:  A key to successfully learning from your projects is making mistakes.

This means learning how to learn is a step in its own. You're probably best just looking for an online community of software engineers with experience and asking there (forums, discords, etc), or just Googling it and hoping you find results. Examples:\n\nBanking and financial processing are extremely heavy on the security, regulations, and infrastructure side of things, so that's where most of your research/investment goes- under the hood I'd imagine most banks etc use very similar software, all just making secure API calls to one-another. Your learning resources are going to be regulations and industry insights to the current norms. Your only hope to breaking into the market is probably innovation (doing something known, just cheaper or higher quality).\n\nComparatively, something like game development would be the opposite. You're creating a lot of unique systems; usually without significant regard for standards/security. I.e. outside of specific cases, there's not really one preferred solution. Your learning resources are gonna be more subjective and decentralized, as the requirements are much fuzzier and the market isn't \"solved.\" This means you can break into the market via invention *or* innovation.",

That thing could knock my eyeballs out. I wasn't using my brain for anything at the time, so I would get up in the middle of the night and spend a couple hours playing around with it. Eventually I started writing code in Amiga Basic. Then I realized that Basic sucked, and I bought an Amiga C compiler, and eventually a debugger. \n\nThen it occurred to me that with these newfound skills, I might be able to stop delivering furniture. Actually... I delivered some desks to a warehouse in Phoenix where they were working on the first really successful map program for PCs. Can't remember what it was called. I tried to make an appointment to deliver some more desks the next day, and one of the guys there said in sort of a lofty, sophisticated voice, \"I shouldn't be disturbed tomorrow, I'll be writing code.\" That was one of the coolest things I had ever heard.\n\nSo at that point I wanted to be a real programmer. I started applying for jobs. Nothing happened. Then I thought \"Maybe if I SEND these people my code...\" It was a stupid idea, but it got me a couple of interviews. I went to the first interview, but they were already mad at me because I hadn't put enough postage on my printout. The second time I sent code out I put plenty of postage on it, and they hired me for Customer Support because the code I sent was event-driven UI, and that's where they were going. No more moving furniture.\n\nSo after a week of doing Customer Support, I went and told the guy in charge of programming department, \"Hey, I found a bug in the code.\" And he literally said, \"Well, fix it.\" So I fixed it. And then I just jumped in the deep end. Eventually they put me in the programming dept, but didn't replace me in Customer Support. So I just kept doing both jobs. \n\nAfter a year or so, they hired somebody for Customer Support and started giving me raises. \n\nReally, that company was a terrific place to Be All You Could Be. I just wish I had realized that. Because after 10 years, I quit, looking for something better. I didn't realize that there were WAY worse places I could be. Had to learn the hard way.\n\nI doubt that this story can help you. Things are different now. Back then, there was a terrible shortage of programmers. Now it's a glut. Also, I could do wonders with copy of Petzold's Programming Windows, a DOS 4.0 manual, and some DB stuff. Now the list of things to learn is as long as both of your arms.\n\nI'd say, if that's what you want to do, don't let anything stop you, work or study 12 hours a day or more, WRITE CODE ALL THE TIME, be persistent and focused. Maybe that'll work eventually.",

So frameworks like Vue, react, angular, spring, springboot, Django, etc., are never taught nor even mentioned in the core CS coursework, and probably only explored in 1 out of however many electives are available. Even as I’m doing a MSCS, frameworks are either assumed knowledge or you are expected to self teach them to complete your assignments.",

Set up a load balancer, experiment with kubernetes, use services like Kafka and write your services to operate on a stream processing model, try setting up a sharded and replicated database, write a CI/CD pipeline, get used to working with containers and IaaC. you can even load test your own box or a VPS to test its scalability.

If you are worried about not getting everything down you may as well worry about the fact that you haven't mastered Scratch in it's entirety.\n\nUse cs50 as a springboard.  Refine and revisit fundamentals as you continue your learning journey as you need them. Dive into other areas of specialisation to build the projects you want to. \n\nAnd it's honestly pointless to compare yourself with others - whether you are really fast or slow. Prof Malan himself mentions something along the lines of it only being useful to compare the knowledge and expertise you've acquired with your previous knowledge and expertise.  Some people have prior experience, others none. Some people are interested in particular areas and will deep dive, others will just skim sections they aren't that into.

It was used in famous systems like the Apple II series, the Commodore ViC20, C64, C128 (where also a Zilog Z-80 CPU was used along), and even in NES systems. It is a well documented architecture with plenty available Assemblers, Disassemblers, emulators, tutorials/courses, etc.\n\nSo, if you don't have a particular goal in mind, and maybe want to dive a little into retro computing, then, the 6502 architecture is the way to go.\n\nI started with the Zilog Z-80 CPU as this was the architecture my home computer used way back in the 1980s. Also wasn't too difficult to get into.\n\nAnother option would be, if you are interested in microcontrollers, embedded programming, to go with the Intel 8031/8051/8080 CPU architecture, which somewhat is the predecessor of the Intel 8086 CPU. That's what I used at my degree. Also very well documented and easy to learn.\n\nIn general, the 8-bit architectures of old are way easier to learn than the modern 32 and 64 bit architectures.",

Learn something like data structures, loops, and functions, then immediately put them into practice through small, fun projects. For example, if you learn about lists and loops, build a simple quiz game or a to do list app. This way, you’ll reinforce your learning and keep it engaging. Projects don’t have to be big or complex at this stage so just think of them more as practice reps.\n\nExam prep and coding will come down to prioritization. Your exam is the gateway to METU, so make sure that’s your main focus until it’s done. But coding can act as a mental refresh so use it as a productive break from studying. Consistency beats intensity so it’s better to code a little regularly than to burn out trying to do everything at once.

Yes, Dijkstra's algorithm is definitely widely used.\n\nIt's generally not meaningful to compare things like \"number of iterations\" or \"number of function calls\" between two different algorithms, or two different implementations of the same algorithm (unless they're very similar to each other).\n\nIf actual practical performance is what matters, then comparing the actual running time is what matters, so that you can fairly compare the effects of things like synchronization overhead.\n\nProbably, the most useful comparison would be to draw graphs of the *average* running time for graphs of different sizes, and also with different numbers of threads (or CPU core counts) so that you can see where the break-even point is, i.e. where the benefits of parallelism outweigh the extra overhead. Varying the sparsity of the graphs would also be interesting.\n\nIf you're interested in the theoretical big-O complexity, then numerical measurements don't really matter at all, and instead you'd need to formally analyze and rigorously prove some kind of upper-bound on the amount of work done by each thread. This is likely to be a lot more difficult than just taking measurements.\n\n----\n\nAn additional note: as you said, the basic form of Dijkstra's algorithm gives the \"single-source shortest paths\" from a source to *all* other nodes. But in practice, we are often only interested in the path from one source to one destination. A simple and obvious optimization is to just stop the algorithm as soon as the destination node is expanded (because at that point its path is guaranteed to be optimal). \n\nA less obvious optimization is to do a *bidirectional* search, which works both forwards from the source and backwards from the destination simultaneously, terminating when they meet. This often results in expanding dramatically fewer nodes. (If you imagine the \"frontier\" as being circular, then then two circles with radius d/2 have half the area compared to one circle with radius d.)\n\nYou might want to see if your parallel algorithm can be adapted to handle one or both of these optimizations. That'll make it more likely to be useful in practice.",

In a basic sense functions take in data do something with it then return data back to whatever called it.\n\nit’s generally bad practice to have functions work on non local variables if you can avoid it because it makes the code less reusable and more prone to weird difficult to diagnose bugs because you have many functions work on the same data it becomes much harder to diagnose and fix undefined behavior.\n\nSimple pattern to start. If you need to mutate a variable, instead of the function mutating the variable directly, set the function to take an input, mutate that input and return the value you want to mutate. That way the function can do the same behavior, mutating the variable, but it can also save that variable to a new variable.\nHere’s a sample snippet of python code to explain what I mean.\nEdit: Reddit messing up formatting here.\n\ndef increment(x):\n        return x + 1\n\ncount = 0\n\ncount = increment(count)  # updates original\n\nnew_count = increment(count)  # keeps original\n\nCount starts at zero, the increment function increments it by one and then you save the incremented count to new_count. This structure is much clearer to people reading your code, the function can now be used for more than just mutating a single global variable and you are discouraged from creating single use functions.\n\nAs you get better at programming, free floating variables become much rarer. Most variables are used as temporary storage for working data, (and if we are really to get into the weeds they act as human readable abstractions that become pure memory operations at compile time) while all persistent data has a clear owner. This makes it much easier to reason about where data lives, who’s allowed to change it, and how long it will exist. If you are making simple python scripts right now it might seem tempting to do things quick and dirty, after all that is what python is good for, but developing good habits in the beginning pay dividends once you have to start working on more complex systems.",

You don't need to learn Python, but if you wanted to, you could learn it online, Udemy has some courses for under $20 that are decent.\n\n2. You could, you could also find someone on the Internet. Fully trusting random people with a lucrative idea is tough. You should start with someone you know and trust who could help you network rather than looking for random people without a connection.\n\n4/5. You'd have to figure out whether you want to try to get the government contracts yourself (find out when this company's contract is up for renewal and then you'll probably need to RFP for it, etc.) or you could offer to subcontract increasing numbers leading up to all of the reports for this company for $150+ (if they only need to deliver data to you/your company and not manage a bunch of other contractors to do the reports, you're adding significant value compared to just doing a few reports a week)\n\n6. It sounds like you're saying you're worried someone is after you? The problem you're solving sounds a bit niche and if it were a glaringly obvious and easy automation case, someone would have done it already, nobody's after you.\n\n\nProbably want to speak to a reputable law firm about setting up the right kind of company and if you have IP that can be protected.

If you want a better understanding of digital logic and how it's used to assemble a functioning computer, it's a good course and fairly easy to follow in a self-study manner. And it's a survey, you'll want to follow it up with actual compiler, OS, or computer architecture courses afterward but you'll have a better foundation to start them.\n\nSICP is a CS textbook that kind of tackles things from the other direction, though also gets to the point of building a compiler for a simulated register machine. It does not really get down into the hardware logic quite like Nand2Tetris does. If you want a better conceptual understanding of how software is evaluated, SICP is a good course. It's important to keep in mind it's context though, it was intended for first year students at MIT who would also be taking (or have taken) courses in calculus, physics, and EE topics so many of the examples and exercises relate back to that. Section 3.5 Streams (which also introduces the concepts of promises and implements them) has examples of using streams for simulations of electric circuits, for instance. They don't always explain the math that they expect students to know, so you may need to devise some of your own exercises or go and study a bit outside SICP to progress on all the exercises.\n\nOn that last point, SICP is somewhat less self-contained because of the context it was intended for, but is still a very good textbook overall. Nand2Tetris provides you, from recollection it's been years, with everything you should need to be able to progress through it.\n\nFrom the perspective of being a backend developer, I'm not sure either will really give you much ROI except that you might understand computers and software better following either.",

        "body": "It's not clear, to me, what algorithm you are using. There's one (or more inefficiency) which is the malloc/free which is considered a bit slow. There's a question of what your objective is, that is, do you want to have an array of the factors as a result or just print it out. Printing it out would be much easier, but then it's hard to use the factors afterwards.\n\nBut the optimization is something rather simple and follows a trick that you use to determine if a number is prime.\n\nInstead of going from 1 to n, you go from 1 to ceil(sqrt(n)). Here's why you can stop at the square root of n. \n\nSuppose you find a factor that's smaller than the square root of n. Let's call it x. Because it's a factor, there's also another factor y such that `x * y = n`.\n\nNow `y` has to be bigger than (or equal to) the square root of n. If it weren't, then you have two numbers smaller than the square root of n which, when multiplied, will be smaller than n.\n\nYou might wonder, could we miss some factors greater than the square root of n by stopping so soon? The answer is no. Why? For a similar reason. Suppose there is a factor, `y` that's bigger than the square root of n. Then, it must have a corresponding factor, `x`, which is less than the square root. If it didn't, then both `x` and `y` would both be greater than the square root of n, and their product would be greater than n (which would mean they aren't factors).\n\nSo, you could modify it something like\n\n      float root= sqrt((float) n); // or however you get the square root\n      // Crude way to get the ceiling of the root\n      int limit = (int) (root + 1);\n      for (int i = 1; i <= limit; i++) {\n         if (n % i == 0) { // Check if it's a factor\n            // It is\n            printf(\"%d is a factor\\n\", i);\n            int other = n / i; // Get other factor\n            if (other != i) {\n                 // Don't double print if we hit the square root\n                printf(\"%d is a also a factor\\n\", i);\n            }\n       }\n\nIf you wanted to save the array allocation cost and do it once, you could run this loop twice. The first time, you'd check for how many factors there were (create a counter before the loop and increment each time you print). Then, you'd malloc the array, then fill in the array again.\n\nHard to say which is more efficient, but the square root trick is pretty useful because square root of n is MUCH smaller than n, so that's the number 1 idea you can use.",

        "body": "Squeezing this kind of optimization (to me) seems silly. You're calling the square root function *once*. On the other hand, you're computing `i * i` each time through the loop. When both are good enough (C programmers from the 1980s and 1990s obsessed over writing the fastest code, but these days, if the code runs fast enough, then clarity of code matters more than efficiency), you opt for the one that is clearer to the reader which could be you or be someone else.\n\nThis is why some people use Python (with Django or Flask) on the backend or even Node. A Rust backend would be faster, at the expense of being harder to read. Speed isn't everything, and even when it is, guessing what is fast or slow is not an effective way to improve the speed: you need a way to measure your program's execution (this is called instrumenting it). There are tools called *profilers* that can do this, but it's not super easy to set up and differs from language to language.\n\nFor example, you can call a very expensive function that takes, say, a second once, but if you have a loop that goes a million times, and you can shave a millisecond off each iteration, that matters more.\n\nIn this case, the square root trick really reduces the number of iterations and has the biggest impact, far more than deciding whether to use square root or i * i. I think it's fine to stick with i * i, because it's pretty close to saying square root. This is where it's useful to have a comment like\n \n    // Not using square root because i * i is more efficient\n\ncan help. Often, when you're trying to speed things up, comments help indicate you're writing less obvious code to help speed it up.\n\nHowever, many beginners obsess over speed without truly knowing how to speed it up (basically, they try a bunch of things). Algorithmic improvements are usually the ones to aim for rather than smaller things like how fast square root runs. Having said that, many years ago I wrote a program using sine and cosine, and because I computed it over and over, it was slow (I had no idea).\n\nThe solution was to create an array with the results pre-computed. I only had a limited number of values I was running these trig functions on (say, 60), so placing the pre-computed values in the array and looking those values up was far more efficient.\n\nSo, it *can* matter. But usually you want to spot big loops which is where things tend to slow down.",

The path can be simple: start with fundamentals (networks, OS basics, databases, caching, APIs). Once you’re comfortable, read *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* for depth it gives you the building blocks. \n\nAfter that, move to structured interview prep sources like System Design Primer or Alex Xu’s books they’ll help you see patterns in real interview-style questions. Finally, reinforce by discussing designs with peers or mock interviews. Think of it like layers: fundamentals → real-world systems → interview frameworks → practice. If you approach it step by step instead of sampling everything at once, you’ll avoid confusion and actually retain the knowledge.",

Is there something I could do better, a simplification I could make, a loop or repetition I could simplify or remove?\n\n  \nOnce I've done that I'll see if there are recommended solutions, or just google similar things. I think I first learnt of python list comprehension by looking at how other people solved issues, being completely baffled by this \\[f(x) for x in something\\] I kept seeing, and then just playing around to see how it worked.\n\n  \nThe whole process made some exercises take a lot longer than they could have done, but as I learnt not only how I could do things better, but also how other people do, I found things easier and quicker. Sometimes I'd go and look at my 'good' solutions and see how bad they really are. And on occasion I realised the brute force approach may have actually been better as it was so much easier to understand and re-use.\n\n  \nI think, personally, brute force isn't so bad on small scripts with small data sets that I only use for simple things. As long as I'm not loading files when I don't need to, then even looping over data sets more than I need isn't always bad. As soon as I have a nested loop I pay far more attention, likewise when I suddenly have a far larger data set than expected.\n\n  \n(Case in point, I have a script I'm using right now where I'm sorting through a text file for some specific identifiers and false positives. My first run through the input was a couple of hundred lines. I didn't pay much attention to how I was scanning through the text. Yesterday I started looking at a file with \\~1M lines.

But it's also generally a good idea in this industry to not move on from a problem as soon as we have some viable solution. If we have the time, refining the solution is absolutely recommended. If you can find a constant-time solution instead of using a loop, or something else that reduces the time/memory use, that's usually highly appreciated.\n\nOften also it's worth struggling and trying out various solutions. If you get a real _oh, riiiight_ reaction when you're shown the solution, then you likely learned something. :)\n\nI still get that for the math problems over at projecteuler, and sometimes when I go to the forums there I just conclude that I don't understand the best solutions. Likely I _could_ understand them if I actually applied myself to more math studies, but being able to figure out a solution even if I don't have all the background knowledge I could have had can still be fun.\n\n---\n\nI'll also note we generally use the `while` loop for when the loop is going to have some spicy development. Like in [the hailstone sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) we don't really know how many steps will be involved or how we'd express it as a for-each loop, so it's more expected to get a `while n != 1`.\n\nBut if we want to repeat a step exactly `k` times, then we generally use a for-each loop, like `for i in range(k): …`\n\nI don't know how the MOOC you're taking teaches loops.",

If `low < high` you print, otherwise you quit.\n\n      while low <= high:\n           # print low\n           # increment low\n           # check the negation of the condition \n           if high > low:  \n               # break\n           else\n               # print high\n               # decrement high\n\nSo basically, you track two variables, one for the beginning (`low`), one for the end (`high`), and you print the `low` and increment, then check if the condition `low <= high` is true, if so then print `high` and decrement the value.\n\nYou can test this out with, say, an input of 3.\n\n* Prints 1 and increments low to 2\n* Prints 3 and decrements high to 2\n* Prints 2 and increments low to 3\n* low > high, so quit out\n\nThis was a little tricky because the decision of whether it's `low < high` or `low <= high` is not obvious and can lead to an off-by-1 error if you select the wrong one.",

This avoids coming across like a contrarian and shows you're open to other people's ideas. \n\n* admit when you don't know something - no one likes a no it all especially about matters you clearly don't understand. This gives your thoughts and opinions more weight when you do express them.\n\n* Use words like \"We\", \"Us\", & \"As a team\", instead of \"you created this bug on this PR\", \"we created this bug, and we missed it during the PR\", \"what if we need to add  X functionality?\"\n\n* form relationships with users (if non public facing software) and stakeholders. If you have a bug you're investigating, just tell the user, this builds more trust and good will. \n\n* when debating about designs/patterns/architecture, just don't say \"this isn't good because X, Y, Z\", ask people questions in a way that it will lead them to the conclusion you want them to make. \"Will this work under this use case?\", \"what if the user does X?\", etc. \n* ask your manager how other folks are doing, \"how is John doing lately? He seems a bit stressed out or anxious\". Shows you're aware of people's emotions and you're concerned about others. \n\nI feel like there are more, but this is what I've found.",

We've gotten to this point where leaders think that they are the supermegaminds that are the only ones who could possible know what the company needs to focus on, and the reality is that figuring out what a company needs should be much more bottom up than top down - because it always needs to go to the bottom and come back up anyway.\n\nRight now the model - especially for internal work, but I'm sure also for external work - is:\n\n1. Executive comes up with \"great idea\" that is neither great nor feasible\n\n2. Executive hands idea down to VP, who loves the idea\n\n3. Executive hands project down to Director with timelines and super aggressive goals. Director already starts getting nervous because this idea sounds unreasonable, and so do the timelines. Also, maybe not that great of an idea once you layer reality on it\n\n4. Executive breaks into smaller projects, hands to Managers. Managers shitting bricks because they *know* this shit is unreasonable and they start pushing back while simultaneously getting ICs lined up on how to get things moving in a direction that is most likely to be palatable to leadership when it inevitbaly becomes clear the original idea wasn't possible.\n\n5. Manager pushes on Director, Director pushes on VP, VP punches Director in face, Director pushes back again on VP, VP starts softening language with executive, executive punches VP in face, VP pushes back a bit harder, executive punches again, VP remembers that executive doesn't know shit so he starts redifining things so that they sound like what the executive wanted while banking on the possibility that the executive doesn't even really know what they want. It works\n\n6. Manager gets go ahead to build the thing they've been building already. It is not what executive wanted, but executive doesn't care as long as he can sell it, so everyone - executive, vp, director, manager, ICs - now have to make a bunch of powerpoint slides to convince everyone else that the bullshit they built - which was good and useful - is actually the greates development ever.",

The reality is companies are trying to squeeze devs harder and invest less in training (especially less junior hires and interns).  They're squeezing harder because interest rates are higher and changes in tax policy meant they can't deduct R&D expenses from their income.  Profitability is king right now. \n\nSecond, juniors definitely are getting shafted hard right now (not 2008 level bad, but still rough).  But mid/senior roles also getting shafted too, and our jobs are anything BUT safe.   We got the benefit of a *little* bit of lube first, but it's still not enough to stop things from being painful. \n\nTo explain: a ton of mid & senior+ devs got laid off over the last few years. I was one of them.  Less than 6 months after hopping to a different Principal job they gutted my new department.  Basically nothing I could have done would have saved me. *Some* of us were able to line up replacement jobs (thankfully me) due to having the right experience.  \n\nBut the job prospects are still not great, even for proven seniors.  Companies know this and are using it to squeeze us hard to get more work for the same pay, and they're not afraid to fire people if they can't keep up.\n\nIn a few years the pendulum will probably swing back for tech.  AI isn't the silver bullet clueless executives claim. If the code I'm seeing daily is any indicator, ultimately AI code generation will ALSO generate a lot of maintenance (and scalability and quality) nightmares.  Plus if companies DON'T hire juniors, then when the market recovers they'll have to pay a  lot more to get experienced talent... and then they're going to turn back to hiring juniors to save money.",

I just knew I want to do this for a living because it's important and closest thing to magic in our world.\n\nIt was only when I step into college and I learned that oh shit this is highest paid industry. Everyone who's not CS major is also taking Data Structure classes to hope they can get their resume pass screening by some tech out there.\n\nAfter my 4 years of training in college, all these non-CS majors and bootcamp grads for some reasons have the same starting line as us. This is something especially ridiculous to look back now.\n\nSo this is why I actually said it might be a good time for real CS enthusiasts: all these corner cutters are no longer in your competition now, because all opportunists are gone now. They won't have the same chance to make it as you anymore, when a market is this tough and competition is even higher.",

You can't just YOLO out code in the same way anymore - everything needs to go through a more rigorous product development process. Also, while the work you're doing may seem simple, you're a small cog in a bigger machine. As you get more senior in your org, you become more and more responsible for figuring out how all of these cogs fit together rather than shipping out code yourself.\n\nIf you're working on internal tools and infra, those teams have many of the same challenges, but also some of their own. The business problems you deal with at a large enterprise are pretty unique and require you to build bespoke solutions. Senior engineers have to deal directly with stakeholders within the company - product teams, other infra teams, program managers, etc. I work in a security org, and honestly stakeholder management is at least as difficult a problem for us as the engineering itself is.",

Furthermore the unemployment rate continued to rise for 2 years  after the recession to almost 11 percent and didn't meaningfully fall for half a decade. Just so you know the unemployment rate for young people is ALWAYS higher than the average unemployment rate, so you were in a market where almost 20 percent  (18.8%) of people under 25 could not find ANY job, including part time work, \n\n source: (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LRUN24TTUSM156S)\n\nOutside the U.S. it was worse, Spain and Greece youth unemployment rose to 50 percent and remained there through the first half of the 2010s. It wasn't until 2014 when the economy started too feel like it was going back to normal and even then the U.S. unemployment rate was still 6 percent (which is recessionary).\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/30/spain-youth-unemployment-record-high](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/30/spain-youth-unemployment-record-high)\n\nMy facebook, which back then was young cool social media,  could be divided into two types of people. People with bachelors degrees from prestigious schools and people who went to normal schools. The people at prestigious schools ended up fine, but the ones who went to your average school had their lives permanently altered. Your talking about people with business degrees go  or math degrees go work dead end service industry jobs until their mid 20s or teach english in Japan. Some of those people eventually retooled or went back to school and have careers, others are still bar tending somewhere.\n\nThis is economic research from that time period, from IZA, which is one of the top affiliation groups in labor economics [https://docs.iza.org/dp5674.pdf](https://docs.iza.org/dp5674.pdf)\n\nNow for the CS job market faired better than most other jobs. Smart phones had just been invented so the tech boom seeds had been planted, but back then people weren't throwing money at software companies like they have been the past 6 or 7 years. Like I worked a data science/risk quant job at a regional bank and all the old guys in the office were laughing at the \"ridiculously high IPO price for facebook at 35$\".  People would throw money into apple, which had great P&L financials, but the things that companies were really looking at then where oil and energy. Fracking had just taken off etc.\n\nFuthermore, the 2010 recession was a financial crisis. That means it effected the finance industry and guess what is part fo the finance industry? Venture Capital. Venture Capital is partially funded by banks. 2009 was a time when there was a lot of regulation was introduced on banks. Banks had taken or were foreced to take government loans, wells fargo and JP Morgan were asked to do acquisitions of bad banks. The crisis caused  a lot of focus on risk management practices in ganks and venture capital inherently is taking high risks. So it basically meant that startup funding was inherently lot harder to get.  Furthemore, at the time of that recession the last big recession was the previous tech bubble, so there was a lot more skepticism about the tech industry.\n\nI think one thing to realize when talking about job markets  is that most people who went through the last recession are in their mid 30s. Like people who graduated college beween 2009 and 2012    are all 33 to 40. This means you have an  entire generation of workers that are in their late 20s that have never seen a recession and don't ahve anything base it on. So they are quick to toss the word around. The other thing is that people who graduated between 2020 through 2022 basically went to the best job market in 50 years and its completely due to COVID stimulus.  That means that people who missed the boat feel that the job market is worse than it actually is, because your expectations are anchored on that boom. LIke I don't buy for a second AI is the main reason entry level hiring is down. Sure this is part of it, but the real reason that hiring is down is that interest rates are high (meaning capital is expensive and finance firms won't throw around money) and you had massive over hiring in the panemic.\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE)\n\nLike this is a time series plot of software engineering job postings on indeed from the FED. See how it goes up and down, that isn't normal behavior. If it was growing normally it would be slight increase over time. What his shows is the the number of job postings in the peak of 2021  over doubled relative to the prepandemic number of job postings. In 2025 its about 60 percent of the prepandemic level.\n\nThere is very good chacne that tech industry might have a slower recovery than every other industry after a recession. I don't think this will be CS and Data Science as a whole, its just that a lot more hiring of those jobs are going to be taking place at non-tech companies and your not going to see these salaries of people making 200k TC straight out of school at tier one companies. Its going to be a lot more I just go my first CS job making 85k at a regional bank or  home depot, and less of those fat equity grants.",

There was a lot happening still in 'the underground' side of things, as well as tech startups.\n\nBut, there were hiring freezes. There was lack of funding for startups, widespread layoffs. The basic stuff you'd expect for a dwindling economy.\n\nBut, the internet, and tech was more fun. Things were fresh, new; not every idea and thing created was built with a paywall behind it.\n\nThen, there was nothing even relatable to the scale of what's going on now. AI tech, social media showing what little promise, lack of privacy. A lot of it has been learning new things that re-invent the wheel over and over again.\n\nAnd discussing the current market allows for teams to discuss strategy. Being in the know of what's going on, and having experience in new and arising tech puts you ahead of others, and not only that, allows you to better seek talent that align with goals.\n\nBack then, there weren't job sites with jobs that will never be filled, there wasn't a massive amount of CS degrees and engineering was what people promoted. Software engineers weren't as prevalent.\n\nThey weren't good economic times though. Houses where I'm from sold for about the price of a VCR after being gutted. Amazing companies and projects died soon after staring. I wouldn't say they're near as bad as what's going on now though.\n\nIf you took AI back to 2008 he'd be the one boohooing.",

Now, the growth is gone. Entry-level hiring is still happening, but there is far more supply than demand so lots of graduates are being left without opportunities.",

The algebraic manipulation you performed is invalid in the general sense Grok explained (it makes the problem more complex by converting a univariate problem to a multivariate one and making your definition of x recursive) and in the specific sense that the specific transformation you made (taking the square root) makes it a multi-valued function (eg sqrt(4)=+/-2).\n\nHonestly, Grok spent way more time handling your belligerence with kid gloves than you would’ve gotten from a university math TA…",

Agentic AI is where companies are now adding evals, memRAGs, pre-determined prompts and answers, and much more to increase accuracy with a proper workflow to solve a bunch of different tasks. Keep a lookout in the next month and all these new industry panels should be on the ai4 website and you can see for yourself how these companies are using LLM properly https://ai4.io/videos/. Whenever you use Grok or ChatGPT on the web is just the surface level what the latest companies are using LLM for. At the end of the day these LLMs are just probabilistic neural nets trained on very generic public internet data and are not as accurate as you want them to be since they aren't trained on the specific data for your specific needs. The accuracy is based on the transformer model and it seems we might be nearing the end of that architecture's accuracy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large\\_language\\_model. \n\nThe reason why LLMs are notoriously bad with logical or math calculation is because it doesn't actually do deterministic calculations but just probabilistic \"what is the most likely words it should output is\" based on your token input, aka prompt.\n\nAlso, a large majority of these companies still need software developers as they are the final guard rails of these LLM outputs.  \n  \n Its just that the economy is kinda cooked that's all and everyone is trying to save a buck.",

This is after a week of working overtime to keep up by the way.\n\nI could immediately see my team eyeing up my jobs, just ready to get one over on me to be above me on the pile.\n\nMonth after month, I would be bottom of the pile despite 70 hour weeks. After a while of this, I decided, you know what, I am contracted at 37 hours a week, I am not getting overtime, I am now starting at 9am and finishing at 5:30pm.\n\nMy check ins and \"performance\" fell off a cliff. I was warned that my performance was down, I wrote an email response explaining that I was no longer going to be doing free overtime. I also sent a copy to HR, but separately, not CC'd in.\n\nI had work colleagues warn me in a friendly way that I'd get my butt spanked if I didn't rethink it. I was sent another email a week later demanding to know why my performance was so poor. I reiterated my working hours. The response, a bit more interesting this time, stated that the tasks I was set should be easily completed in my working week and if I thought not then I should request a meeting to discuss my performance.\n\nOK says I, let's have that meeting. And boy, did we. I had my phone in my pocket recording the meeting. It quickly descended into a meeting where my manager was downgrading sprint estimates to force it into a week's of work. Apparently, creating a process to read, modify and re-save CSV files is a sprint score of 1 suddenly - not the 8 points we did have it set to!\n\nDespite his hammering down of SPRINT estimates which actually all ended up with SPRINT score 1, he still couldn't fit it into my week. What an interesting conversation to have recorded.\n\nI didn't even get 1/4 of the way through my SPRINT, my manager discussed the idea of my lack of performance. This would go on for months. I would keep logs, he would keep complaining, he would call me with passive aggressive advice to help me out, asking if the best use of my time really was to go and see Slayer that weekend or try to catch up with my work, citing all my colleagues who were so bent out of shape that they were declaring all their work being done in the 37 hour work week. I refused to do it.\n\nEventually, I was put on a PIP. Long story short, I failed, so I was asked to attend an HR interview citing my suitability for the role and discussion of continued employment. I filled a formal grievance at work and told them that I had no option but to resign due to the unreasonable mismanagement of workload. \n\nIt took about 3 months but I was going down the constructive dismissal route. I didn't know what I was doing and was taking bits of advice from here and there. One day, HR called up and on a conference call, asked me if we could come to an agreement. In short, I settled for £12,000 and a standard reference.",

Put you in super secret double PIP?\n\n\"Hey, I see my PIP got extended, I'd like to understand what that means? Does it mean I have made enough progress or that I haven't?\"\n\nI will also say - as a reminder, PIPs are about having the right proof for being able to fire someone for ~~cause~~ a valid reason (thanks comment below for the correction). Its basically saying \"we were very clear about what you needed to do, And you didn't do it so we're firing you\".\n\nIf they put you on a PIP and then they fire you even if you did everything they asked you to do, then they're opening themselves up to a lawsuit.\n\nSo I would maybe read up a bit on PIPs and also make sure that if things look shady (i.e., if you're actually doing good at your job but they're trying to fire you for cause when they should instead be laying you off), that you figure out what recourse you have.",

By far, the most common reason is that your manager didn't collect enough supporting data to support firing you, if you choose to sue.  For example, you should have gotten a written summary of every 1:1 with your manager since the PIP began. If not, they may want to allow for more time to get better documentation.\n\nYou don't need documentation to close the PIP without firing you.  All your manager has to say is \"u/linkthecat's performance has been acceptable and I want to close the PIP.\"  Boom, done.\n\nThe fact that it's extended most likely means that your manager still wants to get rid of you, but HR is blocking it.\n\nThere are chances that your manager said \"they seem to be improving, but I need more time\". This happens, but it's unusual, simply because PIPs are unpleasant for the manager and they're unlikely to want to extend them.  \n\nIt's also possible that they're waiting to get your replacement.  That happens, but it's less likely, simply because it's better to be a little short-handed than to keep a bad performer around.  Besides, if your performance is bad enough to warrant a PIP, you're probably not contributing much, anyway.",

I think that the companies that hyper-fixate on not hiring junior engineers and using AI as a quick fix will die. I include Amazon, Meta, maybe even Google in this list, for the sole reason that outside of AI you can probably count the new service or major product launches that any average person has heard of from any of them on one hand. It's all a crux to keep the share price high, at a time where MBA's seem to be ruling tech.\n\nWhat I can see happening is a company or two, maybe more emerging, and eating their lunch. It might be an innovation in search, a social network that dooms Facebook and Instagram, a marketplace that dominates the market, or maybe even something totally new. They'll look at how directionless big tech is, and they'll build something great from a hoard of juniors with respectful senior leadership. Those companies will be what people aspire to work for, relegating FAANG to Boomer Tech.\n\nUltimately, engineers don't *need* to be employed. They could build something, or they could make their own luck. A shift in the stock market and a downturn in tech might be enough for VC's to think that big tech has had its day, and for them to invest elsewhere - causing a shift towards new tech.",

Job posting requirements are usually a wish list for the perfect candidate and should be treated as such. The person hired almost never meets all the requirements.\n\nThat said, yeah, if you’re self taught or even a bootcamp grad the market is not going to be a kind place for you right now. Part of a good hiring process is about reducing risk. Generally, for entry level positions, candidates with CS degrees are stronger hires than non-CS degree candidates. There’s still strong candidates in both groups, but their tend to be fewer really terrible candidates who have a CS degree since many of them were flushed out in college.\n\nRight now there’s a lot of candidates with CS degrees looking for jobs, so most companies don’t have a ton of incentive to look in that more risky pool of candidates.\n\nAs someone who broke into the industry over a decade ago with no degree, I really do wish I had something better to tell you, but honestly, that’s just where the market is at right now.\n\nThe best advice I can give you is:\n\n- Dont let the CS degree requirement in a job posting deter you from applying. If you feel like you can do the job and you meet 60%-70% of the requirements, just apply. Realize it’s a long shot and don’t get your hopes up, but it doesn’t hurt to shoot off a resume. You never know.\n\n- You need to focus on getting your foot in the door anywhere. Focus on smaller companies that aren’t “tech” companies. You need to get a job on your resume that says “developer”, “software engineer”, or something like that. Remember what I said earlier about risk? If you can show that someone else paid you for a year to be a developer, that tells other companies that, on some level, you can do the job, which reduces risk. Again, I realize you’re probably applying to just about anything you can, but I want to emphasize that if your goal is really to break into the industry then you should prioritize getting experience in the field on your resume above all else.",

Maybe the goals aren't to get to \"the next levels\", but you'll need to have goals nevertheless. Doesn't mean they need to force you to write 15 SMART goals with metrics and everything, but still.\n\nCompanies that do career ladders well will have a concept of \"career role\" or \"terminal\" role. That's the place you need to get to if you want to stay there forever. At most companies that do this, that's a mid to high senior level.\n\nThat means that until you are at that mid to high senior, a part of your job is to get better until you are. That means goals and progress. If you don't want to do that, you're out.\n\nOnce you get to the terminal level, things get a bit more nuanced. You no longer need to work toward your next promotion. You can say \"I'll be a senior my entire life\". If you're ok with that and won't complain if all you get are cost of living adjustments, and never get to Staff/Principal, that's fine. But you still need to have goals and move forward. \n\nWhy? Skill inflation. Someone who was a high senior in 2010 isn't the same as someone in 2020. The world changes, technologies change, there's more resources, like AI. So the bar is continually raising. To stay at the same \"level\" as everyone else relatively, you have to keep growing, else you're going backward. That's why there's some level of age discrimination: when you're young you're kind of at the bar by default because you didn't have time to regress. But as you get older, if you don't keep up, you fall behind. And a lot of people do.\n\nThe goals you set are there to make sure you stay at the bar. As a mid to high senior your job is more than just taking a ticket and executing, too. You'll be tasked with doing project work, collaboration, etc, and those become goals too, in addition to learning, coaching, and various other responsibilities at that level.\n\nBut if you want to come in at work, look at Jira/Linear, pick the ticket at the top of the queue, write the code, open a pull request, pick the next ticket, and repeat until its time to go home... I'm sorry to say, but fewer and fewer companies are willing to pay for that. Many never did.",

Orosz is the author of the fantastic newsletter Pragmatic Engineer and he's assembled a lot of his wisdom into this fantastic book. It's broken out into sections for each level of engineering, so you'd definitely get a lot of mileage out of it.\n\n\\- Fundamentals of Software Architecture by Mark Richards and Neal Ford. This is a little more advanced, and you probably wouldn't need the last third that talks more about selling your architectural vision, but it's a great overview of the different kinds of distributed architectures you'll encounter in the wild.\n\n\\- A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout. Really quick read and an implied rebuttal to Clean Code by Bob Martin. I really enjoyed this one and it provides a good framework for how to think when writing code.\n\nThe reason I've read way too many software books is because I host a podcast called Book Overflow ([YouTube link here](https://www.youtube.com/@BookOverflowPod), but we're on every major platform) where each week my co-host and I read and discuss a new tech book. We've done episodes on all the books I've listed, and have even interviewed every one of their authors! If you don't have time to read the whole books, you might get a lot of insight from just listening to the episodes!",

Always got fantastic reviews, sales soared, everything golden. \n\nThen after COVID and work from home, my manager started riding me over every little thing. I had been given tons of independence up to that point because our sales were so great and because my manager honestly didn’t know exactly what it was I did. I built the entire position from scratch and my manager had no computer skills so digital marketing and data analytics were not something he could really check my work on. So as long as number went up, he let me be. \n\nI had 5 years of smooth sailing, loved the work, did a good job, etc. So it felt super out of left field when I started getting grief daily. Note that our online sales were better than ever and growing faster than ever too. The hassling got worse and worse until finally I was given an official disciplinary review for my poor performance. \n\nWanna know the craziest part? Remember how I was the ONLY employee under my manager, the one who built the entire department from scratch? Well, a week after I got that disciplinary review for poor performance, my manager won employee of the year because of his department’s outstanding performance. He got a big bonus lol. \n\nGot called in the next week for another disciplinary review where they tried to push me into a lower pay position (I already got paid well below market standard, like half) and I quit on the spot lol. Sent him all the data I had, updated all my contacts and consultants to email him going forward, sent him a text file with something like 80 or 90 usernames/passwords for the various tools, apps, etc I was handling, and just walked out. \n\nBut it’s not all bad. I got a call a year later and they were still trying to fill the position and wanted me to come back. Apparently they couldn’t find anyone who would do 3 jobs for shit pay. That was the perkiest “no” I’ve ever delivered.\n\nI don’t know the best solution in your case, but if possible you should try to get them to fire you. I was too disgusted to stay so I missed out on a lot of benefits. But that was the best decision for me. You gotta find the best solution for you. Best of luck!",

You are witnessing the new manager being forced to come up with a way to either increase productivity to make more money, force people (e.g. you leave on your own) out ideally without making their unemployment insurance go up, or fire people. If they can get any one of those three scenarios it's a win in their book. They probably haven't put you on a PIP because they don't have strong enough grounds to.\n\nI'd be looking for another job anyways I'd take this as a sign the company may not be doing well and even if you don't get let go soon it might happen later because the division / company goes under.",

If you weren't \"getting it\" odds are there are some structural problems in your QA department that have nothing to do with you. The only thing you may be able to improve on is taking charge and being more self sufficient when it comes to bringing value to your work, but that's more of a mindset you have to work on vs some technical ability",

Lottery tickets are discretionary spending despite what gambling addicts believe. When you apply for a job, you're actively seeking a new income source. Apples and oranges.\n\n> After over 200 applications to MLE and data scientist positions (even data analyst roles that I’m clearly overqualified for), I’ve only been met with rejection or ghosting.\n\nEven before universities had specific graduate programs targeting Data Science / Machine Learning (so before 2019 lets say), it was very challenging to find a position where you fucked with models/charts, tweaked parameters, and performed EDA all day. And this was peak Data Science mania hiring among corporate leadership -- Data Science was the GenAI before GenAI existed from ~2016 through 2019. Sounds great right? Except boy do I know a ***ton*** of people in that space who got laid off between 2020 and 2022 so lets set the nostalgic rose-colored glasses down.\n\n> Both of these times, the recruiters have been enthusiastic to hear about my experience, and often praise my resume and my accomplishments.\n\nThe fundamental challenge for Data Science / Machine Learning roles is an organization will need 1, maybe 2, of that type of skillset for every ~500 run-of-the-mill software engineers that they need to build software products. Maybe closer to 1 every 30 if you're a highly specialized quant firm or something. This is very specialized labor, for a very specialized purpose, and orgs just don't need that many of them relative to other roles.\n\nIf you're looking exclusively in NYC, or for fully remote positions, you may very well be competing with the absolute cream of the crop top-tier candidates. NYC is an extremely competitive market -- lots of people. You could even be one of those top-tier candidates, but when there's 20 other candidates who are lets say within ~10% of each other in terms of performance and team fit coming out of an interview, what the manager had for breakfast the day of the interview could be a significant contributing factor to which candidate gets hired. The candidate that got hired instead of you doesn't necessarily need to be \"god tier\".\n\nSo, some practical advice:\n\n1. Increase your volume of applications\n2. Target different markets/sectors. ~80% of your applications in finance, but no bites? Try energy, medical devices / medicine, ad tech -- you get the idea.",

Back then, there was no AI, so only way to clear doubts were either ask and get humiliated by sr. dev or ask and get humilated on stack overflow by egoMaxxers. I was really questioning whether I am even suited for CS and should I give up.\n\nFast forward 5 years, and I am the best performing eng. in my org (not according to myself lol).\n\nHang in there. Also, I would suggest leverage AI when you need help (not to code, but to learn)\n\nGood devs are plenty, good mentors are rare.",

Even though, ostensibly, they have junior and intern level openings, they usually can't afford to use those as more than seasonal positions for specific deliverables. So it's really not uncommon for a fiscal quarter to approach and for them to lay off staff to compensate for venture capital shortfalls or profitability overestimates.\n\nAnother thing is that junior and intern level staff are a drain on precious resources the start-up cannot afford to bleed out. So, even though they do hire newer programmers, they're *hoping* they can get a new mid or potential leadership candidate for minimal cost. They usually can afford to keep rolling that slot machine every few seasons. So start-ups and consultancies are (often but not always) incredibly hard places to start out, despite their need to hire to appeal to investors or receive grants for training.",

A cert that is not worthless is PMP to be a product owner where your coding background would be appreciated. I think you should check that out.\n\n>I am currently enrolled in GA Techs Online Masters in Cybersecurity in my 2nd semester (my job is also paying for it)\n\nGeorgia Tech is good prestige but a Cybersecurity degree is low value. Cybersecurity is work experience and you can get hired with a CS or engineering degree. Not paying for it so not a big deal. Another nice thing for your accomplishments. I'd prefer the OMSCS degree here.\n\n>I've been considering back-up careers like being an Actuary, Accountant or something in Supply-Chain management (anything but healthcare) But with everything going on, i'm just so unsure.\n\nYou're gainfully employed and seemingly in no fear of layoff or PIP with all that money spent on you. Stay where you are. Can think about a tangential position like product owner I mentioned. You can become an Actuary after passing 1 exam without needing another degree but I don't know what the job market or pay is like. Better be good at math and statistics.",

I don't have a clearance, so I can't speak to the cleared side, but in public trust realm, I have not loved government contracting. There's no one specific thing I can really point to because all of my experiences have been so different. I'll just that that I enjoyed working the private sector and even state government's more.\n\nOne benefit of working for government contractors though is job is kind of expected, so after you get a few years of experience under your belt, you have lots of opportunities to get a new job with a big pay bump. And if you land in a shithole, you can usually find an exit by just being open to new opportunities on linkedIn.\n\nAs for the weather, yeah summers can be swampy. DC was literally built on a swamp. It's not the most humid place I've been, but it's close. The other thing is if you are from a place that gets real winter, we have no idea what to do in snow. We talk about snow storms that the midwest would barely register as storms, like hurricanes. A couple of inches of snow at rush hour can cripple our roadways. To be fair, so can rain, and clear skies...basically, whatever the weather, someone infront of you has never seen it before and is freaking out.\n\nDriving here is also pretty terrible in general. We collect the world's worst drivers and put them on overcrowded roads. The metro is fine. I used it when I worked in DC. I didn't love it when I had to drive to the Vienna station, pay for parking and then ride into the city. I've never did that math, but I do wonder is I should have just paid for parking downtown. \n\nThe cost of living is also quite high. Rent and house prices have been obscene since the 90s. Laidoff federal workers choosing to leave might make a difference, but it will be relatively small.\n\nOn the other hand, the public schools tend to be good, and because we have so many bored government workers around, there are more types of recreation than you would think. The choice of activities I have within an hour of my house is insane. They're all crowded, and none of them are world class, but still, if I want to take up a hobby outside my house, there's some place relatively close where I can go. \n\nTL;DR; NoVa is fine. I can't argue for it over any of the other locations you mentioned. Truth be told, if my wife had an opportunity in Chicago and wanted to move closer to here family, I'd probably be excited about the move.",

CS is overcrowded and accumulating work experience looks better than any advanced degree. If you get PIPed/fired/laid off, an MS can make sense. Else go for free while working when your employer pays for it. Though the only employer I know that pays is the US government.\n\n>I make only $40k/year.\n\nWell that is shit pay. MS program looking better now all of a sudden. MS \"resets\" to look again for internships and move up. UMD isn't elite tier but it's decent like you're saying.\n\nI guess you can argue this either way. You could very well have no job at graduation and be in serious debt, or you could jump up to fair pay.\n\nI don't know why you would go through applying for an MS application without applying to new CS jobs. In normal cost of living, $60k base salary for entry level is low but not terrible. At 3 YoE, you're above entry level and therefore have less competition but can still apply for it. Then OMSCS at Georgia Tech is online and legit and very cheap. No funding other than beer money by being a TA after your first year.",

Current AI probably can't automate the entire job, but within 5 years it definitely will. \n\n\nUnfortunately, IT is probably going to have salaries cut massively because of AI as well. More work will go to fewer specialists, and given that VCs and BoDs don't value IT as much as they should up until this point, that problem will get worse. I'd even say IT will probably become an hourly-wage job, with FTE reserved for those heavy hitters that got there before shit hit the fan.\n\n\nMy recommendation would be cyber security. You have enough experience to justify FTE and probably know enough details to be able to excel at the role, both from a programmatic and aw technical standpoint. Those jobs simply cannot be automated away by AI anytime soon, as the role focuses on the security risks of code, regardless of where the code comes from. You'd need to complete a number of certifications and maybe reskill a bit for the basics, but that would be what I would say to a new grad or someone entering college right now. \n\n\nEdit: the downvotes represent people who are unwilling to see reality for what it is. AI is coming for all our jobs, by the simple fact that the billionaires (ya know, the people driving industry) are spending collective trillions to make it happen. In the immediate, our jobs will be taken, and offshored. In the future, the roles will simply disappear, more work to fewer people. ",

The issue isn't you - it's that there are hundreds of qualified candidates competing for every single position, and sometimes the difference between getting an offer and getting rejected comes down to factors completely outside your control.\n\nTaking the master's program isn't admitting defeat - it's making a strategic move to ride out this market downturn and emerge even stronger. You'll have more time to build projects, potentially get internship experience, and most importantly, you'll be graduating when the market has hopefully recovered. The skills you've built this year won't disappear, and the interview experience you've gained is invaluable. Your family supports you because they see what you've accomplished despite impossible odds, not because they pity you.\n\nI'm on the team that built [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat), and we created it specifically because we know how challenging these technical interviews can be, especially when you're already dealing with the stress of a tough job market and need that extra edge to stand out among so many qualified candidates.",

You’re drowning and the first thing to do is to give yourself some air. My suggestion would be to start by carving out some time for mental decompression every day - it can be something as simple as taking 15-20 mins everyday for a walk or workout or just sitting and staring out the window. But no phones, no emails, no bringing a family member along to make this time about them- this is your time to spend some time with yourself so that you can process your own emotions.\n\nNext, I’d focus on the positives of the situation. To me, it looks like things may not be as bad as they seem - to you it feels like everyone is weighing down on you, but in reality everyone is probably as stressed as you are and they are just passing that along to you, as they are to everyone. Second, no matter how bad it seems, it’s a temporary situation and it will change. It feels like the end of the world right now because you are in the eye of the storm, but it will pass. Have faith in that if it feels like everything else is failing.\n\nYour employability may also be better than you feel. Even if it’s a niche industry, I’m sure there are skills you have that are transferable, and there may be opportunities in places you haven’t looked, like sister industries and customers where they may not be doing exactly what you are doing but your expertise could be valuable. It might be worth reaching out to mentors in the industry to figure out your blind spots in terms of employability.\n\nHope it works out, and remember, this too shall pass",

There is really no movement right now due to some policy things Cheeto Caligula is doing.  \n\nDo be fair, I'm not at my best right now due to stress, and my coping mechanisms aren't working for once. I think the big thing I struggle with is that when they switched to doing daily huddles rather than bi-weekly project updates, it felt like every employee was getting grilled in their work and I've had to push stats to appease them that weren't true to keep the peace and then work weekends to make it up.  I'll be honest about it, but I don't think that's going to save me.\n\nI get this feeling in my chest it's all going down hill and I can't peddle fast enough to prevent it.

That's why it's called a \"job search\", you're searching for the right job.\n\nIf you're barely getting interviews at all, and this startup was your 1 and only opportunity you've had in months, you'd be crazy to turn it down.\n\nIt all comes down to how you're doing in your job search. There are people out there who have done hundreds of applications over the course of several months who would die for that chance. But there's also people out there that are getting interviews just fine that probably wouldn't bother.\n\nOne thing I will add is don't make up your mind from online reviews. Always make up your mind based on first-hand evidence after talking with your hiring manager, and some SWE's you'd be working with. The reverse interview is the most important part of the interview.\n\nYou never know, maybe the vibes you get from this startup are completely different once you actually talk to them. Things constantly change, especially in the startup world, and places like Glassdoor tend to attract people that have things to complain about so it always skews negative.\n\nOne startup I was interviewing had a bunch of negative reviews saying it was a boys club, and if you weren't buddy buddy with the CEO you would never get good raises or promotions. When I actually spoke with people at the company, thats not the vibe I got at all, so I joined despite those reviews. I'm extremely glad I did. I bet those reviews were just from salty employees bad at their job, because I'm the last person to be \"buddy buddy\" with anyone at work, especially the CEO, but I got amazing raises and several promotions. I've had 2 of the biggest raises of my career at that company.\n\nSo I'd encourage you at least humor it, and walk into it with good intentions. If when you speak to these people its as terrible as what you've read say, *then* you can reject them.",

If so, you’ll need to honestly explore your thinking behind that expectation and adjust accordingly. “Expectations are premeditated resentments” - this applies to your career, job, education, professional relationships, everything. If you go into it determined to get something specific out of it, you’re probably going to be disappointed. But if you go into it knowing more about what challenges you are likely to face (exposed by the discouraging articles and posts), you’ll be able to spend more time preparing to face them instead of just trying to hit arbitrary benchmarks you think should get you a job (such as leetcode grinding for x hours every day/week, knowing certain languages/frameworks, which degree you get, etc)\n\nModal of the story - do you WANT to pursue this career path? If it was as “easy” to do as any other job you’re already qualified for, and paid at least a living wage, would you still want to do it? If the answer is yes, start thinking about the scary stories and predictions as clickbait and YOU DO YOU BOO",

Account for that since this is a learning experience you will not be in an out in 40 hours. Dedicate this time to just learning what you dont know. Do your best not to get too frustrated with yourself if you don't understand something. Practice reading code. This is such a separate skill from writing code. Given that you are junior it may or may not be clear what things are learnable via self teaching and what things are specific to your job/team/company that you just wouldn't know if someone didn't tell you. I wasted a lot of time trying to deduce what was going on when a lot of my lack of understanding was about things I couldn't have possibly known and just needed someone to tell me. Try to find a few mentors on your team that you can ask these questions to. No person is an island in software engineering. ",

If you’re not getting job experience (which feels like one of the only things on your resume that actually matters), I don’t think it’s a bad idea at all to start training for a potentially different field.\n\nUnfortunately though I’m not sure how much safer EE really is. EE has been plagued by excessive outsourcing the same as CS has for years. The nature of the work makes it easy to just outsource a specific project, get a working design and never talk to the designer again. Additionally I’m not convinced it’s immune to LLMs taking over, although it won’t happen as quickly as CS since it’s not just pure text that needs to be spit out. \n\nThat said if you’re financially able to potentially work contract jobs or spend some time developing skills, it’s not that bad of an idea. I don’t want to discourage you cause I understand how you feel exactly, but there’s something to be said about working in a field you’re passionate about. On one hand it’s obviously more fulfilling, but on the other hand you risk burnout and losing something that could have been a lifelong hobby or passion. I work on electronics repair and stuff as a hobby with most of my free time. I don’t think it will ever turn out to be a job, but I don’t mind IT and it keeps me afloat.",

It's mostly a lose-lose proposition for them at the point where you've already left and began work for their client. If the company also had some kind of non-solicitation agreement with your agency, that's not really _your_ problem.\n\nI was in a similar position to you and the non-solicitation clause did not prevent me from joining the client company (a global 500).

In-person career fairs are how I got all my opportunity.\n\nHalf the CS advice is wrong because it's by students and cosplayers who never got hired in CS.\n\nOn your own time, you can learn tech stacks. Is a reasonable idea. Recruiters don't care about and won't look at your GitHub. I have never listed mine. If you can hold a conversation and talk through the programming language and common software it uses, you're in good shape. You still have to get to the interview stage and the #1 way to help that is land an internship. At this point, your grades matter. Competition is fierce. Be willing to relocate and sublease.\n\nMost jobs are in 1 of C# or Java or TypeScript/JavaScript, with Python for support. Learn a database such as Postgres and writing CRUD to it. I'd hope your classes cover this. Don't try to learn everything. Look at job descriptions and see what they ask for. You don't need 30/30 requirements but a few are mandatory.

The summer is almost over and bigger companies will begin opening their 2026 summer internship roles. Start applying. Go to career fairs, school events, and as much as I hate it, cold network with the occasional LinkedIn recruiter. It works sometimes. Your opportunity to find an internship only expires when May 2026 hits, so literally just start right now. Internships are the best thing you can do as an undergrad.\n\n2. Projects. Yes, I always hated when people said that. 'Just learn'. Not that easy, especially when you get trapped in tutorial hell. Follow a couple of tutorials and then try to make something on your own. Go find a 'To-Do' list tutorial if you want to do web development, go find a course if there's something specific you want to learn.\n\nI didn't do anything...I mean ANYTHING until I was already a junior and I think I'm fine. Go network, apply for internships (or apprenticeships or fellowships or whatever) and follow some tutorials.",

Now your ability to social with the team, appearance, hygiene (for some people), just showing up to business events is called into question. \n\nThat’s before we get to the studies that show commuting even 40 minutes reduces job satisfaction significantly enough that you’d have to earn nearly double to be just as happy. With other studies from Sean Achors research on happiness that show the happier the staff, the more productive. So, what immediately happens is you’re more likely to fail onsite. Because you have to maintain a lot for your mood.\n\nIf those things are ok, then you have to deal with those who struggle to socialise outside of work and tend to like the office from the social aspect. By that I mean, they think this is the place to get all their social fill and interrupt, talk about shit I don’t care about, gossip, and generally make the day worse purely for their own benefit. \n\nThat’s if they’re not disrupting you, there’s equal studies from the nords on the open office plan being cancer for focus. \n\nAnyways, that’s how I feel about it. When you’re onsite, suddenly your requirements expand 10 fold. \n\n— worked remote for 8 years, also been on site for 8 years prior. \n\nThat’s just my opinion though.

But TBH, unless you’re in a HCOL city, on site is a scam in a lot of ways. \n\nI thought as remote work became more common, that there would be a race to the bottom for salaries. And while salaries have dropped (anyone in a senior position try to lateral lately? Good luck), you’re still finding remote roles paying way more than on site roles for people in LCOL, even MCOL areas. \n\nThe only reasonable thing that I can conclude is that these on site companies are looking for desperate people, or warm bodies. Because they know they’d never get a talented senior who can get $160k in a remote role, offering $100k and mandating a daily commute. \n\nYou seem to really want to be in management, so I’m not going to bash you for your decision. But I would choose the remote role 100/100.",
