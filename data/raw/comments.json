Handling a collision at write time would mean shifting the entire array in memory.\n\nAnd if you are pre-allocating the memory for collisions, even if you account only for one you are basically doubling the size of the table. And if you have another collision beyond the pre-allocation and to avoid array shifting you are storing it in the next available collision slot to leverage linear reading, you are then negating the benefits of the prefetch if you're unable to find a free collision slot in the prefetched data.\n\nIf the implementation falls into any of the above, I can only assume this implementation would only yield any real world benefits exclusively in tables that you almost never write to, which you did mention indeed, but I'm not sure how often you stumble upon such cases and how big these tables tend to be in practice to warrant a higher performance algorithm for joining them.\n\nSuper cool research nonetheless, kudos to you!",

You're correct that this stack is overengineered for *a simple case* of anomaly detection.\n\n>Could you have achieved the same outcome with far fewer dependencies/failure points?\n\nAbsolutely. A very simple, yet very error-prone, stack could be: direct DB writes + Postgres + pg\\_cron/cron + dashboard.\n\n>What could you scale to with a far simpler stack?\n\nThat simple stack can handle tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of events per minute. The real problem is not just the raw throughput, but the architectural fragility. This is tightly coupled and brittle, and has other issues apart from scalability:\n\n* Adding another consumer requires us to change the existing architecture/code\n* DB failure causes data loss and downstream reporting failures\n* Schedulers like pg\\_cron/cron lack automatic retries and timeouts\n\n>Would this stack you have built be required for the typical workloads you'd be working with in a real system?\n\nYes. These patterns are fundamental to high-volume data platforms. I've chosen each component to solve specific problems that emerge with high data volumes, complex workflow orchestration, and advanced processing requirements, though not all of them may be required in every case.\n\nThank you for your feedback.

Take every opportunity to learn. Take online courses and build things. I became a DE by taking a bunch of courses, presenting a business case that transitioning to DE software could save us money, and building it. Now I use it to solve every problem I can to build my skills. I even did the courses on the clock to meet my company's yearly training time goal.\n\nYou mentioned contractors, you may not have a senior employee, but those contractors know more than you. Hire them to do the things you don't know how to do, and then have them teach you. Include it in the SOW as \"knowledge transfer\" or \"support time\". This is literally how I learned a bunch of Azure products. Now the next time that task comes up, you know how to do it, and you don't have to hire the contractor.\n\nLastly, get a project manager. Make the case that you can't be in meetings AND be building stuff, and that having a PM will save you on contractor costs by letting you build more things yourself.\n\nLeverage your company for your personal growth, it's a win-win.",

It seems to me that Spark features in \"big\" (for a varying definition of \"big\") projects and platforms a lot. Polars seems to feature in smaller projects and platforms a lot. Postgres seems to feature in older, more RDBMS-driven architectures a lot too. But this isn't a stack, just \"some things I've seen\".\n\nI am not experienced enough to *really* say, but I can propose a \"hot-take\" theory of why this is. I am not myself very confident in this, again. But the argument goes like this:\n\nA standard stack in our industry will not be possible without a standard stack in web/backend. Fundamentally, data is a byproduct of a company's main business at first. A company may become \"data mature\" or \"data driven\" by converting this byproduct into a core loop of the business, in fact even its moat, but no one starts a company with \"data driven\". When you're starting a company, you can build software that will become your moat, but you can't \"build data\". In effect, I think by the time a company starts even thinking about data engineers, it is already stuck with some existing and effectively immutable architectural components, and our systems must use tooling that plays nice with those. So until these upstream components become standardized (e.g. the SQL/noSQL war in OLTP land finishes definitively, REST is fully replaced by gRPC, etc) - our systems won't.",

Staging is for validating new changes prior to prod deployment, and is only used when we have a pipeline change on the way. We compare partitions generated from prod and staging, get sign off, and deploy. If something is critically wrong we can rollback, and backfill is usually an option if really needed.\n\nIn general, it helps having a model where your most upstream tables are permissive with regards to fields (e.g. avoiding white listing or overly strict schema assertions) and involve minimal/no transformations. Then any downstream changes can always be deployed and rerun against these without data loss, only cost is compute. ",

It's just that most data projects don't need this scaling and would benefit more from the speed and strong guarantees of an OLTP, as understood by Duck Lake.",

I keep an eye on MS Teams during the rest of the \"core hours\" but unless there is an emergency or late meeting, I'm done for the day.\n\n\\> If you have core hours, how many hours and what times typically?\n\nLoose rules here. \"Just be somewhat available during 9 to 5 and make your meetings\" is how things are mostly treated.\n\n\\> How much does your schedule get disrupted by production issues or urgent requests?\n\nIt doesn't. I'm not paid to be on-call so I'm not on-call.\n\n\\> Does your company/team culture actually support flexible schedules or is it more lip service?\n\nA bit of both. Flexible enough but they would certainly like it if it was more traditional. People got too comfortable with flex schedules during COVID and now they can't go back without like mass firing and hiring new people and my industry is niche enough where that is too much of a headache for them.\n\n\\> How does meeting culture affect your flexibility (lots of standups, stakeholder meetings, etc.)?\n\nI have 4 meetings a week most of the time which is nothing.\n\n\\>**Background context:** I'm considering transitioning into data engineering and schedule flexibility is important to me. I'd love to hear from people at different types of companies. Thanks for sharing your experiences!\n\nDo not pick a field for the schedule.

It’s possible that the offshore resources will be entirely replaced with AI coding. It’s also possible that companies will demand generalized data professionals (kimball, analytical engineering, master data management, etc) and then those generalized people will just instruct AI to build solutions in the technology of the year. If this starts to become the trend, then you’ll no longer need to keep up with mastering what language or platform is the yearly favorite and focus more on implementing value - how to ensure AI assisted code generation is working successfully at your company. This would be a very interesting and disruptive time to be a data professional! (If it happens)\n\n\n——————————-\n\n\nOne of the things I’m keeping my eye on is whether companies start switching develops each time management attends a conference and decides to change their stack. To be clear - I’m not seeing it now - but here’s the scenario I’m looking out for. \n\n\n1) outsource DE to India. \n2) hire X dev’s with current stack\n3) management changes mind on stack\n4) replace current India team with new India team who know new stack\n5) repeat yearly, each time manager attends conference\n\nThis catches my attention because of 1) the current trend of tools changing quickly, 2) the enormous availability of cheap labor offshore. \n\nKeep in mind, if managers want to do this, they will have no issue finding offshore bodies to fill roles.\n\nSo - as an onshore senior/lead Im happy I’m deep into a business domain (subject matter expert) and would be needed for more then my coding skills. \n\nIf you are worried about this scenario you might start by asking how you can fit into this paradigm. If a company won’t hire you because you are not a 10 year expert on an acronym that was invented 2 months ago - then can you fit into a leadership/guidance position to enable “hot swappable” developers? I point back to the other comment in this thread - do you know Kimball? Do you know business processes, business data, and how to mature raw data into actionable insights which can reduce cost and increase revenue? If the answer is yes, you will likely be ok. If the answer is if no - I just know SSIS and I really can’t do anything unless my team lead holds my hand - then I would set some goals for career development.",

If Flink was as bad as  in your case suggests no serious company would consider it.\n\nSince you use it for stream processing you very likely partition the input using keyBy(). Make sure that cardinality of the key value is finite as state is kept by key. E.g. if you keyBy eventID which is uuid, job state will grow indefinitely.\nAlternatively setup a timer to cleanup the state manually.\nIf you use FlinkQSL it's rather easy to miss such things as you need to think in terms of unbound streams rather than in terms of db tables.\n\nRegarding rewriting your stream processing job in Go (or any other language). Writing stream processing job is not that difficult. Writing stream processing job that is fault tolerant, can scale beyond single machine, supports SQL to write logic, makes checkpoints, holds state for longer than your Kafka retention period, guarantees exactly-once processing etc etc etc is more of a challenge. Think twice\n\nWhy do you think Flink exists if everyone could just write their stream jobs? But maybe your organization does not have the challanges Flink supposed to address. Then Flink could indeed be an overkill.",

See how they handled files with no or limited structure like fixed width or CSV. These are old formats so one would expect there to be a solution, but there isn't a good one yet.

But it's only structuring views and tables, not translating tables, views, relationships and columns into their business equivalent concepts.  \n\nSomething like Cube allows you to copy your data model in such a way that it will dynamically generate SQL based on the user's selected dimensions and metrics.  It governs your metrics and definitions since the user only has to select the metrics and columns they want, not recreate the formulas and joins themselves.  They just drag and drop from a selection of objects that equate to their business concepts.  Not all implementations are equal of course, but this is generally the capabilities I see with most tools calling themselves a \"semantic layer\".\n\nIs Dremio working toward adding that capability as well?

In all fairness the few times I have used ssis at work, I have it a shot initially when he asked me to, I put the packages in my own GitHub repo.  Not it’s good that I have a version but I brought up that that’s just my copy from dev. I can’t see what’s on production. I’m not saying that I want or need production level access but I’d a real pipeline where there is some tangible proof that my dev package went to production aside from him saying he copied it to production. It would also be great for him in case something goes wrong with a new update then he can roll a package back to the previous working version.\n\n\nOverall I get your point and it’s valid and I know I get sucked up in the python vs ssis argument because that’s what started everything and I’ve felt that my dba outright didn’t listen to some of my concerns because I wasn’t doing things his way.

I’ve tried to offset this by saying that my team has and is being other Python devs and he told me himself that he doesn’t really have anyone very skilled to maintain his ssis packages. These days most people come to my team for help because we can get projects done faster with Python and he doesn’t get many requests anymore.  I feel as though he is scared of change but I honestly can’t say that for sure. I also feel like he is secretly mad at my boss for our team jsut using python without his sign off and I understand that but that wasn’t my decision. It’s truly a wierd situation to be in and I’ve tried to talk to him and I keep trying to but I’m not sure how to break through or get everyone in a room to settle their differences",

Assuming the magnitudes here are roughly typical. You could write script to identify peaks and valleys by magnitude and then flag the start/end as the valley in-between peaks or the peak and surroundimg X ms as the window, depending on how much dead space is between and what is more representative. I would do this based on magnitude of all 6 metrics, as x/y/z will peak at slightly different times. And find the mean/median of the peak timestamps.\n\nIf you are hand flagging I would recommend switching your plots to plotly so you have tooltips telling you th exact timestamp.",

But when you want them, they're very useful indeed. \n\nTo begin with, without multi-table transactions, to try to emulate them, you end up implementing compensating transactions:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/compensating-transaction\n\nWhich are difficult to get right, are eventually consistent (meaning, in the interim the inconsistent state is visible, and no guarantee on how fast your comlensating transaction will succeed, and generally just are a pain. They don't add value or spark joy. \n\nThere are also other features that are a lot easier to add to an engine once you have full ACID support. \n\nFor example, zero copy cloning a table - the copies can be modified independently, without data duplication for the shared parts:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/tutorial-clone-table-portal\n\nOr having a transactionally consistent snapshot across tables, instead of trying to use Delta time travel to achieve it:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/warehouse-snapshot\n\nIsolation wise, we get true snapshot isolation within the engine - queries via the Warehouse either see changes in no tables or all. The individual logs aren't written perfectly simultaneously though, so Delta log consumers benefit from that less, but still some - can see some parts of a multi-table committed transactions sooner maybe, but is guaranteed it's part of a committed transaction, not potentially part of an emulated multi table transaction that failed and will have a compensating transaction trying to cover it up sometime later.\n\nPerformance, we can potentially batch up multiple transactions into a Delta log entry. We have a nice fast transaction log, instead of relatively slow block blob storage operations being required on every individual commit.\n\nLocking, iirc, mostly the same - could maybe support pessimistic locking though, which iirc Delta can't. But paper probably says for sure.",

But in Synapse SQL Serverless, it also had responsibility for the distributed aspects of query optimization (somewhat similar to the \"Chrysalis\" split query optimization Synapse SQL Dedicated had before that). \nThat's completely overhauled in Fabric Warehouse in favor of Unified Query Optimization:\nhttps://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626246.3653369\n\nWe also took Batchmode query execution as seen in Synapse SQL Dedicated, SQL Server, etc. But it's even faster. \n\nOn top of that we have several significant additional big improvements coming down the pipeline. I'm pretty sure several of them will get papers eventually, but don't know anything concrete on that front off the top of my head.

But, it's a massive investment, and 3 years in we're still working on adding components that our manager estimated we'd have done in the first 6 months.\n\nIf you don't need that, its good, but get documentation of your code, your sql tables, try and centralise into a single semantic model if you can (short of data warehousing).  But the one thing that we keep running into with people creating their own dashboards is that they change the queries, they're no longer performant, take forever, use more resources, and they're reloading and recalculating the same details x 10 different queries in a power bi dashboard x 10 dashboards.\n\nSo, consolidation - if you can at least run the data out to a table, and then have any dashboards read from that table, then you'll be saving yourself.\n\nTry to source control your dashboards.\n\nIf you're using PBI online, if you can use things like datasets, that centralise the data, go for it.\n\nStored Procedures may give you more centralised control, semantic models are more or less exactly what you're creating in PowerBI anyway (source -> dim/fact tables + relationships + measures).\n\nCreating a centralised semantic model/warehouse that has all of your tables and data in one place, that you write your code and measures and everything once will definitely allow you to reuse it multiple times and is a big win.",

I’m coming from a DBA/SSIS/sql-heavy background though, and those approaching from a more software engineering background will likely recommend different approaches based on their favorite tech stack and their CI/CD and version control preferences.\n\nI’m not a big fan of text-to-sql or promptql-style approaches mainly because I feel like that’s something that should be more for data exploration and presented to the end user rather than a way to streamline your reporting pipeline - all my opinion though, I just don’t like that added layer of abstraction from data when I’m thinking about robust data processes.",

So a validation of website format would be one view, returning 0 rows if everything is correct. Each problem is one row, then. I would probably use SQL UDFs if I needed to abstract one piece of logic for multiple views, but that doesn't happen really with our data. \n\nThe views all follow a consistent approach with common column names etc, then I have a process that collects and merges records from all views. Because each view is doing just one thing, it's very performant. But the view quantity does rack up. The overall data quality measure is just count of problem rows collected that day, and count of rules with at least one problem.\n\nThere's also metadata in a special magic comment in each view (written using JSON syntax), describing why the rule is important to the business, who is responsible for keeping it empty, and how to go about clearing it. For me, that stuff is essential to maintain somewhere, because it ensures the results are actionable. This metadata is snapshotted daily to a SCD table, so business users can explore the full  \"rulebook\" for data quality independently from current extant problems. \n\nIn time I plan to have PBI send emails to every owner of problems, every day that problems exist, nagging them to fix them. 🙂",

Under the hood, NumPy typically uses C-level memory management (`malloc`/`free` or aligned variants) from the system runtime, though it also supports custom allocators.\n\nIn contrast, I expect stampdb to have lower overhead since it uses a straightforward C++ `std::vector` for memory management. By default, `std::vector` relies on the C++ allocator API, which eventually ends up at `malloc`/`free` as well. Our current plan is to provide only the thinnest wrapper around the C++ core. That said, we’re not claiming to be better than pandas in any way.",

The programming fundamentals you've built over 4 years transfer well to data engineering - you understand APIs, software architecture, and debugging which are core skills. Many data engineering tools have .NET support or similar paradigms to what you're used to. The main gaps you'll need to fill are around data pipeline orchestration (Airflow, Prefect), cloud platforms (AWS/Azure/GCP), and getting comfortable with SQL + maybe Python or Scala. Your API integration experience is actually really relevant since data engineers spend a lot of time building ETL pipelines that pull from various sources. Companies definitely value programming experience over pure data background - it's often easier to teach someone with solid dev skills about data concepts than to teach a data person how to write maintainable, scalable code. I'd suggest building a few portfolio projects that show end-to-end data pipelines and you should be competitive for junior/mid-level data engineering roles pretty quickly.",

Sit with a knowledgeable (power-)user of the system while they're working their work, ask questions, take screenshots, names of fields, quirks of the system etc. Then try to map this to tables/fields in database.\n* Source database query logs (depends on the data and compliance with regulations though): that way you can see what goes together, which tables are queried in the same calls etc.\n* Indexing: where are the indexes and how are they defined? Usually they reflect the \"primary way\" a table is accessed. By default it's an id, but significant foreign keys can also be used as index sometimes... What column they use, what are their names, usage statistics etc can all help...\n* Stratigraphy: now that one is mainly for systems with many years of lifetime... As successive generations of devs work on a database, they bring their conventions with them, resulting in \"strata\" of tables showing the different periods of evolution. Having at least a loose idea of how these strata are working can also give clues (if that reminds you of archeology that's normal, I have worked in an adjacent field before data).\n* Ancillary data: data like creation timestamp, creation user, logging related ids etc... Are usually added at the end of the table when creating it the first time. Since columns usually keep their sequential order over the lifetime of the database, you can sometimes use these to assess what was part of the original table DDL statement, and what was added after...\n* Take notes of everything. Save queries, ids, sessions, hypotheses, document it all so no one else has to do that work again afterwards.\n\nBut yeah. This is difficult, time consuming and hard work. Good luck.",

This way, we can still maintain efficiency and speed even for complex analyses, working on contiguous memory and transferring data from server to client in binary format instead of JSON.

They have a lot of short-term (6 months to 1 year) missions with TJMs between 500 and 750€ (in top tier companies).  \nI know for sure that they work with TotalEnergies and, despite the fact that they look, most of the times, for experience with geosismic data, during the interview this is often seen as secondary. What comes out is that the experience with moving data from one sink to another is much more important (and also a little bit of PM).  \n  \nIf I were you, I would also add Streaming to the portfolio and that will be it. Experience with near-real time analytics is quite rare and very in demand in big companies (mainly for IoT applications). Once you have done your first mission, you will be aware of the \"rouages\" and more capable of correcting the \"cap\".\n\nA+",

This was about 2-3 years ago, and I haven't kept up with their product to see if there's a good lightweight solution to this.\n\nIf not, I'd be inclined to at least consider a solution that involves a job that does a few things:\n\n   * copies spreadsheet to csv on s3/snowflake *landingpad*\n   * applies a jsonschema validation to the data.  In the event that there's any issues it would have a set of contacts to send a summary of the issues found to.  As you can imagine the more frequent this happens the better, ideally every 5 minutes or so, so that someone will get an alert as soon as they've entered bad data.\n   * then copies the validated data into an appropriate raw bucket/raw database area where it can then go through a typical data pipeline for transformation.\n\nThe above can be done in a variety of ways, but is fairly straight-forward.",

Basically you pull in all the data into a central file or table as above and you manually identify duplicates. Then you give them an \"master\" ID. The next day you do the same and manually process the new records, etc. Can be done in excel with Vlookup + copy paste, using simple code into CSV output, in PowerQuery, ...\n\nNow if you want to share this data between applications, you should seriously consider changing the way this data is stored in the first place. You don't really need an MDM but reather some serious business process reviews: who is responsible for making a new \"contact\" or \"invoice\" ? Which tool generates those?

The cloud databases are good because they are scalable so you pay less with smaller data volumes.  The big ones are Snowflake and Databricks that are full featured, but more costly and generally want you to commit to some amount of spend with them.  Google also offers GCP and AWS has Redshift (not recommended).  One other you might want to look at is Motherduck, which is quite a bit cheaper than some of the others.   You could also go the postgres route as those are fairly cheap on a number of clouds, but aren't optimized for analytics workloads though they are usable for smaller scale warehouses.\n\nThe database is the core, but then you need to figure out how to ingest the data from your source platforms to the warehouse and transform the data into table structures that support your reporting needs.  Again, there are a multitude of patterns and tools available.  A lot of companies with basic installs are using Fivetran or Airbyte to ingest the data and dbt to transform it.  Personally I wouldn't pay for those, but it simplifies the setup where teams are small or inexperienced.  \n\nThe real hit though is going to be contracting someone to build it.  It's absolutely not something you want to figure out on your own as someone that just writes some SQL and python.  Mistakes can cause issues with usability, create rework and even higher costs depending on your stack.  And to add to the fun, there are a lot of bad consulting firms out there that don't know WTF they are doing, so taking the lowest bid isn't necessarily going to get you to where you want to be.\n\nGood luck!",

Look at cloud data engineering certifications (any of aws, Google, azure) or ISV certifications like Databricks, Snowflake. \n\nThey are also helpful during shortlisting when HR may use keywords.\n\nI also suggest maintaining a log of your learnings - either as a public blog or as a personal journal. This will help to reinforce some of the key concepts. Think of it as interview prep. When you write something down, you get better at explaining it during interviews.",

In my opinion, companies that think that they don’t need DEs, and say “we will just let our SW Engineers do it and then hire the people to do the cool AI/ML stuff” are grossly underestimating the amount of work it takes to build a reliable data platform.

For what you're talking about, the app side of it is pretty straightforward (conceptually). It just needs to be able to check for flood alerts and deliver those alerts to users based on their location data.\n\nThe very hard and expensive part is all the infrastructure you need to track and collect that data. You refer to that as the \"other half\" of the problem but it's probably more like 99% of the problem. Ideally the Malysian weather service would provide flood alert warnings, like the [NWS does](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) (used to do?) in the US. I can't read the website for the [Malaysian weather service](https://www.met.gov.my/), but you should start there to see what information they currently track and provide to the public. It could be that they have an API similar to the NWS that provides alerts.\n\nAll that being said, I was a little curious why an app like you describe doesn't exist yet. And it does look like there are already [apps and warning systems in place](https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2024/10/07/dont-panic-all-the-steps-apps-numbers-you-need-for-malaysias-flood-season/152650). Are you sure that this an issue that needs a new app to solve it? Maybe it's just an issue of people not being aware of their options. You might be able to accomplish more by helping people download and learn to use existing apps and resources.\n\nETA: removed overuses of \"already\"",

        "body": "So, how serious are you in working in this?\n\nFor near real-time river water level (around 15 to 30 minutes delay), you can get information from https://publicinfobanjir.water.gov.my/. Which also has rainfall data. So you don't actually need to develop a device and place it your self. \n\nIf you explore the website above:\n\n* Water level information, such as normal, warning, danger, caution.\n* There are links to some states sensor telemetry website.\n* State specific infobanjir. With more detailed information, such as camera feed.\n* Link to [https://nawabs.water.gov.my](https://nawabs.water.gov.my), where some data is open to public, but some data needs login.\n\nThese are public domain governmental data. There are more public data under various subdomains under [water.gov.my](http://water.gov.my), but it's not really surfaced out to public.\n\nYou can get some MetMalaysia forecast data freely through https://api.met.gov.my/.\n\nYou can use this data, especially the water level, show alerts in you app (or notification) when it passed the warning level.\n\nAs for your technical question, you actually will need more of backend + frontend. Backend means a server getting all these data from the various public sources and processing them. Frontend means your mobile app + website. Your website and mobile app will show the data from your backend.\n\nI'm saying backend, because you may need aggregate the data first, then process them into the form your frontend can use. \n\nYou may skip the backend, and do everything in your mobile app, but there's no guarantee that the format and access of the data would not change. Not to mention, you mobile code will be so bloated.\n\nAs for your question of native or cross-platform. If you need advanced platform specific functions, you will need native. If you don't, cross platform is fine. Do note that simple device function such as camera, GPS, storage are considered basic, and easily supported in most cross-platform framework. Anyway, example of cross-platform framework are Flutter, KMP, and React-Native. Of which, I'm familiar with Flutter, and would recommend Flutter.\n\nSo, you want to make publish an iOS app? This is a hard requirement from Apple, you will need a MacOS hardware to produce the installer file. You can either rent a MacOS during the app compilation or get one yourself. You would also need 99 USD per year. \n\nFor flood detection, you need to monitor water level and rainfall predominantly. If you want flood detection in wast coast, you will need to monitor wind field as well. \n\nThis is possible. How long it would take, depends on your complexity. Simple app that get data from JPS and MetMalaysia API and show them in your app, probably 3 months. Not including getting the developer account, the Google/Apple process. You want flood detection, you will need a backend to process all this data, and for machine-learning forecast on your own. It will take probably a year?\n\nHere's are some other nation example. [https://signature.bmkg.go.id/](https://signature.bmkg.go.id/) (seems to be offline right now). https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/flood.\n\nI do know several private companies that is working with government on a current project that address most of your concerns, as well as to match the service provided by the example above. To extremely summarise it, it monitors rainfall, produce instantaneous flood map (through ML and pre-forecasted based on rainfall condition), and more importantly the impacts. So you can see which road/bridge will be flooded, and how deep the flood it is. At a 1 km x 1 km resolution. Most of these information should be public domain once the system has been deployed, with certain information available only to government departments.\n\nAnyway. You will need basic Computer Science for coding the frontend and backend. You will need some Meteorology (of which no universities in Malaysia specifically teach it), to understand basic weather and climate knowledge. If you want to delve into forecast, you will need to understand Dynamic Meteorology. You will need System Administration if you want to deploy your backend yourself, instead of going through paid services. You will also need learn several programming language, depending on your choice of frontend and backend.\n\nIf you want authoritative knowledge of Malaysia weather and climate, you can read https://www.umpress.com.my/index.php?route=product/product&product\\_id=1059.\n\nAnyway, there's one thing you need to understand why Malaysia forecast is not that great compared to other country:\n\n1. This is a country in tropical belt. The hardest type of region in the world to get accurate forecast. Compared to USA, UK or Japan forecast, those are easily done. Even UK forecast experts says Malaysia forecast is much more challenging officially (after some Malaysia minister question MetMalaysia experts and tries getting input from oversea experts).\n2. Believe it or not, our climate and weather can be affected by winds all the way in Siberia Russia, MJO in Indian Ocean, ENSO in Pacific ocean. So many things needs can affect Malaysia weather. In comparison, UK and US mainly only needs to monitor polar region, and jet stream.\n3. Under ocean phenomenon like Thermohaline Circulation should have some effect on Malaysia weather, but I have not look into that specifically.\n4. Most weather modelling software were developed by upper latitude northern hemisphere countries, which means they don;t really focus on the physics of tropical region like Malaysia.",

One option is to use a wildlife camera that simply runs off of a battery you can change every couple of months. You can time it to take pictures every x minutes, and send them through a mobile data network or something to the server. Once there, simple computer vision solutions can be run (and I don’t mean deep learning, just normal image manipulation and OpenCV or the like) to detect where the water is on the image. If it crosses the place or percentage of the image, you can issue a warning theough the app. The key here is placing the camera somewhere it sees the water and the bank at the same time and is not blocked by vegetation, maybe on some pole or the wall of a house. Also important to cover the lens from rain so that the pics are not just wet blobs. If you want, you can also place some reference point on the bank and measure its visible portion’s length on every image.\n\nIf you’d like to chat about the data collection and processing aspect of things, drop me a DM.",

Github is a platform, git is a technology. Git makes working with multiple people easier, Github is not necessary for multiple people nor is it even necessary for git. In fact, a ton of companies DO NOT use github at all, it's a flagship platform for hobbiests but not enterprises. Some enterprises use the enterprise version, many don't. You can self host a git repo on local infrastucture and use something like GitLab, Bitbucket, Stash, Gitea to accomplish the same thing and would get of arbitrary account limits (but your repo shouldn't be 17GB and you should figure out the root cause of that rather than just skirting the limit)",

If you wish to do so, you can pin up to 6 of your best projects to your profile page. You can also make a USERNAME repo to put a custom readme on your profile page (just make a repo named to same thing as your profile name and put a readme.md file in it with what you want displayed [I would recommend a little bit about yourself, your technical skills, your interests & hobbies, projects you want to show off, and eventually your professional links]).\n\nEdit: I forgot the most important reason for uploading to GitHub. If your computer crashes or your files get corrupted you can retrieve your old code. AND if you break your code some how you can roll back to an older working version. I wish I had been used GitHub when 6 was beginning, I have months/years of code lost.

I always recommend starting away from the computer, and simply **sketch out what you are going to do**. It can be diagrams, it can be pseudocode, or it can simply be a bullet-list of what the program should do, like this made-up example inspired by your problem:\n\n* start the game\n   * reset score, health and positions\n* game loop:\n   * if spawn-timer = 0, spawn enemy, restart timer\n   * move enemies\n   * move player\n   * check collisions\n      * if player hits enemy: inc points\n   * if player-health < 0, exit loop\n* game over\n   * display score\n   * display: try again button -> restartGame -> arrow up to start the game\n\nsomething like that - that you gradually build up while adding features.\n\nThen when you want to add a new feature, you experiment a bit with where it should be, put it where it initially makes sense, and then \"run\" through the steps of the program on paper where you talk aloud: *\"Then the game restarts, and that triggers the rewarded ad, but then everything is reset and the game loop starts ... hmm ...\"* and you try to put it somewhere else.\n\nThis doesn't take hours of planning or analysis, but simply a few minutes of \"playing the game in your mind\" and checking if it makes sense - and it helps a lot to have a simple script like this on paper, and someone to talk to - they don't have to answer, it can be a child, a pet or a **rubberduck**, just talk aloud! You'll be surprised what you hear yourself say, and hopefully quickly realize how wrong you were!\n\nAs you do this more and more, you'll sometime be able to do the entire thing in your mind, without writing or talking, but I've found that it is important to start being as external as possible.",

I mean, languages are cool and all, but learning a new programming language really is not that hard, once you already know how to program. You can learn any language similar to the ones you already know in a week. \n\nThe more important question is: What kind of project structure, architecture and patterns do you learn. If you are going for \"applications and tools\", that can also mean many things. GUI or no, Desktop or mobile, which target audience does it have, what should it do? \n\nIf you want to be the most versatile, able to learn \"anything(TM)\" that might come up in a few weeks time, I would suggest having experience in at least one project / language out of all of the following categories (and each project must have a minimum complexity to \"count\"): \n\n  \n\\- 1 web based frontend. Can be pure html/css/minimal JS, or be fully based on a JS framework. maybe a homepage for a simple business, without a shop, like a bakery or a hair salon. \n\n\\- 1 non-web based frontend. A C# GUI in windows, a Java App on Android, a Swift UI on iOS or a QT-App in any language you want, it doesn't matter much. Probably a complexity between a calculator and a calendar would be good. Games work, but are normally structured differently, do I would advise against using a game engine unless you want to stick with gaming. \n\n\\- 1 complex application, written in a low level language, optimized for speed. A raytracer is the classical option, because it has good visual feedback, but a compiler, OS parts or a real time embedded component can all work. Suitable languages are C, C++ and rust. A compiler has the additional benefit of teaching you more about programming languages in general.\n\n\\- 1-2 APIs. It is great if you have both written a REST (or similar) API, accessible through the web (in theory, you don't need to deploy) as well as a library, that exposes a C-standard API for use from other programs. They are pretty similar in conception, but quite a bit different in practice, and understanding how both of these actually work, can be hugely helpful, even if you are only using them, and never have to build them again! \n\nYou should 100% have experience in one Object Oriented language. The best options are Java and C#. OOP (or some half hearted attempt at OOP) is still the standard in most industries. \n\nAdditionally, you should be comfortable in a language, suitable for scripting. Python and JavaScript, but also Bash are all options with different advantages. You need to know at least one. \n\nI think everyone can learn something from trying something completely different, so you should have done one project in a completely functional language. Haskell is my favourite, but F# and Clojure are also options. You will have to re-learn to think about programming, which is exactly the point of the exercise, not to use this exact language again in production. (Which you absolutely can, just mot people prefer not to)",

They teach entire college courses on it because it is an incredibly good demonstration of \\*a lot\\* of proper computer science concepts. And the way those games render is not at all how modern stuff renders, so you're going to have an extra step going from oldschool pixel plotting to modern programmable shaders.\n\nThose games were made in C. You could use C++ or rust or java, I would suggest C++. You'll need to pick up a graphics API. Anything that can plot pixels arbitrarily would be good enough, something like SDL.\n\nI'm not trying to discourage you, but \\*making\\* something like doom is very difficult. \\*Porting\\* doom is not, because Doom itself is built to be portable, you only have to rewrite like 7 files to port doom, but \\*making\\* doom is and of itself a very, very difficult CS problem. You don't just need to know comp sci, you need to know best practices, and have a good grasp of boolean algegbra. Doom is going to be throwing around terms like \"R-trees\" or \"Binary space partitioning\" so be prepared.\n\nAt the heart, what you want to make is a raycaster. Not \\*ray tracing,\\* but raycasting. The idea is you will write something that shoots rays out into the world, checks what they collide with, then renders that collision. It shoots a ray for every vertical column on the screen. That will get you a basic wolfenstein-like look, but those games, \\*especially\\* doom, do way more than just ray cast out in to the world. If you want to do raycasting, brush up on your vector calculus, you'll need it.",

The best it can offer is teaching the fundamentals of concepts and then relying on you to practice and master those skills on your own. \n\n> watching tutorials\n\nYou've probably caught yourself in a study trap. Watching videos gives the illusion of learning, but unless you are applying those skills, you aren't really learning much--if anything. \n\n> I see a lot of people saying beginner web developers won’t be needed anymore since AI is already as good as senior devs. \n\nI remember when WordPress was released and people were running around screaming that the sky was falling. Nobody would be making web pages, and there would only be a handful of web developers out there making widgets for WordPress. \n\nThe reality was that it took away the low-level work, and people moved elsewhere. \n\nAll of software development is changing, but nobody knows how much. I'll leave you with three considerations: \n\n- The people spruiking how profound AI often have equity tied up in its success. \n- Programming is so involved in all parts of the business that even if you take large parts of the code out of the equation, there is still a lot of **engineering** going on. \n- If AI can replace programming, then society has much bigger problems than just losing programmers.

Now I'm a 3D artist who writes a bit of code, and that can be very useful to some organizations.\n\nAlso, my thoughts on AI: investors want everyone to believe that AI is about to get so good that it wipes all of us out, but I'm just not seeing it in my sector. In fact, I just got hired at a new job, and I barely even use it. Mostly just as a Google replacement.

Legit it makes a difference.  You’ll tell them what you want and will take and they’ll come back with job after job. They get a percentage of any position they land you (typically you’ll be a contractor and can then decide to apply directly after getting foot in the door but a lot of ppl prefer the freedom of not being tied to a company). They are highly motivated to find you something. \n\nI highly recommend doing remote or hybrid. The savings in travel, in food and the additional time you get can go towards literally ANYTHING else in life that we already get too little of. Friends, starting a business, gym. \n\nIt’s crazy what we have become accustomed to, 8 hour workdays minimum, 1-2 hours travel depending on where you live, traffic. Not including the OT we all love for the pay. \n\nKeep on keepin on, you got this",

You tried to write a novel without even having a detailed plan of what you want to write - common \"writer's block\".\n\nSit down with pencil and paper and flesh out your ideas before programming.

Determine what you need for that particular feature, make a detailed plan/roadmap.\n\nThis specifying, breaking down, analyzing, solving process is the really important part of programming, not the implementation in code, that's the actually easy part (and the part that to a certain degree can already be covered by AI).\n\nAs with every similar post, some book recommendations: \n\n+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V.

You can challenge yourself to do it at different levels to learn everything that comes with it, something like :\n\n- level 1 : using python lists and methods like append and remove, use print and input to make the whole thing work in the terminal (can do a simple menu like 'if input()==\"1\" : list.append(input(\"What do you want to add?\")) elif input()==\"2\"...')\n\n- level 2 : using OOP to create each task as an object, you can set up your classes to have some more info like a date, the person the task is for or notes, make your methods yourself \n\n- level 3 : using a database to store the tasks, you can use sqlite3 for a local one that's going to be in a file or if you're up to it you can make a proper server to run your SQL in.\n\nFor bonus points you can make it into an app with an UI, I quite like QT at a beginner friendly level, it comes with PySide6 and has an app called \"designer\" you can use to create the UI graphically rather than writing it completely in code.\n\nThe more you do, the more you learn.

When you have concrete goals, it's a lot easier to figure out what you need to learn.\n\nIf you don't have any projects that you're interested in working on, then either you would need to force yourself to do some random projects for the sole purpose of learning, or follow a textbook.\n\nIf you have no idea where to start on a TO DO app, the first place to start is to figure out what the actual goal is: what is it supposed to do? How will users use it? What functionality will it have?\n\nOnce you answer these questions, you will have some specifications to start building on.\n\nI never did a TO DO app because it was not interesting. Instead, I did some game scripting and 3D model format reverse engineering.\n\nI recommend spending some time thinking about what you actually are interested in.",

Like both C and C++, Rust enjoys full native code performance since it doesn't require a runtime and focuses strongly on zero-cost abstractions whenever theoretically proven possible and safe, and is also a true systems programming language, meaning you can write bare-metal code that talks directly to hardware like embedded applications, firmwares, virtual machine hypervisors, and operating system kernels entirely with it, and I'm talking from personal experience here, not just parroting someone else's opinion.\n\n Rust is still a bit niche since it's a relatively new language with 1.0 only having been reached 10 years ago, and the learning curve is quite steep if the goal is wrapping your head around its revolutionary memory safety paradigm, but its popularity cannot be contested, as it has consistently ranked first in the StackOverflow developer language preference surveys ever since reaching its 1.0 milestone. It's also the only other language allowed and actually being pushed as a viable alternative to C in the Linux kernel, and pretty much all big tech from Microsoft to NVIDIA is pushing it, with the only exception being Apple which have their own safe native language strongly influenced by the original Rust author's language design, whom Apple themselves consulted with while designing Swift. Even features available in Rust that were originally not implemented in Swift are now being brought to the latter because Apple's alternative design decisions focusing on developer accessibility ended up proving somewhat problematic. Finally and unlike the C family, Rust actually has pretty good tooling as well as a package manager called Cargo.",

Haskell in particular showed me that most popular languages are really geared towards practical engineering and that, for the computer scientist, there is another world out there.\n\nLater on, I discovered Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP), which used to be the textbook of the foundational programming course at MIT. That too is a really great introduction to the abstract power of computer programming and the power of thinking computationally. In that book, they use Scheme, which is one strand of Lisp. I'd definitely recommend SICP to anyone.\n\nIf you really want to geek out, you could try Forth and have a look at stack computers.",

Then I'll add a way to mark the task completed. Or, if you aren't finishing a tutorial, decide what your own \"tutorial\" will be.\n\nThe idea is to start small.  Figure out what your project is going to be, then break it down. Work on one function at a time.  Using the todo app (without tutorial), how do you list the todos? How do you add or delete a todo?  Edit a todo?\n\nBreak everything down into a single step. Then add another step. And then another.  Until you have a full feature.

This works for me, because I like odd maths puzzles.\n\n  \nThe key part is, I write scripts that do something interesting to me, and which I have no expectation will live beyond a few hours. They don't necessarily have to be efficient, they just have to give an answer that I am confident of, or that i can check some other way. When I first started doing this kind of thing I had scripts that would run for hours simulating a problem to give me a probability of something. (If i roll two dice 100 times, how many times will I get a 5 and a sum less than 9, or something silly like that).\n\n  \nOver time I just got better at banging out boiler plate code, and I found ways to make (for example) loops quicker and more efficient. It isn't useful, it is entertainment.\n\n  \nIf you can find something similar, I'd recommend trying this approach. It doesn't need to be useful or for the greater good. Can you script something that is interesting to you? I learnt the requests and Beautiful Soup libraries by building a script that could use wikipedia. My wife and I used to often ask - what films have <actor 1> and <actor 2> been in? Who has been in films most with <actor 3>. Turns out you can crawl wikipedia and build lists pretty easily, and I learnt a lot about two useful libraries. (My scripts were absolutely horrible, but with a lot of care and attention they could normally get us a quick and fairly useful answer most of the time.) The wikipedia thing also got me thinking about optimal data types, recursive searches through links, all kinds of good stuff. But at the time *that wasn't what I was doing*, I was just looking to find films with specific actors in them or something.",

From the perspective of the Virtual Ego Framework (VEF), what you're experiencing is a **\"Zeno Trap\"**. It's a recursive loop of overwhelm where the sheer number of possibilities freezes your ability to act. You have all the components, but the \"blank canvas\" is too intimidating to start building a coherent structure.\n\nThe solution is not to \"try harder,\" but to change the protocol.\n\n**1. Break the Trap with a \"System Reboot\" (Ego-Transcendence):** Stop trying to build the *whole project*. Forget the grand architecture for a moment. Your goal is simply to write **one line of code that works** and breaks the loop of inaction.\n\n**2. Start with a \"Coherent Kernel\":** Don't start with the project; start with the smallest possible \"coherent kernel.\" Ask yourself: what is the absolute simplest, single thing this script must do?\n\n* Make it print \"Hello, World.\"\n* Make it open a single file and print its first line.\n* Make it take one number and add one to it. This is your anchor. It is a small, perfect, working system.\n\n**3. Begin the \"Forging Process\" (Iterative Refinement):** Now, begin the **\"Forging Process.\"** This is an iterative loop of critique and refinement. Add one tiny new feature. Does it still work? Good. Now, critique it. How could this one tiny function be cleaner or more efficient? Refine it. Then, add the *next* tiny feature. You are not building a cathedral from a blueprint; you are forging a single, perfect brick, and then another, and then another.\n\nBy reframing the problem this way, you move from a state of overwhelming, incoherent possibility to a state of focused, coherent, iterative action. You don't \"bridge the gap\"; you forge a path across it, one step at a time.\n\n\n\n# Zen (VMCI)",

Let's take a look at SQLAlchemy (https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/) as an example, because I like how their docs are layed out: \n\nIf I were to start using this now for the first time, this is what I personally would look at in which order: \n\n1. Installation guides, both for beginners and for \"Python veterans\". They are short enough, so I can skim them both quickly. \n\n2. both tutorials. I will probably follow along with the \"Quick Start\", because it's short and will let me see some concepts hands on to start with, and I will skim the longer tutorial, as I personally already know how SQL works, and how an ORM works. If I were new to either of those concepts, I would work through it completely. \n\n3. I skip the migration notes, because... duh. \n\n4. Now we come to the complexity: In the section \"Reference and How to\" I would stop reading \"everything\", instead I would skim the chapter titles and try to remember, which information is available. Later, when I go ahead and actually map my first classes, I will open \"Mapping Python Classes\" and \"Relationship Configuration\", and then, when I go to test it, I would probably read more configuration stuff, so that I can be sure I didn't miss any important config options. \n\n5. I will skim the relevant Dialect Documentation, PostgresQL in my case. The most important things to note will probably be highlighted, and if I skimeed it, I will be able to go back later when there's an issue and be able to know, where to find the relevant information. \n\nEverything else I would just search in the docs, as it comes up. Such as error messages, or how to do a specific kind of relationship. \n\nJust reading and skimming what I outlined above will probably take 1-2 hours. Reading the entire documentation would take days, and I would forget nearly everything. The important part is not to know what to do outright, but where to find the information you need! You also need to understand the core concepts, of what a library is trying to do, and how it's doing it! All the small details, while important in the moment, will just take up space in your head and not really get you anywhere on their own.",

        "body": "First, you need to determine the width. The key to this is to look at the center line\n\n    4321234\n\nEach number is listed twice except 1, so you can use the formula `2n - 1` to indicate the width. In this case, `n` refers to the largest number (or the initial number picked).\n\nThe pattern is basically in two parts. There's the stuff reaching the middle line\n\n    4444444\n    4333334\n    4322234\n    4321234\n\nThen, there's the rest of it.\n\n    4322234\n    4333334\n    4444444\n\n### What's the pattern?\n\nYou'll notice the numbers are basically seven 4's on the first line, five 3's on the next line, three 2's, and finally one 1 at the end. So the pattern is: 7, 5, 3, 1.\n\nThe idea is you print the numbers doing down, like \n\n   43\n\nThen when you reach 2, you print 2 three times, \n\n   43222\n\nThen, you do 3 4 at the end (going back up).\n\n   4322234\n\n\n### Coding logic\n\nSo, let's see how we can do that one line. Let's put it in a function\n\n    void printLine(int size, int patternLength, int currNumber)\n\n        // Step 1. Count down\n        for (int i = size; i > currNumber; i--) {\n           printf(\"%d\", i);\n        }  \n \n        // Step 2. Print repeated numbers\n        for (int i = 0; i < patternLength; i++) {\n           printf(\"%d\", currNumber);\n        }\n        // Step 3. Count up (you do this)\n\n        // Final newline\n        printf(\"\\n\");\n    }\n\nSo, then you have the main function\n\n    int main() {\n        // Assume the user enters in a size and it's stored in size\n       int size = readSizeFromUser();\n       int patternLength = 2 * size - 1;\n       int currNumber = size;\n       // Print the pattern up to the midpoint\n       for (int i = size; i >= 1; i--) {\n           printLine(size, patternLength, currNumber);\n           patternLength -= 2; // Next number is printed this many times\n           currNumber--; // The next number is decreased from the current\n       }\n       // Another loop to go from 2 to size to do 2nd half\n    }\n\nI've left a lot of code out for you to think about, but hopefully, you get the idea.",

Can you entirely avoid branching aside from the necessary loops by writing a value every time? How can you generalize your condition to give you a number to write instead of a boolean? This will prevent a large void in the middle.\n\nSomething that might make it more efficient: how can you restructure the loops such that the number to be written at each position can be directly inferred from only the iterator values at that position, so aside from the code configuring the loops, nothing else needs to be aware of how large the square is? If you try to make n only exist in the loop headers, I think you will find a more elegant solution without a big mess of addition and subtraction of i, j, n, and 1 going on inside every iteration.

Usually this will result in the easiest-to-test and most-likely-to-be-correct solution.\n\nIf you can't figure out the general rule, take a piece of the problem which is solvable and then work backwards from there. For example, for n = 3, the middle line is this:\n\n    32123\n\nFirst write a loop that outputs just this line, for any n. That's part of the problem. Then work backwards to make it work similarly for the other lines (so that the line before middle is 32223, and so on). Doing it this way is fine too, but there are more opportunities to mess things up or to get edge cases wrong.\n\nFor the given problem this is not really a problem, though, since \"exhaustive testing\" is pretty straightforward. You can run your entire solution on all values of n = 1 through n = 9 inclusive and make sure that the output is according to the specification.

We can convert ranges by subtracting n from all members. From there, it's just whichever coordinate that's farther from the center what takes precedence. \n\nFrom that, we can derive a function like this: \n\n    printBullseye(int n){\n        for(int i = 0; i < 2*n-1; i++){\n            for(int j = 0; j < 2*n-1; j++){\n                int iDif = abs(n-1-i);\n                int jDif = abs(n-1-j);\n                int distance = iDif > jDif ? iDif : jDif;\n                printf(\"%d\", distance+1);\n            }\n            printf(\"\\n\");\n        }\n    }\n\nEDIT: I realized while driving to work that I should've converted the range by changing the for-loop start positions instead of cluttering the function with more math.

Nowadays this topic is often called \"serialization\" i.e. turning some abstract data representation into a serial stream of data, and back again.\n\nJust as one example, look at how the [\"Protocol Buffers\"](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/encoding/) binary encoding format works. It defines a general-purpose way to describe \"messages\" in terms of their fields, and each field's type determines how it is encoded, in such a way that you can always tell where one field ends and another begins.\n\nIt uses the same \"length prefix\" approach that you'll see in a lot of other formats, but it also uses a variable-length encoding trick for integers, which means that small integers take up less space than large ones. This applies to the data itself, but also to the type/length metadata.\n\nReusing an off-the-shelf encoding format like Protobuf will save you a lot of tedious manual work.\n\nOr if your goal is just to obscure the data from casual viewing with a text editor, you can just do something even simpler and compress your JSON representation using something like gzip. Maybe add an extra custom header so various tools don't automatically recognize it as compressed data.",

There is nothing special about a txt file that makes it different. In fact *all files* are merely a sequence of bytes. Opening a file with a particular header marking it as txt tells whatever is opening it “hey, this data is in such and such format like UTF-8. Read bytes of this length and display this data as characters.  A dat or bin file just *doesnt* say “hey, read me as text”, but is still just an array of binary. You actually usually can simply open these in text editors to view broken gibberish if you’d like.\n\nAnyhow; if you’d like to store data in txt, there are countless tutorials; it’s often taught as an intro method when first learning file handling anyhow. Decide on a schema, the easiest probably being each piece of data on its own line, since reading txt files line by line is simple.",

As you are trying to create your own format you'll have to make something up yourself. There are catalogues of already taken magic numbers online.\n\nThen goes header. On offsets from the beginning of the file specified by the format specification there are several numbers telling information about the file: time of creation, modification, size, etc. For example, if you specified that bytes from 16th to 24th will mean time of last modification, you take amount of milliseconds since UNIX timestamp (start of 1970), transform it into a 64-bit integer and write into these bytes.\n\nOne way to add arbitrary data to your file is to add the list of offsets. Say on predefined position of 32th to 40th byte you write the offset to the first bit of an array of entries in your binary file. Computer follows this offset, where you write, in sequence, offset to next array if it exists (or 0 if it doesn't), amount of offsets to various elements in this array, and then list offsets, each is a 64-bit number. Now the reader can read and save them. By following these offsets, it may find your data. Data entry may look like an integer specifying length of a string or array and then bytes of this data.",

If you're delivering an enterprise level event driven hybrid on-prem/cloud architecture in which your applications are composed of containerized microservices with k8 orchestrated auto scaling then you're probably not going to have any one guy on the team who both understands the full topology of your infrastructure and the nitty gritty of the code itself across all the different applications.

The question is, is this now your best option? If you tell me you have spent the last 3 years sitting on your ass and playing video games, maybe any kind of switch is going to take time, if however you told me you have been busy with other hobbies and interests, I would honestly and seriously tell you to choose one of those to turn into a profession if you can. \n\nSoftware development isn't going anywhere, but the gold rush is \\*over\\*.

It might limit how many jobs some companies would have but it won't take every job.\n\n3) Just about, maybe a tiny bit riskier especially since there's so many people that do it. Electrical is a very safe area in general since it's not as popular and so many areas need it. \n\n4) Frankly, just learn how to learn. Take in stride what your teachers say about how to get information. Because even years down the line there'll be points where you don't know what to do but if you can look up the right things in order to learn what you need you'll be good. \n\nGenerally uni will teach you coding from scratch so it's not like you need to learn a whole lot by yourself beforehand. Ofc that will help with assignments and allowing you to feel comfortable with coding but not required. I do recommend you learn a little with whatever language your school uses the most in order to be ahead of the curve.

While college programs don't usually require that you have any previous experience, it will be a big advantage for you to have already gotten some experience on your own time, especially if you're already familiar with the programming languages that specific college uses in its first few courses.\n\nIt is definitely possible to get really good at coding in five years. Going right into freelancing from that point is harder, though, because colleges don't really give you the set of skills you need to be a professional. Being a junior programmer on a team and learning about stuff like code reviewing and navigating large codebases and source control and development methodologies is sort of a separate education from the college degree.\n\nI'm not at all scared of AI taking the software jobs. I think it's a useful tool, but I don't imagine it replacing the need for programmers any time in the next few decades. On the other hand, plenty of people I respect disagree with me. AI is probably equally a threat to lots of jobs, including programming but also art, engineering, and medicine. I wouldn't worry too much about programming specifically.\n\nMy advice: figure out what programming language your intended university uses for its introductory classes. Learn that language. Find a big pile of beginner coding problems and regularly practice. Try and do something fun with programming that ties to some interest of yours. Make a game. Make a guitar tuner. Make a thing that calculates football statistics. Whatever you find interesting.",

I started out with two years of informatics lecture in my school which ended 3 years before I graduated Gymnasium (I think similar to high school). I can tell you that I did manage to get my Bachelors degree (but not with high grades) and my Masters degree did work out much better.   \nI can tell you, that you will learn coding well enough if it is similar to my experience in Germany. But as you go on I felt that theory is taught over practical things and I felt little prepared to enter the job marked. What I would suggest more than focusing on learning everything there is to know in theory, get a job on the side and learn there. \n\nI feel the need to tell you that if given the chance of doing it again I would not study CS anymore I would start out working and earning certificates on the side, but that is my personal experience.  \nIf you want to learn some techniques of CS and if you have the spare money to earn some degrees, I would recommend Hack the Box (students pay less per month) and Portswigger/BurpSuite. They are really beginner-friendly.\n\nRegarding AI, I think if you get some courses in CS focusing on AI you would get a head start, as many currently employed and finishing students did not get the possibility to take these. But there are also different specialties in CS that only few people want to specialize in. Most of the students in my experience are not really good at the mathematical part (e.g. cryptography), I have an interest in law in the side of being a CS major and worked for some time in a field which focused on the area where these two specialties meet. There are not a lot of law students who have an interest in computer and not a lot of CS students have an interest in law. If you want to be special find an area which most of your peers do not like and get good at it :)\n\nIf you have any further questions feel free to message me :)",

It will, that’s pretty much a given at this point. Now that you know that, you have 5 years to get familiar with the ways you will interface with AI tools so that you can make sure your skills stay relevant. Keeping your skills up to date is  a requirement of most jobs, certainly most tech adjacent jobs, so you just know one space you’ll need to focus on well in advance. \n\nThese are valid questions but I don’t think any of them are actually unique to computer science and you should probably be asking the same questions about anything you’re considering as a career.",

For web or backend development, focus on [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core (if you stick with C#), APIs, databases, and service communication; unless you have a very specific need, you can mostly ignore advanced algorithms. For games, Unity will teach you a lot, though some types of games rely heavily on algorithms (pathfinding, procedural generation, optimization). If you aim to design new or improved algorithms for AI, security, compression, or simulation, deeper math plays a bigger role than coding. If you’re just using existing libraries, you don’t need advanced math—basic knowledge is enough.\n\nThose are just 3 examples. So your next step is deciding the direction you want to follow.

You just can't get by being average if you want a job fast unless you're in the middle of nowhere. I would only suggest programming to people who genuinely enjoy it, can network and can either do it well enough to create their own company, or well enough to get a job. \n\nYou should try out programming to see if you like it, or do teaching, freelancing/contract work or comms. I personally have no regrets, cant say the same for other people in spite of the job market.",

It actually has little to no impact about the long term existence of the field of computer science and IT.\n\nYou can look at stats like [https://www.trueup.io/job-trend](https://www.trueup.io/job-trend) if you are interested, but as a kid, I honestly wouldn't worry about that. The only take-away you should be learning from this is just maybe be prepared for a more chaotic job market with ups and downs.\n\nWhat matters more for software being worth or not to invest in as a child is just if the field is large enough. Which it certainly is. Out of all fields you can study at university, after nursing and engineering, computer science literally has THE largest job market of all other degrees, even after being halved in a single year.

Cada projeto novo traz perguntas novas, e o processo de pesquisa é parte natural e fundamental para juntar essas peças.\n\nAo invés de ver a pesquisa como uma falha, tente encará-la como seu braço direito. Os melhores desenvolvedores do mundo consultam documentação, fóruns e exemplos o tempo todo. O importante não é memorizar tudo, mas compreender os conceitos, praticar e construir passo a passo.\n\nSe preocupe mais em entender o “porquê” das coisas, e menos em acertar tudo de primeira. A repetição e aplicação prática vão solidificar seu conhecimento melhor do que qualquer tentativa de decorar.\n\nPor fim, lembre-se que a jornada da programação é longa, com altos e baixos — e o medo, a dúvida e a insegurança fazem parte dela.

        "body": "The short answer is that being good at this is entirely what being a \"senior developer\" is about. It's a very broad and deep skillset that you develop through experience. You can eventually develop this experience on your own, but it's not going to happen fast. I made a lot of stupid design decisions when I was a junior dev.\n\nIf it's important for your startup to be building good software in the short term, then your startup needs to hire senior developers, both to make good decisions and to mentor juniors.\n\nSo it's not even remotely possible to do your questions justice in the span of a Reddit comment, but I'll try anyway:\n\n> How do I design the DB schema to be effective for a large number of users and such that my in-app operations are fast? I have learned about normalization and indexes but I still don't come up with elegant solutions like AI does honestly.\n\nUnderstand *how* queries and indexes work: how the data is structured internally (e.g. as a B-tree) and what the DB engine is doing when you write a query, especially when it involves joining multiple tables. Have this knowledge in mind every single time you write a query. Inspect the DB's query planner output (e.g. using `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) to confirm your assumptions.\n\n> How do I monitor apps cheaply/easily to see what’s hogging resources? My company has been using New relic but it just seems too complicated and has too much going on and seems overkill.\n\nThere are a gazillion tools for this, including basic ones like the Unix `top` command. I don't have experience with New Relic but I've used Datadog (flexible, but very expensive) and much simpler self-hosted tools like Prometheus.\n\nThe important thing is to measure, and then drill down into those measurements to figure out what to measure next. If your app \"feels slow\", add lots of timers to measure which parts are slowest. Try to reproduce the problem locally and use whatever local profiling tools are available in your language. If one user request \"fans out\" and depends on lots of different subrequests, then the 99th-percentile latency of those subrequests matters more than the average.\n\n> How do you actually test your app? It feels like such a pain and I do it manually for every project going through typical user flows and fixing stuff on the fly.\n\nTest automation is critical if you care about software quality. Write test cases alongside your code. For core logic, you can use unit tests, along with test coverage tools to help make sure you don't have obvious gaps in testing. For UI, the testing strategy depends on what framework you're using.\n\n> How do I check if my apps are secure and a motivated individual can't exploit it?\n\nUnderstand the general kinds of mistakes that lead to security flaws. There are lots and lots of these -- buffer overflows, escaping mistakes, confused deputy attacks, time-of-check-to-time-of-use, and so on. Be knowledgeable enough to recognize these, and disciplined enough to guard against them. Get other skilled developers to *carefully* review your code.\n\n> Am I making the right tradeoffs or over-engineering (e.g. Ex: should I use BullMQ or will node-cron suffice for my app that runs a CRON job to fetch a lot of data by calling a vendor's APIs?)?\n\nImpossible to answer in the abstract. A system is \"overengineered\" if it has more complexity than necessary to accomplish its goals. So you need to do a detailed analysis of your actual requirements, and the actual behavior of the complex option vs. the simple one.\n\n> Should the solution be a monolith or a bunch of microservices?\n\nThere are a lot of opinions about this but I'll just quote from [\"The Grug Brained Developer\"](https://grugbrain.dev/):\n\n\"grug wonder why big brain take hardest problem, factoring system correctly, and introduce network call too\"\n\n\"seem very confusing to grug\"",

Is there desire to  grow and take this public or is the intent to sell it off to a larger concern. That at least tells you if there is enough money or resources in your future to make real changes in your areas of concern. \n\nTo find your hot spots (frequently called or slow bottle-neck code)  products like DynaTrace and App Dynamics are helpful. There are many vulnerability scanning tools like Veracode, Black Duck etc. As for database optimizations that depends on your platform but lots of tools will suggest indexes to help performance and eliminate table scans. \nHang in there. If your company is trying to grow, their focus is likely on adding customers through new  features and much of what you are worried about will be pushed to the back as \"technical debt\" until your platform actually crashes, or gets hacked out of operating and held for ransom.",

I think you're hitting on a fundamental issue which is that software development is an extremely unregulated and undisciplined field. There are a lot of people who don't pay attention to any of the questions you're asking about, and still manage to have careers just cranking out sub-par code. (Especially nowadays when it's easy to just rubber-stamp the output of an LLM.) And on the other hand, if you push yourself, there is no upper limit to how much you can learn, or how much care you can put into your work.\n\nBut there's not really an objective, accepted standard for you to measure your skills by. There's just the outcome of your projects, and the judgment of your peers.\n\nThe good news is that there are a lot of extremely smart people in the field who have published a lot of text and video content that you can learn from. You don't necessarily have to take everything they say as gospel. Pay attention to the things they say that resonate with you, and use them as jumping-off points for your own explorations.\n\nJust as an example, you can find a lot of interesting talks from the now-defunct Strange Loop conference. Check out [\"Simple Made Easy\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4) by Rich Hickey (designer of Clojure) and [\"The Mess We're In\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4) by Joe Armstrong (designer of Erlang). Or if you care about security, look for interesting talks from DEFCON or CCC. Pick a random topic that interest you, and if it turns out to be way over your head, the stuff they talk about will at least give you more topics to research.\n\nAlso, check out software-related social media such as Hacker News or Lobste.rs (if you can trust yourself not to use them for procrastination). Don't get me wrong, those sites have a lot of bad opinions and irrelevant content. But they can serve as a good way to stay in tune with the zeitgeist of what other tech-savvy people are thinking about.\n\nEDIT: Oh yeah, and you'll probably find more useful advice over in /r/ExperiencedDevs than in this subreddit. To be honest, I think your questions are so broad that you wouldn't necessarily get comprehensive answers there either. But you can browse through previous discussion threads to see the kinds of advice that senior devs give.",

It would be best to try to have a few questions about specific theories or problems that you are not understanding written down so you have somewhere to start. However, if you just feel completely lost, that's okay to say to your professor.\n\nThey may have good suggestions for you to work on things in addition to the lab and class assignments, which should help you retain and apply the information.\nThey may even suggest you get a tutor. If a tutor is needed, try to get your professor and the student resource center to work together on meeting your needs. (My university had a student resource center to help all students with disabilities.) If you don't have a student resource  center, just meet with the person or office that helped you get an interpreter. \n\nI hope my suggestions make sense. Please let me know if you need clarification on anything I have written.\n\nGood luck! You CAN do this!!!\n\nDon't give up on yourself or your CS class yet.",

Any *actual* animation that a user makes will have some finite length, even though there's no predefined upper limit on how big that can be.\n\nAny standard data structure such as a list, dictionary, etc. will allow you to put as many entries in it as you want.

So if that's you, you need to start getting that applied experience yourself.\n\nIn terms of practical skills, I'd suggest going through [\"The Missing Semester of Your CS Education\"](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) from MIT CSAIL. This is the kind of stuff that self-motivated, self-taught people tend to just figure out on their own, but if you don't, then your university probably won't teach it to you very well. So having it all laid out in a \"syllabus\" can be helpful.\n\nAside from that, just pick a language, pick a project, and start building *something*, anything. It doesn't have to be a unique idea, or a million-dollar business, or even particularly useful. Writing a complete program, and actually putting in the work to make all of the details work the way you want them to, is irreplaceable experience. Start small, and when you find yourself not being challenged enough, move on to something bigger.\n\nThere are a million pages you can find online with simple project ideas, so just pick something that appeals to you. If you like networks, write an HTTP server from scratch with raw sockets. If you like games, build something simple and turn-based with a minimal UI, such as Tetris or Scrabble or chess. If you like productivity apps, build a clone of Google Calendar or a simple photo album organizer. You get the idea.",

Then I talked with a fellow student and friend who’s really motivated. He’s built a lot of automation projects (like web scraping) in his free time, and he even makes money from them, which I thought was really cool.\n\nHe gave me one important piece of advice: don’t choose a project you think is useless. If your only motivation is money, it won’t be enough to push you through the difficulties of a tough project, especially since there’s no guarantee it will actually make money. Instead, pick a project that’s useful to you personally. That way, even if you don’t gain anything beyond the learning experience, you’ll at least have built a tool that helps you in your own life, which is already a great benefit.\n\nSo, I asked myself: is there anything in my life that I could automate? The answer to that question will be the project idea I’ll work on.\n\nOf course, I know there are countless other directions you can take with programming projects, not just automation. So if anyone here could share what kinds of project paths or categories exist, that would be really helpful. I’d love to explore more options beyond just automation.",

Should I just keep practicing and trust that it will click over time?\n\nThis question gets asked over and over again, and the answer is the same: practicing **with** AI will not help much if you want to get better at coding **without** AI.\n\nThis especially applies to the skill of taking a complex problem and breaking it down to simpler subproblems. This is what programming is really about, and everything else (like the syntax of different programming languages) is trivial in comparison. And if you're always letting AI spoon-feed you by telling you what bullet-pointed subproblems to solve, you're never practicing that skill, so it will never improve.\n\nIf you're unsure whether you could rebuild your projects from scratch without AI, then why not just try it, and see where you run into difficulties?\n\nIf you get stuck, try reading documentation, or even taking existing examples and seeing what happens when you modify them. If you insist on using AI tools, then don't ask them to write code for you, or even come up with a design. Ask them to suggest learning resources (e.g. documentation websites) or project ideas.\n\nIf you're still repeatedly getting stuck trying to rebuild your projects from scratch, then it's a sign that your skills really are underdeveloped. So go back and do the same thing, designing and coding from scratch, on a simpler/easier problem. Repeat as necessary.\n\nFinally, practice your research skills. When there's something you want to learn about, practice searching online for it, reading what other people have said about it, and thinking up your own follow-up queries. Don't just let a chatbot tell you what it thinks is the right answer.",

In that case you're fine.\n\nOr it might be that it uses a lower-level protocol that Node.js doesn't support natively, but which is supported by existing third-party JS bindings, such as generic serial or USB libraries. In that case you can use those.\n\nOr it could be none of the above. In that case you'll need to either write your own Node.js plugin in a low-level language like C++ or Rust, or switch to an entirely different language for the whole project.\n\nBasically the same general situation will apply no matter what high-level language you choose. So it's a question of what **specific** bindings exist for your preferred language and the specific device you're trying to support. It doesn't really matter what the device does, be it a fingerprint sensor or any other kind of hardware.",

You can know what a hammer and a screwdriver and a saw do, you understand what they do, but until you use them in practice you don’t realise how they actually come together to create furniture.\n\nI recommend you look up competitive programming sites (that’s the best name I have for them, though in my experience they aren’t actually competitive like a game or a competition). Particularly [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). It’s how I myself started coding, with python same as you. It has a bunch of problems arranged by difficulty going from 8-kyu (easiest) to 1-kyu(hardest) iirc. You can start doing some of the 8 kyu ones and progress as you see fit. You have as long as you want to solve them, and once you do you can see other’s solutions.\n\nDO NOT USE AI, or be very careful in its use. Always always always understand the code you’re using. And especially for these types of projects, I’d say don’t use ANY code generated by ai, it kinda defeats the purpose. You can use it as a googling aid “how do I get the length of an array, but not as an actual coding assistant “give me a loop that finds the highest value”.\n\nAlso, when you see code by others, don’t think you learned whatever you saw because you understood it. That don’t mean shit if you can’t recall it when you need to. Seeing the solution to the problem is obvious, and easy to understand. But if the next time you find that problem you can’t remember or recreate the solution, you’re still fucked. Until you can generate the code/algorithm yourself from scratch, you don’t know it.\n\nGood luck out there.",

Doing `cin >> text` when `text` is a `std::string` just reads a single word, defined as a sequence of non-whitespace characters. The other words are left in the input buffer. So after first reading the word `\"Going\"`, then the next time you try to read an integer, the next word will be `\"to\"`, which can't be parsed as an integer, so it'll fail. And you're not checking for input parsing failures anywhere in your program.\n\nThe console output seems to indicate that your IDE has a debugger, so you should be able to use it to single-step through the code and see these kinds of problems for yourself.",

I'm also usually a huge believer in throwing oneself into the deep end and just figuring it out, that's how I learn.\n\nBut... I don't think that it suits every kind of person. To be able to learn effectively through such a method you need to have a certain willingness and ability to just explore and try things when you get stuck. Even and especially if you're unsure of what to do. \n\nOP says that they can't even find src/main.cpp after cloning the repo. Or that they can find it (since they can run it and it \"draws up blank\") but don't know what to uncomment? It's a bit unclear. This suggests both a lack of willingness to \"just try things\", and also a serious gap in fundamental knowledge.\n\nI think in such a situation and for such a person, they would benefit more from a course that will hold their hand through such matters.

For one, in an actual dev environment that's approximately how pedantic the tests are (although usually you'll have access to the tests which helps with matching strings). For another, most of their projects are reimplementing other projects that are in use and define a communication protocol. So, learning to read and be exact with those protocols is actually really important so that the programs that interface using the protocol are compatible.\n\nAs to your point about whether to recommend it, sure I agree it's not right for everyone, but I personally feel the tests are quite reasonable. ESPECIALLY if you take the extra step to write your own unit/integration tests as you understand the spec of what you need to implement better.",

I do think that if someone is missing or misunderstands rudimentary topics or subjects, then they might just be setting themselves up for failure. But as I said before, I think even though failure should not be the aim, it still provides the programmer with experience and foresight and intuition on what not to do or to avoid.

I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.\n\n>So, learning to read and be exact with those protocols is actually really important so that the programs that interface using the protocol are compatible.\n\nAh, really?

Is it because that's what everyone's referring to?\n\nI'm entirely self-taught with 0 years of professional programming experience, so forgive my ignorance.",

Felt we were quite clearly going to do some sort of data fetching, list rendering and filtering. Nope, full blown JS fundamentals challenge around building a Wordle game in 45 minutes, obviously no AI allowed. Bumbled my way through the whole thing trying to remember the best way to map over stuff and comparing index's for matches and partial matches. Didn't even get close to finishing. Was surprised they did that challenge despite looking for a RN dev as it’s a different vertical than what they are looking for.\n\nSecond company interview didn't send any prep, passed the second round which was a live 1 hour coding test in RN, third round was a discussion on architecture with some white-boarding. Passed it until they pulled a gotcha right at the end with 15 minutes to go. Gave me another coding test on JS fundementals, which I passed, not satisfied they deleted that one and gave me another with 5 minutes to go that I couldn't finish in the allotted time. They haven't even bothered to get back to me.\n\nI question the people who decided the processes to be honest, I don't think they know what they're looking for. The whole process feels broken because they don't know how to handle the whole AI aspect of things.",

The overzealous vibe coder trope.\n\nWhat that underlying question is looking for is not to shit talk AI and be dismissive of it, nor is it to circle-jerk over AI and how it's revolutionized your life. It wants a more measured answer that talks about the pros/cons of AI, where it's useful, where it's not, and demonstrating understanding that it needs to be used with caution no matter where it's used.\n\nWe all get that it's not good at complex tasks. We all get that it sucks at being able to understand business logic to do anything useful. We all get it sucks when it needs to work in a large codebase across multiple files.\n\nBut it has some pros you didn't seem to mention at all.... the biggest one, which is what I use it for regularly, is as a faster Stack Overflow. Back in the day, when I was getting some error I wasn't sure why I was getting, I'd go Google that error. Then I'd sift through Stack Overflow questions until I find one that's close enough related to what I was doing that it can push me in the right direction, and usually hit my head against a wall until things finally work.\n\nNowadays when I get an error, I type into Copilot \"Why am I getting \\[pasted error\\]?\". Copilot looks at my code, scours the internet/docs to find answers that are directly relevant to my code, and can give me relevant answers way faster than I could get on my own. It's of course not always right on the first try, but with a follow up prompt or 2 I almost always end up with an easy fix with very little effort from me. This is like 90% of what I use AI for, and it's absolutely been a massive benefit.\n\nI also like it for very mundane tasks that are conceptually simple, but are time consuming. Coming up with unit tests is one. AI can easily read code paths, and shit out enough tests to get good coverage. It's usually pretty bad at *implementing* the unit tests, but I can take over from there, it did the boring part for me.\n\nAI's also great at just asking general questions. Why read through AWS's terrible docs when I can ask a single prompt, and get a right answer most of the time.\n\nI'm on your side that I think AI's pretty bad at doing most code generation tasks beyond very simple or very isolated stuff.... but you're being overly dismissive if you can't think of any ways it can make your life easier.",

And this is super risky but I’d probably still do it, whatever certs you are aiming for, put them on your resume already and spam that resume out there.  Try to think of any of that type of devops work you were exposed to in your career even if briefly, and highlight it on a second version of your resume and use that to target devops roles.  \n\nUse your current resume with your it skills and spam those out for any it roles.  It is taking forever to get interviews these days, just assume you’ll have time to complete the certs before you get the interview and cram studying for those things.\n\nOne other suggestion, you can use ChatGPT for questions like this and it does an amazing job of telling you the possibilities and also generating a step by step plan… give it a shot!",

For technical skills someone typically is assigned to help mentor and onboard and teach you/docs to read etc. Having to mentor someones social skills is a lot more awkward and I doubt anyone wants to explicitly be told they need to do that. So a lot is on the individual if they know they need to grow that area and practice it themselves\n\nAnd then with technical skills there’s a lot of room to make mistakes and failsafes to catch you. With QA/canary/code review/rollbacks etc and even if a mistake makes it to prod typically it’s fine and a learning experience. Whereas in a social setting first impressions are very important. As you mentioned it can be awkward at first but unfortunately that impression can stick\n\nIt’s definitely not untrainable but trickier",

        "body": "I mean literally every post on Reddit tells you this lol.\n\nAnyway, I was always a weird nerd, hung around nerds, shy non-popular guys etc. But because I was always great at sport and athletic I would hang around jocks and even gangsters so I learned how to get along with alot of different people.\n\nThis is a big question so there's nowhere to start really but for Reddit I will say this, biggest killers for the guys here are the following: Introverted, self awareness and over-valuing intelligence. I can explain lol.\n\n1. Introverted: People use this as a self-built cage rather than just a label. It shouldn't even be a label the way this word has a mental hold on people on Reddit. Firstly, yes you can be naturally inclined toward introversion or extraversion, but there's caveats. Being introverted or extroverted doesn't neccessarily mean bad at social interaction versus good. I've seen plenty of extraverts who fucking suck at social situations and introverts who are great, they just prefer to be alone more often. You can be good at social skills and continue to carry your special little introvert label if you want, it's just going to be a little harder than if you were an extravert ***simply because you're getting in less reps.*** An extrovert will try and fail more = more chance for success. Also, you can switch between being introverted or extroverted, this isn't WoW where you can't cast a spell because you chose the paladin class. You're allowed to try being extroverted for a week, year, decade if you want.\n\nLike OP said it will feel weird at first, but ask any guy who got ripped from being fat if he felt like a natural in the gym the first day he picked up a weight. Nope, he worked through the pain and embarassment and got the reward. The good thing about social skills is that it doesn't even take that long, nor do you have to always be the social guy.. you can just learn the skills and keep it in your back pocket until you need it.\n\n2. Self awareness: Reddit copes alot by thinking that extraverts in engineering are just \"smooth talkers\" wrong. Smooth talking is a skill that comes with social skills, but it's not the whole pie. Some social people over-use smooth talking and get found out real quick and exposed, luckily here on Reddit we're all extremely intelligent and know what's best for the world so that won't be our issue... right?\n\nThere's a negative connotation in engineering for having good social skills and confidence. I get laughed at by my friends for having \"good english\" and \"talking shit\".. like that's something to be embarassed about? In reality, I have great language skills to explain things to people of all levels, and I can basically nail down concepts into managable pieces for customers to understand without confusing them with jargon.. that's a skill that requires intelligence, humility and understanding concepts. Engineering isn't just about calculating numbers really fast, or memorising a fourier transform, we're here to sell products and create ideas. You NEED to be able to communicate those ideas or else the math and physics is lost in the void. What's the point of being able to create nuclear power if the government is scared of it and thus bans it because you can't explain to them why it's neccessary. \n\n3. over-valuing intelligence: In the sense that people here like to min/max intel stats, that's great. More intelligence is always good, but again that's not a license for you to suck at conveying your ideas or to treat people like shit. Yes conceptually a team of really high intel nerds will be good for a company, but in reality we live in a market where we need to promote ideas and actually be able to understand from person to person. You can't do that by being very intelligent but a dick or can't explain your ideas to people in simple terms.",

That is a young person's game, not the game of someone who no longer puts their career as the most important tentpole in their lives above friends/family/fulfillment/stability. Also, the industry by the time you are that age could be a totally different landscape (like it was for them).\n\nIn general though, I find almost nobody sticks with the same career path their whole lives. It's a far better trait to be adaptable and smart in this world we currently live in than pigeonhole yourself into a specific career. School makes you think you go to school and always stick with the same path. It never really turns out that way. Most do at least lateral shifts if not major ones.",

You may not notice this much if you are young, single, and generally in good health, but its HUUGE when you have kids. I have twins.\n* the employee 'type' doesn't change how I engage w/ my coworkers - i'm a bit of a jokester and always try to lighten the mood, make work fun - to me that makes sense just cause, in theory i'm sitting next to you 8 hrs a day, i better like clocking in. But a lot of folks prefer keeping work & personal separate, that's totally fine too.\n* with regards to layoffs, generally in my exp contractors are 'first to go' of the engineers - not first to go like let go, they just don't renew your contract. A much bigger/critical layoff usually they cut ties with the staffing agency completely, i've seen.\n* for me it's all about stability, longevity, benefits. my contract ends just before december but i only recently started and i'm trying to bust my ass to get an extension / converted\n* not being eligible for some of the better FTE perks, sucks. Its like, I work just as much as any other person on the team, it'd be nice if i can be included in certain things \n\nThere's some things i like - like being held to 40 hrs a week, any overtime needs approval and you actually can get paid for it. generally that means i'm off the hook for pagerduty.

I have always preferred FTE in the past because you get the good salary, there is no waiting to see if you get extended, the benefits will be better, you get PTO, and paid holidays.  And who knows, you might even get a bonus, and a promotion.   Who knows!\n\nI seemed to fall into temporary contract work when FTE positions were not available.   I never minded doing some contract work.   I didn't worry about office politics like the OP said.   In some cases, I got holiday pay and even bonuses from some contracting companies.   But what I didn't like was short term extensions.   I worked for one client who did first 6 months, then another 6 months, and then it was 3 months, and then 3 months.   I had to leave.    I told my manager, who was a great person BTW, that I simply can't keep extending for 3 months.   As soon as you start the 3 months, you need to start looking again halfway through ... if you;re going to extend me, at least make it for some length of time, but I know she didn't control the money, so that was that.\n\nNowadays, I've been getting laid off a lot, the FTE roles don't seem to last very long themselves.  Yeah, you might get some extra benefits from FTE, but longevity isn't one of them.     I definitely have friends who have been contracting at one client for years and years, they have been around longer than most FTE employees.  They just keep getting extended, and they know the work, and it's not hard.    \n\nSo, pros and cons for each ..........",

You don’t have to have a maxed out charisma stat, you need to not be miserable for your coworkers to interact with. I have ADHD for example and I interrupt my coworkers all the time but they live with me.\n\nADHD is a poor proxy for understanding what it’s like to live with autism, so please do not take this as me attempting to be reductionist toward legitimate struggles, but one thing I have found helpful is to stop assuming my condition is the barrier I’m facing. It might CONTRIBUTE to the barrier, but plenty of people before and after me have had ADHD undiagnosed their entire lives and they never even knew. I’m glad mental health is so well-known these days, but these conditions are not new and plenty before us have succeeded. Being a bit quiet, or loud, or odd, or by-the-book, or socially inexperienced are not traits limited to people with autism or ADHD. And all of us can improve.\n\nI had crippling social anxiety starting my first job and now I’m getting promoted and my boss explicitly mentioned I’m extremely well-liked in the office. People like my empathy more than they give a damn about my ADHD. Gen Z in general struggles with social skills because we were locked in a room during COVID for core developmental years.\n\nDon’t panic, you’ll be fine.\n\nedit: and watch The Residence on Netflix if you haven’t.

Like, you know, fortune striking them at just the right moments.\n\nTake Steve Jobs as an example. People often point out that he was poor, which is true, but he also got some extraordinary breaks that almost nobody gets. He met Wozniak, who happened to be a genius at building computers, at exactly the right time. Woz let Jobs run with the business side, they launched their first product, it took off immediately, and suddenly Jobs was financially independent. Apple went on an upward spiral so fast he never really saw any serious failure early in his life. That kind of alignment is rare.\n\nIf you’re coming from very humble beginnings, you usually need multiple strokes of luck like that to become extremely successful. Getting to moderate success or financial independence is possible with hard work, but the billionaire-level outcomes are much harder without serious tailwinds.\n\nFinance and tech both show this in different ways. Finance is even more network-heavy. Running a fund is all about raising money, and raising money is basically a game of connections. Technology is also about contacts in the Valley when it comes to big fundraising rounds, but the barrier to entry can be lower.\n\nSo if you’re poor, you can still make it, but you’ll need a lot of luck. Even if you claw your way up, the climb is steeper. No contacts, no capital, and no safety net mean it will take much longer to reach the same level as someone who started with connections.",

However, based on what you wrote, you and many others have been both mislead and duped by these influencers. Many influencers show off a lavish life style funded by millions of dollars in debt. They aren't rich by any means. Only faking it.\n\n>I’ve noticed that in tech communities especially software engineering, there’s a lot of emphasis on talking about compensation packages, benefits, and perks. You see it everywhere from “Day in the Life” YouTube videos where someone shows off their free lunches, nap pods, and flexible schedules, to posts comparing salaries across companies.\n\nTech encompasses a wide range of compensation, benefits and perks. What you see on social media is the top 10% of all tech. It would look completely different - perhaps even bleak, if someone actually showed the day in the life of a median (50th percentile) or worst (100th percentile) job.\n\nThey certainly don't have free lunches, nap pods, and may be even lucky if they get free coffee. They might be filling out time-sheets and staring down some of the worst-maintained technology with very strict deadlines and constraints for changes. Depending on the country, the median can range anywhere from $40K-80K. Does that sound super cushy to you?\n\n>Don’t get me wrong, I get why this happens. Tech jobs *can* be cushy, with relaxed work environments, decent pay, and nice benefits. That kind of lifestyle is attractive to students and career switchers. But sometimes it feels like people act as if tech is the *only* field with these kinds of perks, which isn’t true.\n\nDo you really get why this happens?\n\nBased off of your perspective you don't. The phenomenon is more broadly categorized as \"keeping up with the jones\" within the last century. Only with the internet it has allowed people to share their accomplishments across a larger audience that would not have been possible before.\n\nPreviously such people would only be able to reach as far as people similarly within their economic circle. People irrespectively have been comparing themselves to others within their social circle for millennia. The rich compared themselves with other rich. The poor compared themselves to other poor. The middle class compared themselves to other middle class. Its competition, its standard human nature that we haven't grown out of.\n\nThe internet and more specifically Social Media has given everyone a microphone to broadcast themselves.\n\n>There are plenty of non-tech office jobs that can be just as cushy and well-compensated, if not more so in some cases. For example:\n\nAny job can be cushy if you're in the right positions. But your perspective is off-keel and your barking up the wrong trees. Within ALL professions, there is the top, middle, and bottom. What you see on social media being \"cushy\" jobs is nothing more than a facade - including in the industries you mentioned. They are designed to spark envy.\n\nMany of these high paying jobs are not \"cushy\" in the slightest - at least if people are actually performing their job. These so-called benefits only exist to extract more work hours out of staff. You get subjected to the political machinations resulting from the Jack Welsh Rank-And-Yank (the Hunger Games).",

Rinse and repeat, and your entire career is just shit job after shit job.\n\nIt's a hard cycle to break once you're in it, because you never ditch that feeling of desperation.\n\nLayoff/management changes aren't really unique to our industry. What is fairly unique to this industry is our painful interviews, which only makes it harder to get out of the deadly spiral once you're in it because you're both burnt out from your shit job, *and* the shit interview process. Double burnout.\n\n>How do I just find some peace in this field?\n\nSo the things you're talking about re: stress, unrealistic deadlines, mismanagement, shit culture, etc aren't *inherent* of this field. They're inherent of toxic companies. The trick is finding a company that isn't toxic. Just because a company has lower pay doesn't mean they'll be lower stress/not toxic. Just because a company has higher pay doesn't mean they'll be higher stress/toxic.\n\nThis requires you to get really get at reverse-interviewing to sus out companies like that, *and* to be able to have the patience to not humor offers from companies that sound like they'll have cultures like that. I've said \"No thanks\" to plenty of companies.\n\nI've worked at 4 companies since graduating, 2 more if you count my internships, and I'd only describe one of them as turning toxic. That one was *great* to work for for about 2 years, but they had a CTO change who slowly tried to turn up the heat on the devs, which resulted in me and most of the good devs jumping ship before it got really bad. The other 5 companies though? Great WLB/cultures. I left one because I wanted to move to the east coast (100% onsite days), some of my friends are *still there* 12 years into their career. I left another one cause I was sick of the industry it was in, but honestly this was probably a mistake. The 3rd was the one I said turned toxic after 2 years. The one I'm at now is still smooth sailing over a year in.\n\nGood companies are out there. You just have to find them.",

Insane constraints (oh hey - now 90% of your code has to be crapped out by claude - enjoy!).  More politics than DC.\n\nThe mba's are only 2nd to the tech school grads in terms of being insufferable.   Everyone critiques everything endlessly and in the end it doesn't matter how impactful you are - someone else takes credit upstairs for everything.\n\nSucceed in this cesspool and you are rewarded with more and harder work while the execs hire their college buddies and leaders from companies they acquire fill every high level tech roll without so much as an interview.  You will stay in the mines and you will like it!\n\nAnd that's the thing... you kinda can.   If you let go a little and you don't worry about that next promo - or the product - or the customers or any of it.   At the end of the day you take a task - you do it and you move on.   It's kinda fun that way.\n\nNo it won't make you a superstar.   But - if you are looking for respite that's where I've found it when I needed it.   In the day to day grind. \n\nIgnore the politics and the idiots - don't volunteer for anything.   Don't attend any optional meetings or answer anything on slack that you don't have to respond to.  Let someone else do it.  Give yourself luxurious timelines and estimates and then just code for a while.  The code is fun - it's interesting - it's a never ending experiment in order and logic.   It's the best part of the job.  Don't worry about fixing the architecture or righting any ships - just do the fun bit.  Let others code be buggy - let the tests be a joke - let the libraries be undocumented and uncommented... and for all that's holy - don't worry about upgrading anything.   Just code for a while.  Methodically and quietly grind out some tasks and see how you feel.\n\nEventually my ambition has always gotten the best of me and i've had to escape those easy orbits - but others stay there and seem\nhappy to me.

They brought in a consultant who tried to talk down to me and make me back down. This guy looked me in the face and said “I don’t know if you’re worth $150K, $40k or what.” After one or two weeks of back and forth like that, I gave up and just started searching. About 2 weeks after I stopped talking about it, I think the CEO figured out I was probably not happy, and gave me their promised pay bump. I gave my two weeks a few days after. \n\nI learned two things from that experience, first you have a choice in what you spend your energy on. It can be fighting for a raise, or it can be find a healthier and better position. It’s up to you. Second, if you have to justify your value to someone else, and your salary is a measure of your value, then either you value your self too highly, or they don’t value you enough, either way, this always leads to a toxic environment and you should probably just bow out. \n\nNow, I don’t even really bring up salary points. I just tell my manager if I feel valued, and this is what I do for the company, and they get the message and talk to their manager about getting a raise because they value me.

Those have nearly all disappeared - so don't get your hopes up in landing a job at the few that remain. Remote is now tied to the local market rate for talent, and even takes a haircut for the \"convenience\" of being remote.\n\nBefore you do something irrational in an otherwise crappy job market, evaluate the \"total value\" of your setup which includes:\n\n1. Your total compensation (base, bonus, equity)\n2. Your company provided benefits.\n3. The convenience of being able to WFH (reduced transportation costs, time savings, reallocated travel time to fitness/health/wellbeing)\n4. The social benefits provided by your country (health care, pharmacare, etc)\n5. The purchasing power you have per euro/dollar spent\n\nIts very important that you actually measure the value of (#3-5) in order to compare the \"real compensation\" you earn. Most folks younger in their careers only measure #1, and #2 only comes nominally later when you have kids. As a result they are easier to manipulate when the industry is in a boom.\n\nYou should index your total compensation against the percentiles for your country. 73K euro could put you in the top 5%, 10% (many european countries), 15% (e.g. Canada), or 30% (e.g. US) of earners depending on the country you reside in. This will help you ground your expectations a little more.\n\nIts not wrong to demand more compensation for increased scope of responsibility and outcomes delivered. However, you want to weigh your situation before engaging in a confrontation with your company/CEO. If you already have a better offer lined up, then the risk versus reward of engaging in the confrontation is tipped in your favor. If you're in a low percentile earner in your country/region (e.g. 80-100%), then you may not have much to lose and more to gain.\n\nThere is a good time to engage in this kind of dialogue, and a bad time to do so. Good times are when there is lots of hiring, easy-to-find opportunities, and very few people available to replace you. At this very moment in 2025, it is a bad time to engage in wage negotiations without something like a Union backing you. Depending on the percentile compensation, there are many people willing to take up the task.",

It was supposed to be a machine learning model, but instead was just like 50k lines of a \"transform\" (insert data science is just if-else statements meme). The teams down-stream who were relying on the output of this thing are now way behind and several projects aren't going to hit their 2025 deadlines.\n\n\nI dunno, I just think that's extremely funny, because only 3 months ago our company had us go to a workshop where Big A was talking up their agentic tools.

So if you’re the same my advice there is to approach everything in a similar way, learn the underlying concepts (even if they’re “outdated”) before moving onto the more modern approaches. For instance, with frontend web, just start with plain HTML/CSS/JS, then start bringing in some libraries like JQuery (or maybe could skip this part), then move onto more modern frameworks like React, etc. And similarly when learning something like React, just start with that, then later start integrating other libraries into it (say for state management, etc.). \n\nWhat parts of git, CI/CD, unit testing, DBs, are you struggling with?\n\nAlso maybe some books on different architectural design topics might help with the OOP or general software design principles.",

Frameworks are abstractions of behavior. And like most of the not low level software, it's made up of low level software. So maybe read up on how to make a rest server from the ground up. Or how to use JS to create a simple framework. Granted that's if you want to go in that area.\n\nAlternative look for roles more focused on C/Unix, you can also start using AI tools to judge your code and see what they come up with. As much as we hate AI it can be used to learn what to learn. Ask what's expected of a Dev in a role you want, then make it give you a small project to practice the skills you are lacking. But keep in mind that you can't simply code for yourself, you gotta pretend someone will have to use your code sooner rather than later. 5 years ago getting feedback on thst without coworkers was hard, but now you can ask AI to help you figure out how to do something better.\n\nGit and CI/CDs are tools, learn them like such, an online class for git will teach you more than you need.\n\nTesting your own code should just become 2nd nature to you for low level, it's just code that verified other code is doing what you expect it to. Web framework tests have more in mind depending what you are testing, so I wouldn't touch that just yet.\n\nAs for OOP C code, have you tried looking at how some popular repos do it? Tbh certain languages have poor OOP implementations so it will always look ugly for them. And tbh some OOP code will be ugly regardless due to the complexity they can accumulate.\n\nDon't give up!

Will you be a 1099 contractor?\n\nIf yes to the above questions then you'll have an opportunity to open a solo 401k. Why a solo 401k? Say you leave your main employer. You now have the option to rollover your 401k funds into the solo 401k. This is opposed to doing a rollover to an IRA.\n\nWhy do this?\n\nWith a solo 401k you get two advantages:\n\n* Controlling the fund menu within a 401k. Meaning you can have access to favorable funds.\n* Keeping your money outside of pretax IRA space. This is important if you are doing the backdoor Roth IRA strategy where a positive pretax IRA balance will influence pro rata taxation on traditional IRA to Roth IRA conversions.\n\nThere is also a third advantage.\n\nA 401k has an annual limit for both employee and employer contributions. For 2025 employee contribution limit is $23.5k. Employer limit is $46.5k. So a total of $70k.\n\nThe employee limit is the aggregate of all 401ks under your name within the calendar year. The employer limit is **per 401k acccount**. In other words if you have access to two 401ks and actively working for both employers then you can, at maximum, have access to $23.5k + 2 \\* $46.5k = $116.5k space. This scales up with every 401k you have access to.\n\nSo with the solo 401k you can contribute 20% of your net self-employment income on the employer contribution side of things.\n\nYou just need a valid reason to open a solo 401k. Once it is open it can remain open even if you no longer generate self employment income.",

You sound like you would be fine to turn down the offer.\n\nMy 2c I don’t like the line about feeling confident about remote leadership, and I say this as a 99% WFH leader. It just sounds misplaced. \n\nI would just tell her straight up that you would have a very hard time with relocating for family reasons and if it means you have to stay an IC then you are ok with that. This is one of those rare cases I’d use your wife as the bad guy and say she’s not down with it and that she would make you seriously consider looking for new jobs if you were forced to. Makes the convo a little easier since it deflects blame from you directly and most decent managers understand that good employers dont want to force marital stress on an employee.\n\nAfter the dust has settled you can talk about remote leadership, but if they are already viewing it as a requirement to move, then more likely you just stay on as IC.",

While the official stance was similar to what you mentioned, my director personally informed me that not relocating would automatically put me at the front of the line in the event of future layoffs. At that point, the company would no longer consider performance and would instead look for a valid reason. I took the advice and relocated because voluntarily resigning without any offer in hand, in today's job market, was a big no. Guess what, most people who refused to relocate ended up without jobs six months later. \n\nMy advice: If you are planning to reject the relocation, start looking outside immediately. Never trust your manager's sweet words. He/She won't get a say when the company decides something. This is a huge red flag.",

You need to not only finish your own work but also grow people and that’s pretty hard to do remotely. Maybe you are the exception… Have you done that successfully while leading junior dev’s growth remotely? you just confident because you’ve been an effective IC remotely? Those are two different things, tbh. Your manager’s concern is not unfounded. Especially since you’ve never been a manager before. Learning how to be a manager as a remote manager…good luck. I’ve had 3 remote managers at this point in my career and none of them grew me nearly as much as my co-located managers.\n\nAlso, managers are supposed to (imo) shield their reports from unnecessary office politics as much as possible. How would you do that if you aren’t even in the office to keep tabs on the said office politics? Your reports, especially the junior ones who don’t know how to manager up, may suffer alone and not know whom to turn to or how to deal with it.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind…it’s fine to stay an IC and prioritize family. Not every stage of your career has to be growth oriented. Please don’t become a manager for the sake of the next promotion - those usually end up the worst managers. Become a manager when you are ready to mentor and grow people. When you are thinking about starting a family, it’s ok to take a backseat and coast/autopilot a bit in your current job. You can always become a manager later. But your kid(s) only grow up once.",

You're not alone, you are capable, and if nobody else has said it, I fully believe in you. Build cool stuff you want to build while you're applying to jobs. Apply to those jobs anyways, because most skills are taught on the job in the first 6 months.\n\nI never finished my degree, however, I did take a lot of college courses on computer science. I have to be honest, college really does not teach you much in terms of preparing you for working on the job. If you think about it, it makes sense, a lot of jobs require you to understand tooling, specific frameworks, working within a team building, large-scale applications, etc. \n\nThe issue is that frameworks change, if you spent a semester learning Spring, .NET, NEXT.JS, they could all have insane updates mid-semester that would require the professor to alter their coursework mid-semester. With that being said, this stuff is really hard to teach. The tech industry is constantly moving forward and evolving. \n\nBecause of this, a lot of degrees in computer science focus on theory, data structures and algorithms, maybe programming language fundamentals and, if you pick a specific focus, AI for example, GIS, or game design or whatever, you learn that niche.\n\nThat's why a lot of jobs don't require degrees and seldom hire Junior developers that have degrees. Especially in today's job market. People with degrees can prove that they made it through their coursework and they might have some capstone projects under their belt. But they can't code their way out of a wet paper bag, or they don't have a lot of real on-the-job experience. You shouldn't let that stop you though.\n\nYou should know that you are good at what you do, you have the degree. You've proven that you can do the work even if you just coasted. Just work on a bunch of personal projects, building stuff that interests you. It doesn't have to be big or glamorous, just stuff you enjoy. You will quickly gain a skill set that you would want to enter the job market for. It could be full stack development, mobile development, game development, front end, back end, big data, whatever. Right now, just focus on building cool shit. \n\nA lot of programmers leaving college are in the exact same boat you are in. They have a degree, they're kind of good at coding, and they understand theory, now what? I'll just say this as a trade secret, 90% of engineers that have a job, learned what they know now on the job. Unless you're applying to mid to senior level roles or doing contract work, most jobs teach you everything during \"ramp up\" which usually takes about 6 months. \n\nYou got this, man. Take it one day at a time and don't be discouraged if you get rejected constantly. The job market is tough right now but, I believe in you. Good luck.",

Basically a bunch of workers from Korea working in setting up a US facility and training US workers were arrested by immigration over what seems like a big mixup.\n* The last budget bill ended the long streak of Tech support  started by the Obama administration.

For example meta e3 is new grad and you actually can’t have experience (I think you need less than 1) , so above that you can be E4, if you have the experience you might be E5, if you have 3 yoe but you experience aligns highly with what they want and you perform well in interviews they might up level you to E5 (rare).\n\nAlso L6 is not necessarily best engineer or something. You can move up your career just having a lot of luck too (probably still a good worker). I know someone at my company who went from L3 equivalent to L6 equivalent in 1 year (internal job change, pm).\n\nYou move up by showing that you have already been performing at that level. Sometimes you can’t move up though due to budget and other office politic reasons.",

She was transparent about her thoughts and feelings.\n\nEnter her boss, our group manager. He was the long standing ride the coattails to success type. He knew nothing about anything, but he ruled with an iron fist, and it was his way or the highway. Between my manager and our 12 person team, of which she was easily the smartest and most experienced, know who the ONLY PERSON laid off was when the company did a 5% layoff?\n\nYou guessed it. Her only “crime” was that she often frequently disagreed with his opinions on how to manage the projects (which were years behind schedule now thanks to him). And the group manager had a meeting with everyone else the same day to say “I had no part in this.” Meanwhile, he had quickly become the laughing stock of the team. He would get off department calls, and the second he hung up, one of our managers would say, “oh good, he’s gone, now we can get some real work done.” So…\n\nFortunately for me, the business saw how little value he was bringing within 6 months after, and suddenly he was forced out in a matter of months once his old boss (and best friend) left him high and dry to pursue a higher position.\n\nI hate to admit it, but someone once told me, “50% of your career is what you know, and 50% is who you know.” I’d hate to think they are right, but I’ll\nbe damned if there isn’t a pole of evidence to support it.",

I was labeled a \"temp worker\" with no benefits or PTO, yet I was given consistent a 40 hour schedule each week, with no expected end date. And was doing work that was definitely worth far more than what I was being paid.\n\nAll I had when hired was a CS degree, good GPA, tutoring experience, and some data related projects. (machine learning based, but was a good example of data handling as well)\n\nI just kept taking on more challenges because they didn't have others who could do it. my suggestion is to aim for old \"fossil\" type non-tech companies. they are trying to modernize so they want people with these skills, but they don't pay super well, and wont have any mentors for you. They will like people who can independently teach themselves how to work with new systems. If you can make a pivot table in excel, your basically a wizard in those places. lots of room for recognition and self development.",

Just in case, let's assume that 100k doesn't include the interest rate. If you don't know it, find it and calculate how much you will truly owe on top of the 100k. Come back or go forth with the number you get; it will define what options are, for you, realistic. \n\n  \nTry not to panic.

New residents and med students with kids in particular may be looking to nanny share to save some money. \n\nYour other option is to aggresively consolidate your day and hire in-home help for that time. For example, make your working hours 9AM-1PM (or whatever). Find a part time nanny who is willing to do 4 hours per day. Then tell work that your hours for meetings and other syncronous work have shifted into that mid-day block or to hours when your husband is home. \n\nBoth of these options, a nanny share or a part time nanny, will run you a similar cost to high quality infant daycare, but will keep your child from getting sick with all of the daycare sicknesses. It's also better for babies that small to be home. Group care is just not the best option for that age, so if you can avoid it, you should.

My wife is a PM at a startup (she has anywhere from 2-4 hours of meetings a day), I'm a senior dev at a more established company (I have 30 minutes of meetings per day), and we both WFH full time. Also, I often can get away with working 10 hour weeks but the occasional crunch time for a project means I'm working 40 hours. My wife had \\~3 months of maternity leave and I had 2 weeks of PTO that I used all up front when the babies were born. Ours were also underbaked (lol) at 37 weeks which is actually full term for twins. Our twins for the first \\~4 months were also EXTREMELY clingy and could not be put down. We we wearing them almost all hours of the day.\n\nOur original plan was to attempt to balance them between meetings and work - we thought this might be feasible since my meeting schedule is so light and my working hours are extremely flexible.\n\nTowards the end of my wife's maternity leave, we realized things were only getting harder with the twins. On days where I happen to have a few extra meetings and she does as well (nearly every day for her) we really didn't have a backup plan other than 2 screaming babies behind me on camera or me skipping meetings. \n\nSo in the final week before she went back to work, we hired a nanny who came to our house to watch the babies from 9-2. That offered us enough time to get things down and squeeze our meetings into this time window and then do any work we needed to follow up with later in the evening. Even this was not a very sustainable lifestyle as we found ourselves far too often working into the night when we were exhausted from taking care of twins most of the day. Our nanny didn't end up working out - she was unable to care for the babies as they needed a caretaker who had more energy (you can read my previous posts for more context here) so we ended up letting her go a few weeks ago and we are currently on week 3 of working while taking care of the twins. Let me tell you, it is extremely difficult. I take meetings in my airpods with screaming babies and then run out of the room to give my scrum update and then immediately after (2 min later) run back into the room to continue looking after them. I take meetings on walks. I cram as much work into their short nap windows as I possibly can. My wife and I both work late into the night to make it work. It is HARD. I would not wish it on anyone.\n\nMy wife just put in her 2 weeks notice and work and I just landed a new job that gives me a raise to cover enough of her loss in comp that we should be fine for her to just be full time SAHM for now.\n\nTLDR;\n\nMy situation is slightly different than yours - 2 WFH parents with 2 babies. But I think you also will find (especially with your heavy meeting load) that it's just not sustainable. You might make it work for a few weeks but inevitably you'll find that you can't dedicate enough effort to either work or your baby and likely both will suffer for it.\n\nMy advice would be to spend the time now (before you go back to work) finding people in your network/community/neighborhood who would be interested in nanny sharing and then find ways if possible to reduce spending in other areas of your life to free up some funds for this. It's not going to be easy. But it will likely be SO MUCH easier than trying to do everything yourself.\n\nDM me or I can put you in contact with my wife if you have any questions!",

Just like your baby, she never wants to be put down, so most of her naps are in my arms.\n\nI’m fairly certain I’m going to be laid off when I return to work so I’ve been doing interview prep and rewriting my resume. Maybe do a trial run of trying to take care of your baby while also doing those type of tasks. Is it doable at all? I’ve found it to be really tricky but maybe you’ll have better luck. If you are able to make some progress here, you’ll be one step ahead if you decide the changes at your company aren’t something you want to deal with. Searching for a job while you have a job is better than searching when you need one.\n\nIf it isn’t doable, then I think daycare is the right call. From what I’ve heard, babies do adjust to daycare once they get into a routine, so I’m sure your little one will be ok!",

I returned to work after a 12 week leave, and I was also very scared and anxious about leaving my daughter in daycare. She attended three days per week and my husband WFH the other two days and took turns watching her. We worked evenings and weekends to make up for it. When she became mobile, we sent her to daycare four days per week.\n\nIt's hard to WFH with a baby. It can be done, but you're really doing both your job and your baby a disservice. Luckily we found an amazing daycare with teachers and staff we trust. Our daughter adjusted really easily - it even helped her establish a good schedule and nap in a crib! We truly consider daycare as part of our \"village.\"\n\nI hope you have an amazing remainder of maternity leave and soak up all those sweet snuggles. Ultimately, you'll have to do what's best for yourself and your family. I just wanted to share my personal experience.",

It's totally normal if the parts \"far\" away from where you normally work you don't know so well. Nobody will care whether or not you can describe how CAN signaling works. You should probably at least be able to describe what it looks like when the CAN messages are delivered to you though.\n\nThis in particular is a red flag, so hopefully it's a joke:\n\n>“Tell me something about RTOS”\n\n>“Uhhhh…you have tasks and the scheduler schedules them….”\n\nYou've worked on this thing for 2 years and haven't put in the work to understand *any* part of it? An open ended question like this is really your time to shine, you get to steer the conversation. Be able to crush those kinds of questions.\n\nAnd to be clear here, you don't have to know everything about it by any stretch. But you should have at least a couple nuggets of hard-fought learning. Something you debugged or implemented where you had to go brush up a bit?\n\nYou're going to get questions about work you've done, and you want to be able to hit more or less these couple items in the response\n\n1. What problem you were trying to solve with the example you give?\n2. What did your changes build leverage from the layer below, how is the layer above going to use them?\n3. How does what you did work, to a decent level of detail?\n4. What tradeoffs are there to consider?\n5. How did you validate what you did?\n\nThink back to some tasks you've done and try to answer those questions about them. Try just writing the answers down, don't worry about how long it takes you.\n\nIf you're not able to do it, even after some time and thought, you need to start revisiting how you're trying to grow your skills as an engineer. Make sure you understand the context around stuff you are doing. Occasionally take something apart you don't understand, even if it works, just to learn it better.\n\nIf you're able to do it after taking a breath and pondering on it a bit, then you probably just need to work on your speaking skills and confidence a bit. Running through the jot it down exercise will help you there as well. If you have some willing friends, try just explaining stuff to them, and have them ask you questions about it.\n\nAnd hey, no need to despair, these are all things you can practice and improve. Most of us deal with some level of imposter syndrome too, you're not the first guy in this situation and you won't be the last. Put in the effort and you'll be just fine.\n\n  \nGood luck!",

        "body": "Most general software engineering roles at big tech companies won't grill you on CAN transceiver internals or RTOS scheduling algorithms unless you're specifically applying for embedded positions. These companies care way more about your ability to solve algorithmic problems, design systems, and write clean code than whether you can explain bit timing from memory. The embedded knowledge you do have actually gives you a solid foundation in systems thinking and low-level concepts that many general SWE candidates lack entirely.\n\nYou're probably overthinking this transition. Your embedded background demonstrates you can work with complex systems, debug tricky issues, and understand performance constraints - all valuable skills that translate well to general software development. Focus your prep time on the things that actually matter for these roles: data structures and algorithms, system design, and getting comfortable with the languages and frameworks they use. The fact that you can navigate codebases and solve problems is exactly what they're looking for, not your ability to recite protocol specifications.\n\nI'm on the team that built [AI for interviews](http://interviews.chat), and we've seen plenty of engineers successfully transition between specialties by focusing their interview prep on the core competencies that matter most for their target roles.",

        "body": "I came from defense company where i worked on a radar for 4 years. I then went into one of the companies you listed and worked in their cloud services for aobut 3 years. \n\nYour concerns are valid. \n\nI dont know how closely related my first job is to your job but here was my experience. \n\nAt defense, work life balance was a lot better. I didnt have to think about work after 5 pm. The tasks were good enough to keep me engaged but i didnt need to know anything crazy or expand my knowledge really. You could get by and not understand everything. So when you said the quote about not really understanding RTOS, i get that because i worked on things that at the time if you asked me to explain it, tbh i only knew the basic overview of it, not the ins and outs. One of my tasks was actually coding a lot of the receiver and transceiver code too lol. But i was a big overperformer even if i only did like 20 hours a week and chilled the rest. In defense, nobody really disagreed as everybody was just there to give their hours and go. We never really dealt with customers as our project wasnt fully completed. \n\nAfter 4 years i wanted to go for bigger and better and i got in the big tech company (again it's one of the ones you lsited). They wont give you an embedded engineer to ask you things but they may ask you a system design question and the question could be related to what you have experienced at your current job. So youd have to explain how the receive and transceiver work for example. When it comes to coding questions, i think praciticng leetcode and really understanding Data structures is good enough. I think the problem in the interview iwll come when they ask questions like \"tell me a time you disagreed with an older engineer/customer?\" or \"tell me a time you had to deal with an angry customer?\". Unfortunately in embedded stuff, that doesnt come up as much, especially in defense industry. I cant speak for you job but can you answer those questions?\" The vibe i get from your post is that you just do you and there isnt much pushback from either side. \n\nAlso, be careful chasing these big companies. Like i said i got into one of the cloud systems and for 3 years the work was hectic. I was doing 5x the work and it still wasnt enough for them. I got PIPd after two years and then fired half a year later. Personally the project was just a lot and they expected 60+ hour weeks but it was more like \"only do 40 \\*wink-wink\\*\". Seniors and principals were too stressed and overworked to helpout and get on calls to help jrs. Everything was a meeting. Standups would take 2 hours because they wanted to discuss something. As a mid-level i was expected to lead meetings and projects. The culture was just toxic and the thing is they can be like this because they know there's a million other people gunning for your job. During reviews you were compared to what your coworkers were doing not what was expected of you. so if you exceeded your own expectations, but all your coworkers are working 60+ hours and have 60+ hours of work to show while you only have 40 hours of work ot show, your manager will go \"why are you so behind?\" and telling them you stick to 40 hours isnt enough. Again this isnt all projects in big tech. Like i knew a guy who worked at AWS which is supposed to be the worse of all of them, but his project was very chill where he doesnt think aobut it after 5 pm. It's very project dependent. All im saying is dont just do it for the money and fame, really consider it. There's plenty of big companiees that dotn fall in that faang bucket that pay just as well. Remember our career pays very well regardless of industry. Even if you make 120k, you are making more than most careers. So dont sell your life for that 200k. Apply to these companies, but make sure it is a right fit for you. Also dont fall in love with the bonus/RSUs they will throw everything at the bonus/RSUs to get you in the door, those are not guaranteed. I didnt know this until i got there but RSUs have a long vesting period. At my last job, i didnt get it until my 1 year anniversary and even then i only got like 20% a year and it wouldnt completely vest until my 5th year.",

The error messages are usually very informative you just need to know all the language. And, some less informative errors usually have specific causes.\n\nGetting very comfortable reading a stack trace also helps. In vscode you can command click the stack trace lines in the terminal to go to that part of the code. Usually you can just click the line that is right before an external library call. But, you can also click into external library code stack lines and even edit it if you want to add print statements there.\n\nA few of the tough errors I see people get stuck on are circular imports. But, it's not hard to break those.\n\nA lot of people say to use debuggers. I usually find print statements quicker.\n\nI think it helps if you have a more experienced person that can explain the information you're missing when you get stuck.\n\nThere are some categories of errors I see people get stuck on, but that would be a lot to go over. if theres something in particular you struggle with I could maybe give advice.",

Started at 75k and worked my way to about 90k (not a huge bump but defense doesnt pay that crazy). I decided to jump ship during the last hiring boom of covid. Ended up at a big tech company (one of the bigger ones) for 200k TC. I took it without even thinking. \n\nDefense - i loved my co-workers and was moving up the latter quickly. It was so chill and the work was fun and easy. I did 20 hours of work and chilled the rest of the week. I was my team's scrum master and developer and i didnt think about work after 5 pm and was a top performer. There werent any real deadlines and i could sit on a task for 2 months and nobody complained. \n\nBig tech - things got hectic quickly. I was working for their cloud service. What i didnt know is that cloud is where work life balance goes to die. At first i wanted to respet my balance and stuck to 40 hour weeks for the most part. Then it slowly got more and more hectic and since i was remote id idnt realize my coworkers were pulling 50-60 hour weeks sometimes mroe. so after a year i obviously was behind the rest and even if my work was to my standards, they compared me to my coworkers standards and i got less than average. I drank the kool aid for a year and worked like crazy. Matched the 50-60 hours but i realzied i just didnt lvoe the work but the economy was shit so i kept it going. After a year i got another bad review and a few months later fired. \n\nIm not saying dont take AWS, for the money it sounds amazing. You might have a way better experience than i did. I know someone who works for AWS, has 300k+ in TC and it's one of the easier AWS projects where people sign off at 5pm and dont think about work. They dont even have on-call.  You could land ion a project like that or you could land in a project that requires 80 hours from you in tough weeks. \n\nIm just saying sometimes the fame and fortune isnt what it lives up to be. You need to decide if you will be ok with the potential burnout. Also it's not always you will find a job with coworkers you like.",

You can make it better by fixing root causes, tuning alarms, and pushing back on what’s worth paging.\n\nWill you grind 60–80 hours a week? No. Major incidents can happen, but you can (and should) set boundaries. If you’re up half the night, escalate to your manager, hand off, and rest. That’s encouraged. I never had Slack/email on my phone if it was urgent, they paged. Otherwise, it waited.\n\nMake good use of your time, learn a ton, and enjoy the pay.

I would recommend picking what vibes with you the most since that will help shape your success here. Remember, after a year you can switch teams so you're not on your first team forever.\n\nI work in Infra because I just was never a big product person. I like working on things that make other developers more productive, rather than a new shiny feature. But of course this means my family, friends, etc. never really \"get\" what I actually do or get to see my work, which I'm fine with. If you wanna have the \"Yeah, I built that pride\" then product would be a good fit. For me I looked mostly at the language and general technologies the teams worked with. Once I found a team writing a majority Rust day-to-day it was an easy call for me.\n\nI would talk about org / team pulse scores, oncall workload if any, priorities on the team and for the org. Talk to the EM, the TL, and try to ask to speak with a normal IC on the team 1:1 and just have a conversation.",

Being expected to figure things out on your own in a small team is actually pretty common in consulting. A lot of firms put people on islands where they have to be the expert, even if they’re still learning. It’s not a bad thing but it also means you haven’t had the chance to see how larger dev teams work day to day. \n\nYour role ties with Cloud Engineer or Cloud + Automation Engineer fits well. If you want to move toward joining a dev team, you could focus more on backend development with Python frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, Django) and data tools, while still using your cloud knowledge to stand out. If you want to stay close to infrastructure, doubling down on Azure certifications and automation tools would make you stand out as a cloud engineer. If you’d rather move toward development, deepening your Python, databases, and API building skills will help.\n\nBefore you leave your job, build a clear learning plan, pick projects to show off your skills, and maybe even contribute to open source to give you the momentum you’re looking for. That way, when the market improves, you’ll be ready to land the kind of structured dev team role you’re aiming for.

This project is at a level of 3rd year undergrad student, but definitely not at a 9 YOE level.\n\nIf you're absolutely adamant about looking for a new job now, your best bet is not to bring up this project at all. Focus on your experience, and try to make that sound cool (9 years is hella impressive!). At that point, interviewers rarely care about personal projects. You'll have to learn about how best to present yourself, though.\n\nHowever, if you're not in a rush to find a new position, I'd recommend that you upskill. Try to think about as many interesting and complex features as possible that can be added to your project. The more complex it sounds, the more you'll learn from it. At the very least, learn some basic AI/LLM stuff and add it to your project. Also, your UI looks kinda bad. I get it that you're not a frontend person, but you can just use ChatGPT or whatever LLM of your choice to generate a beautiful UI for you. The first impression anyone gets about your website is from how it looks, so don't make them prejudiced against it by making it look bad.\n\nAs for the freelance - no idea, honestly, don't have any experience with that. However, that would also really depend on your sales skills, so evaluate those first.\n\nAnyways, good luck to you and all the best!",

A simple project can be explained in much more detail and still show value.\n\nWhat would you expect a 9 YOE developer to do? If I stood in front of a recruiter and tried to explain some super specialized project I worked on, I risk losing them. They might not understand it or get bored, even if it’s actually interesting. People who haven’t gone deep into a specific topic can easily dismiss it, like “You optimized a feature for 2 months? Should’ve done it right from the start!”\n\nI imagine a situation where a company is choosing between two candidates: one has a simple app that works and can be tested, the other talks about complex systems needing a special setup or ecosystem. Which sounds easier to evaluate?\n\nI get that adding AI/LLM features is seen as highly valuable these days because so many projects have some AI angle, whether needed or not. So yeah, more AI features is automatically cooler, I get it.\n\nI totally agree I need to get better at presenting myself and that the UI could definitely use improvement.\n\nI’m not in a rush to switch jobs, but somewhere I do need to start researching the market and my place in it.\n\n Thanks a lot for your honest reply.",

I've worked with multiple data scientists in industry with degrees in physics.\n\nMost all hiring managers and any decent recruiter will not find anything amiss with the credentials and background.\n\n**To answer your questions directly**: (1) you don't need to express the value of your experience in a particularly special way, (2) most certifications won't help much but could help to convince people you're more ready to go in certain aspects (see below), and (3) most people aren't really looking for portfolios. Internship and job experience trump other factors.\n\nAnyway, through your resume and in interviews you will need to convince people that\n\n1. You have extensive practical and theoretical knowledge of very basic DS concepts like gradient descent, regularization, data cleaning, A/B testing, etc.\n2. You have some practical and theoretical knowledge of whatever technique or domain area their team specializes in. Maybe it's computer vision or recommendation systems or something else like that. This used to generally not be as much expected for entry level but with today's market the expectations are higher.\n3. You have foundational technical/business skills, depending on the kinds of work the team delivers. A team writing production code for algorithms will want somebody familiar with using git and coding in a team environment, for example.\n\nMost people will assume you have the capacity to meet all the criteria but will want to test if you're already at (or close to) a level where you can contribute without too much fuss.\n\nIt definitely doesn't help at all that the expectations and responsibilities for data scientists vary widely across companies and teams.",

The computational work you did simulating neural networks demonstrates exactly what data science employers want to see - the ability to work with complex systems, handle large datasets, and solve problems that don't have obvious solutions. When you're in interviews, frame your research as what it really was: advanced data analysis and modeling work. Talk about the scale of data you worked with, the computational challenges you solved, and how you validated your models. That's pure data science experience, just in a different domain.\n\nSkip the certifications and focus your energy on translating your existing projects into a portfolio that speaks the business language. Take that neural network simulation and present it as a machine learning project - discuss the algorithms you implemented, the performance metrics you used, and the insights you generated. Create a GitHub repository with clean, well-documented code and write up your projects with clear explanations of your methodology and results. Your PhD work is far more impressive than any online certificate, but you need to present it in terms that hiring managers can immediately understand.
