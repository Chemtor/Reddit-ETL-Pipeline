        "body": "Hey, [r/dataengineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/)! Hope you're having a good day.\n\nWe are excited to announce Sail 0.3. In this release, Sail preserves compatibility with Spark’s pre-existing interface while replacing its internals with a Rust-native execution engine, delivering significantly improved performance, resource efficiency, and runtime stability.\n\nAmong other advancements, Sail 0.3 adds support for Spark 4.0 while maintaining compatibility with Spark 3.5 and improves how Sail adapts to version changes in Spark’s behavior across versions. This means you can run Sail with the latest Spark features or keep your current production environment with confidence, knowing it’s built for long-term reliability and evolution alongside Spark.\n\n[https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-3/](https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-3/)\n\n# What is Sail?\n\nSail is an open-source computation framework that serves as a drop-in replacement for Apache Spark (SQL and DataFrame API) in both single-host and distributed settings. Built in Rust, Sail runs \\~4x faster than Spark while reducing hardware costs by 94%.\n\n# What’s New in Sail 0.3\n\n* **Compatibility** with Spark 4.0’s new `pyspark-client`, a lightweight Python-only client with no JARs, enabling faster integration and unlocking performance and cost efficiency.\n* **Changes in the installation command** now require explicitly installing the full PySpark 4.0 library (along with Spark Connect support) or the thin PySpark 4.0 client, offering greater flexibility and control, especially as Spark Connect adoption grows and variants of the client emerge.\n* **Automatic detection of PySpark version** in the Python environment adjusts Sail’s runtime behavior accordingly to handle internal changes, such as differences in UDF and UDTF serialization between Spark versions, ensuring that a single Sail library remains compatible across both versions.\n* **Automatic Python unit testing** on every pull request across Spark 3.5 and Spark 4.0 to track feature parity and avoid regressions.\n* **Faster object store performance,** reducing latency and improving throughput across cloud-native storage.\n* **New and improved documentation** with updated getting-started guides, architecture diagrams, and compatibility to help you get up and running with Sail and understand its parity with Spark.\n\n# Our Mission\n\nAt LakeSail, our mission is to unify batch processing, stream processing, and compute-intensive AI workloads, empowering users to handle modern data challenges with unprecedented speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. By integrating diverse workloads into a single framework, we enable the flexibility and scalability required to drive innovation and meet the demands of AI's global evolution.\n\n# Join the Slack Community\n\nThis release features contributions from several first-time contributors! We invite you to [join our community on Slack](https://www.launchpass.com/lakesail-community/free) and engage with the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/lakehq/sail). Whether you're just getting started with Sail, interested in contributing, or already running workloads, this is your space to learn, share knowledge, and help shape the future of distributed computing. We would love to connect with you!",

Write Terraform to setup an EC2, install postgres and all the good stuff like IAM, etc, all the stuff you're gonna use. I suggest the basic AWS course by Adrian Cantril. You should work in your local desktop but connecting to an Ubuntu EC2 instance.\n\n* Set up a project for Python with uv, ruff, mypy, pydantic, all that stuff.\n\n* Write some code to download data from somewhere. Something like the NY taxi data is fine\n\n* Upload it to postgres in EC2, and Snowflake\n\n* Do some modeling and transformations with DBT, both postgres and snowflake\n\n* Orchestrate with Airflow\n\n* Package it in Docker and make sure it's easy to use and install and run everything from scratch with a few simple commands\n\n* Use Power BI or whatever to build a report\n\nThat's enough work for a month or more, mostly reasearching, reading documentation, and understanding how things work and get tied together. Then you can apply for any role. CI/CD is something you can't really do by yourself, you need to be working in an organization.\n\n> Currently reading the holy bible that is The fundamentals of Data Engineering\n\nDitch that garbage.\n\nDM me if you need some help or further guidance :)",

Don't try to learn everything at once - Spark, Kafka, and Airflow can wait until you're in a role where you need them. Your quick learning ability and existing foundation will carry you through interviews, especially since many companies are willing to train the right person on their specific tech stack.

There are few reasons to compare raw data between media files.  You almost always want to extract features or outputs with AI/ML and then do the comparison.  AI/ML over media files is almost always highly parallelized specialized GPU-based compute.  That's expensive.  It makes sense to save the outputs or cache it.  Even retrieving the color would be cheaper to write out as an: image_url, color then re-compute on the fly.  This type of compute is very different from traditional database model of: retrieve off file system via index, store in memory and then compute over a set.  It assumes quick computation over a large set of small things.  Media files tend to be large.  They take up too much space in memory.  They can easily blow up a hard drive.  So it makes sense to store them on disk or blob storage.  It makes life a lot less complicated.",

Fast forward 6 months the data team is still trying to get their complex and brittle near real time analytics engine up and running while folks are asking “where is my data?”\n\nI don’t think it matters how someone defines a “data product” (really who cares?), what matters more is the thought process that you should first identify “why” someone needs something data related and then work backwards in your data stack to deliver the data to them in a format that makes sense (i.e. dashboard, downloadable dataset, or landing bulk data in a bucket/SFTP)\n\nLastly, there have been a handful of times at companies I have worked at where they realized “oh, this isn’t actually a Data Engineering problem but actually something we need to build into our main application.” A lot of times people confound that just because something involves data, it is somehow a Data Engineering problem to solve, not always the case.",

Hackerrank Advanced SQL and LeetCode’s harder DB questions are solid drills, but nothing matches shipping a mini warehouse: spin up Snowflake’s free tier, pipe data with dbt, visualize in Apache Superset, and wire alerting tests with dbt-expectations. I’ve used Superset and dbt Cloud, and DreamFactory slips in when I want a quick REST layer on top of my practice schemas so a small Flask front end can hammer them with real requests. Building end-to-end projects like this will teach you more about modeling and SQL trade-offs than any static course.",

Iceberg is designed for, as stated later, \"tens of petabytes of data\" and a few dozen bytes per write is utterly inconsequential. It is less than a rounding error. You may as well be complaining about the unnecessary weight of a heavy duty door on a mining truck - half a kilo isn't going to matter when you're carting 5 tons around.\n\nSo, from a *purely technical* perspective, yes it has a *slight* amount of redundant data, but in practice the difference wouldn't even be measurable.\n\n> \"Tables grow large by being written to, they grow really large by being written to frequently\"\n\nThis relates to a complaint about optimistic concurrency, and again it completely whiffs. I don't know where they got that quote from, but it doesn't inherently apply to the types of uses that iceberg would be used for. Each operation is for updating or inserting millions and billions of rows. We're not expecting to do *frequent* writes into iceberg, we're expecting to do *big* ones.\n\nHe follows up with...\n\n> Did I mention that 1000 commits/sec is a pathetic number if you are appending rows to table?\n\n... and if you'll excuse my language: Who *the fuck* is doing 1000 commits/sec for a use case where iceberg is even remotely relevant, that is completely fucking insane. You're not using iceberg for subsecond latency use cases, so just add 1 second of latency to the process and batch the writes, good god.\n\n> you need to support cross table transactions.\n\nNo, you don't *need* to, because the use case doesn't call for it. This isn't a transactional database where you need to commit a correlated update/insert to two tables at the same time to maintain operational consistency because this isn't the transactional store underpinning an application state as a system of record. Data warehouses can be altered and rebuilt as needed, and various constraints can be, and are, skipped to enable high throughput performance.\n\nIf you're ingesting customer data, account data, and a linking table of the two, you don't need a transaction to wrap all of that because you use your orchestrator to run the downstream pipelines dependent on the two after they've both updated.\n\n> This is extra problematic if you have a workload where you constantly trickle data into the Data Lake. ... For example, let us say you micro batch 10000 rows every second and that you have 100 clients doing that.\n\nWhy write every second? Why not batch writes up every minute? Why have each node do a separate metadata write, rather than having them write their raw data, then do a single metadata transaction for them? Why use Iceberg streaming inputs like this at all, when you can just dump to parquet -- it isn't like you're going to be doing updates at that speed, you can just do blind appends, and that means you don't strictly need versions.\n\nThe writer is just inventing problems by applying Iceberg to things you shouldn't apply it to. It doesn't wash the dishes either, but who cares that's not what it is for.\n\n> I am going to be generous and assume you only do this 12 hours per day. \n\nShould read as: I'm going to be a complete idiot and make the worst decision possible.\n\n---\n\nI'm done with this article, it is garbage, throw it away.",

Is that Twitter-level provocation for engagement?  \nI am pretty sure this community agrees SQL is the number one skill for DE.\n\nI think the clunky, but successful tech like Apache MapReduce are created by engineers trying to solve their own problem with what they have available, and most of the time that gives a clunky mess that is never shared outside. Sometimes it is deemed useful enough to be shared, and then outside people will more or less abusively reuse them without the context for which they were made: not everyone work with FAANG-scale data warehouses. At the same time, those outsides usually don't have the possibility to rebuild tools from scratch to make them more refined than the original, like Duck Lake is doing. I think that's more than enough to explain inefficient data platforms without personal attacks.\n\nOverall, I agree Duck Lake's management of the file level metadata in a relational database is the way to go, and I think it will actually spread.",

Of course by doing this you will sacrifice a lot of true DWH features.\n\nBasically the idea of ducklake is that by using postgres as an entry point, you get a true DWH like features for “free”.

This data could come from a Kafka queue or perhaps some web servers streaming in logs. This is a very common workload and the kind of pattern you need for big data and Data Lakes to make sense in the first place (if not, why didn't you just run a single PostgreSQL on a small EC2 instance?).\n\nTo be honest a lot of people have 'data lakehouses' that could be run out of traditional rdbms or clickhouse on a big server and the reason for that is fashion, but it does make a lot of these issues he mentions not ones that will come up for most practitioners, in the same way that people can rightly criticize transaction wraparound in postgresql but most people will never have 4 billion unvacuumed transactions to know it's even a thing.  So people running at high scale who have hit issues with iceberg may be tempted to look at ducklake or whatever but they aren't compelling to companies like mine who don't actually need a data lakehouse but have one anyway and don't feel the pain of any of these issues.\n\nIt's also kind of funny he complains about the bloat of a 1k avro file, my brother in christ that's a rounding error in s3.",

        "body": "First, OP, your post reads like a marketing flyer with all the buzzwords. There are definite good practices for many needs but not a generic one size fits all. There are a list of things I would suggest,\n\n1. Stop calling it medallion architecture (it is a pet peeve of mine). The three tier design has been around for 35+ years. It was originally called staging, core and semantic layers. There are very few hard and fast rules around them; just generic guidelines.\n2. The best datawarehouses don't have any particular purpose (at least not until you hit the semantic layer). This is especially true of the core layer. It should be modeled around the business processes. As such, it only changes as often as the business does. Normally, this is not very often.\n3. Things happen in the processes between layers. It is not very often that things happen inside a layer.\n4. Staging is for landing data and, if desired, keeping the historical feed data. You should always have the original feed from the operational system so that you can trace your data back to it. The data warehouse is considered \"correct\" when it balances back to the system of record (SOR). If the SOR isn't right, you don't fix it in the DW, you fix it in the SOR and let the correction flow forward. When you change source data in the DW, you lose your chain of accountability. The Line of Businesses (LOB) or legal will tell you how long they want you to archive that stuff. Remember, they look at it differently than IT.\n5. The core layer is where data is kept that has been cleaned and adjusted to standard values. Different LOBs may have different abbreviations and meanings for data components. The processes to create and update the core data is where you adjust those to the standards. I tend to make my core layer in 3NF because it shows the proper relationships between the data parts without assigning specific purpose to the data. You make it fit for all purposes. This is where you also clean up things like addresses. (These can be a nightmare. Look at all of the ways Peachtree is used in Atlanta.) You also generalize things like customers, employees, vendors, etc. to generic terms like Party. You don't have to have the entire core flushed out before you use it. Just have the design as far as you can and flush the data out as project come along to fund it.\n6. The third layer, semantic, is where you put your data products, created from core, that the various LOBs need. When you create something like a star schema, you assign specific purpose to the data. It may or may not fit with other LOBs in the organization. Trying to reuse data products across various LOBs can be a tricky proposition and needs a bit of thought.\n7. Traditionally, you would only give access for users at the semantic layer. I tend to break this guideline. While still having appropriate security controls, I give users access to any layer they want. Data Scientists tend to like data a early and close to the operational data source as possible. I give them access to staging with the caveat to them the data is still abit of a mess. Regulatory reporting normally can wait a bit for the much cleaner data in the semantic layer. Those are just two examples.\n8. Don't ignore the other data parts like security, metadata, governance, etc. This is why you want to find an experience data architect to help you. Not a senior data engineer. They are not the same thing.",

As a \"rule of thumb\" if you are making a report in Excel or desktop BI tools for occasional viewing, its built direct from silver.

Run DBT externally in a cloud hosted service, which fully decouples the softwares (good), but then deal with having to manage two services instead of 1 (bad)\n\n\nHonestly I would just recommend orchestrating in DBT cloud.

We created a bunch of them and we refresh them daily in Airflow. If I would have know the company will develop as it develops, I would start with dbt right away. But I didnt, so I would have used mvs again - they have their advantages.\n\nThat beign said, drawbacks of the mv (postgres edition, some drawbacks may vary in Oracle, tho they both use plsql):\n* when you refresh data it always has exclusive lock - you can't even select during refresh time\n* it fast become time consuming. And you can't natively refresh only part of the Data, you either need to refresh all of it, or create duplicated code to simulate 'partitions' \n* become very resource consuming. At peak, our main mv refreshed 4 hours, during night. If I refresh it during the day it sometimes timesout because of lack of the resources (I put the same query in dbt and some how it managed resources much better)\n* it's easy to add just another column.

The challenge is to ensure that when your visualization tool fires off its queries it can actually use the view. When the tool needs e.g. an aggregation level the view can not provide it may fall back on querying the underlying tables. So it can be finicky to setup and maintain as requirements change. It's also not useful if the user wants frequent updates of the data during the day.\n\nWhenever running into performance issues, the first step is to analyze queries plans and optimize by indexing, partitioning etc. Another issue is typically that many visualization tools pull in everything at the lowest grain level (individual transactions) while 90% of the visuals only need aggregated data. So then create aggregates on the db and use these instead. Only query on the lowest detail level when the user drills down into a specific subset of data and then make sure the data is indexed or partitioned along the attributes on which the subset is filtered.",

Since ur a solo engineer, you want a way to onboard new tables, databases, or sources into the datalake quickly and avoid becoming a bottleneck. If you have solid experience with DLT and can make it dynamic thats a great place to start. \nIf not then it might be worth looking into Airbyte its straightforward to set up, and makes adding new ingestions really simple. \n\nThat way you’ll have more time to focus on building transformations using dbt/sqlmesh, and spend the effort understanding the data to make it consumable and valuable to others. \n\nAs a quick win to get something in place fast, you could use Airbyte to ingest data, then build procedures inside the database and schedule them using SQL Server Agent to run a few times a day. Its a simple and reliable setup that works well for most common data sources.\n\nIf come across cases where the source needs more customization or a different approach, you can handle those separately using Airflow.\n\nWhile this setup is running, it’s a good time to step back and explore what tools and designs best match your longterm use cases،، before fully committing to a specific stack.",

Do expand your toolset over time and if you can, but do not focus on the tool as such. Instead focus on solving the problem at hand with the tool(s) available, as effectively and efficiently as possible. Also keep in mind someone else will eventually pick up where you left off, so document what you've done in an accessible way.\n\n3) know and paint the bigger picture for yourself and others to understand more easily what is going on. This helps you to do a better job and explain what you are doing, but it also helps others to understand and match their skills to the task at hand. \n\nIf you focus on these 3 abilities, you can work in any company of any size. Your experience in some tools, like Databricks, counts of course, yet less so because you know the tool technically, more so because you know how to apply it to the above 3 abilities. Every new tool is just a means to and end. If you can master 1 tool, you can master another one, and another one after that.\n\nTrust yourself. You'll find the right opportunity. Hope this helps.",

        "body": "Hey!\n\nFirst, sorry to hear that. Startups are tricky to get into and until you have been working for a bit, it’s hard to know the right questions to ask to avoid coming in too early.\n\nRegarding what you should do next, I would advise against freelancing. Most companies don’t want to hire freelancers with 10 years of experience as they can simply go with a boutique consulting company. I’m not saying it is impossible, but it is a steep hill to climb and it also sounds like you could benefit working in a team environment and learning from more experienced engineers.\n\nThe top 4 things that will help get the average data engineering job are the following (in this order):\n\n1. SQL\n2. Python\n3. Shell scripting (aka bash)\n4. Data modeling (i.e. fact and dimensional modeling)\n\nOnce you get a good grasp of these, then you layer on whatever are the current popular tech stack tools/platforms like the following (no order):\n\n1. Clouding computing (AWS/Azure) - sounds like you are already good here.\n2. dbt \n3. Snowflake/Databricks\n4. Orchestration (Airflow or Dagster)\n5. Extract Load tools (dltHub, Airbyte, etc.)\n\nThese are going to be your most common tools. While there are things like Spark, Trino, Kafka, etc., not all companies use them so there is limited value in focusing on them.\n\nNext, I’d also pick up good software development tools like:\n\n1. Docker\n2. source control (GitHub)\n3. CI/CD (GitHub Actions)\n4. Infrastructure as Code (i.e. terraform)\n\nThis is quite a bit and I suggest starting at the top of my post and slowly working down. Next, while you can apply to jobs, the entry job market is very strained right now. You need to start networking, ideally in person but if that isn’t feasible then you need to seek out online networking.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any questions.",

This is tough for me personally as an introvert and something I just had to practice over time. I have found this is the best way to just organically grow your network.\n\nNeither of these approaches are quick as it takes quite a bit of time to build a network and get to the point you connect with someone looking to hire.\n\nI also recommend starting to post on LinkedIn. Doesn’t have to be clickbait, but just show some activity. Regardless of how folks feel about LinkedIn, it is widely used and being active on it helps give you visibility. One thing I recommend to folks is as they are learning/working on things, simply post to LinkedIn.",

This is perfect for insert-only scenarios, but god-awful for SCD2 tables where you need to update IsCurrent=0 and IsCurrent=1 (or IsDeleted).\n\nMedallion lends itself well, you keep the SCD2 tables in bronze & (some edge cases) in silver, OLTP, and gold is columnstore index.\n\nIf done well, porting to Snowflake from MS SQL can be relatively painless. On-prem is great for data confidentiality, and if you have licenses for a dedicated VM MS SQL server. Give it lots of ram, like 128g is a minimum, but 4 or 8 cpus is fine.",

People can be dicks about \\`minimum reproducible examples\\`, but this is a good example why.\n\nYour question boils down to \"How do I update and filter data?\" The answer is you build new dataframes and join them. You use a group by or windows to only keep the max value, maybe before the join maybe after. This approach scales much further than most people realize, especially with polars.\n\nDoing it this way prevents all the headaches and footguns that come with manually updating slices of pandas dataframes.\n\nIf group bys and joins sound scary or complex, then you're missing the fundamental concepts of data manipulation, and I would strongly recommend brushing up on them.",

The good-ish news is that most reasonable companies understand that every data engineering role is different and they will allow some time to ramp up before they throw you into the fire. \n\nAlso, with enough years of experience you may find yourself removed from the specifics of any one tool.

Feed each block into Splink on Spark; its probabilistic model scales to tens of millions and gives you match weights you can tune without coding pairwise comparisons. If you prefer Python only, Dedupe works well with DuckDB temp tables. Once confident, cluster records, assign a surrogate\\_id, and push that map back to the source tables so future loads are incremental, not full re-dedupes. Use dbt for the cleaning/merging models and git+CI to enforce code review and documentation so the offshore mess doesn’t return.

Methods for measuring and monitoring data quality. Example: routinely sample N records, analysts inspect and flag any incorrect matches and then produce a % accurate metric.\n2. A process for what happens when there are exceptions (if needed). Example: a defined process for analysts to input overrides in particular cases.\n3. Understand the risks when there are exceptions.

The real issue isn't the approach - it's probably the implementation quality given what you've described.\n\nFor the technical side - before you rebuild everything, try profiling the current pipeline to see where the actual bottlenecks are. Sometimes these \"bad\" codebases have one or two critical performance issues that, once fixed, buy you time to do a proper rewrite. We've seen 10x improvements just from fixing obvious stuff like loading data multiple times or running queries in loops.\n\nFor entity resolution at your scale, you might want to look into:\n\n\\- Splink (open source, handles blocking and matching pretty well)\n\n\\- RecordLinkage library if you're in Python\n\n\\- Even AWS Entity Resolution if you're cloud-native\n\nThe blocking strategy is solid but the devil's in the details.

        "body": "Moving data from oltp to a DW should be done in meaningful batches (by unit and week).  I wouldn't require an extensive number of table-joins from the source system, and wouldn't request more than a million rows per batch.  The goal is to use cheap table scans and drop the source data into an intermediate temp file for staging. (Parquet or one of its derivative)\n\nMoving data out of the source is sometimes described as creating your \"bronze\" layer.  Personally I think that sounds a little pretentious.  But there is a lot of responsibility involved. You need to know the source, and avoid burying it with unnatural workloads that it was never designed to handle.  In general it should be safe to do table scans on a clustered index in the source database.  Those simple queries should go unnoticed (ideally).\n\nThe next part is loading the data back into a warehouse or lake house.  This is called building your silver layer (at the lowest granularity required).  Basically this work involves reading data back out of the temp files and then loading it into a star schema.\n\nSpark is where the magic happens.\n\nMy preference for all this data movement involves the heavy use of spark.  Microsoft loves spark as much as any other company (besides databricks itself of course). I would learn spark if you aren't familiar. That is where you find as much compute as you need, and is far more important than other decisions you may need to make (like whether to send data to a db, or dwh, or lakehouse... and whether the data will live in fabric or elsewhere)",

This is in line with existing best practices in Synapse and elsewhere - use Entra instead, e.g. Managed Identity, Service Principals, et cetera instead. So when setting up logins et cetera in Synapse, I'd suggest following that best practice. Here's a doc on this - whole doc is useful, but I've linked to the section on disabling local Auth: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/active-directory-authentication#disable-local-authentication\n* Ditto on SAS keys and account keys- if you have to, use the user delegated kind. But user passthrough is what we support in both and the modern recommendation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/develop-storage-files-storage-access-control?tabs=user-identity\n* Dedicated can take a fair bit of fine tuning to run at its best. 500 Gb isn't very large by its standards, which is good, but also, means that you're paying its overheads without getting as much out of it. Fabric Warehouse does a much better job that Dedicated did with that sort of volume, generally\n* Depending on your needs, I'd consider Serverless as well. It doesn't require as much tuning to get the best out of it.\n\nHappy to answer questions.",

Insert only processing will run without problems. Take care to align distribution columns on facts and most commonly used dimensions and query performance should be fine.\n\nFor smaller dimensions, use row based storage (heap or clustered index). Avoid replicate distribution like the plague.",

Unfortunately, our agency management is extremely pro-Microsoft, and it’s just a matter of it being easier to get a contract approved for a vendor with whom they are familiar and comfortable. \n\n Really, we just need to get started here with some kind of DWH effort, as anything beats our current model. The synch frequency to the DWH would be daily. If we needed real-time, I am thinking we would set up hybrid tables on PowerBi with a direct query over a narrow partition of data based on the last modified attribute in our database tables. \n\nRegarding orchestration, are you using Synapse notebooks?",

However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it gives you more control and flexibility over the data pipeline.\n\nYou can use a secondary pipeline (could be DBT or custom scripts) to filter and push only the relevant client data to their lake. This gives you the ability to implement data governance, ensure data quality, and maintain audit trails. Plus, you'll have the flexibility to serve multiple clients from the same source without cross contamination.\n\nYou can implement client specific transformations, add data validation layers, and set up automated monitoring to ensure data freshness and accuracy. The slight complexity of the process pays dividends in maintainability and scalability, especially if you plan to onboard more clients with similar requirements. Also consider if your client has other data sources they'd want integrated, platforms like Windsor.ai excel at selective data extraction from multiple channels with proper tenant isolation, which could create a more comprehensive analytics ecosystem alongside your survey insights.",

I absolutely do think this sort of change, like details of a publication, should be part of a CI pipeline, using one of the tools for managing database migrations. Flyway is one I've used with success in the past, lately I found pgroll (https://github.com/xataio/pgroll) and its innovative take very interesting, I don't have hands-on experience with it, though. Postgres can be started up very quickly in a container (it's what we're using for testing Debezium itself, too), so this can easily happen for tests on CI, too.\n\nOn the aspect of changes to a publication and thus a CDC event stream changing its schema, that's a very large topic by itself. In general, the team owning an application and its database should also be in charge of its change event streams and their schemas, evolving them with compatibility in mind, ideally implementing the idea of \"Data Products\", i.e. consciously designed data streams with a well-defined, documented, and stable contract. Stream processing with tools like Flink can be one way for shielding consumers from the impact of upstream schema changes.",

There is .. a \\*lot\\* ... of confusion and odd statements in your post.\n\nTo get straight to the point of solving your problem ...\n\nFrom your other comment:\n\n\\> So the idea is, ingest an excel file and convert the data into parquet files in the ADLS (each sheet would be a table equivalent).\n\n\\> Then in databricks merge/upsert that data into our Azure SQL database tables.\n\nFirst, why use parquet for this? You can just read Excel as a CSV and bulk insert into Azure SQL and then do your merge. Why introduce an arbitrary data format and add complications like a whole other platform Databricks when you're probably just dealing with a few hundred rows?\n\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/import-export/import-data-from-excel-to-sql?view=sql-server-ver17#bulk-insert-command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/import-export/import-data-from-excel-to-sql?view=sql-server-ver17#bulk-insert-command)\n\nThat being said:\n\n* ADLS is *not* NoSQL ... it's a storage layer. Databricks supports reading ADLS Gen 2 - that's where your Delta tables are stored in Azure when using Unity Catalog.\n\n* Not sure what you mean by \"I'm assuming you can't because ... NoSQL\" - Databricks is based on Spark, it will happily read unstructured data in files from your data lake.\n\nAnd while in your specific case you can't do it because you have multiple sheets, *if* your Excel file was just a single sheet you can just read it directly in Databricks SQL\n\n`select * from read_files('/Volumes/my_volume/uploads/test.xlsx', schemaEvolutionMode => 'none')`\n\n(You can use an arbitrary ABFSS location if you provide a credential to Databricks SQL's [data access configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/admin/sql/data-access-configuration) but Volumes are a lot more convenient and easier to manage.)",

The only downside is that the notebook cannot be run on SQL warehouses as a result, because they only support SQL statements.",

It performs better if I use DIFY and force just a 1024 char chunk, with 100 char overlap, but even that tends to return the docs header boilerplate fragments, and not specific code that examples or describes the thing I'm asking about.  This may just be a hard use case, where you want to ask \"how do I use this cli tool to build xyz\", and have it not return \"to use cli tool for xyz do the following...\" but instead, grab the example code and list of command line options.   \n\nProbably would be better on a big organization SOP that had clear things like \"policy on internal document encryption is this and that\".

They do have a nice UI though.  DMS ended up costing us more than we wanted to pay and it's honestly pretty weak as an ingestion solution.  Like to do incremental loads based on a date column, you can't just configure it to pick yesterday's date or something.  All the filters are static so you have to write a lambda to rewrite the DMS config json and update DMS with the current date every load.",

The learning curve is minimal compared to managing Airbyte OSS, and you avoid the DMS headaches that others mentioned about static filters and Lambda workarounds.\n\nSkip DMS for this use case, it's overkill and expensive for your scenario. The static configuration limitations mentioned earlier are real pain points, especially for incremental loads. Since your platform team is already managing EC2 infrastructure, adding DLT pipelines to your existing Airflow setup is the path of least resistance.\n\nBefore committing to self hosted solutions though, Windsor.ai might solve your cost problem, they handle MySQL → Snowflake with competitive pricing that could bring your 30MMAR spend down.

This should greatly decrease costs if you aren't already doing it:\n\n[https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/change-data-capture#cost-best-practices](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/change-data-capture#cost-best-practices)\n\nAs for setting up your own merge ingestion, the cost of each merge is based on the amount of data scanned in all relevant partitions of the destination table:\n\n[https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/dml-syntax#partitioned\\_tables](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/dml-syntax#partitioned_tables)\n\nUnless I'm mistaken, this means that the partitioned column has to be included in the merge condition in order for the partitioning strategy to provide any cost-savings benefit. In practice, I found that partitioning on the primary key (or an integer component of it, if it's a composite PK) is the best way to minimize merge costs. \n\nAnd obviously, reducing the frequency of your merge updates will help here as well.",

The business just don't think in terms of \"I need this report to be a 12 month rolling average that can be sliced by location and drills through to existing reporting with colour coding\", and they shouldn't need to.\n\n\nThe communication gap comes from business users having clear understandings of the problem but can't (and shouldn't) be able to solution specifics. But at the same time centralise BI or engineering teams sit outside the business and, having been burned by getting blamed before, want to push the risk and design back to the business as much as possible.\n\n\nSo pretty much every place I've worked has done kind of communications barrier between technical and business but when you get right into it, it's really more about the data side being unwilling or unable to think about the business process and do effective blue sky thinking about how to leverage their talents against a shared problem and pushing the business to become data designers instead and come to them with a spec.\n\n\nI reckon there's definitely some value to be had by getting an AI in the loop somewhere to help translating, but I don't think it attacks the core of why people always have this problem and the model you've described sounds like it's trying to remove the need for data development to understand the business world and problems. I think generally the opposite should hold, which is that data teams who want to only do the tech and not the people work are the problem.\n\n\nNot the worst example of a shitty pitch for yet another data AI tool startup hustle in that you've picked a good problem area, and there'd be an audience for it, but personally I'd give a hard pass to anything selling me the idea that the people problem of business/tech culture clash can be solved with a tech product.",

I’ve had had some success and made a lot of duds when testing and deploying AI/LLM solutions for non or semi-technical SMEs in enterprise orgs, so when I read your idea, I recall a lot of those learnings.\n\nTo me, the communication gap you are looking at is the like, 20% problem that requires 80% of the effort to solve. It’s one of those permutative problems that when solved destroys agility and flexibility of organizations and when pushed all the way in the other direction of giving everyone free reign and no direction can make other orgs look like a barrel of monkeys. \n\nSo all that preface is to say tools that presuppose that you will be able to solve knowledge transfer between more than like 3 layers of a business of how information passes through competency layers (ex in my prev. comment) is a cursed problem. \n\nBecause of that, I see problems with a tool that suggests that a Director can cross 5+ competence layers and genuinely get what they need, because to be completely clear: While data is served at a wide scale to many ICs and SMEs, the general purpose of all data is to help teams inform leaders, because all of that data is meant for those teams to make better decisions, and to then show data of improvement to the leaders. So for a tool to cut across all of this and save money or time or both, you would need to create a tool that solve all of these layers based off of a leader level prompt, which is really hard to do, and I think cost/success% wise outside of scope of existing tech. \n\nWhat I personally see as the clear line path for llm products are places where you can extend a sme 50% of the way in the direction of a couple of other domains that require proficiency and time spent learning. Tools that can take a great manager with ok tech chops, and solve the little simple ad-hoc tasks that you would originally bog down report devs / automation analysts in excel, idk the examples arent always great they are niche and reveal themselves through iteration. \n\nI think that smart LLM practitioners will not try to replace the human in the middle, not because its the right thing to do, but because its the financially prudent and performant thing to do, and they will support SMEs to become more proficient in adjacent domains. More so, at least, than was previously possible or expectable in the past. That will help solve the communication gap (a bit) in these orgs that prevent end to end technical implementations today.\n\nSorry if this was too long! It’s a really interesting topic. I think good historical cues to take are to look at how no-code / low-code tools have started, been hyped, and where they ended up. Sometimes they do pretty good (Power Automate, Zapier), but they never have a “playing field levelling effect” across all layers of an org. Rn a Director could use Power Automate to already pull and transform their own data, but they won’t. \n\nNot to say those loops can’t get better and more accessible, that does seem to be a good use case for LLMs, I just think that it will more often than not require that someone knows something about the field they are using an LLM solution for, even if its an adjacent one (which is the more practical value prop of AI except for OpenAI who get to be the core chatbot, lucky them).",

Cosmos and Scheduler pressure—add a scheduler! If this is enough of a problem that you are here seeking ideas, and you already pay for Snowflake, it’s worth the cost. \n\nIf one or both of those isn’t feasible, you’d want to use `dbt retry` (as the other commenter suggested), however, depending on how you run Airflow you’d need to maintain the state of the dbt artifacts (dbt core, perhaps not w/ Cloud?). \n\nThe only other thing you could explore would be splitting into a few DAGs, each with custom dbt run filters (e.g. a DAG for base models only), then on failure you could only need to run that subset of the project (but it’s a hacky way to avoid the better Cosmos structure of 1 task per model).",

Spend time on indexing, VACUUM tuning, and explain plans-nothing impresses interviewers more than knowing why a query is slow. If you want some NoSQL flavor, set up the Mongo cert lab locally so you can compare document patterns, but the market still wants solid relational chops first. Spin up logical replication, test pg\\_partman for time-series partitions, and pull data into pandas to build a small forecast model so you can show an end-to-end story.

        "body": "Here's my list of why it's tough to teach yourself.\n\n**Figuring out what to learn**\n\nThis is the number 1 problem. How do you know you are \"learning the basics\"? Which YouTube videos are you watching? There's so much stuff, it's hard to pick. \n\nThere's even a bit of procrastination. Some lay out plans that will take years to complete which means it won't get done. They will add an intro programming courses, maybe discrete math, maybe SQL, maybe operating systems. The fact is, most people never get much past the first course. \n\nLesson: you don't have to plan that far ahead\n\n**Hard to make progress**\n\nIt's tough to motivate yourself. For a handful of people, learning to program is (kind of) fun. For others, it's boring (yet, not easy). You have to learn syntax, e.g., a for-loop in C. You have to learn what you can do with that syntax, e.g., iterate through arrays.\n\n**You fail to learn control flow properly**\n\nIf you're learning a procedure language, or a language that has procedural aspects, like Python, it becomes useful to emulate the computer, going one step at a time. You want to know what happens at every step. This low-level approach helps you understand how your program behaves.\n\nThe human mind often skips steps, making assumptions about what stuff does. This is where it's helpful to learn a debugger, or do the poor man's equivalent and print \"debug\" statements.\n\n**There's not a lot of material on debugging**\n\nAs a beginner, you're likely to write buggy code, ie, code that has mistakes. Fixing those bugs means determining *what* caused the bug, i.e., identifying the bug. Then, *fixing* the bug.\n\nFor as much time as a beginner spends learning material, surprisingly little covers debugging.\n\n**There's a lot of advice**\n\nPerhaps the most common one is \"build projects\". Here's the thinking behind that approach. Beginners sometimes learn from tutorials. However, many tutorials are too advanced for beginners. Worse than that, they tell you *what* to do, but not *why*.\n\nYou might wonder why they don't explain things. After all, don't learners want to learn? Here's the problem. How do you know how much the person watching your tutorial knows? If you can barely program, then you'll spend time talking about programming basics, and the part about building what you're building is now a fraction of the tutorial.\n\nEven if you know programming basics, it's still not enough. For example, you might be following a tutorial on React (not recommended for beginners). It will tell you to do this and that for React, but not the *design* of React. What was the philosophy behind React? Why does it look the way it does (i.e., why Javascript)? Explaining how React does stuff takes time, and tutorials predominantly skip over it, and jump into using it. \n\nThese tutorials fail to show you the big picture. Instead, you're in the weeds (stuck in the minute details).\n\nSome beginners begin jumping from one tutorial to another, building stuff, but not understanding what they are building nor how to change what they are building.\n\nThis leads to the common advice *build a project*. \n\nHere's my beef with that approach. You need to learn basics first. You need to learn basic syntax, control flow. You need a mental model of what the computer is doing. You need basic debugging skills. You need to do small exercises to help you learn, say, for-loops.\n\nThat part, to many, is boring. \n\nThe other complaint I have is you're asked \"find something you're passionate about\". Most beginners have a hard time identifying what they want to build, or they want to build something far too sophisticated, like a 3D game. They struggle with coding tic-tac-toe, and that's far too boring to be fun.\n\nThe analogy I typically give is learning a foreign language. There are two popular approaches. The academic approach teaches it like an English teacher teaches English, i.e., it's about grammar. The other approach is to learn phrases. The second way is meant to avoid long hours of learning a language's grammar so you can take a vacation somewhere and get by with little knowledge of the language.\n\nI liken the second approach to building a project. It only works if the following happen: you have a reasonable sized project (can be hard), you figure out what you need (also, can be hard), you find what you need (also hard). The driving motivation is you're building something you can use. A programming exercise doesn't do that, but I feel it's a necessary prerequisite.\n\nStill, some can manage to learn enough of a language by searching for what they need. But the part they leave out is how they search for what they need. They tell you to build a project, but then no one ever shows you how they build the project. I suspect if they showed the steps, a beginner would say \"but how did you know to do that?\". It requires search skills (or you could capitulate and let the LLM do all the work, but then you're not really learning).\n\n**Staying motivated**\n\nMany beginners burn out. Or they procrastinate and play video games (or something else) or they have family issues that require their time. With no one to motivate you but yourself, many quit after a month or two. It's not fun. It's not easy. The concepts are too hard. It seems like it will take forever to do something simple. There's so much material out there.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nMany things contribute to self-teaching being a challenge.",

I went from being an inventory guy to our company sole software developer. \n\nGo on github and find something you care about. Fork it and play with it and think about what you wish it had and start implementing. Failure is key to success. Not AI, not another Python tutorial. Write it yourself by hand until it turns to muscle memory. If you get stuck give yourself some pen and paper and 30 minutes and write down your problem.\n\nYou know you are getting when you start asking Google how to do http request. How to connect to x database. How to wrap and unwrap json. You start asking about real concepts. Not Javascript 10 hours super quick super fast, or 10 things you should know programming. \n\nWhen you understand the problem. The language writes itself. \n\nTook me 8 years on and off to finally figure that part out.\n\nHopefully some of you find it faster then I did\n\nNeovim btw",

When the feelings of frustration and anger arise, let them just wash over you, but don't leave. Know them for what they are: mere emotions. You are greater and stronger than your feelings. You can persevere, your ability to find the solution is always just on the other side of a veil of confusion. Stick it out, calm your breathing and master your emotions. Once the timer has finished, get up from your desk, even if you have begun to make progress, or may now even \"want\" to continue programming again. It doesn't matter. Stand up, go to a window and let your gaze extend as far to the horizon as you possibly can. Do this for 1-2 minutes, again, timed! Set an alarm, because we are absolutely miserable at being objective with regards to time. 😆 Then immediately go back to your desk, resume where you left off and work for the given amount of time. \n\nAgain: set a project timer for a little longer than you may be comfortable; stand and shift your gaze to the horizon; return to project; repeat as often as you need. Try performing the routine religiously, our brains and bodies love little routines and procedures. After a couple days, try to increase the amount of time. Gradually you will discover that your ability to push through negativity will grow, and your ability to discover and map out solutions will become robust and powerful.

So in Python you expose a web server using something like Flask, which when queried with a web browser serves a file containing HTML depending on the route (path in browser) and method (GET, POST, etc). The advantage here is that you could use a template engine like Jinja2 to serve dynamic content. The old TurboGears framework (yes I'm that old), Flask, or Django are commonly used with python, PHP is another commonly used one using the Laravel framework for example.\n\n2. API driven, here you serve endpoints (routes) with a web server and various methods just like with the server side rendering but instead of serving HTML you serve some other machine readable media formats like JSON, JSON-RPC, XML, etc. You then combine the \"backend\" with a frontend website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that calls your backend routes and then utilises that data to change the front end. React, Vue, Angular, (Ember if you're old), or more raw JQuery, are tools/frameworks to help you do that.\n\nProbably about a third of all the programming information on the Internet is about how to do this, how to get started in it, etc.",

It has a lot of extra tools for REST APIs. You can run Spring with Java, or Kotlin. I recommend getting into Kotlin. It's somewhere between Java and Python where it's a lot less boilerplate-heavy than Java while also being a lot more secure than Python. \n\nWith these tools I have mentioned you will be able to make what you desire, and make it better than you currently can imagine.

Essentially, your backend program is responsible for preparing data to be consumed by the browser in some form or another. The simplest web program might look like this:\n\n    print('<head><title>Hello</title></head><body>Hello, world!</body>')\n\nThis can be run by telling your web server to run this script as a CGI program. This is not a modern recommended practice for several out-of-the-scope-of-this-discussion reasons but it's great for educational purposes. The idea is, you set up your web server to serve any given route by running this program and then sending the output to the client. Using this example, Python itself isn't handing HTTP requests, the web server is, and it's adding additional context that can be accessed through environment variables or even reading STDIN to handle posts, etc. \n\nOnce you've got that, you can start doing more clever things, like mapping out endpoints and having the browser make asynchronous requests to those end points to dynamically update already-loaded pages.",

Hell even displaying information in a console isn't straightforward in functional programming. Read about Monads if you want to know what I mean (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)\n\n\nNow this isn't to say functional languages are bad. They have a lot of applications in science and research  due to the way they enforce consistency, especially when you want to parallelize operations without worrying about shared resources management. it's just that in my opinion, functional programming isn't designed for a lot of enterprise level software that modern software engineers work with.",

        "body": "You're asking more questions than you think. \n\n1.) Tech is extremely competitive. Many factors contribute to this. It used to be that tech seemed such a brain-dead obvious bet for a lucrative career that it seemed foolish *not* to attempt some sort of STEM career. This means that you can have a CS degree, several fullstack apps in your portfolio, and are able to steamroll the LeetCode 150 and not even get interviews. The constant rejection of any job search process is soul sucking, but the energy that goes into the ground level for software development makes the search a really special journey into feelings of worthlessness.\n\n2.) Gaming is the worst part of tech. That's not even discussing the wild freefall the AAA side of the industry is experiencing. The reason is because gaming is a prestige position. No matter what happens, folks like you are gonna say, \"I don't care. I want to make games.\" Because games are awesome. Since the line to work on projects is out the door, management can pay less and work their talent harder. A normal tech job outside of start-ups can give a really good work/life balance, even more so if you land a remote position. That is considerably less likely for a similar position at a gaming company. Call it crunch or \"Bioware magic,\" but those companies you dream of working for know about your dreams, for better or worse. \n\n3.) As game projects increase in scale, distribution of labor gets more distinct. You aren't \"programming a game,\" you're \"responsible for the flow of the inventory system but not the menu system itself or the actual UI of the system.\" This isn't a bad thing. It's just how the sausage is made. But it can take away some of the razzle-dazzle of \"making a game.\" \n\n4.) This is an incredible time to work in a small group or going yolo solo. Unreal Engine is free, and blueprints make it a lot more accessible than raw-dogging C++. Unity is free (but don't use Unity). Godot is free. Phaser3 is free. YouTube U is free. Check out /r/gamedev and r/IndieDev. There are posts on those forums every other day from folks who are further than you in this process asking themselves, \"Am I wasting my time?\" And the answers may be illuminating. \n\n5.) Game dev just isn't something you should be going into for love of the game if you want to make money. If you shift to the most lucrative corners of making games, you will bleed out your love, and if you focus hard on making projects of love, you won't have as much money or as much help (co-workers), and it's an uphill battle to be noticed. Undertale is the exception. Balatro is the exception. Vampire Survivors is the exception. I hope you're an exception.... but you'll probably need a day job or a rich spouse/parent. \n\n6.) Learning to program is worth it as a skill on its own, I truly believe that. I LOVE that I can have an idea, think about how to make it, and just... make it. It's a really, really fun superpower. It was also really hard won. Understanding how all the pipes fit together beneath the user level is incredibly useful. I think everyone should at least learn to build and deploy a CRUD app without AI so they can just understand what the hell is happening. That said, there are other parts of the game industry than programmers or artists, same as there are other paths in \"tech\" besides engineers, bright-eyed founders, and parasitic C-suite villains.",

There is nothing wrong with having your own opinion about it too.\n\nFor me personally, writing \"clean code\" is more about understandable code and less about esthetics. Can someone else (or your future you) still understands what is happening? Nifty details like where to put brackets are only a small part of that. Naming conventions, proper separation of concerns and reducing unnecessary complexity are more important if you would ask me.",

There are some weird sideeffects to everything, and throughout the book he seems to think that sideeffects are okay as long as they happen inside the same object. That was kind of the OOP-way of thinking back then, not so much now. And while I'm certainly not a fan of methods just throwing Exceptions without explaining why or where they originated, that is more of a Java thing.\n\nBut I kind of agree with you, that the entire book seems \"ugly\" - there are a lot of good suggestions in there, but then they are intertwined with crazy \"rules\" that seems made up on the spot, and the strange flow in the text and the small illustrations just makes everything seem \"messy\".",

This is nowhere near the same thing as taking a course.\n\nWith that said, you could slog through the text books, and then sign up for 1 semester at WGU or some other similar school, pregame a bunch of the outsourced learning when possible, and then test out of everything.  This would get you a CS degree in \"a single semester,\" which basically just means it's a very cost-effective approach if you are disciplined and/or smart enough.\n\nPersonally, I've taken a more organic approach of just pursuing things when I'm interested in them, and always pushing myself to dive deeper in the why behind things.  It takes a lot longer, but is more fun for me.  For instance, I taught myself web dev and explored that for a while, then moved onto lower-level things with C++ by making a game engine.  Now I have dived deeper into embedded systems and learned to program Arm assembly.  This has taught me a lot about logic gates and CPU architecture.  Along the way, I have learned and practiced data structures and algorithms whenever I needed to or felt like it.\n\nNext up is either going to be learning network protocols for IoT stuff, or learning operating system design to create my own RTOS.  Eventually I'll get into database design when I want to, and I think that about covers everything.

On paper, you have one big reason for people to throw your resume out right away, and with thousands of options that's exactly what they'll do. You're going to need a connection pretty much.

It's like I understood the concept but my mind didnt understand yet how to use those new concepts and put them together. It took a while for me to get that confidence and that switch of knowing how to actually use what I'm learning and it wasn't really one singular thing, tutorials did kind of help me, and projects DEFINITELY pushed that learning even further, but it was mainly answering programming questions and basically trying to teach everything I learned to someone or something. Obviously I wasn't good at programming, but because I was passionate about the field I would still try to answer programming questions and so I would study the concept and fact-check myself all the time, because I dont want to give the other person wrong information. Basically the Feynmann technique. It works really well for me.\n\n Just simple [rubber duck debugging](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) and answering questions helped me go from not understanding how to put new concepts together to being able to write code confidently. Because I was taking my time and explaining everything like I was a teacher and that helped me slow down and understand the benefits and the reasons for some of the concepts I was using like loops and functions, it opened my eyes to what I did and didnt understand. By answering programming questions I also read a lot of code that wasn't mine and that also helped me understand documentation a lot better as well teaching me how to identify good coding practices. As for when I learned to understand it all? I don't know,  it took months and I have no idea when it clicked. I think a lot of it is a gradual process.

Don't expect your solution to look anything like that solution. Don't aim for any specific length. It might be 3 lines of code, it might be 30 lines of code.

Well there a bunch of space before, a bunch of \"o\" in the middle and then we go to next line so the code become:\n\n    for each line \n      print_spaces(numbers of spaces)\n      print_stars(numbers of o)\n\nNow can you do print\\_spaces and print stars ? Well we just need to repeat the same stuff the specified number of time, something like:\n\n    line = \"\"\n    repeat for numbers of spaces\n      line = line + \" \"\n    repeat for numbers of o\n      line = line + \"*\"\n    print line\n\nBut to be more concise, we could write as well:\n\n    line = repeat(\" \", number of spaces) + repeat(\"o\", number of o)\n    print line\n\nwhere repeat would repeat the string the number of time we want. That's not so different than\n\n    line = \" \".repeat(number of spaces) + \"o\".repeat(number of o)\n\nor even:\n\n    print \" \".repeat(number of spaces) + \"o\".repeat(number of o)\n\nNow how many number of stars we have per line ? From the solution it's:\n\n    Math.floor((i * 2 - 1 - row) / 2)\n\nTo really get it, we would need to understand what i and row are as well as floor. But you can likely come with you own way to count the spaces.\n\nFrom your pyramid, to me it look like there zero space on the bottom pyramid and 1 the one before, then 2, then 3. So it like the (max line number) - (current line number) - 1 So the whole for me would be\n\n    for I in range(0, max_line - 1)\n      num_spaces = I + 1\n      num_o = max_line - I - 1\n      print (\" \".repeat(num_spaces) + \"o\".repeat(num_o) \n\nor\n\n    for I in range(0, max_line - 1)\n      print (\" \".repeat(I+1) + \"o\".repeat(max_line - I - 1) \n\nAnyway, what I try to explain to you that you go step by step, trying to solve a complex problem by dividing it in smaller problems and solve each sub problem one at a time.\n\nIt the same even for the Math.floor method you would normally have constructed it step by step.\n\nAnd yes maybe repeat was introduced too fast in their example of maybe, the Math.floor was not well introduced. They gone too fast and you are lost now.\n\nBut doesn't mean you could not do it on your own with smaller learning step and couldn't master all that with enough training.",

Because you've put that in quotation marks.\n\nSadly creativity was always or has become almost a meme, because (as the other posts confirm indirectly) it sounds like some kind of superpower for almost anything, from programming and maths (\"multiple way to solve a problem\") till songwriting and visual artwork (doesn't even need any argument for those...does it?).\nBut actually creativity is something so abstract that one could write philosophical essays about it (no irony here). And in my experience most jobs, even the more intellectual ones (or maybe especially those) have the cliché that they give you freedom of how-to-do-this-task, no monotony but possibility to be even creative, and so on.\nMy experience is that sure some people are lucky and get their visions and wishes related to their job satisfied and most things are as great as they expected, but that's unfortunately more exception than a rule...\n\nI studied chemistry for few years and how did I learn for maths, physics, chemistry modules etc.? By f-ing REPEATING various catalogs of \"questions/tasks that can be asked in the exam\". That's frustrating and I'd hope less people would have to work and especially to learn this way (because it's one of the heaviest turn-offs imo).\n\nBefore I drift off into more pessimistic stuff, one thing I can tell you as a (hobby-)musician and occassional painter that aside from let's say 0.1% of the population who have superpowers, top genetics and were raised very effective & without any damages, creativity is a bit like natural mutual attraction (\"love\") - you can't enforce it. Still you want to achieve it, how you should do that?\n\nBy doing certain activities, which you have to find out for yourself, what fits for you somehow, the newer and the more they differ from each other, the better. Just try things out you wanted to f.e.. You will gain experience, expand your conciousness (literally & still in a natural way), the more contrasts you can gather and experience, the better. Nothing is true, everything is permitted!\nAnd by automatically building new associative nodes & connections in your neural system / \"soul\" through this gathering of new experiences, by natural passive (\"background-process\"-)learning you will already make one step after the other on the way to more creativity. Will, patience and time - I know, we all need especially the second one, but it's possible :)\n\nA bit untypical my whole post, but I hope this gives you some inspiration and new thoughts. I wish you success and optimism for your goals and your future.",

However, code in the real world has to be constantly maintained by several developers. The piece of code that you wrote today should still be understandable to you when you read it 6 months from now (and you've forgotten all about it) and understandable by your teammate who has never worked in that part of the code and maybe has never even met you.\n\nSo your plain loop solution would still be good, and some might argue even \"better\" than the clever single liner.",

But it's rarely (i.e. almost never) important to have the \"perfect mathematical solution\" to a given problem, even assuming one exists.\n\nFor this particular problem, I would personally look at the pattern first. How many spaces do you need to print at each row, if the pyramid has a height of 4? Do it manually first in a text editor: 3, 2, 1, 0. Now, what if it has a height of 5? Manually in a text editor: 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.\n\nNow do the same for how many \"o\"s you need to print. That one is a little easier. It always starts at 1 and then it always advances by 2, to count out all the odd numbers until the pyramid is done: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ....\n\nSo in this situation I would say that the \"goold ol' C-style for loop\" is easier to understand in this situation. Luckily JavaScript supports that style of loop:\n\n    // Pretend that height comes from the user.\n    let height = 4;\n    // Starting out the pyramid with an initial \\n so that it looks\n    // nicer inside the JS Console.\n    let pyramid = \"\\n\";\n    let ohs = 1;\n    for (let spaces = height-1; spaces >= 0; spaces--, ohs += 2) { \n        pyramid += \" \".repeat(spaces) + \"o\".repeat(ohs) + \"\\n\";\n    }\n    console.log(pyramid);\n\nSome people won't like that style and will prefer a more \"functional\" or \"mathematically correct\" style. But at the end of the day your job is to solve whatever problem you have, in a way that is easy for you to understand and which is fast enough. The above solution is perhaps less \"elegant\" but it gets the job done and it's usually easier to debug code like that than to debug code which is too much in a functional \"mathematical\" style.",

Those skills can always be used, even if just on the side.\n\nAI doesn't have a chance to take over software developers until it has the cognitive capabilities of a human - and by the time AI can do that, EVERY job is going to be replaceable so there is no reason to even worry about this. Even if AI does get to that point, you will still be better off having spent your time learning than doing nothing valuable with it instead, learning and preserverence are skills too.",

C is a bit unforgiving, it totally lets you shoot yourself in the foot and C++ lets you do the same, except that your entire leg is gone afterwards.\n\nBeware of any mention, that C++ and C# are just supersets of C. That might have been true very very early on, but both have diverged from C quite a bit, some things just work differently.\n\nFind a resource, that teaches C with a proper focus on how to write secure code, having to debug undefined Behaviour, memory leaks and segfaults is no fun if you just came from python. Personally I like the book \"Effective C\" by Robert C Seacord. Despite the name, (effective LANGUAGE usually means advanced in a lot of programming books) it is written for beginners, but it is well written, up to date and doesn't make stupid errors where the example code won't even compile (surprisingly common).\n\nThen, once you have a grip on the language, implement various algorithms, like the problems on [projecteuler.net](http://projecteuler.net), reading and processing some files, playing with raylib (since you came from gamedev with godot). The best way to learn C is writing programs in C, but they need to be small self contained things that compile cleanly and pass through valgrind cleanly. But most importantly, you need to understand various concepts of C first, otherwise the compiler will be like a girlfriend you forget to feed.\n\nIf you have a sound understanding of computer science, you might read the K&R book, but it is written for seasoned programmers that just don't know C, yet. It is from a time when Programmers already went through college and might had a PhD or a Master at minimum, home computers and self-taught coders weren't really a thing yet. It assumes that you know how computers work, potentially already have programmed in some form of assembly. It's more of a historic document than a valid learning resource. Don't get me wrong on this, it's a great read and you definitely should read it at some point in your learning journey, but it isn't the *best* way to learn C, anymore.",

The pressure drove me to pick it up in a month, become proficient by six months, and complete production migration within the year. Now I use Ansible everywhere. That's automation born from necessity.\n\nMore often though, automation springs from fixing daily annoyances. I hate tracking my hours, so I built an iOS shortcut that logs my ins/outs and generates a weekly spreadsheet for my boss. When I used to distrohop on Linux, I created an Ansible dotfiles repo to streamline setups.\n\nThe key is to identify what genuinely annoys you, then ask \"how would I automate this?\" The search for solutions naturally follows.",

Rust programs often call into libraries written in C, C++, and other languages, and sometimes you'll need to read, debug, or modify that code too. So knowing C++ is pretty useful.\n\nAnother reason is that experiencing the flaws of C++ will help Rust make a lot more sense. Rust was designed in particular because it just wasn't possible to write memory-safe code in C++. There's no better way to appreciate that than to try to write C++ and to see how an error can cause your program to crash or corrupt memory, then to experience how Rust prevents that code from even compiling.",

There’s a huge global system (the Domain Name System) that manages the mapping from domain names to IP addresses, and your computer relies on that system to resolve any domain names to IP addresses.\n\nURLs, or Uniform Resource Locators, are strings that can be used to specify the locations of resources. The host name portion of an URL can use a domain name or an IP address to specify a host (which might actually be more than one machine), but each scheme (the first part of the URL, e.g. `https:`, `mailto:`, etc.) has its own rules for interpreting the rest of the URL. For example, the `tel:` scheme is followed by a phone number rather than host name.\n\nThere’s no real difference between accessing a machine via IP or domain name; the sending machine resolves a domain name into an IP address using DNS as part of establishing communication. The actual connection is made using the IP address. So, yes, hacking is also done using IP addresses, but no, that’s not really a basis for hacking — it’s just how internet communication works.",

It's unlikely to concern you.\n\nYour computer is behind your ISP router. He is the one managing your public IP (unless you buy your own IP address and start managing your AS). By default, this router won't allow anyone to enter.\n\nThe worst that can happen is that somebody tries to jam the router's interface. That's basically a DoS (Denial of Service) or DDoS (Distributed DoS) .

        "body": "Let’s be a little more specific on what happens. IP addresses are routing addresses assigned to an internet endpoint. They work like mailing addresses and just like mailing addresses have nothing to do with whether there’s a locked door or even a building at the site. Also, just as a large building might have an internal mailroom, computers connecting to a local network like your WiFi router will have a local address behind your internet connection’s public one. They usually start with 192.168 or 10.x. These local devices cannot be reached directly unless a forwarding rule of some kind is set up. They can only receive responses to their requests and this affords them a lot of protection from attack. \n\nThe DNS system is an aliasing system. You can buy or really rent with the right to renew a domain like mysite.com from a trusted registrar. They’ll have a portal where you can specify that mysite.com should direct traffic to a certain ip address or forward it to another domain. There are other entries for email addresses using that domain and several options. Browsing to the site involves using DNS to do a destination lookup and then sending traffic to the final ip. This also allows those IPs to change if needed. The second part of this is traffic encryption using a ssl cert the registrar sells you and verifies on the fly. This addresses most DNS breaches other than the authority itself because the traffic recipient must also have a copy of the cert.\n\nNone of this is actually securing your computer. It’s just addressing and impersonation prevention and traffic encryption. That’s more the realm of firewalls that block suspicious traffic and anti malware that disables suspicious programs.",

I used to be quite competitive during bachelor's and put a lot of effort into staying ahead, but in the masters, I just realized that having a more nuanced and focused skill set is more productive. Webdev, on its own, is oversaturated, and maybe you need to find a specific thing in your field that is special and make you really stand out.  That skill might not be used to the employers but showcase that you are smart.\n\nIn my case, I have a degree in ai, and I got a job offer not because they needed an AI spesielt but because they think that makes me smart(i dont know about that tho 😅).\nSomeone with a deep understanding of a topic that they dont teach in uni will be better prepared for the industry than someone with good leetcode stats.",

This is done **within the same stack frame**, and the function does not create new stack memory. Memory stays constant and predictable unless you create new objects manually.\n\nHowever, in case of recursion, each function call gets **its own stack frame** in the call stack. This stack frame stores local variables, return address, parameters, etc., When a recursive call is made, the current function is paused and pushed onto the call stack. Once the base condition is met, the calls start returning one by one as the stack entries are popped.\n\nNow you might understand that if you go too deep using recursion, it will cause too much of piling on the stack and if the input is too big, it would end up creating a **StackOverflowError**.\n\nHope it is helpful :) I'll may be write a detailed blog post on my Substack and a link here later when it is done.",

You have to use a pointer. Arrays have never become full first-class values in C. You also can't assign one array to another:\n\n    int x[2];\n    int y[2];\n    x = y;\n\nThe reason, 50 years ago, was that it would have required emitting too many assembly language instructions from that one statement (and passing a large array as a value can overflow your stack); the restriction has never been lifted because `strcpy` and `memcpy` work better for most people.*\n\nAs for why it's a pointer to the first character of the string and not to the string: pointers in C are designed to be the interface to arrays. They're how you access any element of an array, any time you do. An array, when used as a value, is always converted to a pointer to its first element; adding (or subtracting) an integer to a pointer moves it that many places through the array, and, of course dereferencing the result accesses the selected element.\n\n`x[i]` is syntax sugar for `*(x + i)`, which means (assuming `x` is an array): take a pointer to the first element of `x`, move that pointer (hopefully forward) `i` positions, then get the element at that location.\n\nSo once you have a pointer into an array, you can access the whole array from there.\n\n\n* Citation needed, according to anyone who's ever passed the wrong length to `memcpy` and smashed the return address on the call stack. But fixing that produces a *very* different language than C.",

A typical place to draw this line is at the edge of well defined objects in your domain\n\nLayers help you stick to solving for certain implementation problems related to a subset of the technology. Some common layers are\n- data store \n- data access or orm \n- domain or business logic\n- api\n- presentation \n\nWhat I've found is that the edge seems to be a bit wider in the presentation layer than what you want for the domain layer and to do that you sometimes want to inflate the boundary in the data access layer, but this can introduce problems with the domain layer\n\nA good compromise is to create summary types which you can refer to in the presentation layer without having to load entire objects\n\nHappy to talk through this stuff.

Show up, join a team, and build a solution in 48 hours with your team, and present it to the judges.  \n\nThere are a few benefits of this approach:    \n  \n1) It raises the stakes. Suddenly, you're not just completing an exercise to get some course's Certificate Of Completion. Suddenly, there are prizes involved, and team mates who rely on you (and who you rely on). It makes it much more exciting. As a result, you'll be driven to learn things you wouldn't have expected to, and end up with a richer learning experience.   \n2) It will boost your confidence. You might be competing against people doing PhDs. And you'll suddenly realise that even though you're 14, your project is could still beat theirs (and in some competitions, it will).    \n3) It's the most fun learning environment. The real purpose of going to a hackathon is to learn a new skill. Often, hackathons are sponsored by someone who has invented a new technology of some sort and who wants to promote it among the software community. By doing a hackathon and learning that skill, you become among the first one in your town who gets experience with it, and you find that a few months to a year later, there are job ads for someone who knows that skill (and of course, no applicant does). Knowing the newest technology gives your IT projects a big advantage, because new technologies tend to make your projects better.   \n  \nHope that's useful. Good luck!",

While Python is great at data-wrangling scripts and ML, it's a fairly sub-optimal for enterprise applications due to lower runtime performance and no support for data encapsulation. C++ is blazingly fast for compute-intensive algorithms thanks to your ability to allocate just as much memory as you need on the page-level, but I'd rather shoot myself in the foot than build applications with very high IO throughput.

        "body": "Sorry if this is not what you're looking for but here's a brief summary using C as an example because it is kinda the base and most other languages like java and python run by doing something with C.\n\nFirst, computers have CPUs, they are the things doing the instructions your code makes. Code and CPU instructions aren't a one to one mapping, the way a language works is it must be translated to CPU instructions. In the case of C the thing that does this is called a compiler.\n\n  \nCPU instructions are whats known as binary code. Assembly language is a CPU specific programming language that takes CPU binary code and puts labels on specific binary strings that mean do this thing. For example ADD. CPUs also have access to registers, which just hold a few bytes of values, for example a 32 bit machine 4 bytes 64 8 bytes, etc. These registers are what the CPU uses to do math with. So ADD register1, register2 would take the sum of these two numbers and put it into register 1.\n\n  \nAssembly is a 1:1 mapping with that architectures binary, meaning if you learn to understand it you can write code that tells the CPU exactly what to do. C is an abstraction on assembly, meaning that it let's you write code, the compiler does something, then you get an assembly file. For your use case you don't need to know how this file works, but the general theory is pretty simple, basically it builds a stack, which is just like a pile of variables, and the compiler writes the assembly in a way that instead of variable int x, it's base of the stack + 10 bytes or something. And that is how it knows where x lives. But again you don't need to know this right now.\n\n  \nWhat you need to know is that when you compile C code, you get an executable, a file you can run directly in the command line, or just run like any other windows exe or other executable I forget the mac and linux extensions. You can do this in command line or depending on the code treat the executable like it's own app.\n\nPython is a little different. Python itself is a language built in C. Python does not compile into an executable, python is an executable. When you click run, all it does is the command python3 yourfilename.py. python3 is an assembly file that opens the file yourfilename.py, reads what you wrote, and then figures out what to do with the text and updates things accordingly. You CAN compile python, but it's not popular, not efficient and kinda weird.\n\n  \nSorry this is random and disorganized thoughts, please if you have questions ask me i like talking about this stuff if you couldn't already tell.",

It is not easy to break into without internships and published papers.\n\nIf you just want to use models and integrate them into products. Then that’s pretty easy and doesn’t require you to understand much of what goes on under the hood.\n\nIf you want to actually train models and understand what is going on under the hood, then that requires a decent grasp on college maths, stats, machine learning, and being comfortable reading research papers.\n\nI’d also give you a heads up that the approaches used by modern LLMs are very different to classical NLP methods. Deep learning and the transformer architecture have upended traditional approaches in many fields and this is a case where a textbook written even 5 years ago will be grossly out of date.",

Maybe you learn you hate it so much you would never take a job where the company uses it? That’s a really important outcome if so! Or alternatively you have a moment where you get it and it becomes a non-issue.\n\nIMO the best use of Tailwind is something like Shadcn/UI which builds upon a headless framework, Radix, then uses tailwind in a really effective way with overrides and theme extensions. If you haven’t dug around a well maintained Shadcn/UI project on GitHub I recommend you do so.\n\nOh also having to look up documentation/cheat sheet… have you installed the tailwind extension in VS Code? It’s a big help. You can hover over classes and it will show you the CSS behind them.",

When you are good at programming, the language really doesn't mater you can pick up a new one in a weekend for fun.\n\nIf you are pre-college I would say use whatever language you like, learn it, build programs with it, get good at programming i.e. breaking large problems down into smaller problems, then breaking those smaller problems down into even smaller problems, keep doing that until you can tell the computer what steps it needs to perform.\n\nWhen I went to college a long long time ago, there was basically 1 de-facto language, C, that was the language it best to know because most people there knew it and you could do your assignments in C.  Not sure if colleges these day have a de-facto language.  But if you are in college being good with the defacto language would probably be best.\n\nIf you are out of college but not working, look at what jobs are in the area, or look at what kinds of jobs you want and see what language(s) they would like you to have.  \n\nIf you are working then get good at the language you are using at work before branching out.  \n\nIf you are retired do whatever the hell you want. :-)",

There's been C++14, C++17, etc standards too. \n\nProgramming is simultaneously easier and harder. It's easier because the newer languages like Python and Javascript are easier to get productive in and easier to learn. It's harder because it doesn't punish bad coding habits so your projects can become hard to maintain. Also there are a lot more frameworks and libraries to learn if you want to build bigger apps. The frameworks make coding easier because you they abstract away implementation details, but there are so many around that it can become overwhelming. \n\nThere's also more online development platforms nowadays, so you can start to learn coding online without installing anything on your machine. The barrier to entry is very low, but the skill ceiling is very high. \n\nI would say if you want to dip your toe in, go with python or javascript. Javascript is better for web programming, and python is better for general automation and machine learning. Or you could even dip your toes back into C++. \n\nOnline compiler/editor to try out a few coding languages: [https://www.onlinegdb.com/](https://www.onlinegdb.com/) \n\nThis one is for python, check out a youtube video on it.

A good design gives you that \"ah hah\" feeling when reading through the code, like \"oh, someone really thought about how this was going to work\".\n\nOf the two, I would say that having a good design is about 50x more important than having good \"style\". If you give me a program with bad style but a good design, then all I have to do is run clang-format on it (or the equiivalent). However, if you give me a program with a terrible design, then there's no amount of automation that can fix that. It's like building a house on a bad foundation.\n\nNow, that being said, if you can't even be bothered to run code styling tools on your code, then if you were to give me your code, then it will inevitably create some kind of a mildly to grossly bad impression in my opinion. It's a bit like sending me an e-mail riddled with typos. Sure, maybe I can still read it, but couldn't you have at least taken 2 seconds to press F7 and do the spell check before sending it?

Just learn a few ideas.\n\nHere are some quick ones.\n\n* Learn good variable names and function names (harder than you think, but valuable).\n* Write lots of short functions (a bit controversial), say 50 lines at most.\n* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). Don't copy/paste the same code. If you're doing that, write a function that has that common code.\n\nYou're writing smaller projects that's maybe 500 lines or so. This doesn't require the same level of organization as huge programs with many files. However, it is good to organize the code within a single file.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't worry about how fast your program runs. It runs fast. Until you learn DSA (mostly the algorithms), it's hard to improve the speed, and often meaningless. \n\nOh yes, learn from others. You'll see better solutions out there. Don't beat yourself up that you didn't come up with it. Most people can't come up with brilliant code. Instead, they see others, and imitate it.

Can't stress how important it is to have a long whiteboard session at the beginning.  Map out the plan and stick to it until mvp.  Test it, show it to the customer, then refactor only if necessary.   And usually you will only be refactoring for maintainability and readability not for efficiency.   You're just starting so you are a long ways off from needing to write \"efficient\" code.  Most of the time people toil days or weeks to reduce a few lines of code which ultimately saves microseconds.   Not worth it you'll burn out and start accumulating tech debt.  So I agree with the general sentiment of get it working first then tune it only if necessary. \n\nPoint of clarity, im not saying do not write \"clean\" code that's different.

In that case, you'll have to *think* about how to solve the problem you're faced with. And there is always a possibility of making a mistake in your thinking. Those are the mistakes that tests can help you catch.\n\nTo use your example of input validation: Maybe you have a set of ideas in your head about what kinds of inputs are valid, and what inputs are invalid. And maybe you write a regex that matches only valid inputs. The test exists to make sure you wrote that regex correctly, so that its behavior matches what you had in mind.\n\n(You could argue that if the regex is wrong, you'll notice the problem just by running the code and experimenting with it. Doing this kind of interactive testing is good, but on its own, it's a very unreliable and error-prone way of testing. Writing the tests down in an automated test suite helps you make sure you didn't miss anything. And most importantly, it tells you if a later change introduces a new bug, without you having to manually test every single feature every time you touch the code.)\n\nOf course it's possible you'll make a mistake in the tests too.

The reason you write tests isn't necessarily because you want to catch all of the things you already thought of.\n\nWriting tests is inherently tricky. The essence of writing tests is thinking about the ways that your code might fail, and then enshrining that in a test. For simple functions, that's easier than it is for complex functions.\n\nI think the core thing that you're missing is that tests aren't for testing whether your particular slice of code works under ideal conditions; it's often more about future-proofing your code, like when you make changes to variables, or the way that certain key variables are broadly calculated; and suddenly your tests can alert you that your function isn't working as intended because you couldn't account for how your code would evolve in the future.\n\nDoes that make sense?",

It might just be undefined behaviour\n\nIts best to just check the documentation for whatever library you are using though. Semantics can vary.\n\nEdit:\n\nI also like the answer in the reddit thread someone else linked that mutexs can be reentrant. Reentrancy doesnt really make sense for semaphores.\n\nThe top answer talks more about the fact that semaphores are built for managing concurrent access to a pool of resources (they store a counter for how many \"resources\" are available), where as mutexes are about critical sections. For clean code, you should really use these constructs for only the associated purpose above, even if you can use the other, since the names \"semaphore\" and \"mutex\" come with these connotations.\n\nAdditionally, just sticking to using them for these purposes will basically automatically help you avoid problems with differences in reentrancy and and who can call up()/unlock().",

I think going through some beginners books or courses like you do is certainly a good start. I like this book which is available on GitHub for free and you can work on it directly in Colab:\n\n  \n[https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/)\n\ngoing through some texts gives you \"muscle memory\" and usually helps. Once you have done the course and worked through a book, it should be much easier to see where you are going. Especially for Python there are lots of great resources. \n\nWhen people speak about \"advanced Python\" it is not a specific course, but rather some ideas/concepts/approaches that you do not see in a beginners course. These could include iterators and generators (e.g. yield), decorators and content managers (with, wraps), typing and packaging (type hints, virtual environments, concurrency (async, await), metaprogramming (metaclasses, \\_\\_getattr\\_\\_, descriptors), performance and memory (profiling, understanding how NumPy works).\n\nI think that consistency is important. It is a matter of working 1-2 hours every day. After 3 months you should be at a good beginner level. 9-12 months might get you closer to being ready for a job. Of course, everybody is different and times depend on the individual. Using AI to help explain code or comment on your code. If you use it wisely it can act as a personal tutor. (It can also solve most of the beginner exercises, but then you don't learn much.) \n\nThere is also material you should learn like a web framework, databases, testing (pytest) , git, docker, basic deployment. \n\nI would think of this as an ongoing task. There is much to learn and you should continuously expand your skillset. In fact there is so much that each software engineer or programmer develops a rather individual profile as you cannot learn everything. For a new project you  might need to learn a new tool or a new skill, which is why after many years you become a more rounded programmer. \n\nBy the way, it turns out that employers often like experienced programmers at a level that early graduates/beginners can hardly achieve. It is a good idea to work on many different projects of your own, and put them on GitHub to develop a portfolio of projects and skills to show off. This is a great way to learn and show off what you have achieved.",

This won't work for you, because your frontend will be served from `something.github.io` and it will need to make API requests to `somethingelse.vercel.app`.\n\nIn order to get around this, you will need to use the appropriate [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS) headers on your backend. This is how your backend tells the browser that it is \"opting in\" to receiving requests that are triggered by your frontend domain. \n\nHowever, if your app handles any private information (including authentication credentials) then you need to be very careful with this. Make sure you're only allowing the access that you want to, from the domains that you intend to. There are a lot of terrible tutorials that will tell you to use headers like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` which is very insecure in a lot of cases.\n\n(The same-origin policy won't affect things like cron jobs that are making requests to your backend directly. It only affects browsers, because it affects the situation where a browser is making requests *on behalf* of a user, initiated by domain A, and sending/receiving data to domain B. The policy is needed to prevent the browser from accidentally compromising the user's data in situations where either domain A or domain B is untrustworthy.)",

Every time a manager schedules a one on one meeting with me, I'm nervous that this is it and they finally figured out that I'm dumb.\n\nThe thing is, though, that to be a good programmer, you have to get really comfortable with not knowing stuff. People naturally get very defensive about not knowing things, but learning about any one thing takes time. For a programmer, there are far too many things to know about any given situation, so your time to learn things is always very limited. You have to budget. \"Do I need to know more about how this platform works, or do I need to know how this one library works, or do I need to know how HTTP is meant to handle this, or do I need to learn how to use that new AI thingy to debug this, or...\" You have to pick. That means you have to get comfortable not knowing some things and planning out what you need to learn.\n\nThe more senior you are, the more this is true. You'll eventually need to start delegating work to others, and the whole point of that is that you don't need to come completely up to speed on all of the details of what they're doing. And in meetings, the new kids will have even worse imposter syndrome than you do, and they'll never want to admit they don't know something, so it's your job as the senior engineer to ask clarifying questions, sometimes even when you know the answer, even if you think it'll make you look dumb, to make sure the junior devs don't have to ask on their own.\n\nSome developers solve the imposter syndrome by cultivating a giant ego. \"I can't be an imposter; I'm a programming god, a 10x hax0r, I look down on fools who use (vi or emacs) instead of (emacs or vi).\" Don't become that guy. Just get comfortable with feeling a little like an imposter.",

Layoffs, managers who expect impossible tasks to be done, burnout etc. But there are fields where things are more chill, you can get 20 hour weeks and not make as much but you'll have a work life balance.\n\nI worked at defense industry my first job (RTX, Lockheed martin, BAE, etc). This was widely known as the chill job for SWEs. I worked 20 hour weeks and was an overperformer and I did Scrum master duties on the side. Had I stayed i'd probably be considered a Sr Level 2, or a Principal by now and im only 7 YOE. \n\nI left due to pay (started at 75k and made close to 90k after 4 years) and lack of work tbh. But if you can get in one of those jobs, quickly get a security clearance, you are all set. They try to retain people in these jobs because of the clearances. So even in down years at most you might just be thrown in some repetitive maintenance project until better projects come. \n\nIt sounds like you are lookiing more for this type of work. DOnt get me wrong, there are things that you mentioned that still happened, like managers expecting impossible tasks to be done but tbh, most people barely bat an eye when it takes you forever to complete a task.

Your goal is to over time develop an income producing portfolio that gives you a lot of options financially (aka FU money).

A significant part of our job is process/red-tape. At startups, process/red-tape can be straight up non-existant. You're lucky if you end up at a startup that has some halway decent dev processes in place.\n\nBut at a large company, process is key. There are very strict best practices in place. There's very strict change management, very strict approvals, very strict boundaries of responsibility, etc, etc, etc. They're simply too large to let devs just cowboy code some stuff into prod that gets introduced to their millions of users right away. They also have internal and external audits to think about, where they're straight up auditing *the process*. If your processes aren't good, you're going to fail an audit, and failing an external audit can have a significant negative impact on the company and its clients.\n\nAll companies will feel slow compared to startups. Not just big tech. Startups are trying to get their code and product out into the world as fast as humanly possible. It's like Facebook's old mantra (which they've since ditched) \"Move Fast and Break Things\". Who cares if what you released into prod broke something? You'll have a patch up in 10 minutes.\n\nEstablished companies are more focused on keeping things stable, not distrupting their user base, staying in compliance with all the many compliance/regulations/frameworks they need to abide to to make their customers feel warm and fuzzy inside. A short downtime can easily lose 6-7 figures for them, whereas a startup DGAF about downtime. The benefit of releasing code quickly outweights whatever negative would come from prod issues.\n\nOne thing that will be very valuable for *you* from a career-growth perspective is seeing what heavy-process looks like. Look at what this company is doing, how it differs from the startup world, what the pros/cons are, etc. That gives you multiple perspectives to view any given problem from in the future. You can consider stability and process, while also considering quick delivery. There's ***a lot*** of companies in-between the 2 extremes that highly value that kind of perspective.",

I'm not stupid, I know the one and only reason you're reaching out to me is to advance your career. You're not reaching out to me because you want to be buddies, or want to form a genuine relationship. You're reaching out to me to use my status for your benefit. The minute you no longer need anything from me, we're not going to continue talking, or having coffee chats.\n\nThe alumni from my University that are a part of my network are the ones that *I knew in college*. My genuine friends. People I directly worked with, studied with, partied with, etc. The fact you happened to go to the same school I did doesn't really mean anything to me, there's hundreds of thousands of livnig alumni from my University. Over ten thousand graduate every year. Can you imagine if even one percent of the alumni base sent me LinkedIn messages asking for a coffee chat?\n\nIf you met me in a bar, or doing some hobby out in the wild, we got to talking, found out we went to the same college, and became fast friends, *then* I would be happy to refer you. We formed a genuine relationship *first*, in an environment where I don't feel like you're using me or the connection was fake. *That's* what I consider networking. Making friends in the wild. This actually happens quite a lot to me, there's a lot of alumni living in my city, and I've made some good friends because of it.\n\nI'm not actively annoyed at getting cold messages or anything, I'm not getting angry, I'm not personally offended that someone tried to reach out to me. I just ignore them.\n\nDon't let me discourage you though.... maybe 1000 alumni ignore you, but 1 responds and you get a job because of it. So it could totally still be worth it, and there's not really a downside. That's just how I personally view cold messaging, and I feel like most of the people I know personally operate the same way.",

While you may not use a B-Tree IRL, understanding Big(O) and fundamentals of how algorithms work, and how you approach breaking down problems is something that's good to understand.\n\nProblem is that then interviewees started memorizing the problems and optimal solutions, and it kinda became an arms race between interviewers and interviewees. There's an entire industry around helping people prepare for interviews with the FAANG companies, and so much resources out there on YouTube and so forth that teach you exactly how to do all of these things, so the standards got pushed up so high that if you \\*can't\\* do leetcode questions, you just look bad compared to someone who can. And we still don't have a good way of gauging effective workers.",

So sure, while there are a lot of valid criticisms about this particular type of interview, it makes sense to suck it up and try to get reasonably good that them. Personally I think leetcode problems are somewhat fun to solve and they're at least a semi-standardized interview format which is better than not knowing what you're walking into. But it's absolutely annoying to have to prepare for something that doesn't really align with the day to day job. Not every company asks them. Most of the higher paying ones do though.\n\nPersonally I'd advise against mindless grinding unless it's a company that kind of expects that (e.g. one that rhymes with feta). Go through a categorized list of problems, try to figure out any gaps you might have and study those concepts. Then come back and build a muscle memory for that type of problem.\n\nOr... you can just keep going until you find a company that doesn't ask them.\n\n>During that time I would say about half was hands on engineering (coding, submitting or reviewing PRs) and half on architecture/leadership.\n\n\n\n> There are many factors here--I am self taught--and I discovered have more test anxiety than I realized. Also, these \"problems\" are often just little puzzles that I've rarely if ever seen in my 25 years of software engineering, so I am simply rusty at solving them in the allotted time. My problem solving may also follow a non-traditional sequence that the interviewer is simply not used to seeing (like, incorrect \"order of operations\" even though I solve the problem).\n\nIt's easy to have a gap between what you're capable of doing and what you're capable of showing others you can do in an interview. You pretty much need a muscle memory for coding (and realistically specifically for these type of problems) to show your chops in a 30-60 min interview. You likely need to build that up even if you could probably solve the exact same problem without the time pressure. 5 min reading through docs to refresh your memory on how the python heapq module works is 5 min you might need in the end.\n\nI get interview anxiety too and I almost always bomb the first 2-3 interviews during a job search regardless of preparation. For me at least, there's no replacement for exposure therapy :). However you can do mock interviews with friends or time yourself on a random problem, etc. Most of them aren't really puzzles or tricks, just bite-sized applications of common data structures/algos. 95% of which are from a single semester in a CS degree. Some are indeed basically tricks or techniques to memorize and apply",

It took my heart and soul just to get any kind of offer, and I am so ready to get back to trying to turn my life around.\n\nI wasn't FAANG material, but I worked pretty hard. I graduated w/ a Master's in CS + 2 years intern + 1 year full time -> had a big name F500 100k TC full-stack job lined up before I even finished school.\n\nThat F500 was amazing, but 1.5 year in I got mass laid off. It took me 3 months to find my next job.\n\nMy next job was awesome too (for the most part, 1/4 of it was a tough crunch period), I got in at 105k fully remote security clearance in the same stack. I felt like I was really starting to get the hang of things.\n\nHowever, 1 year into *that* job, I got mass laid off again. Unlucky!\n\nThen I began my descent into the hellish reality of me trying to get a job in 2025. I actually had no issues getting interviews. I have a very strong resume, I was able to secure a couple referrals from my network. I was also pretty resourceful / lucky at just cold dm'ing or trying to be the first 20 people to apply to a job.\n\nMy problem was, I am/was just not that good at interviewing! I was completely caught off guard how awful this last 6-7 months would be. At first, I was like it's just rust and we'll get other chances. I went on to fail A LOT of interviews.\n\nI actually have had 21 different positions that have made it to technical rounds. Of those 21, I got 2 offers and 3 are in progress (plus a 22nd chance round 2 this week for a remote job!)\n\nIt's been absolutely miserable. Some jobs were actually laterals or upgrades in pay / situation, some even remote. Most of these jobs though are pretty sizeable paycuts + bad commutes and I wasn't good enough for them.\n\nI still have a few interviews / leads building up so I'll keep taking them until I actually start my new job, but man I can't wait for this to be over. I'm going to work hard at my new job and establish the workload. If it ends up being chill, I'm going to just go right back to studying for interviews on the job whenever I can and keep fighting until I can get a big salary and/or remote again.\n\nI wish anyone on the journey best of luck and to keep believing in your hard work. I still dont 100% trust I'm actually going to have a job in a few weeks, I've been in survival mode for so long..\n\nFor what it's worth.. I got some pretty crazy feedback at some of these jobs. I got told for a few positions that the people I was competing with had 5+ years experience. Can't confirm that for all of them, but I legit have made it as a top 2 finalist twice and didn't get it. Competition is just insane out there right now.",

The online noise didn't match what was actually happening in the market.\n\nHere's what I'd focus on instead of endlessly tweaking resumes. Pick one solid project and make it really impressive. Not just another todo app, but something that solves a real problem you care about. Then write about your process, document your learning, show your thinking. Employers care way more about how you approach problems than your school ranking.\n\nAlso, you mentioned 3 internships, that's actually solid experience. Maybe the issue isn't your background but where you're applying? Sometimes casting a wider net geographically or looking at companies that aren't the typical FAANG targets can open up opportunities.\n\nThe market is tough right now, no sugarcoating that. But good developers are still getting hired every day. Keep building, keep applying, and try to spend less time in forums that make everything seem impossible :)",

Point at any 2 random SWE's, and I'd bet the work culture, type of work, pay, expectations, etc are all completely different.\n\nMy first job was nothing like my 2nd. My 2nd was nothing like my 3rd. My 3rd was nothing like my 4th.\n\nSure I'm \"coding\" at all of them, but there's so much variety. Even the way coding is done, the processes in place, the pace at which we work, the pace at which decisions are made, how involved management is, etc, etc, etc all vary.\n\nFor example, every thing you describe as what's made you miserable is absolutely not inherent of being a SWE. Most jobs don't require you to learn brand new tech stacks. I did that at 1 company, but my other 3 I used a single tech stack from start to finish. I've *never* had a \"lack of work\" at any company I've been at. We always have a very long backlog of work that needs to be done. Even when I was 100% onsite I wouldn't describe that as \"spending every waking moment at the office\".... I was there 8 hours a day or less, usually with a 1-2 hour lunch in the middle which I didn't make up for. Getting a hybrid job after that made life even better, it was 1 day a week WFH and it was amazing. That job also had a great culture so I frequently came in late/dipped early and nobody cared.\n\nSo take a long hard think about things, is what you hate actually inherent of this career? Or is what you hate actually a trait of your company/work environment.\n\nIf the industry isn't for you, that's fine. I just want to make sure you aren't making a major career decision based on a *single* experience at a *single* company when there's so much variety out there.",

That's why we first saw the engineers get cut. The dev owners and leaders get more face time and essentially blamed the engineers. Then after that didn't fix anything the started cutting middle management who told them it was the engineers fault. \n\nNow they don't know why to do so they're bringing in consulting forms and offshoring work to fill in the gaps. From what I can tell these consulting firms as really leaning on the specialized/clear cut responsibilities by telling the businesses it's impossible to higher one expert who can respond to a wide variety of issues and software in today's specialized tool environment in a timely manner. The way to fix that is using consulting firms to bring in say an architect for a month, then bring in a cloud designer for a few months, once the architecture is setup bring in the engineers. Meanwhile now you're no longer paying an architect salary after the main chunk of work is done. \n\nI actually tend to agree with it but it's going to suck for us all around people",

It is a skill and it takes practice. It's like meditation. \n\nWhen you catch yourself doing a work thought you need to intentionally and consciously think about something else.

You need to stop thinking about work in order to recover from work.\n\n\nOnce youve already crossed over into being burned out, it may take some time (weeks or months depending on how bad the burnout is) for better boundaries to start making you feel better. But in my experience it does eventually happen. Just remember for the future that you need to be vigilant about the signs that you're working too much. It's something we do to get ahead and it can be good but if you want to be at your best you have to compromise with what is possible. Don't ignore your warning signs.

Unfortunately sometimes PMs get overzealous with assigning work and you need to push back during planning if you think it's too much.",

        "body": "I love programming, but I find that getting quick feedback really helps me stay focused even on long term projects. I mostly do C++ and usually work pretty close to the iron. Each class I'm working on right now, I know approximately what it needs to do in my grand scheme of things, and usually write unit tests as I go. Usually at any point in my project I can either build my code and run the tests to verify that everything I've built so far builds and works as expected or I'm within an hour or two of being able to do so. There is no \"I'm going to work 3 months on this before I know anything about whether or not it works.\"\n\n\nThe projects you see in CS are not really the projects you'll see out in the industry. They've probably already told you that most software projects are maintenance. You'll very rarely ever see new design, just because on average most projects' lifecycle is 80-90% maintenance. The skill of reading someone else's code and understanding what they're trying to accomplish is not really something I picked up in CS. I had to learn that as I go. I'm not saying wait and see what industry jobs are like if you don't like CS, I'm just saying don't expect anything you do to look very much like anything you've been doing.\n\n\nThey may also have told you that programming languages are as much for communicating with engineers as it is with computers. They didn't go into a great deal of detail about that when I was in school, but a decade after I got out of school a computer program was like a book for me. I can read it and I can tell you things about  what the guy who wrote it was thinking. Probably things not even he was really aware of. Comes in handy, and it kind of feels like a superpower when you get good at it. Not saying you should do anything in particular except keep that in mind if you make a career out of this.\n\n\nIf you enjoy doing this for a living, there is never an end state. It's impossible to know everything that there is to know about computers at the moment, and has been since the '80's. There's a lot of arrogance in the field because a lot of people seem to think that they do know everything there is to know, but it's far more important to have a pretty solid idea about what you don't know. At least as it pertains to what you're doing right now. The landscape is pretty much infinite here, and far more similar to the math landscape than I realized up until surprisingly recently. You probably can find something to explore there that's interesting to you. How easy that is or whether you even want to try is of course entirely up to you.\n\n\nWhatever you decide to do, *you* ultimately set the direction in your career. This is as true now in your academic career as it is in your professional one. You can decide to stay in academia somewhere and explore the frontiers or old problems there. You can go off to the industry and solve math problems for stabilizing fusion reactors or something. You can go grind out enterprise communication code at some company and probably make a lot of money. Long's as you have the rent by Friday it doesn't really matter all that much. But you decide what you're going to do with your life, or you can try to float through it without much of a plan at all. I think a lot of people try to do that. From what I've seen, that path leads to regret sooner or later. Maybe all paths do, but if I end up regretting anything at least I was the one who decided to go that way.\n\n\nHope you find a direction you like. Good luck!",

But then I could pick them up in a week once a real life problem presented itself.\n\nSo, maybe join an existing project that you could be passionate about, look at the bug reports, fix some issues. Find some feature requests and implement them. Here are some benefits of this approach that I see:\n\n\\* You will be solving real life problems, which is fulfilling\n\n\\* You will learn structure and processes\n\n\\* You will learn to debug an unfamiliar product and read someone else's code, which are precious skills\n\n\\* Most open source maintainers are the \"my way or the highway\" bitchy folks, but navigating the process teaches you social and negotiations skills. It also keeps your ego in check, that is a must in a real world.\n\n\\* You resume will then shine: \"I have solved this and that and got very positive feedback from real users\", \"this improvement I made is now running on thousands of devices\", \"I have become an official contributor or a maintainer for projects X, Y, and Z\",  and so on\n\n\\* Become a \"problem solver\" instead of a coder\n\n\\* A list of real-life problems that you solved or improvements that you made will make your resume stand out\n\n\\* A real-life pay check will come naturally soon after",

The coding rounds are definitely the wildcard here. If you do decide to withdraw, be upfront with your recruiter about needing more time to prepare rather than making excuses. Most recruiters appreciate honesty and might be more flexible about future timing. You could also try reaching out to coaches on platforms like prepfully who've been through Meta interviews recently to get a realistic assessment of your readiness in a mock setting.\n\nEither way, don't beat yourself up about it - better to interview when you're genuinely ready than to rush it and potentially hurt your chances for months.",

Meta's cooldown period is real and can stretch 6-12 months, which means you're potentially locking yourself out of opportunities during what could be a crucial time in your career. Even if you're not fully prepared, you have some solid foundations - your system design knowledge is valuable, and behavioral questions are definitely manageable with focused prep over the weekend. The coding rounds are the wild card, but you already passed their initial screen, which means you're not starting from zero.\n\nThe reality is that most people don't feel 100% ready for these big tech interviews, and there's something to be said for getting the experience even if you don't nail it. You might surprise yourself with what you can pull off under pressure, and worst case scenario, you get valuable interview experience and feedback that will help you crush it next time. Plus, if you're already questioning whether you'd be happy at Meta, going through the process might give you clarity on that front too. I actually work on [AI interview assistant](http://interviews.chat), and we built it specifically for situations like this where you need to navigate those tricky behavioral questions and coding discussions in real-time during your interview.",

That is a way to make the WFH day worse than an office day.\n* Wake up at the same time as you would going to the office. It's tempting to wake up at like 9 AM. Don't.\n* Hooray! You have just freed up a block of time you can use to do whatever you want instead of walking to the office and sitting in a bus. I usually use it to start my morning slow. I wake up, go take a shower, put on fresh clothes, go prepare a real breakfast, and then eventually get to work. No rush. I am trying to wake up a little easier and actually fit more into this. Like, if I am able to get up earlier than usual on the WFH days, I could probably get the right temperature for a quick run and bike ride before the usual routine.\n* I have time flexibility. If I wake up early and I don't feel like doing the full morning routine, I just do a minimal one, get to work early, and call it a day early. The only requirement we have for WFH days is that there are two small blocks of time (1-2 hours each) where you **must** be available to answer a call. As long as you are available to answer a call during those two blocks, nobody really cares how you organize your time.\n* Set boundaries with extreme precision. It's very easy both to overwork yourself and work through your lunch break, and do the opposite - just go do something else and take an extra long break that ends up biting you. I try to use timers and alarms.\n* If possible, I try to get out of the house right after work. Quick walk, going to some event or gathering with friends, run some errands, etc. I find it's beneficial if you \"simulate\" the same separation rituals you get from an office day, except they are not time completely thrown into the garbage, but time slots for things that are good for you, or tasks that you should make anyway.\n\nExtra goated golden bonus tip:\n\n* If I want to take a break, instead of just going to get a coffee and use my phone or talk to people a bit as I'd do in the office, I do a quick errands break. Like, I do a part of an house chore I need to make. Load up and unload the dishwasher, clean the kitchen, something like that. This has two benefits: 1) it keeps you active and away from your screen, which is the best way to get a break. 2), when done consistently, it frees up a surprising amount of free time. So, after you work, you have to do less errands and you have more **really** free time",

Its kind of like when you sell something on facebook marketplace and your asking for cash but someone offers a trade but then says \"what do you want\"...i don't know, i wasnt considering a trade how about you offer up what you've got available for trade rather than me just replying i'd trade for world peace.\n\nExample, Are they a crisis management center handling assistance for the community and managing it through a spreadsheet that they share among case workers?\n\nAre they having to track their hours and theres 10 people that email one manager their time sheets and the manager has to rekey all that information into another spreadsheet?\n\nStuff like that is what you have to look for in order to know \"i can do XYZ to make your life easier\". If you just say \"hey, im a developer and would like to volunteer with you\" your going to get blank stares because people either won't care or they don't know what they could use you for.\n\nAlso, don't just limit yourself to non-profits. Look around in your area,  maybe you've got a mom and pop trash guy in the area who runs a trash route with little to no tech usage, see if you can build him a notification service so he can let out schedule changes to his customer base.\n\nMaybe you've got a neighbor who runs an etsy shop but has no way of managing their inventory.\n\nPoint is, get creative, think about whats around you and see if you can fill any gaps, don't just offer your services...offer a solution.\n\nThis is the route i did back in the day and I was always asked why I didn't just get \"a job\" or was told to \"just go get a job\" either related or unrelated and my view was at the time, i could either get experience or i could get money but at that point in time with how the market was i couldn't get both and only experience was what would lead to a career.\n\nBeen at it 14 years now. If this career is something you want to do, just stick with it, stay hungry, find ways to provide value to people...don't just offer \"software development services\"....figure out a way in your area to offer solutions.",

That's not how it works.\n\nA network is made up of your genuine friends, family, and colleagues.\n\nWhen you define what a network actually is like that, it points out why \"networking\" is a silly term that doesn't need to exist. Networking is very simply *making friends*. Forming genuine relationships with people.\n\nIt's not forming fake relationships where the sole purpose you're speaking is to use them to get you a job.\n\nTech meetups are common suggestions for \"networking\", but that's not because it's a place people go to connect on LinkedIn. It's because it's a place where people that all have a shared interest go to do that shared interest together. When you do that, you *make friends* with those people. When they're your friends, they're now in your network.\n\nYou could go to a rock climbing meetup and it would have the exact same effect. You could go to your local dive bar and make friends with John Doe over a night of heavy drinking. It doesn't matter if John Doe is in tech or not, all that matters is that John Doe *has a job*. Anyone at a company can refer people to any position. Even if John's in sales, his company is likely hiring SWE's, and he'll be happy to refer a *genuine friend*.\n\nIt's not something that really happens overnight, forming a network takes time.

At Metana, we've definitely seen this progression, people who get comfortable with their first language but then hit a wall when it comes to designing scalable systems.\n\nThe thing is, you don't need to go back to school for a full degree. You just need the right fundamentals,  algorithms, data structures, distributed systems concepts, and database design. Most of the 'scary math' conversations are honestly just people showing off half the time.\n\nAlso worth considering, maybe look into some of the more intensive programs that bridge this gap? There are options between bootcamps and full degrees that focus specifically on systems and architecture for working developers. Way more practical than starting from scratch with calculus and discrete math.\n\nYou've got 5 years of experience and domain knowledge, that's actually pretty valuable.

There are various sorts of \"systems design interview prep\" resources you can look into, and that might help you participate in the conversations you run into.\n\nLike many things in this field though, that all barely scratches the surface and there's a lot to learn by just being in the trenches. It's probably also advisable that you take more notes and ask more questions during these conversations.",

You just get fired. At the same time, there aren't a ton of rules and processes for things like filing expense reports or even planning work. It's not the kind of places where some PM is micro managing a team's tickets using some planning process pushed by consultants. Get your shit done, deliver results.",

The values are written out in a public memo and there’s an internal version with plenty of extra context, and the yearly 360 cycle plus management training emphasize them constantly so there’s no way to be ignorant of them. This team member was given a 3 strike policy by the manager to improve and he clearly kept failing (I personally witnessed 1 of these strikes happen in a small meeting) so he was exited. \n\nManagers are trained to be very clear about expectations and you are given a chance to improve if you don’t meet them. And it’s supposed to be a regular conversation, not just a quarterly or annual thing.\n\nHonestly the sanest and most transparent and fairest process I’ve experienced in my 16 yoe. But as always things are team/manager dependent.\n\nAs for workload, depends on team but my personal experience has been 80% 20-30 hours per week, 15% 30-40 hours, 5% 40+",

Direct company career pages - boring but effective, especially for mid-size companies that aren't drowning in applications yet\n\n3. Networking/referrals - I know everyone says this but it's still the fastest path through the noise\n\nLinkedIn and Indeed are honestly black holes right now. You're competing with thousands of other people hitting \"easy apply\" on the same roles. The companies I work with get so many applications through those channels that they barely look at them unless you have some serious keywords or connections.\n\nHave you tried reaching out to recruiters who specialize in your tech stack? Not the spray-and-pray types, but ones who actually understand the technical side. We tend to have roles that aren't posted publicly yet.\n\nWhat's your tech stack btw? That might change the strategy a bit.\n\nAre you just applying to big companies or also interested in startups?\n\nGood luck!",

That time you spent hours debugging a segmentation fault, or when you had to figure out why your algorithm was timing out on edge cases, or even when you struggled to understand a complex concept and had to try multiple approaches before it clicked - these are all valid technical challenges that demonstrate problem-solving skills.\n\nThe key is to structure your answer around the process rather than the complexity of the problem itself. Pick something where you can clearly explain what went wrong, what steps you took to diagnose and solve it, what you learned, and how it made you a better developer. Maybe it was implementing a data structure from scratch, debugging a tricky race condition in a multithreaded program, or optimizing a slow database query.

It varies by company. But in the end there should be an onboarding of how to build, test, etc.\n\nBefore any of that, your first day will likely be signing up for benefits (insurances), payroll, etc. This shoudl be the absolute first thing you do so you get your money in the bank and not through a check mailed to you.\n\nGet your W-4 completed (takes like 5 minutes tops). Im not a financial adviser in any way but if you get RSUs, i'd suggest having them take a certain amount extra per check to account for the RSUs when you start to get them. I got burned by this the fist time I got RSUs. Because tehy are considered bonus they are taxed differently so I ended up owing a good amount to the IRS my first year. Ideally I try to have them take 100 per check to account for that.\n\nSign up for any 401k accounts too. Your future self will thank you later. Put as much as you think is fair, experts suggest 12-15% a year.\n\nAs for the job. Your first week is usually onboarding and then you get small tasks and build up confidence in the code. Ask your manager when he expects you to start getting bigger tasks. If he/she says in 3 months, try to get ahead of everything. If they say that the first week they only expect you to run tests and build, try to get that doen within the first few days and then by thursday tell them you are done and if you can at least look at the first task to get an idea of where to start.\n\nAsk questions, dont be afraid to reach out to people. it's scary at first but passive devs are the ones that get booted. If you start doing it before your manager has to say it, your manager will thank you. Managers have so much on their plate so they love devs who they dont ahve to say anything to, they just trust the dev will always be ahead of the pack. So if your manager is hoping to get you a task after 3 months, try to be ready at the 2nd month. Better to have him tell you to slow down then having to tell you to hurry up.\n\n  \nEdit: also just to add. To emphasive the dont be a passive dev, report what you do. You have to play a game to a certain level. I once had a seniro dev tell me that it is better to do 2 tasks and report it during stand up and create dialogue about it (take ove rthe screen and show results for example, ask questions about being stuck, etc) than it is to do 10 tasks and just make simple 1 comment about progress that doesnt create discussion. Being stuck on the same task that should've taken a few days, but you are just stuck for weeks and dont say anything in stand up is a huge turnoff. \n\nAlso find a mentor or senior friend you can do work with at a certain point. Someone who will hype you up to the manager and you can work along side with. At a certain point if you can be the guy who gets name-called during stand up, that's a plus. Even in meetings wher eyou are not there. Im talking about when someone has a report and they say \"OP helped me get past this issue\" or \"OP made an interesting observation\" at a certain point someone is going to say \"wow OP is making good contributions\" and someone might be like \"who is this OP everybody is talking about\".",

There's two competing views of automation: the first, is that it causes layoffs and lower employment, which is the luddite view. The second, is that innovation from simpler tasks frees us to do the more complicated tasks. 1000 years ago 95% of us were farmers: iron, then steel, and coal freed us from a life on the farm and let us build cities.  Change is never comfortable, but historically it's been an economic good.\n\n>  \nWith software being shipped at light speed, and a single software being usable by billions of users around the world, i'm wondering if we will not hit a ceiling ?\n\nNo one really knows, but we haven't hit the ceiling yet. The CS field is boom or bust, but there are still market dynamics. Eventually, the surplus of trained and experienced devs will leave the market through attrition or promotion, and it will be much healthier for grads.

        "body": "Part of this is that the demand side of software appears almost limitless. There are physical limitations to how much food any one person needs, so it's easy to see how we don't need too many farmers. You can make the same case about doctors or lawyers or accountants or architects. Their demand scales with the number of people on the planet: Demand ~ Population\n\nHowever, software is fundamentally different. There's always a new idea around the corner, some service that could be digitized, some new feature to be added, some code to be optimized. The amount of software scales both with the number of people *and* the amount of digital services each person is willing to adopt: Demand ~ Population x Digitalization.\n\nFurthermore, there's an idea that digitalization actually enables such a boost in efficiency that it's still a beneficial allocation of resources. For example, suppose you're playing Economy Manager 2025 and you have to decide what to do with 10 college grads with the goal of completing auditing companies. One way is to train all 10 to be accountants. However, if you were to train 1 software engineer, that one SWE could develop tooling to boost efficiency so that even if you have 1 fewer accountant, the remaining 9 accountants could double their speed.\n\nThis is why many people view the demand side of software to be much more flexible than traditional occupations like medicine or law. However, even if the demand for software is more flexible, there is indeed a limit. Software doesn't defy the laws of supply and demand, and yes, more supply is inevitable going to cause salaries to drop and hiring to slow.",

But the “next big thing” has traditionally come out of down markets. \n\nAlso, there is something to be said about communication and culture fit. It’s generally easier to work with someone face-to-face who speaks the same language as you and is from a similar culture. Yes, there are exceptions to this, and sometimes people decide saving money on compensation is worth any difficulty in communication. There are a lot of subjective factors at play. \n\nWe’re at a period of time where there is more demand than supply.

Let's be honest, most of us have days even weeks where we arent our most proactive especially in this career. Some jobs care more than others but when it comes to light it doesnt look great, so i'd say maybe spend the next few weeks/months being the most proactive you could be so that one week is your only small ding. \n\nManagers udnerstand nobody is perfect and if that's your one ding then they wont hold it against you, if you try to do a better job im sure theyll see that and maybe not even put it in your next review or hold it against you.\n\nJust be honest.\n\nIf you dont mind me asking, while you were waiting on it, what did you do that week?\n\nTwiddling fingers is a big thing that happens in this career because a lot of time there is so much downtime and waiting that it's hard to not do it sometimes. Managers know it happens and try to combat that which is why they like when employees try to make up the time doing other things. So maybe if this happens again, bring it up to the manager like \"hey her transfer is taking longer than expected. Any other options I can do to get mine's done if not, what work can I pick up?\"",

But if you let it add up, it would exponentially be slower and slower. \n\nOne time we had to transfer some major data coming in from an even higher network that was barely used but people started to use it more as the project was winding down. We realized that the higher network just was never updated so we had to routinely update it with huge transfers. I put the CD in, it took me half days work to do it. Thankfully one of the Product owners ntocied in the first week it was taking me forever so he told me he had a secure hard drive that I could use whenever I needed to transfer huge data and it cut my time down by so much.\n\n  \nAgain take it as a learning lesson.

If you have a PhD in Physics, you don't want to apply for jobs that are going to emphasize things you cannot bring to the table. So you don't want to apply for jobs where they're going to be looking for you to be a shallow generalist or a specialist in something you don't do.\n\nThis is the trap people fall into - they see 500 jobs that they could technically do and apply to all of them.\n\nInstead, you want to focus on applying to the jobs where not only can someone with your background be successful, but really where almost only people with your type of background can be successful. \n\nGenerally speaking, that is going to be companies working on solving things that aren't fully solved. Some people will call this R&D or research or innovation, but at its core you want to look for things that are not just standard, off-the-shelf solutions.\n\nWhat you want to avoid is generic \"entry level data scientist for Fortune 500 company training ML models\".\n\nNow, what can you do to enhance your resume:\n\n1. Make sure you cram Python hard. C++, C#, Java are all good too, and there might be some niche industries where other languages are relevant, but if you're blindly going to pick one, it needs to be Python, and you want to be able to show up as a very strong Python coder. \n\n2. Make sure you cram SQL. It's not as critical as it once was, but you still need to make sure you are fairly competent with SQL: select, group by, inner/left/full/right joins, partition by/window functions, nested queries, and CTEs.\n\n3. Assuming you're looking into AI/ML: make sure you learn about/brush up on as many of the basics of ML: regression, classification, clustering, A/B testing, NLP. \n\n4. If you want to go for maximum marketability and you have the time/ability to do so: either a) dive into some of the \"under the hood\" LLM stuff, or b) learn how to build LLM-powered applications. There's no easier path to getting a high paying job right now than being able to contribute to LLM stuff. And realistically, it's a new enough field that there should be plenty of room for someone with a Physics PhD to find an area within it where you can get yourself up to speed and be dangerous.",

Positions such as senoir data science frequently have hiring managers or recruiters who only look for experience in industry in the exact right platforms and tools and dont consider anything in terms of applicable skill.\n\nSomeone with a PhD isn't normally going to go straight to a Senior role unless their research experience is directly relevant to a specific industry.\n\nIf I were you, I wouldn't be looking for Senior roles - I would be looking for entry level roles in highly competitive industries. Like, a Senior Data Scientist at some middle tier tech company is probably making less money than an entry level data scientist at a hedge fund, top tier tech company, cutting edge startup with lots of money, etc.\n\nSo again, don't think \"well, I'm smart enough to be able to do something as well as a more senior data scientist who *doesnt'* have a PhD\", because not only is that not right (experience in industry matters), but also hiring managers won't agree with you.\n\nInstead, I would look for jobs where you can say \"typical entry-level data scientist with a BS in CS could not handle this\", and those are the jobs you want to apply for. I think startups would also be a good place for someone like you vs. mega dino tech companies (and I say this as someone who works in a mega dino tech company).\n\n>Also, to be sure, what does llm powered application mean ?

You're not actually making contributions to the underlying LLM model, you're making a piece of software that uses an existing model. There is a spectrum too - there's stuff like RAG systems where you're not retraining the model per se, but you're adapting the model for your own application with your own data.",

First, C is still very powerful/important so I would write as much C and as little ADA as possible. Rust still has a ways to go to be an industry staple so you're not missing out. C++ is a superset of C so whatever you learn in C will help you learn C++ on the side.\n\nI'm starting a new job in embedded ML using Python/C++/CUDA, I would suggest learning that stack on the side to make yourself more employable for your next role. Good luck!",

It may result in errors leaving a bad impression. You're entering a level of complexity you probably haven't seen before.

You can leave whenever you want. At a paid role leaving without notice comes off as rude, but that's about it; at an unpaid role, talking about notice is absurd.
