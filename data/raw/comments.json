The new tools built in rust, and with interoperability in mind via open formats - both storage with parquet+deltalake/iceberg and in memory with arrow - that work natively in-process with python bindings and even out-of-process, are going to be much easier to work.\n\nI've been plugging away at using daft, which can run in-process with python, or out of process on a single machine, or across a ray cluster. You can take the same code and run it in something super lightweight and then scale it out to a huge cluster. No need to change processing engines.\n\nI can see more being built around duckdb for the same purpose.\n\nI've seen someone benchmark running daft distributed within a databricks cluster and it being *faster*. That is you start up a Databricks cluster, install daft and ray, and you get better performance than the spark instances you're running alongside. At that point Databricks is just a glorified cluster manager and notebook provider.\n\nSpark is just too cumbersome and too awkard to deal with. It isn't suitable for small use-cases, and in very large ones it can be arcane to figure out what is going on. People just can't develop skills with it until they are working at a huge scale, so they get chucked in the deep end with issues.\n\nThese new tools will let people get experience on their own machine, it will let DS and DA roles grapple with things directly, and let everyone get essentially the same experience when they work at scale.",

Python-first, with native wheels that don’t require external dependencies\n\n2. Works on ANY scale — effective both for a 60MB CSV as well as 100TB of Parquet/Iceberg. This means having best-in-class local as well as distributed engines\n\n3. Works on ANY modality — data today is more than just JOINs and GROUPBYs. The reality is that data is messy and unstructured!! Sometimes my UDF fails but I don’t want it to kill my entire job…\n\nWe’re trying to be more public with our roadmap and stuff too so please let us know if there is interest. For instance, we will be working to reduce reliance on Ray as a hard dependency soon and enable raw Kubernetes deployments (which seems to be a common ask), and we have a Dashboard in the works (we call this Spark UI++). \n\nAppreciate the support here ❤️keep plumbing away r/dataengineering the daft team will be here to make things with less oom and more zoom.",

You can process arbitrarily large datasets using a standard declarative  syntax and not have to worry about running out of memory. DuckDB works well for single user / single node otherwise there is a plethora of other databases available if you need distributed processing or to share amongst multiple users.\n\nSpark is overkill for most situations and even for the situations it isn't overkill for you still have to question whether you actually want to deal with it. Its slow and bloated like anything JVM based. I also find it ironic that Databricks is investing a large chunk of energy turning Spark into a SQL engine because it turns out the vast majority of data processing can be described in terms of SQL.",

They made me do a proctored written test (weird for director level) having MCQs and also questions about designing end to end architectures for 4 use cases and few weird questions (asked to write spark configuration and write IAM policy in json) . \n\nI passed that round and in the partner round , expecting more questions on broader aspects I got rejected for not knowing the correct syntax. eg- mounting cloud object storage on databricks ( I said dbutils.mount instead of dbutils.fs.mount) . Turns out the partner does all of these stuff day in and day out and expects the same from director . So for them  the director works as an IC building pipelines and there would be no scope of preparing data strategy and governance and stakeholder management until the team is built . So in short , the “director” role expectation depends on the team that is hiring .",

It's genuinely good to see someone mapping out what they've learned with this much clarity, especially the enthusiasm for the core DE work – debugging, building, improving infrastructure. You've definitely hit on some crucial points that many take years to internalize.\n\nThings like focusing on pipeline resilience, code quality, and the importance of documentation are spot on. That’s the stuff that separates okay pipelines from robust, maintainable systems. The emphasis on CI/CD, templates, and understanding SQL fundamentals alongside frameworks like Spark/Pandas shows you're building a really well-rounded technical base. Keep that momentum going – the learning curve is steep, but you're clearly navigating it well.\n\nJust a couple of thoughts to add from experience:\n\n- You're right that physical presence can boost visibility and make ad-hoc collaboration easier, especially in certain environments or client-facing roles. However, it's worth developing the skills to achieve similar communication effectiveness and relationship building remotely. Mastering clear documentation (which you already value!), proactive updates, and strong asynchronous communication is vital, as many teams are distributed or hybrid. The core skill is effective collaboration, whatever the medium - so don't view remote work as inherently having fewer opportunities; it just requires different strengths.\n\n- Regarding DRY and OOP, I have no doubt they are good principles. Just remember the other side: sometimes abstracting too early or creating overly complex OOP structures can hurt readability more than duplicated code, especially for simpler tasks. Finding that balance between avoiding repetition and maintaining simplicity/clarity comes with practice. You're right to question when not to use OOP though!\n\n- You've got the right idea with watermarks and parameterization for the pipeline self-healing process. Also think about idempotency – ensuring your tasks can run multiple times with the same input and produce the same outcome. It’s key for reliable reruns and recovery. And as you mature your pipelines, layer in dedicated data quality testing on top of unit/integration tests.\n\n- Definitely keep that volunteering spirit intact to improve things. Just learn to balance it strategically cuz it's easy to get pulled into fixing everything legacy, so make sure those efforts align with broader team goals and don't consistently derail your primary project responsibilities.\n\n- This is more of a personal ick, but I generally don't emphasize too much on documenting the finer details of a codebase, since things change and us devs can spend more time documenting things instead of focusing on what matters to our stakeholders.\n\nOverall, your reflections show a great attitude and a solid understanding of what makes a good DE. You're focusing on the right areas – technical depth, process improvement, and collaboration. Keep learning, stay curious, and continue refining that craft. You're well on your way :)",

Honestly, DE is so backend, I would generally rather business users not come to me directly. \nAnd my experience with pre commit and linter has largely been negative. \n\nDocumention is always extremely valuable. Consistent naming conventions and packages is critical. Our consultants did neither and it is a shit show. \n\nOOP can be helpful in some regards, but I'm with you that FP is more than sufficient for the bulk of jobs. OOP overcomplicates, makes debugging more difficult and time consuming, and is rather rigid. It's worth it if it is scalable, but if it takes the same level of effort to cram all the SQL and configs into an OOP approach as just coding it from scratch in FP, you might as well use FP. \n\nI'm coming up on my 1 year as well. My biggest lessons have been think in terms of frameworks (how can you organize your code, how can you automate or parameterize development, etc.), that you simply can't learn everything and delegation is critical, knowledge of the business data is extremely important, that InfoSec is a PITA, and think through things before implementing anything (nothing is ever as simple as it first seems).",

Redshift is a very black box that throws unexpected errors and is very difficulty to introspect.\n\nOne of the more frustrating things it does is it can sometimes pick a query execution path that it doesn’t support depending on the tables you’re hitting. Exact same query, exact same table structure will error from one execution to the next.\n\nIt doesn’t support all of SQL and I don’t mean the syntax, I mean that certain sub queries and joins will sometimes not be supported.\n\nWhen it encounters an error it shows up as a stack trace to an internal C file that you don’t have access to.\n\nIt’s also sometimes wildly inconsistent where the compute nodes and the main node have different behaviour. You need to internalise what will run where to be able to keep track.\n\nIt’s a pain in the ass to optimise things because makes it hard to turn off caching and other optimisation to be able to measure execution impact of iterating on your queries, it rewrites queries into multiple queries and makes it a pain to track down how things are getting decomposed.\n\nRedshifts feature development is very slow, and it has surface level support for things like JSON. I wish we had gone with something like ClickHouse where you have some hope of seeing long standing issues and features gaps get resolved over time.\n\nIt’s also quite complex in terms of managing it, if you adopt it and actually use it you’re gonna be spending a lot of time learning things that are only relevant for redshift which is a huge time sink. One of the major selling points of redshift is the price, but when you need to spend money on salary to manage redshift that calculation may not work out in redshift favour.",

The comparison isn't equivalent. Redshift in combination with other analytics services such as Athena gives better results. It is the complete AWS analytics stack which needs to be compared with snowflake and databricks, not Redshift alone. Recently AWS have begun to address this with the new Sagemaker Studio.\n\nA huge chunks of the complaints fall in this category - UX, and features which are outside of Redshift but possible with other very well integrated services. \n\nOn the other hand it is true that Redshift tuning needs higher skill and detailed knowledge. A lot of people don't understand what MPP is. Or how database internals work. However if uses correctly you end up running a cheaper and more efficient system.\n\nPersonally I haven't seen any \"random errors\" - I've generally been haply with Redshift.\n\nAfter a long time looking at such discussions I've concluded that it's usually a problem of engineers not making an effort to understand their tools properly. You can run any platform - AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, BQ. Each has its pros and cons.\n\nGood engineers will figure it out, bad ones will complain. Maybe I'm just cynical.\n\nI know people who are happy with AWS, happy with snowflake, happy with Databricks, and also others pissed off with all of them - several migrating in between different stacks.\n\nThe biggest sell of snowflake is that it is an easy environment to work in, but more expensive - what you save on salaries you may spend on snowflake.

Also questions on what technologies they are using for current end state so you don't just drop your own tech stack if they have one already and adapt to that.

That’s a good point — orchestration probably would’ve helped tie everything together, especially for verifying successful transfers and setting up retries or backfills. I did ask them where this data would eventually live. They told me assume it was a database then I asked about a dashboard where I mentioned where the schema normalization would be important to make sure that on the front end you could identify specific filters to show the user (like drop downs). \n\nAlso, your point about aligning with their existing tech stack is spot on. I think I got a little too caught up in the idea of feeding everything into an LLM pipeline with vectorization + embeddings. Probably came off like I was optimizing for a use case they didn’t even confirm.\n\nIn hindsight, I should’ve slowed down and clarified whether they needed real-time ingestion, what the downstream usage was (e.g., dashboarding vs search vs ML), and whether historical backfill was in scope. I was so nervous lol 😅. Thank you for your answer",

For example, all source databases should dictate anything that contains currencies and prices in float(8,2). That way, you don't feel frustrated that two columns that are topically similar (e.g. transaction fees or sales subtotal) can be calculated without some weird-ass errors due to data type mismatch.\n\nThat's just **one** type of governance.

That said, it’s not flashy, and it’s rarely a direct path to monetization unless you’re working in a highly regulated industry. In most cases its something I think you layer on top of your existing data skills to increase your value in the market, whether you're a data engineer, analyst, team lead, or CDO. But generally once you step into a management role, governance quickly becomes central. At that level, almost every decision touches on it in some way. And I definitely see its importance growing on a broader scale, albeit from a different than traditional point of view that there are generally much more CDO's and data leaders out there who require and need those skills or that organizations are failing in mode modern projects like AI or digital twins and learn the hard way the requirement of governance.  So I guess overall its just more streamlined and integrated into broader management, data transformation, and change management efforts.\n\nTo answer your question directly. Is data governance essential to land a job? I don't think so, unless you're lucky or in a specific industry. But can it significantly increase your value in a data related career? Absolutely, especially if you're entering the management area.",

Your goal is to catch changes early.   \n3. SaaS APIs and finance sheets will always change so treat them like untrusted user input. Assume they WILL break.  \n4. Build joins in a downstream layer ONLY after validation and cleansing. Default to left joins with null safe logic and then log any unmatched rows.  \n5.

It makes it 10x easier to debug what changed and when, and you can always roll back into a version in case anything goes wrong.  \n6.

Depends on how much time you have on your hands and if you expect to support many dozens, if not hundreds of layouts. Or just 7. In which case I’d dumb it down) should initially store everything as string, imho. I personally like to stage as stricter data types when reasonable (dates are a great example), as long as I’m capturing the raw data elsewhere.\n3) validate parsed data with a schema/layout.

A lot of experienced data engineers hit this wall after working with legacy tools, especially when the market shifts fast. Most would also wish they had the experience. The good news is: you’ve already taken the hardest step. You recognized the change and started upskilling. Python, Spark, SQL—those are the right moves. You’re not starting from zero.\n\nNow it’s time to shift from learning to building especially showcase a story / impact. Courses are fine, but real traction comes when you can point to something you’ve created. Set up a public GitHub repo with two or three small but complete projects. Think end-to-end: pull in data, transform it with PySpark or dbt, orchestrate it with Airflow, push it into a warehouse like BigQuery or Snowflake. Even if it’s basic, the fact that it works is what hiring managers want to see. Aka you are self sufficient and not to be watched but deliver results.\n\nAt the same time, tighten how you talk about yourself. You’re not “catching up”—you’re evolving. Build a 60-second intro that shows you’ve worked in high-scale environments and now you’ve added modern tools to your stack. The story needs to be clear and confident.\n\nAlso—don’t get stuck applying to roles blindly. Be intentional. Focus on companies in transition—those moving from legacy to cloud. Your past is an asset, not a liability. It’s not about having every shiny skill. It’s about showing you can adapt and ship. Do that, and doors will open. Keep going. Good luck 🍀 keep us posted.",

I have seen so many databases filled with stored procedures that no one wants to touch and they aren’t being version controlled.\n\nWith DBT you organize sql scripts in nice little project folders. Add as much or as little documentation as you wish. You can reuse common snippets of code (macros) among the scripts, which is helpful for making the code modular. The whole thing is code so it harmonizes nicely with git and version control. Finally, the little SQL scripts are easily referenceable by orchestrators to be used as building blocks in other programs.\n\nDuckdb is used to create versatile lightweight ephemeral database instances that can hold a lot of data in memory and can run blazing fast queries and joins in SQL. If you need to temporarily store data then duckdb is a nice way to ingest, transform, and stage data on its way to some more permanent system. Well, you can even use duckdb as the final resting place for some data since it is after all a portable embedded database like SQLite. Duckdb can fit just about anywhere in a data pipeline, but it’s especially useful for memory-intensive or slow tasks that are bottlenecking your workflow.\n\nHonestly the tools have a ton of overlap and you could very well use both, like [this guy](https://georgheiler.com/post/dbt-duckdb-production/).",

If you have many transforms that need to be run in order, you’ll be writing a lot of custom logic to build the DAG, handle retries of something fails, etc.\n\ndbt abstracts some of that away.

The main problem with doing the transform in DuckDB and then loading to a warehouse is you have to build some process to do the loading. Are you just going to drop and rebuild every table?

Thus, many do not actually do much data engineering, funny enough, even though they should. Overall work quality does suffer for this, so don't run your data teams like this.\n\nAt well run orgs the MLEs do data engineering and share ownership of pipelines with data engineers; DEs focus more on ops and moving data to different environments and MLEs focus on transforming data, though there aren't any hard lines, and human to human collaboration is necessary.\n\nIt is unusual to move from DE to MLE, the reverse is a little more common. MLE is a more competitive title: mostly because it is sexier, more people want in, also pay tends to be higher because people assume it is more skilled (I really don't feel this way; median MLE has just superficial knowledge of a few concepts and a few Python APIs, but that's another topic for another day). So companies will prefer to hire MLEs from the pool of people with prior MLE experience, of which there is no shortage of such people on the job market looking for a role, than DEs for MLE roles.",

Ask yourself what happens when the data is updated or when you need to change your website. How are you organizing your project and code?

I don't think there is a formula you can follow to stand out ahead of 499 other candidates (that's a suspiciously large and round number that makes be doubt the truth behind the post...) and the sort of person who writes this sort of shit is going to be an annoying, impulsive person who will bin a candidate on a whim because \"the vibes are off\" or something.\n\nThat said there are a couple of nuggets of truth here:\n\n1. spamming heaps of nonsense in your CV is going to just make it look busy, it's not necessarily going to help. There's a quote about writing in general - \"Perfection is achieved, not when there is *nothing* more to add, but when there is *nothing left to take away*\". Giving someone 6 page CV isn't going to make them think \"this person is seriously experienced\" it's going to make them roll their eyes a bit. That shouldn't discount that candidate (I definitely wouldn't throw a 6-page CV in the bin, for example), but it definitely doesn't help.\n2. making \"hail mary\" applications as an entry-level dev for a position that is advertised as a senior position may *feel* productive but is kind of a waste of your time and the recruiter's time. There may be exceptions - maybe they were planning on also hiring someone junior and may contact you about that position - but that's kind of rare.\n\nSimilarly for the \"there's no such thing as entry level in data engineering\" - that's someone trying to appear profound, but instead is frankly coming across as an unhelpful dick.\n\nIf you're lacking experience try for internships, give Google's [Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) a shot, try to do some self-study and personal projects or find some open source project you can contribute to. For the open source projects you can contribute even if you're \"only\" writing tests, documentation etc - that's a really valuable contribution, and demonstrates some commitment and could quite easily lead to contributing fixes and features in the future.",

If you've never worked as a data practitioner (DS, DA, AE, BIA, pricing analyst, etc) before, then go for these and think about making the transition a few years down the road. The job is entirely dependent on having a practical understanding of how data is consumed downstream of its production, and you just cannot have a clue if you haven't spent a few years of your life, well, consuming data.\n\n80-90% of the DEs I know have basically the same story. STEM degree(s), 2-6 YoE in Data, legitimate interest in software engineering (reading books, recreational programming, etc), makes the transition by learning the trade directly from the DEs working under the same roof. These roadmaps may give you the impression you can make the jump by learning the right tech. Learning bash, SQL and python is more like the bare minimum for most data jobs, honestly, not exactly a recipe for becoming a DE.\n\nI know the job title is pretty sexy, but trust me when I say you have no idea of what's it like.

It would depend on what you prefer.\n\nMy preference would be to go deep as for 3 YOE you have quite a wide tech stack so becoming an expert in these technologies will take time and possibly be a good value addition for your next role.\n\n1. Definitely be an expert in Python, SQL and either Snowflake or Pyspark. This can be your core. It is a quite wide stack that will certainly get interview calls and this can become your strengths when you talk about yourself in interviews.\n\n2. DBT and Airflow can be next to master. By mastery I mean you should know what are real bugs/limitations you encountered, how you migrated across versions, how you managed deployments of 1000s of models or pipelines, etc. What works for 10 jobs rarely works for 1000s.\n\n3. For good companies data structures and algo will most likely come in picture. Be good at fundamentals around data warehousing, data modeling, data architectures. DDIA is a must read. General system design can become relevant.\n\n4. Streamlit is a very nice to have feature, not sure about job interviews but once you are in a role it will help you shine if you can demonstrate good insights from the data that you are engineering. Same applies for ML engineering.\n\n5. A good background in a database technology can also be a good thing. Postgresql has emerged as a standard but that again is going to take quite some time to master.\n\n  \nAll the best!",

My boss was very impressed with this guy during the interview process, said he had a ton of contributions to open source projects and also had a lot of personal projects. He was supposed to be very experienced, and was hired for a senior role.\n\nOn his first day, early morning we have a meeting to showcase the data architecture we are proposing to a big data migration we are supposed to do in a near future (migrating old legacy on-premisse ETL to something more modern on the cloud) and the guy just sits there nodding. Didn't ask a single question, no comments or suggestions. Meeting ends, we all go out for lunch and invite him, he says \"go ahead, there's some personal stuff I need to take care off during the lunch break, see you soon\". The guy never came back. We were all shocked, \"maybe it's something I said?\", \"did he think our architecture was so bad he didn't want to work here anymore?\", etc. I was a little suspicious because in the quick small talk we had he didn't seemed like he was a very experienced programmer, so I asked my boss to send me his GitHub profile. There were dozens, maybe hundreds of repos there. I started to click in each one and... It was all just repos forked from various open source projects with ZERO changes from the guy. So he just basically just forked a bunch of random repos to impress some clueless recruiter and it fucking worked. The guy was a hack, probably didn't understand a word of what we said in that meeting, panicked and never came back.",

That way if you need something comprehensive you can create it as needed. If your storage is cheap you can also keep it around, but you don't want to run every single dev process at full scale.\n\nAt a place I was at previously we'd essentially snapshot the prod environment in a way that we could repeatedly 'restore' it to other environments as needed. That snapshot then had transforms to cut down the data as needed into other snapshots. Want something that only targets a specific geographical area, or a particular customer segment, or product, or a random sample? Then just grab a data snapshot for that and restore it into your project.\n\nJust check the costs against your labour costs though. If it is only costing 10% of an FTE, then is it even worth messing around with it? With that cost if it would take more than 10% of someone's time in a year to set this up and maintain it, then it isn't worth changing. If your dev is costing 100% of an FTE to run on prod data rather than a cut-down version, then it is probably worth having someone spend their time on setting up that cut-down data.",

Those people need to introduce OLAP as part of their stack, the value prop of what we offer in that case is that we make the opinionated choices for you, the glue is built in the framework for the different pieces of the stack so you don't have to worry about that. \n\nFor bigger orgs that already have something like a Databrick or a Snowflake, we see data engineering with huge backlogs that has a hard time to respond to demand for analytics. All of the data is pretty alive and fluid and what was the golden standard at day 0 is not so golden at day 100. We are trying to address that with a stack that is optimized for local quick iterations, reducing the time it takes to get something to production.\n\nI hope that helps.\n\nis your experience different? if so, how so?",

I find it particularly helpful for:\n\n* Connecting to a wide range of data sources, including APIs, databases, files, and cloud apps\n* Building flows visually or via JSON-based configuration\n* Automating scheduled jobs, such as syncing Salesforce data into SQL Server or pushing data to Snowflake\n* Transforming data mid-pipeline with built-in functions or custom scripts\n* Monitoring and alerting, which help ensure reliability without constant manual checks\n\nIt’s a versatile tool, especially when I need to support integrations across systems like PeopleSoft, Salesforce, and cloud data warehouses.",

I ask questions like: Can I automate this a little more? Can I add some fault handling or error handling? Can I set this up to be triggered to run instead of running on a schedule? By solving some of these questions, you allow yourself to quantify your impact to the business, which goes a long way in showcasing your skills and upgrading to a new role.\n\nI wouldn't worry too much about a particular tech or skill you don't have, because you can always try to pick them up on a personal project or training, and there's always a possibility in the future for a use case, especially if your are looking for one. The way I see it, you're already experienced in Azure, a big cloud platform.

Would be curious actually about how this turns out.\n\nWhat I normally do is instead I will have my “source table” with all data that is partitioned yearly as my “cold” storage. I will then incrementally build another table that is just maybe 1 year or month worth of data partitioned by month or day as my “hot” storage. Yes I am duplicating data but the compute cost to query is significantly less. This is also very easy to do with dbt. Also cost of storage is cheap which is a big selling point of Apache Iceberg in the first place.\n\nEdit: And of course anyone who needs more data will accept that increased cost and simple go to the full history table.",

It means that people that are familiar with that system can use your data platforms to get at the data they need, without having to put strain on the original source.\n\nAnother thing you could do is, with the 'internal tables, if some team wants access to some state like that you just make a copy of the model and call it a published one just for that team. You should then able to make changes to the original model to suit your own needs, and they've got something stable. It does mean you might have two materialisations, and you'll have two dependencies, but it might be worth it.\n\nYou still might have a bit more going on with the source-replica styled tables. People might want a history of the data in there, for example, so you might still run raw staging copies, then produce 'latest' and 'full history' representations of the data. It generally isn't hard to do both, since the latter gets you the former, so you can make it a standard that every time you ingest a new source you create these representations to provide to anyone that needs it so they can get quick access.\n\nLater down the line you'll have to grapple with data governance issues, but in a small org it can be handled more directly.",

And particularly when dealing with non-technical leaders, they don't want to be bogged down by a lot of technical detail, it's scary and confusing to them. You think you're showing them your great technical acumen but you're just convincing them they would rather work with the other guy.

More often than not, we get so caught up under the hubris of achieving technical excellence that we forget who it's being developed for. \n\nMy only thought was that it maybe slightly oversimplifies why some engineers get overlooked. The \"myth\" of focusing only on technical excellence felt a bit like a strawman – most engineers I know realize communication matters, even if they don't prioritize it enough. And promotions often involve more complex factors than just technical skill vs. relationships (like scope, leadership potential, strategic impact).\n\nBut overall, a valuable perspective on needing more than just coding chops.

It’s often through teaching or explaining concepts—whether it's techniques, architectures, or tools—that they become more deeply embedded in our understanding. That said, choose the method that works best for you.\n\nFeel free to DM me—I'd be happy to share tips and resources that have helped me throughout my career. For context, I started in the computer vision field, transitioned into software back-end engineering, then worked as a data analyst, and since 2020, I've been both a Senior Data Engineer and a Solutions Architect Expert at large international companies.",

Trying to put everything at once will take you a long time and you won’t be able to validate your progress and maybe you’ll stop in the middle because it was too long and you don’t see the project ending anytime soon.\n\nFirst focus on ingestion.\nThis will guide you collect data from a source and store it.\n\nYou can try a couple different sources here like REST api, web sockets, MQTT topics, GraphQL API, just here you can have some fun.\n\nDo things simple, use simple python and once it’s working THEN try to improve if you want ti make it faster or what ever.\n\nThen focus on transformation \nLoad the data from S3 to Snowflake. It doesn’t have to be automated. Ingest enough to have a couple of hour/days worth of data for your need and load that at once into snowflake.\n\nNow configure your first DBT project and make sure you are able to connect to snowflake using DBT debug command.\n\nThen clean and transform your raw data to something meaningful.\n\nNote that before you start the ingestion step you should know what’s the first thing you want to achieve. If you don’t this won’t work. Find something you want to know then find the data source for it, not the other way around. It’s always more fun to do something which have some value for you. \n\nThen work on testing you ingesting code and you transformation. Might be boring, but it’s a needed skill.\n\n\nThen focus on automation. Configure your airflow module and orchestrate  you ingestion module on a schedule with your DBT transformation from a trigger when the ingestion for a specific partition is done.\n\nThen you can start looking into streaming.\nConfigure your infrastructure (Kafka, or red pandas or what ever you want)\n\nThen modify your ingestion module so it send events instead of full set of data. For example if you were collecting all weather records from all country well don’t wait for the complete process to be finished, yield events as you consume them to your Kafka stream.\n\nThen configure your ingestion engine spark/flink/quix/bytewax and run some transformation on real time data.\n\nThen try to configure some threshold will would alert you in real time if xyz happen, if the temperature increase from x in the last hour.\n\nThen work on building beautiful dashboards.\n\nThen you can try to consolidate all pieces together.\n\nThis is never a small project, and doing everything at once won’t bring you where you want. Do small integration instead. You’ll get completion reward as you go and you will be more willing to continue instead of dropping because the scope is to complex.\n\nCheers and good luck",

I actually landed Unilever as a client and did 3 projects with them through the platform as a data analyst.\n\n\\- Large / corporates hire freelancers through recruiting firms. That's called contracting. Those project usually last 3-18 months and are almost always full-time. They are great to get started as a freelancer as they pay very well but you will depend on just one client.  \n  \nI have a community of data freelancers so I can testify that yes it's a viable career path. \n\nEnough talk.

More often than not, it just basically means Sales Engineer or similar sales role. The rest of the time it means developer who hacks “solutions” together (that aren’t usually that great). \n\nThat being said, you might want to look into getting some kind of SA cert from one of the cloud providers. You mentioned GCP, but I wouldn’t rule out AWS or Azure. In fact, I would look to see if there are any companies trying to migrate from on-prem Oracle stacks to cloud based ones and see which cloud provider they tend to go for (I would guess Azure but that’s just a guess) and then get a cert in that. That way you can leverage your old and new skills together. \n\nGood luck.",

Conversely, Flink is now 100% Java.\n\nHave you also looked at Akka/Pekko? Depending on what you want to do this can be a bit simpler to deploy and operate, event-sourcing and CQRS are the main use case.",

A systematic governance framework is required in every business that assigns clear data accountability to each data role. DEs and DAs need to collaborate and answer one fundamental question first: What data product does the business need?\n\nTo achieve such a goal, DEs and DAs need structured and adaptable data quality rules and to determine how to monitor and catch issues at the source. This is the critical overlap that many organizations are missing today.\n\nIf you can, build a custom (homebrew) system to detect data issues early. If that's not feasible or scalable, invest in a data observability platform that meets these needs.\n\nI might have answered a bit more than you asked for, but this is a good question and I think it's worth rethinking, even for some senior DEs and DAs.",

So I am trying to navigate my way carefully while taking on this challenge.\n\nIm definitely trying not to over complicate/engineer anything as I want to keep the code simple and maintainable since the use case isn’t really huge. But I have to optimize the process a bit given the amount of data fetched.",

Most business do not hire for someone that specialises. Being a data engineer with a lot of data ops experience will get you a long way in my experience and is probably better for your employability.\n\nAnyone else out there feel free to correct me if you think I’m wrong - this is all anecdotal from my personal experience.",

        "body": "Hi! I am a little experienced programmer (\\~20 years), mainly in heavy-data-oriented companies (banks, governmental taxes, investment funds, energy). IMHO, DataOps - and similar teams - are costly solutions for an underrated way of seeing data.\n\nEven companies dealing with high volumes of data can use other solutions, which - although old-school - are cheaper, effective enough, and have known, stable tools. Companies have analytics teams, reporting teams, controlling teams, etc., working closely with IT. If all they deliver useful, valid data, it's good enough. DataOps as a team is another layer of organization, which requires more collaboration, more tools, more discipline, more dependencies, etc., giving unknown (maybe?) better value. Which company wants to pay for it?!\n\nDataOps should be more a general concept, a part of strategy, like DevOps, not a new role or a new team. (BTW, this is one of the reasons for failure in introducing DevOps - by a team or a role foundation.) Of course, this is very convenient for some people to have a visible \"thing\" on an orga chart, with attached obligations and maybe some KPIs, but it is not working for 99.9% of companies - I guess this level, but I will try to justify:\n\nDataOps as a team or a role is a kind of coordinator role. There are two general attitudes (it's malicious, but it's for real): first, this role is given to the least competent person, who needs to do something, but in this role can't mess up anything; second, this role is given to the most competent person, who quickly becomes a bottleneck.\n\nBut there is easier, working alternative, which paradoxically is also a MUST for DataOps: collaboration between parties. Without collaboration DataOps is probably impossible. With collaboration DataOps is probably not necessary.\n\nSo, if you want to look for a very niche job offered by very few companies, that are rich enough to proceed with such an experiment, and if you have very high skills in business and technical issues, you are probably a good candidate for a very lucrative contract. In other case, have a good plan B. Whatever happens, good luck!",

It would only really be useful for one email but it might be cute to send him an email that says something like:\n\nI just wanted to say, SSdtIHNvIHByb3VkIG9mIHlvdQ==\n\nWhich translates to   \n  \nI just wanted to say, I'm so proud of you.\n\nJust make sure there's the == at the end of the message to make it obvious.  Base64 uses padding to make sure the content is of an appropriate length so sometimes it will end in = or ==.  So if you encode it to Base64 and it doesn't have == at the end just add a space and reencode until the encoded message contains ==.  You do run the risk of him not realizing what the message is though.",

The author basically starts mentioning the abacus and other early calculating machines, which leads to Babbage/Lovelace, which leads to Turing, which leads to Von Neumann, which leads to... etc etc all the way up to modern networking, cloud, and social media.  \n\n\nIt doesn't go overly in-depth into any one topic, but still explains a lot of things in a way that's easy enough to grok even without a CS background. And it's not just historical figures like a textbook, he does explain things like how vacuum tubes worked and *why* certain things developed the way they do, like how CS concepts we consider foundational today were being theorized/implemented to invent devices to accurately. Lots a little fun facts you can repeat to sound smart at parties too which I appreciate from any book.... like how a committee inventing machines to calculate the necessary settings to aim anti-aircraft kinda just offhandedly invented the term \"digital\", humble beginnings for a word that defines the modern day.  \n\n\nDefinitely recommend, especially if you like history or are a little shaky on certain CS topics. Really having a good explanation of how a vacuum tube actually works before moving onto microprocessors really helped the IRL \"tech tree\" make so much more sense to me, and now if you ask me what a microprocessor is, I won't any longer respond by saying \"idk, shit that low level is just magic to me\"",

If you don’t enjoy programming or coding (which it sounds like you may not) it’s prob best not to force it. Let things happen naturally do what interests you. If you’re not afraid of taking on some debt (which shouldn’t be too much if you go the trade school route) I think becoming an electrician could deff pay off.

People here are saying \"no\" but it's more complicated than that on modern architecture. Yes, they can slow down your loop if the branch predictor guesses wrong, because the CPU pipeline will have to flush its pending work. But branch predictors are pretty good, so unless the if statement is very unpredictable or 50/50, you'll be fine.\n\nedit: As far as optimizing if statements out of loops, sometimes you can split the loop into two loops with separate logic, and that allows you to extract the if statement outside the loop. Alternatively you can look into branchless programming, which usually relies on methods like boolean algebra. But don't go too deep into the world of micro-optimizations, 9/10 times it is a waste of your time unless you have definite specifications that require it.",

In modern ISAs, you typically see cmp and jump instructions bundled in the same one, this would be executed faster than two instructions, but the jump offset addressing is usually smaller.\n\nHow fast are those instructions? Well that would depend on the architecture, but I assume they are done in a cycle easily.\n\nOf course, if you don't need the IF, your program would obviously be faster, because you reduced the need for an extra instruction.\n\nBut in reality, it shouldn't make it that much slower (remember one instruction only), but since IF is used to cover side cases, it'll obviously make your program bigger, how big you may ask? Depends on what the compiler optimizes the if to, it could be a branch with a link, it could be a skip, etc...\n\nIf you're strictly testing loop scenarios, just think to yourself \"every time I run this loop, I am doing an additional instruction\" so if the loop is 8 instructions long, and one of them is the IF instruction, then yeah, it would make it somewhat slower. So yeah, if you're doing a loop that loops 1 billion times, and you tracked the  time it took, you could probably see a noticeable difference.",

        "body": "Here's a breakdown of some good learning resources:\n\nFrontend:\n\n\\-Scrimba's frontend career path is endorsed by MDN and has a unique teaching style. Not overly comprehensive and could be great paired alongside Frontend Mentor for projects.\n\n\\-Frontend Mentor is great for practice projects.\n\n\\-The Odin Project is probably the most comprehensive resource for frontend online but its not for everyone. There is tons of reading and it takes much, much longer to complete than other souces. However, its up to date and really enforces the fundamentals. Might be best to choose another resource if your focus is backend though since this goes deeper into frontend than you'd probably need to know.\n\n\\-FreeCodeCamp launched a new curriculum recently. I haven't tried it but it looks pretty good.\n\nBackend:\n\n\\-Boot.dev is a newer resource that teaches backend fundamentals in a \"gameified\" learning experience where you earn XP from completing problems. Probably one of (if not the) best resource for learning general backend skills, my only gripe is their focus on Go. Go isn't as in demand as some other backend langauges, but they are launching a Typescript path soon for those who don't want to learn Go.\n\n\\-Hyperskill is a lesser known resource where you get lots of hands-on practice. I used this website to learn Java and I can't recommend it enough. The projects are great and after every lesson you are given plenty of practice problems. The only downside is that its a little unclear when you should start on projects and some of the practice problems pull from content you haven't learned yet but other than that its a great platform that has integration with Jetbrains IDEs.\n\n\\-The Odin Project also covers Node.js if you're interested in that. They also have a Ruby on Rails path but I wouldn't recommend it.\n\n\\-Since you mentioned C#, I've heard good things about [https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/) although I haven't tried it myslef. Also Microsoft recently launched a full stack developer course on Coursera using C# for backend.\n\nWhether you want to learn frontend or backend first is really up to you, just make sure you apply your skills once you learn them with practice projects. The platforms I listed here are all really good about making you practice the skills you've learned. That's why I didn't recommend Udemy courses, because while there are some instructors that do a good job teaching, projects usually involve you just watching them code and copying what they do. I could see using Udemy for frontend paired with Frontend Mentor though, Colt Steele and Jonas Schmedtmann are probably your best bet for that. Also, I would avoid the full stack developer bootcamps on Udemy, since they are often just surface-level knowledge. Lastly, if you ever plan on getting a CS degree I would go with WGU. Very affordable university that lets you go at your own pace. You can proabably get it done in 2-3 years depending on how much time you have (I'm on track to finish in about 3 years, although I've kinda been slacking). Hope this helps!",

You can learn these but companies tend to like degrees for AI jobs. Your best bet falls in Webdev and maybe cyber. Cyber you can get in to on your own by doing online courses and certifications but this is less programming and more just security information. \n\nPython is generally recommended for beginners. \n\nI would look at JS especially the fancy frameworks like next and react and some new one that came out that probably came out as I am typing this. \n\nIf you want low level stuff I think rust is pretty cool.

There is a thing called a car. I have one. Mine is a particular colour and it can drive to places at various speeds... yada yada yada. \n\nOOP let's us express these ideas in these ways. When it comes to large, complex systems, this kind of separation and encapsulation can help tame the chaos. \n\nOver the years, I have come to accept that forcing \\*everything\\* into the object model is a mistake (as a Java guy for a couple of decades, this was a hard lesson to learn), but there are times when it is the right way to express an idea, even a very complex one. \n\nOver time and assuming the tools support it (and hopefully in 2025 they do), you just learn to combine all this stuff.",

        "body": "Let's be honest with you: your programs so far were way too small to really benefit from OOP. OOP works great with huge, complex programs.\n\nYet, there are even smaller programs that can greatly benefit from OOP - provided, you have the right use case.\n\nFor me, a prime example are card games. Here OOP can really play its strengths in simple, fairly small projects.\n\nThink about what you need for card games: you need cards (obviously), you need a deck, you need players (also obviously), players have hands (the card hands, not their physical ones), and there could be much more.\n\nExactly the nouns above: Card, Deck, Player, Hand translate very well to Classes in OOP.\n\n+ A *Card* is a class modeling a single playing card. It has a suit, a rank, potentially a numeric value, potentially, a front and a back, and it is either face up or face down. It can be flipped (toggle face up/face down), can report its suit and rank, and value *provided* it is face up, otherwise it should not reveal its values.\n+ A *Deck* is a collection of cards. It can be initialized, can report its size, can be shuffled, can deal 1 or more cards.\n+ A *Player* models a human player with a name, potentially some money, a hand (the cards they are holding), a bet, etc. Of course, it can report all that.\n+ A *Hand* is basically similar to a deck of cards, but always directly related to a player.\n\nWhen you have this fundamental classes above and add a Game class where you define the rules of the game and how the game rounds run, you can quickly whip up any card game.\n\nEven better, by just changing the game class you can make Blackjack, Poker, and many more games by reusing the other classes you have previously made.\n\nSure, you could just as well do all that without OOP (and it has been done plenty times already), but overall the OOP code will be much cleaner, much more modular, much easier to maintain and reuse, much shorter in total than its non-OOP counterpart.\n\nReuse is one of the advantages of OOP. Another is *encapsulation*. The outside, the program that uses your classes does not need to know anything how the inside works, how it stores its data (state). The outside always \"communicates\"/\"interacts\" with the class/object through well defined and limited channels, pretty much in the form of a dialogue. The program asks the class/object for something and the class responds.",

An object contains data about itself, and methods to manipulate that data, so other objects can \"communicate\" directly with it, without having to know anything about how it is built.\n\nThe example you supplied is just a single method that does some procedural work on some separate data, so you don't get any benefit from doing it more object oriented.\n\nBut imagine a game, where different players have different health and shield-status, different inventory, equipped weapons and so on. Every item in the game is an object, so that when one player hits another with their weapon, you don't have some central code that does all the calculation, but the Player1 object sends a message to the Player2 object, that they hit it with WeaponA - Player2 then calculates the damage delivered by WeaponA, subtracts its own shield, and adjusts their own health-level. Maybe even deciding to hit Player1 back.\n\nThat is all done by code inside the Player-object, making it seem more like the objects are \"communicating\" than running a procedure.\n\nSince many processes - in games and business - can be modelled as entities communicating, OOP lends itself very well to that way of thinking, and it is \"easy\" to transfer an abstract model of a system to independent objects, than to a huge procedural program.\n\n  \nSmaller procedures, like parsing a text, calculating shortest distances or sorting data, usually don't benefit from using OOP.",

        "body": "The benefits wont show up much on small single person projects over a short timespan.\n\nThe essence of OOP is encapsulation. Encapsulation is what makes object polymorphism possible, and it’s the core thing that distinguishes OOP from procedural and most functional programming.\n\nThe point of encapsulation is that it limits how much of the system you have to keep in your head at one time. At its best, you can focus on the responsibilities of a single object and trust that other objects are doing what they’re supposed to do. This is in especially important when you’re on a team where someone else is writing those other objects.\n\nOne place where the rubber really hits the road with object-oriented encapsulation is in the enforcement of invariants. An encapsulated object can make more guarantees about its behavior than a publicly mutable struct. To understand whether a struct is in a valid state you might have to look at every place that has mutated it, whereas to understand if a mutable object is in a valid state you should (ideally) only have to verify that its constructor and setters properly maintain its validity. You can think locally rather than globally.\n\nThe other place where OOP has a leg up is extensibility. When you encapsulate your objects by writing to an interface rather than a concrete implementation you gain the ability to add new implementations of your interfaces which will interoperate with existing code, without having to modify the existing code. This is also very important as the project increases in scale.\n\nI’ve written a basic [blog post](https://jnkr.tech/blog/abstract-data-types-and-objects) on the tradeoffs involved in choosing between proper objects and imperative abstract data types which you might find interesting. ",

Done cleanly it can certainly work, but it's rarely done properly and often results in much more complication than is really required.\n\nAs a learning pattern it is something that really seems to \"click\" with people in theory, but implementing in practice it brings in more natural bias about how things \"really exist\" even if that doens't make sense for the actually requirements for the code.\n\nYou can frequently see this with beginners who want to do something like write a game, the first thing they will is start listing out object types and quickly realize that half the time \"Enemy\" should be a \"Unit\", but other times it should be a \"Targetable\" or something and often end up with inheritance trees that look like spider webs.\n\nWith practice you can learn to manage this better, but it never fundamentally changes the fact that model isn't actually that great in the first place.\n\nI think a lot of people have spent so much time hearing the supposed benefits of OOP that they have never seriously questioned that fact.",

        "body": "To your credit most intro programming courses do a horrible job of explaining the purpose of object oriented programming. They usually try to introduce it with some flimsy metaphors of cats and dogs and bicycles and wheels and then have you memorize the four tenets: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, without really giving a good reason for why OOP embodies these tenets better than any other paradigm. To their credit, it’s difficult to see the benefits until you are seasoned enough to start working on larger scale coding projects.\n\nFirst, let’s get this out of the way: OOP is not strictly superior to procedural programming. Different paradigms are good for different things. We also don’t choose one paradigm over another because of performance reasons, or really anything involving the computer. Paradigms are solely concerned with how we, the humans, conceptualize the code we’re writing. At the end of the day, every program is in an imperative paradigm once it gets compiled down to machine code.\n\nProcedural programming is great if what you’re coding is best conceptualized as a procedure; AKA a series of instructions. If you’re writing a python script to run some preprocessing tasks on your ML model then it makes total sense to take a procedural approach.\n\nHowever, let’s take the most stereotypical application of coding, software development. Say you’re developing an app like Microsoft Word. Is Microsoft Word better described as series of instructions, or as an object? In this case, OOP makes much more sense because you are developing a *thing*, and that thing is composed of many smaller things like buttons and menus and widgets. It makes it much easier for our brains to decompose the task of coding Microsoft Word into manageable subtasks in a way that effectively reduces complexity.\n\nIn reality, most languages these days include elements of many different programming paradigms, there are very few languages that are purely one paradigm. This is nice because you don’t have to commit completely to one paradigm if there are little parts of your project that would be better done in another. JavaScript mixes OOP concepts with functional programming which works well for web developers since functional programming is great for dealing with network protocols.",

All those common things you do regularly.   Use only C++, no cheating and using c-string tools or the string to cstring conversion.\n\nFrom there, I would master the vector class.  You don't have to understand the template syntax fully yet, just know that its vector<any type> variablename format and work it from there.  Work the learncpp chapter on vectors hard.\n\nNOW, with your feet a little wetter, give classes and object oriented programming chapters a look, and start working that stuff.\n\nA couple of things to forget from C for a while:  \npointers.  Just forget them for now.  You can circle back later, but code without using any at all for a while.  Iterators are OK to use.  \nmacros.  Don't use them unless strictly necessary, like a debug tool to spew a line number.  As with pointers, just don't go there for a while, get used to coding without them, and circle back later once the C is a bit of a distant memory and less of a habit.\n\nAs you move forward, I would alternate a day to study c++ differences with a chapter or two on the deep topics.  For example (literally!), the c++ for loop has a new twist, you can iterate over a container with loops that look like for(type &t : container) and t will advance through the elements of container, becoming each one in turn.  If referenced, its the real value, if not, its a copy, and that is a big deal for performance and behaviors both, to get that & or not absolutely correct.

Something simple like a console-based calculator, anything, just write it yourself with what you've learnt regularly. \n\nBe patient too and stick to the path, it's going to be very hard compared to other programming languages and will take significantly longer to get to an intermediate/advanced level at C++.",

They iterate over and over and over again. It is REALLY hard, even for the best designers out there, to achieve a perfectly designed websited from a blank canvas. You build something that kind of works and kind of looks good, and then you improve on that. Then you test, gather feedback, and improve again, ad infinitum.\n\nEdit: learning this is quite fun tbh. I am doing a lot with just HTML and CSS nowadays, and it's a great way to relax after programming, lol. Think of it like painting.

Go deeper in the professional development career**\n\nLearn more about the infrastructure around coding: all the DevOps branches, testing, automated testing, dev containers, docker, github actions, deployment, CI/CD and so on - become a \"software developer\" more than a programmer, and understand the environment around the software.\n\n**3. Go deeper in programming**\n\nYou have some low level C++ knowledge, but do you understand data structures and algorithms, do you know how a linked list is built, or why a hashmap is as fast as it is? While these aren't necessarily required skills in this day and age, it helps to understand more about the machine, more about why programming works the way it does, and it can be very code-nerdy fun.\n\n**4. Take the alternate route**\n\nTry something completely new: \n\n* perhaps **frontend programming** (which would be a nice match for your backend knowledge), learn some React, try to build frontends for your existing backends\n* or **games programming** \\- pick a language and framework you like, and play around with making small games - if you like designing complex programs, that can be a great challenge, and could be an excellent hobby, if not exactly job-oppertunities\n* or **hardware programming** \\- buy an Arduino or similar small scale microcontroller, and play around with controlling lights and motors. If you feel up to it, try to do without the libraries, and learn how to actually control the hardware. Can be very challenging, but also great fun, and the physical aspect makes it feel a bit different than programming, while still giving you lots of practice.\n* or **app development** \\- try to make small apps for your phone, small things that you can use yourself, and decide if you want to expand in to better UI or more AI once you get going.\n\n\n\nRight now there's no guaranteed direction that will make you a lot of money, so pick the one you deem most fun, and try it out. You will always become a better programmer than you already are, no matter which direction you pick!",

        "body": "I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and used to work as a [backend developer](https://roadmap.sh/backend) for multiple companies including Amazon. For the list of common professions in the Computer Science world, see: \n\nhttps://roadmap.sh/ \n\nI'm going to go through what you wrote one line at a time.\n\n> \"So, I'm in my first year of college and honestly, everything in tech seems super interesting—whether it's web development, AI/ML, DevOps, or cybersecurity. The problem is, I don’t know which one to choose, as I don't know much about them.\"\n\nYou start with the foundations that they all have in common. For example, regardless of whether you are doing full-stack web development in JavaScript, Machine Learning development in Python, DevOps scrips in bash, PowerShell, or Python, or red team cybersecurity penetration testing scripts in Python, you have to know how to code. First, you need to learn programming fundamentals like variables, integers, Strings, booleans, conditions, operators, loops, functions, etc. Then after that, you need to learn Object Oriented Programming (OOP) like classes, class inheritance (subclasses), interfaces, methods vs. functions, etc. At some point you should probably also take a class called \"discrete math\" that covers the math of logic (and, or, not, true, false, etc.). This class (in the University of Michigan course list): \n\nhttps://eecs203.github.io/eecs203.org/ \n\nAlso, for most of those specialties, a Computer Networking class is also useful (note that this is a 400 level class, so students usually take it in their 4th year of undergraduate university studies): \n\nhttps://github.com/mosharaf/eecs489\n\n> \"Everyone says, 'Pick what interests you,' but that’s the thing—I like all of it, and it’s kinda confusing.\"\n\nYou don't have to pick a specialty in Computer Science right away. Look at the list at https://roadmap.sh/ and know you can be in university for years before deciding on a specialty. Sometimes you don't even make a conscious decision, life circumstances and availability end up deciding for you. Like I know one guy who graduated with a Computer Science degree but couldn't get a coding job but did land an on-premise server I.T. job, and then he ended up going that route and eventually managing/supervising a huge number of on-premise servers. Circumstances ended up choosing for him.\n\n> \"How can I try out these different fields for a small amount of time and figure out what I actually enjoy the most?\"\n\nMaybe check out various subreddits, follow them, and eventually send professionals in those subreddits chat requests to ask them about their profession. To help me find subreddits, I start with a Reddit search and then use The Map of Reddit (Google \"Map of Reddit\", it's a website to help you find related or interconnected subreddits). For example, for Machine Learning there is r/MachineLearning and r/LearnMachineLearning , maybe r/DataScience . For experienced developers there is r/ExperiencedDevs . For backend developers there is r/backend . There is also r/fullstack , r/WebDev , and r/frontend . Then there are subreddits for the individual programming languages like r/java , r/LearnJava , r/Python , r/LearnPython , etc.\n\n> \"I'd really appreciate some simple advice on where to start and how to explore without feeling overwhelmed.\" \n\nStart with the foundations that multiple different professions in the tech industry have in common. For example, backend developers, data science people, data analytics people, data engineers, and software engineering team managers all need to know databases and SQL. Thus, this class, Database Management Systems, should be a class you take at some point: \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1JK6_nmwkouMnU3gtD9AF085hR_LhPKIL1bVPzRAS8MA/mobilebasic?pli=1 \n\nBut yeah, start with establishing a foundation that spans across multiple different professions. Keep your body and mind healthy and sharp, and never stop learning so you can pivot as necessary. Who knows what will be most in demand when you graduate.",

This is good, because the ideas are transferrable to other languages.

But bear in mind you'll have to learn the more popular language, like Python, when you've graduated.   \n\nSo let's assume you're learning the wrong language. For instance, maybe the employers in your town all use Python instead. How do you get ahead? My suggestion is to find out what is the most popular language used by the industry in your town, and then start a club on campus where you *teach* it.

They have courses that are ready to teach in a variety of popular languages, it's just a matter of learning how to teach the curriculum, and doing the work to practice teaching it. Luckily, they also have self-paced courses that teach you how to teach. And by teaching, you learn.  \n\nOnce you've graduated, saying that you TAUGHT a popular language at a university club will make you stand out.",

        "body": "Okay, these are pretty non-widespread languages, that won't yield you greater access to the modern software world.\n\nVisual Basic may be fine for some limited microsoft-centered development, but is not really future proof or standard for advanced projects. Nonetheless you can learn programming basics with it, very well, and use the knowledge for other languages later on. You just need to learn to adapt to a new syntax/library functions.\n\nKnowledge of Assembly is good! It will teach you how computers work internally, and what high-level languages work with. Knowing it, you will be able to write more efficient and realistic code. But it is only seldom used nowadays in application programming. It is used in some embedded projects, even when C compilers are way more standard, or platforms running slim interpreters for script languages. It is still useful for some isolated use cases for extreme hand-tuned optimizations, hacking, reverse-engineering etc.\n\nThe Graphic design you describe as making graphics with basic library functions by a basic or assembly header, I understand. Well, it is toddler stuff fpr beginners imho. You can learn programming with it, and collect experience. But later you will have to move on and learn to use more professional solutions for graphics design.\n\nEven if you study these topics in university, I'd recommend you to privately stay busy with more widespread, professional components, i.e. python, java(-script)/typescript, C/C++, ... Another benefit of these languages is, aside possible involvement in way more professional production projects, that you can massively learn from the open source scene using these languages, i.e. on GitHub, and you can get all the tools and docs you need for free from the internet!",

This means using a program called a *profiler*. Many beginners still choose to optimize without a profiler because it's just one more tool they need to learn, and they'd rather guess what's slow.\n\nIf you insist, you can create a HashMap (or whatever C# has) that maps the command string to a something that implements a Command interface.

That doesn't mean you should write fast and shitty code, just that you need to learn the optimal amount of \"should I consider this now\" vs \"note this as a place to consider if execution time becomes and issue\".\n\nI am a firm believer in not putting off refactor if you see problems, but beyond keeping good, clean, defensive coding practices, overthinking problems that haven't even presented themselves yet will just drive you fucking crazy.\n\nB: You have decided to listen to random people give you \"this is how it is\" advice instead of exploring and learning about how if/else and switch might differ in the resulting assembly. Stop letting other people answer your questions with other things you don't understand. The internet is full of fucking nonsense, and I read TONS of it being given as confident \"this is how it is\" programming advice when the reality is ALWAYS more complicated and nuanced. Get curious. The answer to your question is out there and well explained by someone who actually knows what they are talking about.\n\nAnyway, what you are doing is fine. Using a switch might make it look a little cleaner if it gets longer. I would also look up using function pointers and a dispatch table, more as a thought experiment. Function pointers seem outlandish at first but are an amazing tool to be comfortable with. If you want to DM me at any point, I do light tutoring for free and I think this is a cool problem to talk about a few interesting design patterns.\n\nedit: I dropped the term \"function pointer\" in this without thinking language.

Doom is a \"2 1/2d\" game. It looks 3d, but it uses clever tricks and is really not.\n\nThis repository has code for one [https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/DOOM-style-Game](https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/DOOM-style-Game) .\n\nThat said, this is an order of magnitude more complex so google Doom in Python and do a good amount of reading. \n\nIf you make it through both of those projects you will be ready to start looking at real 3d games. Keep in mind while you can do 3D in Python, it will be slow. 3D games use some form of C. or a related compiled language. Full on game development environments like Unreal Engine have optimized libraries and allow you to create at a very high level and then build the game executable. \n\nGame development is a long road.

It's a testament to the language that it is still mostly backwards compatible with the versions 1.2 or 1.3 that you must have worked on. Of course, there was no Spring framework, or even a decent Java IDE back then. \n\nI do think Spring (doesn't have to be Boot) is a great choice for a complex Java app. JetBrains IntelliJ is the best IDE, with VSCode as a close second. Git should be your version control system. Start with JUnit for your tests.\n\nBootcamp is an attractive idea. You would get a great immersive introduction, but it will cost, on average, about USD 13000. I am a bit of a cheapskate, so I would just learn it on my own.\n\nYou don't really need a webserver if you are building a REST API. Your UI apps will just invoke the API, the same way that you would do it programmatically. \n\nIf your app needs to scale massively, then AWS, or any other quality cloud service provider, is your answer. Much easier to set up a proof of concept when you can get a wealth of services, but only have to pay for what you use. AWS will host your database as well. A lot of people don't seem to realize it, but you can easily write a performant Spring Java REST API / Db access app as an AWS Lambda. Although if you need a monolith, then EC2 hosting scalable containers like Fargate will do the job as well.",

I think learning algorithms along side data structures is important as data structures are used within algorithms to model whatever it is you’re trying to do.  I’d take a moment and get a stretch goal laid out of a project that incorporates these tools step at a time.  Example: create a list with an “exit” or key search term.  Then optimize your solution for a bigger data set.  Lastly use a popular search algorithm (binary search for example) to implement for your solution.  Did it decrease your run time?  Can you do it in less lines of code?  Optimization is one of the key tasks all scientists have to learn as they’re testing in the field.  Don’t treat computer programming any different.

Alternatively you could use scratch to introduce him to programming concepts such as variables, loops and conditionals as well as help develop an algorithmic mindset which is honestly one of the most valuable things you can have. Knowing the syntax of the language is one thing, but the most important part of coding something is knowing how to think within the bounds of computer language.\n\nOnce he has some footing, he might want to try out godot. It's what i'm using to make my rhythm game and the coding while incredibly flexible and powerful, has easy to learn syntax. Don't get me wrong it's a proper engine and has all the bells and whistles, but it's accessible compared to something like unreal.\n\nThe other alternative is gamemaker which doesn't have coding, it has logic blocks that you connect together visually. Unreal has something similar and deeper called blueprints but unreal is the premier game engine on the market, very much not suitable for beginners and the actual coding in unreal is C++, pretty much the most beginner unfriendly (but powerful) language you could learn.",

In addition, since your specifically interested in web development, I'd recommend the Odin project. It has a lot of front end stuff, and it is really well made I think (also free). The two of those combined should really set you up for both backend and frontend development. Some other great resources are freeCodeCamp, Coursera, and edX. Coursera and edX have some free courses, I think Harvard's CS50 is often the go to recommend for a first course in coding on here. freeCodeCamp is just awesome in my opinion.

There are plenty of lessons that go into CS concepts like OOP, Data Structure & Algorithms, etc.  \n  \nOn top of that, you'll learn how to build a network.

It is more of a Job program than a bootcamp, but the way the coding is taught is really easily digestible. Technically, the program is like 7-9 months, but I finished(including the big project) in about 5, and that was with a job and other adult responsibilities; I imagine a summer would be enough time to get through it if you don't have much else going on. I tried to stick to the two classes a week schedule like when they did it live, but it didn't take long before I was watching at 2x and skipping big portions of the videos, so accelerating is definitely possible.\n\nLots of people say \"Build stuff\", \"Do projects\", etc.; I think that's definitely something you should do, but it isn't super helpful for someone in your position. You'll build lots of things with the technologies that you're learning doing 100devs.\n\nBest of luck!",

You start from basics and progress from there. Maybe the a-ha moment is understanding how a program runs or making your first algorithm, but it isn't a single a-ha moment, and it doesn't mean one day you don't know how to program, and the next day you're churning out code.\n\nThere's always new stuff to learn (whether you choose to or not) and it's done in steps. Have you ever seen people who draw really well. Sometimes they post their drawings over the years from stuff just better than stick figures. Sure, maybe there's a year it starts to take a big leap forward, but there's often more progress after that.\n\nWe all want shortcuts, but they aren't always there.\n\nFor a recommendation, try (web search: `MOOC Java`). This is a free course in Java. You can do it in C# instead, but if you do it in Java, there's automated grading. The key is to do all the programming exercises, and not just read. As you do this, you can do the equivalent in C# which is reasonably similar to Java.",

You can learn to code while making games and it's a fun way to keep things interesting. However, it's very unreasonable to be writing your own game engine, especially as a complete novice.\n\nIf you just care about making the game, getting it finished and shipping it, you will save yourself, probably years of effort to do so in an already established engine. Godot, unity or unreal are all good options. Look into which is best for you.\n\nAs a beginner programmer, I guarantee you will not create anything more complicated than a pacman style game for a significant amount of time if not using an engine. This is fine if you're trying to learn about the programming language. Using classes, inheritance, polymorphism learning about common patterns etc. but this likely will not produce what you expect. Even veteran programmers, solo, struggle to make entire games. We haven't even got into art, animation or sound yet.\n\nFinally, why C#? Why not Java, or C or C++ or python? If you can't answer this question then go back to the drawing board and decide based on facts.\n\n\"Python because it's very forgiving and beginner friendly with great libraries like pygame\"\n\n\"C++ to get me closer to the hardware allowing me more control over how my game is run\"\n\n\"Java because I hate existence and want the most disgusting challenge ever\"\n\nAll are acceptable answers.

My concern would be that you're struggling to get through the content, even when taking ADHD meds. If you don't have a genuine interest in programming (as in, actually programming, not \"what you think programming is\"), then it isn't unlikely that it's just... \"not your thing\". You don't need to be a math genius, or be able to perfectly follow code in your mind, but you do need to be interested. A lot of the developers I know could take ADHD meds and program for 18 hours straight. It make them insatiable.\n\nAt some point, you'll need to learn more about data structures, algorithms, and memory (which is usually what the Bootcamps skip). I tried my hardest not to learn that stuff for as long as possible, but eventually... you just need to. It helps you recognize problems and how to solve them.\n\nJavaScript is particularly tricky (even though it's also beginner-friendly) because it's the only language that has built-in templating, windowing, rendering, and styling (HTML, the browser, and CSS). Vanilla JS teaches you about manually manipulating The DOM, but the second you move into more professionally-oriented work, you'll likely be using frameworks like React that abstract The DOM away. So they teach you all this \"document.querySelector\" stuff in JS, it's unlike anything in any other language, and when you've finally figured it out, they say \"just kidding, we usually use libraries to do that for us\".\n\nJS and all of it's libraries, packages, and frameworks update regularly. Syntax changes, frameworks fade in and out of popularity, and you'll need to keep up. I'm autistic with ADHD, and for me that's a benefit. It keeps changing, but it keeps getting better, the tools are fun and relatively easy to use, and I enjoy trying and learning all of the new stuff. Keeps me from getting bored and keeps me sharp.\n\nBootcamps are intended to jump-start you. So they'll walk you through database, server, and user interface - relatively quickly - so you have a reasonable understanding of how to build a complete application, even if you don't perfectly understand the languages, syntax, and tools being used. It's just a starting point.\n\nFor Vanilla JS, as is always recommended in this subreddit, [https://javascript.info/](https://javascript.info/) is the best, most modern, comprehensive, interactive tutorial. If you can get through part 1 (save part 2 and part 3 for later), you'll have a really good understanding of Vanilla JS, it's tools and it's syntax (depending on how well you learn, and how well you integrate what you learn).",

And as real professionals, though, we must find \"stomach\" to cope with the unenjoyable bits as well, at least in a professional manner.\n\nThere are certain types of programming that are enjoyable for some folk and not to others.

You have to learn what kind of programming or systems \"get you up in the morning\" as it were.\n\nBut if you don't enjoy programming ITSELF, then I'm not sure what can be done. There are always annoying parts to the craft, as well, but once you have done it for a while you know you can get \"to the goal\" and that is always a good feeling for me. \n\nFor example, if you don't understand how something works yet you need to understand, then that is annoying at first, but you know that you can eventually \"get it good enough\" to accomplish the task. Or, if you are in a greuiling debugging session then again it's frustrating, but with experience you know that you can either find the bug eventually (even if it's just one dumb typo) OR can find it or learn to find solutions to work around it if it is too elusive. \n\nIn any case, once you achieve these goals, it's ultimately going to trigger dopamine in the brain and will become addictive in a good way (basically a self-fulfilling positive cycle in psychology).

So you don't need to search for it. But you still need to traverse the *k*-1 preceding items to reach your target. That's the access runtime.\n\n\nAnd so on like that, for all the data structures that have access times listed on that website. But a hash table has no stable order. So there can be no cogent concept of \"accessing the *k*th element\". You have to search every time. (At least that's the argument for the N/A, I think!)",

To stick with your example, attempting to create your own Carousel module might seem tedious, but it might be great practice nonetheless. Understanding how it works in its core principle is important for you to be able to be able understand how somebody else's Carousel module has been implemented so you may be able to add such a package and implement it efficiently and as intended in future projects.\n\nThe order of importance is\n\n1. UNDERSTAND\n\n2. Import\n\n3. Adjust\n\nToo many freaking people skip step 1.

They buy their own lights so customer cost goes into the 650s-700s. \n\nSo it does get a bit crazy on the customers end.. since I've never seen this service offered and definitely not peer to peer I don't have any baseline though. \n\nGarage door opener is another big seller if they bought the lights I'll bundle in the door for 50 profit on my side, they see around 70$ additional charge. If they didn't starting is still 200. \n\nTemperature controls if above it bought I'll bundle it for 100 additional profit, this I know I should increase since people always have weird requests when it comes to temperature. Always gotta modify this one. \n\nThe watering feature is definitely under priced but people treat it as a novelty and walk away from the additional 160 even though that's only 100$ profit on my end.

        "body": "If you’re on Windows, just start with Cygwin; it’s very similar to a Linux, but it runs natively on WinAPI without blocking it from you. (Properly, it’s a POSIX operating environment.)\n\nMinGW comes with some of the same gunk, even forked from Cygwin, but gives you a much thinner shim around WinAPI, which ranges from irritating to miserable for beginners. (E.g., the Windows environment of the NT kernel—now the sole one AFAIK—has two separate subsystems, console and graphical, and they expose slightly different APIs and behaviors. Cygwin matches other Unixes in model and behavior, which means you can follow Unix tutorials, and if you’re careful with `LONG` vs. `long` you can probably follow some Windows ones too.)\n\nWSL2 is another option, but it’s stood off from Windows itself by a hypervisor, which means you don’t get good access to things inside the Linux domain from outside or vice versa.\n\nOtherwise, chances are you’re already on Unix. Apple’s Darwin (incl. OS/X→macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, etc. ad ridiculam) is in the FreeBSD family, which derives from Jolix which is a clean-room BSD/Net2 Unix. Linux wasn’t forked from anything, but its kernel tends more towards the AT\\&T family of Unixes culminating in System V, rev 4 (SVr4). Android is a variant of Linux using Bionic as libc and very little in the way of shell environment; desktop Linuxes tend to use the GNU libc and environment, of which Bash and GCC are also constituents.\n\nOn Android, you can install F-Droid and thereby Termux and Programmer’s Keyboard; immediately run `pkg update && pkg upgrade`, then you can install your preferred packages. Termux layers GNU onto Android, giving you a rough, subordinated desktop Linux environment.\n\nFor desktop Linux, I use Neon, which is an Ubuntu variant for KDE, which is my preferred windowing environment; Ubuntu is a vast family of Debian-based distributions, so pretty much anything major will do—Mint is supposed to be reasonably good, but you do you. Konsole (part of KDE, but runs anyway) is imo the best terminal available on Linux (also works for Cygwin and Win-per-se); open it up, start a [shell tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview), and you’re good.  If shit ever breaks, Ctrl+Alt+Fkey will usually drop you to a lower-level terminal, so monkeying is never far away.\n\nMost Unixes uses Bash for their interactive shell nowadays, though POSIX mandates certain characteristics for the baseline shell environment, and older systems tend to have their own, quirky Bourne shells. IIRC modern Linux tends to use Ash or Dash for POSIX and startup scripts via /bin/sh—Bash used to be used everywhere.\n\nFor editing, Kate (also KDE) is a very good GUI (MDI) editor for getting started with, but I strongly recommend you at least install Vim and start learning the basics, whether or not you use it for day-to-day work. It comes with a built-in tutorial, and it’s pretty straightforward to pick up. Very useful when you’re three ssh forwards deep, trying to resurrect a very custom, in-flight supercompute batch job, for example.\n\nSo that’s 1½ languages to start with, Bash and Vim.\n\nI’d probably start in on a C tutorial, also—prefer GCC or Clang; under no circumstances should you use MSVC for C or C++ unless you’re being paid to or have no choice in the matter. Also, I’d recommend staying away from full IDEs in general for just now, since you don’t need all the extra trappings. Build directly from command line, and try to engage directly with the terminal where it’s not counterpurpose. Get a feel for imperativeness.\n\nIIRC for Apple, you get a Clang-in-GNU’s clothing with XCode, but I don’t do their nonsense so that may have changed. XCode itself is a …fine editor, but probably overkill for your purposes—syntax highlighting will often not line up with what the compiler actually sees or does.\n\nOn Linux and Cygwin, you go through the usual package management tools for compilers, or build them yourself if feeling adventurous. `pkg install gcc` for Termux, `pkcon install gcc` for Neon, `apt-get install gcc` for Ubuntu, `yum install gcc` for RedHat, and Arch has its own, fancy mess.\n\nIf you install all the goodies—sometimes from separate foo-doc packages accompanying foo—you should have Bash `help` built-in command, a `man` command to acess manual pages (e.g., `man man` for man’s manpage), `whatis` and `apropos` to search for manpages, and `info` to browse the info manuals. (E.g., `man gcc` tells you how to run the `gcc` command, and `info gcc` tells you how to use it. /usr/share/doc may also have some goodies.)\n\nI recommend installing the POSIX manpages alongside native, where available, and bookmarking or downloading the 2001–2004, 2008–2018, and 2024 editions of the [POSIX standards](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/), which is what you aim for if you want your code to be portable to other OSes in the Unix family. (Links to prior versions at bottom of that index page—only 2001/12, 2008/09, and 2024/05 editions are recognizable from within the C-language build environment. You can also find 1988 and 1990 versions as FIPS-151-1 and FIPS-151-2, FWTW and FTTB.)\n\nIf you learn C, K\\&R’s *The C Programming Language,* 2ed (1988—not 1ed from 1978) is the usual approach vector, and you can easily find free copies to work from. It’s a bit out of date, but so is most C software, and you can push forwards from C89 pretty easily using the draft standards, or backwards using XPG, TCPL/1ed, and compiler manuals.\n\n[ISO WG14](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/projects.html) is presently in charge of the language (qua ISO/IEC 9899), so they produce standards docs that form the backbone of the language. The final drafts are effectively equivalent text for free, so they form the most portable layer undergirding the language, and then dialect extensions (e.g., GNU, MS), POSIX and X/Open, and other environmental stuff layers atop that. If you want to know whether something ought to be “legal” or not, start at the standard for your language version and then look at your compiler and ABI manuals for how the blanks are filled in.\n\nGood luck! I’d probably run through to pointers, then take a dip into assembly and come back, but delve however you like. Most of the system software is in C or C++, and if you’re on Linux, the source code is readily available to explore and play with, so you can reconstruct pretty much everything to your choosing.",

I hit it extremely hard with the job search and have only had two interviews first one for full-time junior dev, I bombed. Second one, was an internship at the same company, position got pulled because the current state of our economy. That really killed my motivation.\n\nAfter that I pretty much didn’t touch my laptop until about the middle of March, where there was the first local in person hackathon in my city. I signed up and started to get excited about programming again…and then extremely nervous, because up to that point I realized I got through the degree because the “thought process” & “project requirements” were given to me pretty much on a silver platter. With a mediocre grasp on the fundamentals and no real problem solving experience I didn’t want to look incompetent in front of people that were likely much younger and realistically more experienced than me. So, I went to roadmap.sh and started from the beginning with JavaScript. I got reacquainted with the basics and nuances and went to the event, I was in a group of 4, one took building out the frontend, ironically another guy was currently enrolled with WGU as well and he took the backend, the other was our pitch person and that left me as a floater to just help wherever I could. This was the absolute best position for me! the frontend was next.js/tailwind, backend was spring boot with a Postgres db. I remembered enough about the backend and how everything “worked” that I was able to help there anytime our backend guy got stuck or needed a break and was able to pickup right where he left off, having used typescript at WGU and refreshing my js knowledge I was able to figure out enough of next and tailwind to be helpful there too. This helped in a few ways. Building a fullstack app with stuff I hadn’t used and people I don’t even know in 48hrs showed me 1.) I knew more than I gave myself credit for and 2.) I’m capable and genuinely have a love for programming. \n\nWe lost but since then I have been steadily keeping detailed notes on project ideas that pop in my head at any given time, so I can work through how to actually get started building them and make it a point to spend the downtimes at work to study, listen and consume tech related things and then when I get home in the evenings even if it’s something as simple as writing a function that does something trivial or solving a problem on codewars, I try and code at least something everyday to make it habit. So far I’ve been able to stay pretty consistent with that. \n\nNow that WGU has MSCS programs I’m planning to enroll for that to give me a tangible goal and something to work towards since I doubt the job market is going to turn around anytime soon and I want to gain additional skills in a structured way.\n\nI know most of the advice floating around is to network, grind leetcode, move cities, etc, but for some of us that isn’t a possibility at the moment and I say find some way for you that makes you excited to get home and build that project or learn that tech stack or concept and keep getting better a little at a time until you finally get the opportunity to make the career change!",

Looks amazing on a resume if you contribute to open source software as well. \n\nBuild larger more complicated applications and Contribute to open source are my main suggestions.\n\nI’ve noticed a lot of places now really want you to have schooling. Long gone are the days where people truly don’t care if you have a degree or not. Especially in this market as a junior. But not everybody can go get schooling that easily. If you’re one of those people then I suggest taking a couple Google courses and get yourself a google certification. They look amazing on resumes.\n\nCreate yourself a LinkedIn page and start networking! There is literally nothing more important than networking in this market. Goto hackathons, tech events in your area, post on linkedin and talk with recruiters etc… \n\nHave all your code public on github.\n\nAnd if you’re serious about perusing a job in this market as a junior make sure you can code without AI and code with AI (not vibe coding but using it as a tool to speed up your development)",

        "body": "From the [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/ranges-indexes):\n\n>A range specifies the start and end of a range. The start of the range is inclusive, but the end of the range is exclusive, meaning the start is included in the range but the end isn't included in the range. The range \\[0..\\^0\\] represents the entire range, just as \\[0..sequence.Length\\] represents the entire range.\n\n[A comment](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54092520) on stack overflow contains some sorta lost info on how this came to be:\n\n>We decided to follow Python when it comes to the from-beginning and from-end arithmetic. 0 designates the first element (as always), and \\^0 the “length’th” element, i.e. the one right off the end. That way you get a simple relationship, where an element's position from beginning plus its position from end equals the length. the x in \\^x is what you would have subtracted from the length if you’d done the math yourself.\n\n>Why not use the minus (-) instead of the new hat (\\^) operator? This primarily has to do with ranges. **Again in keeping with Python and most of the industry, we want our ranges to be inclusive at the beginning, exclusive at the end.** What is the index you pass to say that a range should go all the way to the end? In C# the answer is simple: x..\\^0 goes from x to the end. In Python, there is no explicit index you can give: -0 doesn’t work, because it is equal to 0, the first element! So in Python, you have to leave the end index off completely to express a range that goes to the end: x... If the end of the range is computed, then you need to remember to have special logic in case it comes out to 0. As in x..-y, where y was computed and came out to 0. This is a common nuisance and source of bugs.\n\n>Finally, note that indices and ranges are first class types in .NET/C#. Their behavior is not tied to what they are applied to, or even to be used in an indexer. You can totally define your own indexer that takes Index and another one that takes Range – and we’re going to add such indexers to e.g. Span. But you can also have methods that take ranges, for instance.",

        "body": "TypeScript will not fix JavaScript's shortcomings as a weakly typed language, because it doesn't make JavaScript into a strongly typed language any more than, say... data validation.\n\nTo me it's a linter with lots of DevEx overhead, that makes projects much better for both solo or collaboration. Once you learned TypeScript, you also get used to have a lot of guardrails, and there's no reason to go back to coding without those guardrails as you'll encounter issues at runtime (in the browser console) that will require you to debug more lines of code. \n\nIt's not a shortcoming for JS, because for a senior JS developer it's part of the job to keep a tight ship, code linearity and easily readable unit tests (see examples of Express in JS), but for someone learning: choose TypeScript as long as it is an option (almost always is nowadays).\n\nI even believe that frontend needs TS more than backend, because it's harder to structure frontend for code linearity when you have more important hierarchies such as layouts, components, events, async effects, the DOM... The logic is being called from potentially many different places and it's harder to enforce type consistency everywhere \"by hand\".",

Roughly coming up to 5 years of experience. I went from retail sales to tech (I work for a financial institution, American company but in London). Salary is great, lifestyle is balanced, and you learn a lot. But boy oh boy, you have to dumb a lot of the stuff you learn. It's incredibly hard not having a CS degree to stay focused, a lot of the basics DSA you won't have heard of just because you followed a Udemy course etc. You really have to learn a lot of it, I'm 5 years in and still learn fundamental stuff once in a while. Thankfully with DevOps, it's less coding atm so I can spend some time coding on the side outside work. I do mostly terraform with AWS atm, and use other tools like Docker, K8s, etc. You learn a lot on the job, and I mean A LOT. Thankfully, I have a very very good team who is about developing engineers. I won't be a CTO in my lifetime but idc, I'm an engineer and I want to solve stuff. \n\nI would say do not do a bootcamp, you learn web dev mostly, you skip out on important stuff like BigO, DSA etc. plus, don't enjoy web Dev as much anyways\n\nDo self taught mostly, I used to research what modules get taught at university for CS degrees, and focus on those modules for a while. Definitely helped more (I took a bootcamp from Makers in the UK)",

Two weeks ago I got two offers and and accepted one as a Software Engineer without any professional experience. Here's the route I took:\n\n2 year technical college. This got me exposure to more programming concepts, experience working on a small team, and a small portfolio of a wide range of applications to pad out my resume without costing a fortune. The applications I ended up with werent fancy, but I put more work into them than I needed to and really tried to experiment where it was allowed.\n\nAfter graduating I started working on personal projects in my free time. I set up a homelab server to learn more about networking and security, and made some small applications that made my life easier both at home and at work. A few of my software solutions got adopted by my company for widespread use. I had fun doing these, but more importantly I was able to replace a lot of the academic work on my resume with these, and it gave me talking points when doing interviews.\n\nI'm not sure if I've just been lucky or not, but I haven't had to do any leetcode in any of my interviews. They have been way more interested in talking about the solutions I made, and the impact they've had. I spent a lot more time practicing talking points, terminology, and having a professional conversation because I'm bad at interviews. In the end I believe this helped set me apart, and I highly recommend spending some time explaining parts of your projects to someone (or even just to an AI).\n\nWhen you do start applying places, spend some time customizing each application for the job  You'd be surprised how many people don't. Also, it helps to format any examples you give in STAR format. Some say it's outdated, but it helps keep things consice while effectively conveying impact.\n\nThe market sucks, but some things don't change. The jobs are still out there, and the people that put in the extra work still stand out. Don't be in a rush, make sure the jobs you interview for are a good fit for you. Hopefully something in here helps you on your journey. Good luck!",

There is also Unity which mainly uses C# and Godot which uses GDScript which is essentially python.

If you do I would suggest looking up games that are similar to your idea first and take note of which game engines such games use. \n\n\nAfter that you can compare these game engines by how easy they are to use, how hard is the language they require to know, is the price for your budget etc. \n\n\nThen you can learn the basics of the language of your engine on platforms like Coursera, Udemy etc. You most likely won't be ready to make your game immediately after that, so watching tutorials/ courses on how to develop games (especially the kind of game you want to make) with your specific engine can be the next step.\n\n\nThis would be a time-efficient approach if you already have an idea. And once you learn a language, learning a new one is quite easy so if you want you can move onto a new engine in the future without too much struggle, as well. Good luck",

I’m sorry OP..I will echo one of the responders you might be better off seeking some vocational training at a community college over trying to mess with bootcamps…there’s less stigma during hiring with AS Degrees.\n\nJust know without a full blown CS degree the going will be tough and we are currently in the most junior unfriendly hiring market I have ever seen in my 11 years of working in this field. Literally no one is looking for junior devs right now and it’s sad…because there is in fact a shortage of GOOD senior level and mid level devs and engineers BUT in order to get fresh talent we have to train the new incoming juniors…no one wants to do that right now though.",

        "body": "I thought I knew the answer, but apparently I was rather off.  Here is Claude's response\n\nI'll explain how physical memory is partitioned into blocks for contiguous memory allocation in operating systems.\n\nIn contiguous memory allocation, physical memory is divided into fixed-size blocks or variable-size partitions that can be allocated to processes. Here's how it works:\n\nPhysical memory is organized into addressable units (typically bytes), and the operating system manages this space by dividing it into partitions or blocks. When processes request memory, the OS allocates these blocks based on specific strategies.\n\nThere are several approaches to partitioning memory:\n\n1. Fixed partitioning: Memory is divided into fixed-size blocks (like your example of 10 MB chunks). Each partition can hold exactly one process, even if the process doesn't need all the allocated space, which can lead to internal fragmentation.\n\n2. Variable partitioning: Memory is allocated exactly as requested by processes, resulting in variable-sized partitions. This reduces internal fragmentation but can lead to external fragmentation as processes terminate and free memory becomes scattered.\n\nFor allocation, the operating system maintains data structures (typically tables) that track:\n- Which blocks are allocated or free\n- The size of each block\n- The process using each allocated block\n\nWhen a process requests memory, the OS uses allocation algorithms such as:\n- First-fit: Allocate the first available block that's large enough\n- Best-fit: Allocate the smallest available block that's large enough\n- Worst-fit: Allocate the largest available block\n\nThe actual implementation involves memory management units (MMUs) that translate logical addresses (used by processes) to physical addresses. These hardware components, along with operating system tables, handle the mapping between a process's address space and physical memory blocks.\n\nModern systems use more sophisticated approaches like paging and segmentation rather than contiguous allocation, as they address many of the fragmentation issues. ",

If you're changing the oil in your car, you don't want to make an oil filter by hand, they are an off the rack standard component. Same with coding, things that are used all the time can be made into libraries so you can just get them off the rack and use them, rather than making them by hand. To know if a library exists for what you're looking for, do a search online or ask people experienced with Python or whatever language you're learning (after doing your own search).",

        "body": "If you want to know \"how Docker works\", that can really be broken down into two separate questions:\n\n1. What Linux kernel features do you use, and how do you use them, to get the behaviors that we call \"containerization\"?\n2. How is the Docker software organized and architected to use those features?\n\nI think question 1 is the more relevant one for what you're asking. [Part 8 of this presentation](https://container.training/intro-selfpaced.yml.html) (the \"Deep dive into container internals\" section) is the best self-contained overview that I know of. For more details, a good starting point would be to read all of the Linux kernel documentation and manpages about cgroups, namespaces, chroot, etc.\n\nThe short version is: the Unix permission system has always provided some basic ability to \"isolate\" processes from each other, e.g. a process belonging to UID can't kill another process with a different UID. This is just enforced by the kernel doing permission checks on the appropriate syscalls. A more interesting example is the `chroot` syscall, which tells the kernel to change the \"apparent\" root directory for a process, so that it can't see or modify any files outside that root. Containerization is just \"chroot on steroids\" by telling the kernel to isolate process groups in various ways.\n\nBeyond that, the \"sharing\" of the kernel works in pretty much the same way that it does without containerization. When a process asks for memory, or the scheduler decides which process to run in a given time slice, the kernel makes the same kind of decision it always does -- except that it keeps track of some extra accounting information to enforce fairness and resource limits between \"containers\".\n\nQuestion 2 is a bit less technically interesting, but still somewhat important because it's useful to know where to look for the relevant source code if you really want to dig into the implementation. For instance, when you run a \"Docker container\", Docker is delegating the work to containerd, and containerd is invoking runc to actually start the container. So runc is where the actual relevant syscalls are made. You can see an overview of *what* runc is doing [here](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/main/libcontainer/SPEC.md), and you can find more details of how it interacts with the rest of the system by reading the [OCI Runtime Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/v1.2.1/spec.md).",

Team member use that script to initialize their development databases, and when database design changes, you update the SQL script and notify team members that they need to update their databases to match.\n\nIf you have no given requirements for this project, I suppose you can invent your own. I'd recommend keeping it fairly simple.",

On the other hand if they’re the type to mix in Hindi or something and shift without realizing they’re doing it, you’re fucked and need to explicitly say you’re having trouble understanding them. Usually - especially if you’re the only non Indian - they don’t even realize there’s an issue. I’ve had to do this a couple times in the past and ask them to stick with English and annunciate a bit clearer and they did make a concerted effort which helped a ton. Just be polite and have a tone like a request for help rather than an accusation and you should be ok. \n\nStuff that can be jarring for native English speakers vs Indian English - \n\n- pauses at weird points mid sentence and sometimes multiple times per sentence\n\n- rising tones like asking a question but during a statement or other part of a sentence\n\n- dropped words (your brain will autocomplete the sentence anyway once you get used to whoever you’re working with) \n\n- certain phrases (do the needful being one of the most infamous) and words (definitely, certainly, surely, etc pop up frequently) that you will soon realize are far more vague than they imply. For example the “definitely” does not mean definitely, it can often be said as a “yeah yeah whatever” vibe\n\n- sometimes questions are phrased more like demands, but just know that usually it’s still a request and no offense is intended. It can come off as a bit aggressive though. (Ie “you will do XYZ for me”)(paraphrased a bit). \n\nI dunno maybe others here can add to this list for OP to adapt faster.",

The idea that you could cut comp by 50% and increase workload by 50% without a mass exodus is pretty disconnected from how labor markets actually work. Engineers aren't stuck in one company or even one industry. Talent moves. Fast.\n\nTech compensation is high because demand is high, the skillset is hard to build and maintain, and the impact on business is massive. If one company decides to nerf pay and crank up workload, that’s a gift to their competitors. Good devs won’t just stick around out of loyalty or passion; they’ll walk. Even the \"not-so-passionate\" ones are often very competent, and they know their market value.\n\nCould there be some cooling in salaries over time? Sure, especially as markets mature or we hit saturation in certain roles. But some exec \"overheard\" saying they want to halve pay and work people harder isn’t a signal of an imminent industry collapse, it’s a signal they’re going to lose talent fast if they try.\n\nSo yeah, I'd still code if unicorns were real. But if you're banking on market-wide comp dropping because of wishful exec thinking, you're betting on unicorns *and* leprechauns.",

An employee has to do what the employer requires, or the employer is free to fire them. Writing that a job is remote can trigger some legal protections for how much notice they must give you to change your work location, but any employer can change your work location as long as the proper notice period is given.

(It is worth asking the question: you've done some of it, do you enjoy doing it at all?)\n\nGet signed up for whatever affordable coverage you can and go find a therapist that has a background in depression, addiction, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT.\n\nIf you really don't know where to start, go to a Gambling Addictions Anonymous meeting. You don't have to buy into it all the way. It will give you a place to say your piece, as well as talk to people who have gone through similar things, de-stigmatizing the shame.\n\nPeople are saying quit trading and gambling. You should, but I am going to tell you that is a *symptom* of the cause, because waiting years to try and get a job after getting a degree, or not applying yourself to available skill learning resources (you literally have to not look for them) indicates that your problems lies in fundamental motivation, and is likely co-incident with other mental illness. \n\nYou need to fix that first, or at least find a sustainable coping strategy or short term medication assistance, because everything you've described (switching from what sounds like hardcore imposter syndrome pivoting to high risk, low reward strategies as the first shift you've described) points to the problem not being your ability to learn, but in fact, something emotional you're not dealing with that is impairing your ability to deal with your problems, which are not compounding (and not just like the interest on debt).\n\nThis stuff is worth figuring out and you are not hopeless, you're just mostly avoiding doing this, because I highly doubt I am the first person to say this to you, but in case I am. Stop reading this, and go do that immediately. \n\nCan't do it right now? Write it on a note and put it on your bathroom mirror or refrigerator. Somewhere you can't ignore. Just do what it takes to deal with this. If you actually do nothing about it, nobody will care about your suffering. Why do I say this? Because everything I have seen you write indicates an immaturity in dealing with the consequences of your own actions. You need to own that first, and you need to help yourself. Because you have created problems that will take years to solve, and you have to be the one to do it. The upside is you will feel better when you actually start doing working on it. Congratulations on making it this far, and good luck.",

That's a very important part of building up the same familiarity as you have. It's known that tickets are going to take longer when given to me, because I don't have all the context everyone has. What might be a 1 liner to you, could be days of digging through code, running the app locally, and building up the context around the issue before I can finally land on that one line.\n\nIf I'm just handed answers, I'll never be able to develop those skills or that context myself, so I'll never get to your level.\n\nGenerally the way mentorship goes is you should treat it as pair programming, and *guide* them towards the solution. As opposed to giving them answers, or even lecturing / dumping similar solutions on them.\n\nIf the change is as easy as you say, it should be super easy to sit with this dev for an hour and arrive at the solution together. Let them flounder a little and explain their thought process to you, if they get stuck, ask leading questions that nudges them in the right direction. Try to teach them *your process*, as opposed to the answer. The key is you want *them* to solve it, not you. You just want to be their safety net that helps them reach that point.\n\nA simple \"Hey, how's X going? Wanna pair up today and see if I can be any help?\" goes a long way.\n\nSometimes the answer to \"how's it going\" might be \"Oh I already fixed it I think, I was just working on figuring out how to test / add unit tests / open a PR / etc\". Really this is stuff that should be coming out in standup so you can reach out before it's been a full 4 days when you notice they're not making any progress... but it sounds like yall either aren't doing standup or this dev isn't providing accurate updates.\n\nAs others have said this stuff was easier in the office. For whatever reason there's a tougher barrier to break to send someone a DM, as opposed to just casually walking past their cubicle and asking \"How's it going?\".",

When working remote you tend to be a bit more siloed so you need to be much more deliberate with your teamwork and collaboration efforts.

From first hand experience, NVIDIA has excellent culture and a strong hiring pipeline for interns, and we're doing lots of cool work in ML depending on team. Meta is probably also a good one if you want to be doing cutting edge ML work. I don't think you can go wrong with either NVIDIA or Meta.\n\n\nEdit: for more context, a SWE at NVIDIA working on ML is more likely to be inside the guts of a model, figuring out how to optimize its throughput or latency. A MLE at Meta is more likely to be applying ML to solve a business problem. So it depends on which part of the problem you want to work on.",

It's true, but it was bad timing and I certainly didn't intend for it to go this long.\n\nI've taken some short contract/freelance work over these years.\n\nI embellish both of those things to make them bigger than they are.\n\nThe bad market is helpful in that regard, because it's pretty easy to say that the freelance is uninteresting work just to pay the bills, and it's taking longer than I hoped to find the right full time gig. Emphasis on \"the right\" gig. I imply that I am being selective, not rejected.\n\nReality is somewhere between. I am being selective. I don't want to work somewhere shitty, and I still have ample savings. I am working, but not as much as I want to be.\n\nPart of why it's been so long is I am not \"grinding\" applications. I've done some traveling. I've done some grinding. I am at the point where I'm getting more serious, though, as it has been much longer than I expected.\n\nMy resume doesn't have a gap, but I have found response rates for initial interviews to be pretty abysmal. Better as of late, though, but I often wonder if I should just accept the gap and remove the freelance from my resume. Some companies have indicated in conversations that it can make them wary of whether or not I want a full time position.",

The truth was that I was still applying to jobs pretty consistently and getting rejected or ghosted, but to be fair, some of those were definitely due to companies having layoffs and no longer hiring for the position. Also, the personal hobby I was the most focused on was building my wedding photography business, which I didn't share with recruiters bc I didn't want them thinking it might get in the way of being a dedicated full-time employee.\n\nEdited to add: I'd also sometimes talk about how I wasn't in a huge rush to get back into the job market and was just keeping an eye out for the Right Opportunity.",

For one, the industry at that time was MUCH smaller then, than it is now. That burst then probably was the worst thing the tiny industry has ever seen. Only about 8% of the global population in 2001 had any access to internet. Now, in 2025 from what I can find 68% of the population has access to the internet. Even with all this uncertainty now, startups are popping up all the time, massive salaries are still being paid. There are more students and comp sci graduates now than there ever was before, making the modern market much more competitive. This is also a global market now, plenty of overseas engineers all vying for the same roles. Offshoring is a big one too. But, still companies are hiring, just not juniors.",

Companies like Tesla today that are very hype driven still bring in billions of dollars of revenue each year. A lot of people genuinely believed the internet was a failed fad, that software was, at best, a boring thing banks used that had no growth potential.\n\nSince then, the industry has grown in size tremendously. In absolute numbers, more people are impacted by layoffs today. But businesses are not folding left and right like back then. The job market is slow. There have been many layoffs, but there are still millions employed in the industry. Pay is still higher relative to other jobs than it was back then. There's certainly no sense that the internet was a fad, or tech is going away entirely.",

The codebase wasnt easy but it was a pretty chill job and i got paid somewhat well (80k starting off) and for working 20 hours was a top performer. I decided to try out faang and the last 3 years was very stressful. I just couldnt understand the codebase and how things connected. J wasnt a great communicator either and struggled to find the right resources for help. The job was very demanding. I got fired this year due to low perforamance. I made sure to get a new job that would be more in line with having good work life balance ans not be so demanding. Even if it meant i had to take less. Im currently working for a new job and it seems it wont be too demanding so far. \n\nThe first thing they told me was “if you want to be the guy who works 40 hours and gets your task done. You can have a long career here. If you want to prioritize getting promoted quickly and working a bit extra. We just advise you respect your work life balance.”\n\nEdit: just to add. I think if you found something that was more chill, even if the pay was a but less or the benefits werent the best, you should do it.",

I used documentations, internet and AI to complete the task. \n\nAfter that submission got cleared and a follow up was arranged I had near 2 hours with 2 engineers going over all details of my submission. Ran the project locally and they asked me key performance and functionality questions. We discussed the shortcomings of my submission and what I could have done better… totally open conversation with many back and forth exchanges. Impossible to fake if you haven’t done the work or used AI without understanding. This is where they actually verify it all. \n\nHaving done these interviews I always left with the confidence that these guys know what they’re doing, and that I was respected as an adult. Not surprisingly, working with them has been a similar experience. \n\nI spend more time finding these companies than actual interviews. It’s not easy to come across such companies which also have great compensation and interesting projects so I have very specific set of questions to narrow down at the initial interview.

It takes a lot of effort. Anyone can do it but the vast majority of people don’t like it enough to study it constantly for years until they get paid to do it. If you drop everything, quit your job, and study, you should be prepared to invest a lot of time.\n\nThe market isn’t the best right now. Not as bad as some say but it’s definitely not great. Out of my graduating cohort of like 50 students, I think maybe 10 percent are working as software engineers.

There are exceptions, but knowing your stuff will often get you to a sensible result faster in the scope of the interview. You need to be able to coherently explain and reason about your code, why you're taking one approach instead of another. Using AI in an interview doesn't pair well with this. It also gives me less signal as an interviewer.\n\nAll this to say, when you're ready to start your job search, you should be doubling down on fundamentals, Leetcode and upskilling on things like React/whatever framework you're rusty with. Using AI on the job is one thing, but imo you should be focused on fundamentals and interview prep in the short term.\n\nOnce you have a job, then worry about how you'll use AI to work faster and better.",

They're the responsibility of management.\n\nWe're IC's, we're responsible for doing the best work we can during our 40 hour work week. It doesn't matter if we get assigned 20 peoples-worth of responsibility. All that means is we will work to prioritize, and accurately communicate progress and ***timelines*** (independent of \"deadlines\") spread across 1 persons-worth of work weeks. That's how the exchange of labor works. Don't scale your hours.\n\nManagement has tools in their toolbelt to account for at-risk deadlines. It's literally project management 101, shit interns learn, shit that's like on page 1 of any sort of guide to PM. They can dial back scope, they can hire more resources, or they can push back the deadline.\n\nForcing their resources to work more than 40 hours isn't a (healthy) option. But if the SWE's *let them*, they'd be crazy to not take advantage of it. So don't let them. Work your 40 hours. Communicate everything based on those 40 hours. \"We need it done by X\" doesn't matter, because based on your 40 hour work week your job is to communicate the *realistic* estimate. \"Ok... well if I drop A, B, C, D, E, and F, I can get G done by X\", or \"If we take an MVP approach and get rid of H, I, J,  and K requirements we can get the MVP done by X\".\n\nEverything you're describing is a failure of management, not of you. Deadlines, staffing, prioritization, scope, etc. It's all in *their* job description. Will your management like you establishing and sticking to your professional boundaries?\n\nProbably not. But you know what their options are? Fire you, and set their timeline back by *bare minimum* another 6-12 months across the board (probably more). Does that sound like a smart option? Call their bluff.\n\nPut in your 40, be realistic, be communicative, don't fall victim to \"deadlines\", and if your management ignores your very reasonable professional boundaries, start looking for another job. The market being bad doesn't change any of this.",

Ex. if you make $80,000 and want to make $100,000 tell them you want to make $100,000 to $160,000 (arbitrary ceiling chosen but give yourself a nice range) rather than you make $80,000. I don't think it's unreasonable to give SOME number, if your number is TOO low then it's possible you should have bolstered your position by understanding the market better (to be fair, sometimes difficult to do).\n\nHowever third-party recruiters don't just have the incentive to match you to multiple companies, they have the incentive to match you ASAP. That means if they're going to companies, they may be getting the cheapest offer just to line you up with a few offers and have you choose (if you are presented with 3 offers ranging from $85k to $95k it may also give the impression that is all companies in your area are willing to pay and cause you to commit early). This isn't always the case, but if you get a lazy recruiter, this is more likely.\n\nIf you give them a target, they will more likely hunt against that target, in which case you're aligning their goals (getting you matched) with your goal (getting you matched at your target) which I think saves everyone some time in the long run (companies for whom you are out of their league won't bother, companies who are willing to pay more may be more inclined to be more competitive).\n\nHope that provides some clarity.\n\nEDIT: I also generally don't like advice to never give a number, I think that's just lazy on the part of the candidate and can be wasteful of the time of the recruiter if they're following leads you would already know are not worth your time. Knowing approximately where you stand saves everyone time and makes you better positioned in the hunt.",

I think you just brushed this off, but it sounds like you feel the need to constantly validate and confirm your worth due to insecurity.  Hopefully it should go away once you get some experience under your belt, or if your priority in life changes(such as getting a partner, getting married, starting a family, etc.).\n\nNot every successful engineer becomes an icon in the tech world, a social media influencer, or even a revered name that is whispered among their peers.  While some become celebrities in their own domains, others prefer a life of quiet anonymity. \n\n> But digging deeper, that desire doesn’t feel purely ego-driven. In tech, career advancement almost entirely depends on perception. Recruiters scan for brand names. Managers reward visibility. Friends decide whether you’re worth a referral. Your market worth is defined by what others think, not by what you think you’re worth.\n\nThis is because you surround yourself with people who believe in this and actively participate in this grind.

It reads either as very self-conscious or very braggy, neither of which are good things for people to think about you. \n\nStrongly preferring a big brand like FAANG or a major scale-up over f500 or a small startup is just rational career planning.

Software isn't a game we play for a day and can take big injuries, but a game we play week after week for years. For you, it doesn't sound like you are in a sustainable work environment -- you'll ever suffer some major health consequences then lose your job, or lose your job a little bit sooner and be back home.\n\nTherefore, I'd figure out what you need from your work to start getting on top of your health: maybe that's medical leave, or it could be an accommodation like more WFH. Then, tell HR what you need, with the right documentation, and let them decide. They don't really need to know the details of your condition, just that you are asking for certain things that are medically required. You might a little screwed right now, but if you lose a finger (or more), you'll be dealing with that consequence for the rest of your career.\n\nYou're already on your way out of the company: that's what it means when your manager is forced to PIP you, it's a pretext for planned turnover, and it's very likely that no matter what you do, the manager will be forced to make another decision they might not agree with, since this is already going on at the company. I'd weight that pretty heavily in planning on what to do next.\n\nAlso, you gave a small tell that your performance probably isn't as good as is expected or you might be misreading the situation: \"This was shocking, since one of those leads had publicly praised my work before, even in front of my current manager\". This complaint is common in a few people I've had to coach for not meeting expecations, and it's difficult for them to understand that praise of a single task, or doing one thing well, doesn't equate to broadly meeting expectations. IMO, it says there's a blind spot in your understanding of where you fit into the workplace, and therefore I'd encourage you to sit down 1v1 with the lead and get their opinion on whether or not you're on track, or what else you could do.",

There would be real concern that you're flaky.  I know one of them is a contract role, but unfortunately it's a common white lie these days for a short stint.  Additionally for your current role, some of your accomplishments are tough to believe simply because of how little time it's been.

Like when you said you used WebSockets you didn't say which language you programmed in. I would list everything packages, library, programming languages or whatever used on any given project. It bloats the resume, but no human is going to read it. You just want to cram in keywords. Even some jobs ask for \"git\" experience and I just assume that is a given and don't list it, but I do \"managed projects with git\" dur. Even when it seems redundant like you used Java at your last two companies, get that keyword in there at each company.\n\nAlso, it may just be me, but I find a lot of companies don't give a shit about \"non-professional' experience, projects don't get any weight. They will explicitly say so in job descriptions (X years of professional experience with Y). Or recruiters or managers will appear kind of disappointed when you admit you know something from a personal project.\n\nAnd also, you can just lie. A find a lot of companies rarely check you on the skills you know, if you know you can pick it up easily, they won't know the difference once you're on the job. A lot of requirements are written by managers who think you need 5 years with git or else you don't know it at all. And like what I mentioned about projects above, you can just say you did that at your job rather than as a side project.\n\nAnyway getting your foot in the door is hard, I got my first job by referral from a relative. And it's probably even harder with the economy contracting. But I started my career at the start of the great recession, so there's some hope it's not as bad as that.",

Recruiters and interviewers don't want to read a huge amount, particularly for a junior, and just look for keywords.  AI can help make things briefer - just make sure you double-check what it produces. Some of the tools you used there can just be listed and probably don't need to be in a sentence.\n\nAlso, I have little idea about what you actually worked on.  Seems almost like buzz words in both the companies and the projects.  That could use a slightly clearer explanation at the reduction of other things (as mentioned above).  Think of how you would explain it to your mum/dad or a 6 year old.  Many recruiters aren't technical, and even engineers don't know every field.\n\nFor skills you list tools but are there any interesting algorithms or patterns you know?\n\nHaving only a couple of months and then looking for a new role can be something recruiters occasionally pass due to being risk-adverse. They don't give you a chance to explain.  However, having some experience is better than none.  If you can hang in at your current company long enough, then it'll start to look better.\n\nAny awards, papers etc...?\n\nKeeping it at one page is good.",

Getting good working on legacy systems is its own skill set and provides a lot of job security and opportunity if you are.\n\nBut the first question is what is the leaderships understanding and support to make the situation better? Are they receptive to tactical investments in tech debt? \n\nAnd second question is do you have the appropriate technical lead to help drive a vision and technical plan to dig out of the hole? This is hard and many are not cut for it, preferring to create plans to burn it all down for something new. \n\nLastly, I hate to say, but just wanting to be a mundane ticket taker is neither good or fun for you long term.

Cert won't get any jobs but has a small chance of getting you to the interview stage and helping you with a design problem. Master's in Data Science is a worthless degree. A Master's in CS is useless except either **a)** you can land a paid internship and co-op in CS to reset yourself **b)** reset a long work gap where you feel recruiters are discriminating **c)** you don't actually learn CS with the CS degree or work experience\n\nDoing QA work and deployments, it's more or less a dying job for Americans and has been so for years. Why Cognizant does it, was POS IBM where I was. Newer trend is make the developers do the tester job as well for the same pay. All of a sudden I was coding and deploying my own code with responsibility for all levels of testing. Violates segregation of duty and forces me on 45-50 hours weeks but saves the man money.\n\nIf you still want to go this route and build on your work experience, yeah the cert is probably okay and degree probably works the same way in that it's a calculated risk. Less a risk if the degree is fully funded. You can do Multivariate Calculus. The shock value ended in Calc II. Nice part is taking the derivative of one variable, you treat the other variable as a constant and it doesn't matter what order you take derivatives in.",

So my intent in pursuing these is just for learning something fruitful, then I can hopefully build my own projects to show some competency on my own.\n\nI hear what you're saying about the Data Science Master's, it isn't much on its own and actual experience matters. But I can't get a job without experience, and I can't get experience without a job, as the saying goes, so that's why I considered this. Rutgers also offers a Master's in Business and Science which combines data analytics and business courses, but having to fund it myself, fully or partially, I dunno I just don't want to bother with school again, now that I think about it more. Also for calculus, I haven't touched it in well over 5 years, neither at work nor school, basically forgot everything, so that's why I am so hesitant about that part.\n\nCompanies expecting people to be a jack-of-all-trades just so they can save money is an irritating trend. If I were a greedy CEO I'd probably understand, but as someone who just wants enough of a salary to live comfortably, it gets on my nerves. But that's how this field is, the ones who are willing to adapt in the race to the bottom will succeed.\n\nI'll stick with the self-learning path then, for now. It's the most doable at this point.",

I was told by someone in the company that investigations had been done on hiring bias as well as some people were even turned down because the people they had interviewing thought someone with an unattractive appearance might not be a good fit for the client.  \n\nNo training on hiring or evaluating, but I wasn't interviewing for that position.  I just took it not because I wanted it, but because I was 3 days away from being laid off due to bench expiration, so it allowed me to get a paycheck still.  \n\nFortunately for me, I actually was rather good at it, as I had been a teacher before and know how to evaluate and ask higher order thinking questions, so I did a hierarchy starting with basic easy questions, and then questions such as walk me through how you would design a Spring Boot service given a specific need, and even if they didn't do it the way I would, I'd at least know they knew what they were doing. \n\nHowever, if I didn't put any thought into it, I could have been like the others and just did a google search for common interview questions.   Very few of the candidates knew the first thing about what Spring Boot does or how to make a React component.  We were mostly campus hires that were hired just for having heard of stuff before, and training was canceled early due the company cutting funding, so it was everyone fend for themselves for a year watching Udemy and doing our own stuff.",

I've also never heard of a company asking HR about \"reason for leaving\", I *really* doubt HR would be willing to answer that even if they knew.

In no world is HR going to respond to a background check saying \"Yeah, pinkbutterfly22 was great, but they didn't fill out their exit survey so we wouldn't recommend you hire them\". HR is going to strictly say \"pinkbutterfly22 worked as a SWE from X to Y\".\n\nI personally don't tell the company where I'm going, or even the real reason of why I'm leaving.

From their perspective, as long as you were decent to work with, and you put in your 2 weeks notice, no bridge is burnt. That's all you're really obligated to do. If you think your colleagues that you hated wouldn't give you a reference... don't ask. Only ask for references from people that you know will say good things about you.",

Once you know one moving to others isn't hard.

Popular techstacks were Nodejs, PHP, Java, and C# with Nodejs being the most dominant among new grads like 5 to 10 times higher than usual (I asked my cs friends from colleges/universities all over the city and they all confirmed this) while PHP was treated like a second class citizen even though positions were just as much as for all of them. Unpopular ones were Python and Ruby: I'm talking about like just 4 or 5 postings per month.\n\nSo I had a decision to make, should I compete in popular techstacks knowing that there would be more jobs to apply but the competition would also be crazy or should I choose a less popular one knowing that there would be only a handful of jobs to apply and only a handful to compete against? I picked the latter, learnt both Python and Ruby, and landed my first role after 3 months.\n\nNiche stacks have served me really well and now I'm even more invested in them. At my previous and current company, I've got the chance to add Golang and Elixir to my resume too. So now basically I have to maintain the knowledge of 4 stacks knowing that the amount of jobs I can apply to won't even compare to many of friends who have experience with only Java or Nodejs. For the current company, I've been more involved with the hiring process and the amount of Python/Ruby devs are still very few and far between. I guess the upside is that I know for sure I don't have to worry much about unemployment anymore. Take this as an anecdote, it might not applicable to your situation, nonetheless, good luck out there!",

People have different risk tolerances and it is a different market, but imo if you're reasonable about it \"worst they can say is no\" still applies and they won't usually pull an offer. \n\n\nAnecdote; my current job I started 6 years ago and when I was offered I told them I was in process of interviewing with Amazon but overall more excited about this role. Asked politely if they could bump my offer. I got around $20k a year extra on stock. Amazon ended up down leveling me and came in something like $50k lower per year so was no brainer in the end. This was with 2yoe so wasn't super experienced or anything. \n\n\nThat \"hey thanks, money please\" conversation took like 15 minutes and amounted to probably > $100k in returns. Just saying ",

Had pretty bad undergrad gpa from some earlier years (I left and returned to college 3 years later) at a really low ranked college, but still wanted to do my PhD at T50. I couldn't qualify for a lot of internships because of GPA requirements, but with a masters I could since it would just go off that GPA. I also wanted to work some a federal job. \n\nSo doing my masters now at school T100 school with a 4.0 and currently in the interview process for a job with my dream federal agency where if I get I'll start at GS-7 (56k) and once I finish my masters I'll go to GS-9 (69k). The hiring manager actually seemed interested cause AI is designated as mission critical for the US government and my concentration for my masters is AI/ML. I guess with the lower pay and it being several hours from a large metro that it's harder to find young workers. Plus they said they'd help me get my PhD if I got the job which would put me at GS-11 for 84k.\n\nIf it would actually be needed for the path you want to follow then go for it.

I always said if I found a job that really has impact like that then I'd actually be happy going into work. Something to benefit animals and people less fortunate, something that'd be beneficial to the environment.\n\nMaterial Science, Chemical Engineering, Physics, Math, etc. are all going to be about finding the big breakthroughs with hands on in the real world looking for discoveries and leveraging phenomena to build things.\n\nThen of course, the medical field.\n\nA big roadblock though is that so much that stands in the way of progress is nothing even technical, it's political. Shitty policies. We have insane technology today that people 200 years ago would never have dreamed of and I'm sure many of them would be shaking their heads at what we're pointing it to instead. There are simply way too many dishonest and self-centered people. Too many selfish people not thinking about people less fortunate, animals, the environment, etc. is why we're in this mess and in many cases, going backwards.\n\nThat said for Comp Sci I'd say most likely C and C++ mainly for Embedded with potentially Rust and Zig  and there's Python for A.I. Hate to be yet another \"A.I\" person and sound like I'm shilling, but the reality is the tech is going to be a big game changer, even more than it is now imo. We simply don't know when, if we'll ever get it to that level of A.G.I, but even if we don't get there this will help lead to many breakthroughs along the way. NVIDIA recently cracked the genome. Their A.I is actually able to build lifeforms with unique features/genetics and traits. Stuff like that is a gamechanger and that's what A.I brings.",
