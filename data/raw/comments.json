It doesn't seem necessary to mention in an  ML stack, I only use it to refine a model and that's about it unless I am missing something. Jupyter Hub too, you don't need it, it's just a collaboration tool and not sure why it would be recommended to use. Jupyter notebooks yes, but Jupyter Hub? MLFlow makes sense, orchestration is important, and I have never use Feast but I feel this section doesn't tell me what I want to know in this context. You list different AI models, which is also a bit awkward considering how much they change, but why not list ML models like Tensorflow Keras or XGBoost/Catboost? \n\nTo be even more honest, I don't think your audience will get past the first row of tools. If somebody is looking at this to learn, they'll stop there because why bother with the other tools when AI and vibe coding can do it all?",

We have spent decades trying to build deterministic systems that give the right answer every time but effectively we are throwing a probabilistic system on top that will add to the error rate.  Their expectation is that you one shot determine the correct answer every time and that's never going to happen no matter how much you tune  it, add agents or whatever.  The best you can do is reduce the error rate, but that takes some serious work with experienced people, not just something you get out of the box from some crap tool or whatever.\n\nAlso the context of how the LLM got to that answer that it gives is often SQL and that's gibberish to most business users, so they can't even evaluate whether something that \"looks weird\" is actually correct or it's an obvious mistake in the SQL construction.  Personally I think AI is great for tasks in which the user can evaluate the output from their knowledge like doc retrieval with links, coding assist, etc.  But we are not at a point where we can blindly trust answers from AI.\n\nKinda related, we had a call with a company that was offering some kind of vibe coding tool for data engineering.  You feed it a bunch of context and it would build your pipelines with an agentic model (orchestrator/workers from what I could tell).  I asked the question of how it could get to understand your source systems when the documentation is often lacking.  They said the expectation was that you had full documentation for your systems that you could feed to the tool.

Out of curiosity, what did you try building? \n\nI haven’t done this myself yet, but something I hope to experiment with soon: build an MCP server that scans your metadata and samples the data so that it “understands your database”. You can then, in theory, hook that up to Copilot or some other LLM as the MCP host. There are probably good and bad ways of doing this, but it should in theory be doable. Someone on this sub recently posted that that they had successfully implemented this (I give this sub slightly more credence than LinkedIn lunatics).\n\nTo those concerned about OP feeding private data to public LLMs: enterprise LLM products exist (ChatGPT Enterprise, GitHub Copilot, etc) and they typically have privacy/security guarantees, or so I’m told. This type of setup should only be used with those, obviously. \n\nAll that being said, the most successful use case of such a setup would probably be the data team having more intelligent/aware AI coding assistants, eg using an agent to build you a pipeline that isn’t just guessing at your schemas. As for your stakeholder… I still don’t understand why some people think a fancy randomness machine will give better results than a simple SQL query, which is a straightforward and deterministic way to pull the data one needs.",

Some would say more aligned with business intelligence engineering or analytics engineering. \n\nBut I would rather split data engineering into frontend and backend data engineering. Where frontend is more about visualizations, dashboarding, and sharing direct insights. Go further into data science to give your dashboards more depth. But for “frontend data engineering”, as i call it, the data is all there, but you’re just finding the data with optimized queries and transforming and loading into a dashboard or whatever. For some, that’s enjoyable. For me, not so much. \n\nThen “backend data engineering” is more storage, modeling, and infrastructure. \n\nYou can def up skill with tools like spark and airflow to automate some of those processes. Those skills def transfer to “backend” data engineering a bit more. \n\nAlso, use Python.",

Data Engineering is a very broad term, just like “Software Engineering”. You can find software engineers specializing in multiple different specificities but they’re still someone who writes code to solve a problem. Same for DEs: they write code and design systems to solve data problems. Analyzing data and working with business requirements around data systems is also part of it. Creating reports can also be part of it (although that’s more of a data analyst thing in my opinion).\n\nGenerally you will find multiple different realms of data engineering when looking for jobs. To me it sounds like you need to be more specific with yourself about what exactly it is that you are interested in within DE (is it writing Spark ETL jobs? Is it writing SQL pipelines? Is it working with Kafka/streaming systems?) and then filter your job search based on that.",

        "body": "I might be outside of your target for the thread but I was a C# dev for 10+ years who stumbled into a classic SQL Server data warehouse via a Power BI migration in 2016. I then took the leap into cloud native data engineering in 2021\n\nInstead of slowly making the transition and building alongside a team that knew what they were doing I ended up a tech lead by the end of 2022. IMO this never should have happened and I ended up stepping back to senior. This has hurt me in some respects trying to find my next role but that's off topic\n\nWith no awareness of cloud tooling I originally built a skillset in SSIS. Weirdly - maybe due to the fact that I was still largely a dev day to day - nobody would give me the time of day when I tried to find roles in that area from like 2018 onwards. I largely credit COVID/full remote/zero interest rates and the explosion of hiring for even getting interviews for cloud native jobs as my dev job never had cloud native options. I still wonder if I'd have even broken into the field at all without that\n\nAs to how I'm managing - I've really been on the \"learn outside of work to the point of burnout\" trail for the last 3 years. I was a SQL heavy dev so no issues there but I still don't think I know enough about anything else. This gets more complicated because my current role is analytics for security teams so I'm also doing SIEM work and chasing security certifications...\n\nI always get by in my roles by being passable at things the teams I work in can't even get started. As a data engineer that's been teaching everyone Git, CI/CD, and infrastructure stuff, or in my current team doing actual security work in the SIEM/SOAR space\n\nI've written far too much but there's lots to share I guess. Happy to answer anything in more detail",

Yes it was hours worked for free on the side, but the market was shit and I needed some experience.\n\nEventually my utility in this role got too hard to ignore and I negotiated a role as \"data analytics engineer\", which was a role created for me. My salary negotiations actually netted me a loss in money, but I view it as a stepping stone.\n\nI know not everyone can do that, but I'm leveraging what little power I do/did have to hopefully get myself to a company that will actually pay me what I'm worth to do it now.\n\nAs for how I managed, I was used to doing a ton of work on grad school outside of work, and I just took all the time I had been spending on that and applied it to making the data thing work.\n\nYes it can be tedious and overwhelming, and I spend a LOT of time trying to prove how valuable my work can be, but coming from a job that is very difficult physically and emotionally, this shit is cake.",

If you use it - you can run DuckDB as a server on huge cloud VMs (like the one in the 1 Trillion-row challenge) - and allow clients to connect to it remotely via Arrow Flight SQL JDBC/ADBC/ODBC drivers...\n\nI hope this is helpful!

Use data factory for this if you can as its just a tick box. This guarantees your data is as expected. You can also capture rows counts in metadata\n\nData Translation: It is important to run audits at every point in this process as in nearly every migration, some data will fail to go through translation, or simply be incomplete at a source level leading to data incompatibility with new systems. To solve this, it has to be found in the original system, details and then agreed with the business. You can then write routines to determine all of the data that is affected this way and make that know to every before-hand.\n\nData Cleansing: Often we are asked to fixed of patch data issues from the source data, this should always be avoided. But we know how the entirety of the project will be against you pushing best practice. If you do get forced to cleanse or transform any data you must have the business and project agree that this will break any ability to do data verification, and you can only therefore rely on counts of data and inference of 'completeness'\n\nYou'll never get away with having a migration project that actually follows sense and logic, you will be the only person in the room arguing why transforming data in a migration is completely wrong, and you will be spoken to like you are the idiot in the room for it.\n\nYou can only cover your back by making sure:\n\n* You get agreement for everything\n* You document every row of data that falls out of expectation at the source\n* Plan in multiple entire migration data runs leading up to the go live data\n* Never ever be quite about best practice.

Consider pivoting this to a human in the loop approach where your agents generate detailed remediation plans and PR suggestions, but require approval. This would still save the manual work while avoiding the uncontrolled automation scenario.\n\nThe real value is in the detection and recommendation capabilities you've built. Your agent system could be powerful for automatically identifying pipeline issues, suggesting fixes, and even generating test code - all while keeping humans in the driver's seat for final decisions. This approach is especially valuable when managing complex data ecosystems where schema changes ripple across multiple sources like Windsor.ai's extensive connector library.

Multiple excel tabs instead of 1 expected tab?\n\nEssentially my point is the folks creating the raw data that you then ingest as \"raw\" data in bronze layer are often times front desk staff who dont know what excel even is - there is huge variance. We can't reject every other row in real life, that data needs to be cleansed and ingested/used for x purpose(s) (because we pay for it, or responsibility to load it or whatever the use case is). \n\nWhat you've built is really cool, and teams out there would pay you big bucks to get this sort of pipeline operating efficiently, assuming you can course correct for the above scenarios.",

Be careful while googling!!\n\nThe reason high concurrency mode was important in databricks -at the time- was because the \"interactive\" clusters sent the driver of all jobs thru a dedicated driver node and it doesn't scale well when lots of jobs are running at the same time.  My recollection was that there was deliberate synchronization performed, for the benefit of interactive scenarios involving human operators.

That said, most new builds I’ve seen are going all-in on object storage easier to scale, cheaper, and more cloud-native.",

Typically organizations will have their own player ID keys, but unless you already have the mapping figured out, someone else's keys aren't helpful, and there's a new batch of rookies every year. So you end up with waterfall fuzzy matching logic which always has to end with some hard-coded exceptions that need to be regularly added to. This can happen with team names and abbreviations too - don't get me started on college football.\n\nAlso timestamps.

Some other comments here have covered it -- matching things by name or by address, rather than by concrete id values.\n\nNot only does it need a variety of fuzzy matching approaches, it also requires domain knowledge to understand what types of fuzzing can be used rather than just plain string distance. You want to know how to parse things like addresses or names into components, with different rules for different types of addresses/names. You want to figure out which aspects can be ignored or moved around, or can have specific changes.\n\nEven when you have it working well, it is still only 90%, and the last of it is always a continuous manual process of fixing things that didn't quite work, and your rule set just can't handle the subtleties that a person can manually implement.\n\nA great annoyance is the business looks at it and thinks 'this is easy for me to figure out, why can't you just write an algo for it? it should be easy' - not understanding how trying to implement all the nuance of human understanding is impossible.

People look to you for decision-making and occasionally for technical review or guidance, but not for deep technical execution.\n\nTechnology evolves constantly, and it's nearly impossible to keep up with everything. The fundamentals, however, change very little—unless there’s a true paradigm shift. What really matters at the senior level is your ability to focus on people and process.\n\nAt this point in my career, I spend far more time on change management, stakeholder alignment, and influence than on hands-on technical work. If you're aiming to move into leadership, you'll need to develop skills in business and finance.\n\nYou're in a strong position if you can both \"get your hands dirty\" when needed and also see the bigger picture. The next step is learning how to communicate that vision to people who have little to no understanding of data—and doing it in a way that drives action and buy-in.",

Your instinct about Postgres being easier on the dev side is spot on the SQL compatibility makes the migration much smoother.But honestly, with 87TB of highly relational data and that schema structure you described, I'd lean towards Postgres here. few reasons: The relational nature of your order management system is gonna fight you every step of the way with Mongo. Sure, sharding comes easier but you'll end up with a mess trying to handle all those one-to-many relationships across collections. Plus your devs will hate life trying to rewrite all that logic.\n\nFor active-active with Postgres, yeah its more work upfront but:\n\n\\- Citus handles the sharding pretty well for this scale\n\n\\- pglogical or BDR can handle the multi-master stuff \n\n\\- Your existing queries won't need major rewrites\n\nThe 15M users across US east/west is definitely doable with either but given your schema complexity I think you'll save months of dev time sticking with relational.\n\nOne thing to watch out for tho - active-active with financial transaction data gets tricky with conflict resolution. Make sure you have a solid strategy for handling concurrent updates to the same order records across regions.\n\nWhat's your timeline looking like for this migration? That might influence which route makes more sense from a project management perspective            Also curious about your read/write patterns are customers mostly reading their order history or do you have heavy write loads during peak ordering times?",

        "body": "Upfront disclosure - I work at MongoDB. But I’ll fully upvote every comment that says you’ll have to redevelop most backend code to use MongoDB. Fact! \n  \nOn the other hand - an Order Management use case is perfectly suited to the MongoDB document model. Your data is not highly relational; it is highly structured. A customer places orders, and orders contain items. That can be entirely achieved in a single collection with nested fields in MongoDB. The performance will be superior. There is rarely a need for transactions in MongoDB - use a flexible document to capture the reads atomically, and if you need to update other collections that contain values use change streams. Jumping across 87TB in relational tables is inherently less efficient. \n\nGoing further, if you use MongoDB Atlas, I’d expect you can use the built in archive for a majority of the customer data (orders >6 months go to archive?), adding minimal latency degradation (+1-2s? Vs sub 100ms for hot data) and massive savings, with no added code. That could half the size of your cluster and costs. But at worst, for the near hundred TB of data, you are looking at a 25 shard cluster which would be active-active and could accept east/west geo-specific writes\n\nGoing even further, how does your order management support search? Atlas will provide you order search capability within the same cluster or with dedicated search nodes. And vector search. And all of this is Highly Available starting with 4 9s of uptime with options to increase to 5 9s. \n\nSo if your C-Suite is weighing in with technical requirement (active-active) - my suggestion is ask them what the business requirement is - uptime, latency - and steer them back towards doing their jobs and letting you do yours ;). And ask them what value lucene search would provide to users? \n\nAnd then returning to the reason for you not to use MongoDB Atlas - you will have to refactor more code. But we do offer purpose built genAI refactoring solutions to help customers achieve this. DM me or check our website. End Users can even Experiment with “Relational Migrator” but you’ll need custom or some of our internal tooling to migrate 87 TB. Good luck!",

I won't get into them here, but say for instance Fuzzy Matching is involved. Sometimes the fraud team will keep these secret since if folks were aware of the nature of the detection analytics they could circumvent them. I'm referring to sophisticated stuff you can't really do this in PowerBI, not basic calculations or lookups. \n\n- If this access is absolutely necessary, the fraud team should make every effort to limit who on their team can view the data, they should have procedures for granting access, and document who has access and who approved it, ie I wouldn't advise a \"free-for-all\" but I would be pretty upset if PII was restricted. \n\n- I had access because I was one of the 'trusted few' at the company. I was maybe one of 10~ employees out of 100k employees who had the level of access needed to conduct this work, the others being legal, the CEO, CFO, etc. There were maybe 50+ other folks in my org, but the PII was masked for the rest of the employees. They could download aggregated statistics from dashboards, but not the PII or row-level data. \n\n- You may want to involve in-house Legal. Anytime I granted access to the raw PII data, we involved legal. \n\n- There are excel-level controls, like encryption and security, you can tell the team must be enabled anytime they send an email - we did this as a policy. There's no real way to enforce it, but we'd always encrypt the emails and the excel file if we ever shared it. \n\n- On that note, aren't there controls in your company which monitor the sending & sharing of Excel documents? ie if it is ever exported to a flash drive or printed? \n\n- Speculating here - I think Microsoft has a data governance tool, Purview, which might detect things like PII containing columns and restrict the sharing of the excel report? Might want to look into that. I briefly used it but can't speak to its applicability or effectiveness in this situation. \n\nJust my thoughts - could also maybe learn from them exactly what procedures they need to do in excel and see if you can design queries to handle it? I could see the financial industry being a bit more sensitive than where I worked so, these controls might not be enough.",

Every extract got watermarked with the ticket number so leaks were traceable.\n\n\n\nIf your stack is mostly Databricks, hook the VDI to Delta Sharing or Power Query so analysts still build pivots. For quick looks, spin up a Squirrel SQL style web viewer that limits results to 10 k rows.\n\n\n\nI’ve tried Immuta and Privacera, but DreamFactory slots in nicely when you need to expose just a few masked endpoints to vendors without opening the whole lake.\n\n\n\nThe safest move is to isolate Excel in a monitored sandbox instead of banning it.",

My best jump came from building a tiny warehouse on Postgres: load a public dataset, write the pipeline in plain SQL, then rewrite it in PySpark so you’re forced to map CTEs, windows, and joins to transformations. Follow up with a dbt rewrite; the model tests catch bad assumptions you didn’t realise you made. Drill the planner-explain analyze will teach you more about skew than any blog post. When stuck, screenshot the plan and compare it to the Spark DAG; patterns start to click. Keep a scratch sheet of oddball functions (lateral, array\\_agg, conditional windows) and fold one into every practice query so it sticks. I’ve used Airflow for scheduling and Snowflake for isolated perf tests, but DreamFactory let me spin out quick REST endpoints from the same tables to demo downstream consumers. Keep solving real problems in raw SQL first; every other DE tool gets easier.",

A Master’s can help, but only if it’s paired with project experience and real-world tools - that’s what hiring managers care about most.\n\nOne option before jumping into a full MS is to build a public portfolio using tools like Datalayer, which gives you a Jupyter-style environment (with Claude and agent support) that’s great for building dashboards, pipelines, and ML experiments in one place. It’s also resume-friendly and much cheaper than tuition.\n\nIf you're leaning toward school, look for programs with strong co-op/internship pipelines (like Northeastern, Georgia Tech’s OMSA, or UCSD’s MAS Data Science). But even short-term certs + a strong project repo can sometimes land you the job faster.\n\nP.S Have some blogs and github links around Jupyter (MCP and AI Agents) use cases.

That’s why Spark (that originally was meant for parallel processing) usually goes along with Hadoop File System (HDFS).\nWith this setup you can simply pick a CSV file, manipulate with Sprk, and then store in another location.\n\nNow let's complicate a little bit the situation: for example you can still store records as CSV table but want to enforce a schema, in this case you can spin up a Spark cluster with Hive Metastore (it’s just an external small database to store metadata of your tables). This allows you for partitioning, clustering, grant RBAC, ...\n\nIn the last 20 years more complicated file types have been enforced in data engineering, like Parquet (think of it as a self describing CSV which has an header with column names and data type) and Iceberg.\n\nI don't know if this answer your question but to recap basically you need to combine a query engine with a metadatastore to have a complete database/datawarehouse otherwise you can only transform data from point A to point B.",

Without a metastore, you'd check storage directly.\n\nBut if the table not already existing doesn't affect the required logic, you can just write in overwrite or append mode without the need to handle table existence. Either will implicitly create non-existing targets.\n\nFor pure DDL operations (just creating a table, not writing any data), if you're using the SQL API then `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` [is available](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-syntax-ddl-create-table-datasource.html).\n\n> can add some parameters to your query to do it ?\n\nYes. Notebook widgets (not advised, notebooks are poor code artefacts), script or function arguments. But you may want to pin this to the runtime state (or lack of) of the target table, a config value, or some combination of these.\n\nTypically what Spark code for data warehousing \"looks like\" is some sort of workflow orchestration using a DAG, in something like Luigi/Airflow/Dagster (and/or dbt), which will invoke stuff (scripts, notebooks, dbt runs) as needed and with the required parameters.\n\nYou can totally run dbt against Spark, the connector is [officially supported](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/spark-setup).",

        "body": "> do modern BI systems need an analytics Database\n\nTechnically no, in practice yes. \n\n\nThe reason is that productive systems like ERP are built for recording transaction data, i.e. a fine-grained log of events and facts. Technically this translates into lots of short-lived requests to the system, e.g. \"store this order\", \"lookup this invoice\" etc. That is, the system load per request is low. \n\n\n\nThis is different for analysis oriented queries, where we typically want to show aggregate results, e.g. \"order volume in the last 3 months, grouped by product / region / customer segment\" or \"show \nall customers who's order volume over the last 3 months is less than their average over the previous 12 months\".\n\n\nThese aggregated queries require a different data model, at least a different set of indexes v.v. the data model for the transaction system, aka operational database. Of course it's technically possibly to run these aggregate queries against the operational database directly, however it will strain its resources and potentially result in bad performance for end users.\n\n\nAnother aspect to consider is that the data needed to answer these kind of queries often span multiple systems, e.g. orders are tracked in one system, invoices in another. That is, we have to combine data from different systems, which is notoriously difficult (as in requires dedicated effort) unless there is an infrastructure that supports it.\n\n\nWith this in mind, it is easier to build a seperate database that is optimized for aggregate queries, and does not interfere with the operational database.\n\n\nRegarding the argument against storing data multiple times: That's a very common objection and it sounds logical. You don't want arbitrary copies of data stored just about everywhere - that's a valid concern. However, the need to serve analytics demands are equally valid, and following the above line of argument, they require a different technical setup. So there's a trade-off between avoiding data duplication, and the need to have well-performing systems for both operational and analytics needs.\n\n\nThey key is to build the analytics database (whatever you call it) by a controlled and managed process, that is the data is not stored arbitrarily, but the process is designed to keep the data up to date, the purpose of the duplication is to serve analytics needs, and there is ownership assigned.",

With standard, modern stacks the switch is feasible and may be trivial in some cases\n\nwith custom aggregations and calculations you still lose the flexibility of having the data gathered in one place (the DW) at a granular level, which you could slice, dice and roll up in many ways. This tradeoff is similar to using general purpose language vs a domains specific one.\n\nAlso, with APIs you will spend man hours and brainpower to build and solve things that could be had free with DW and a tool like DBT or SQLMesh.\nWith DBTs shenanigans lately I am mor and more inclined to look deeper into the elternative.\n\n\nThis may or may not happen, but dimensional modelling with its well known setnof ideas, terminology, values and artifacts is a unifying factor in terms of vision and culture, with devs building APIs and reports consuming directly you will be herding cats, every thing will be done differently, there will be consistency and compatibility problems, and compund effects of say conformed dimensions across many domains goes out the window.",

Breaking it into two distinct steps allows the database to first have a copy of the data that it has statistics about, and can do it as a single bulk operation. You also have the option of creating an index on the staging table before the merge, which could help that process.\n\nBreaking it up into two steps also means that once the data is uploaded, you don't need to run your local compute process anymore, and you aren't susceptible to the process failing if you have issues with your local processing, the network connection, or the merge. It is generally just more stable, and if it has an error you have a definite point the error occurred, and since the target table merge can be a single transaction, it is easy to rollback anything critical.\n\nHaving your local data processing engine do a direct upload to a table lets it use whatever optimisations it has for the connection. If it has specific support for your database, it may make use of bulk operations in some way to speed up the process.\n\nOr, if you have a separate tool for bulk uploads, you write the data locally in a format suitable for that, push to a staging table with that tool, then merge with a database script or procedure.\n\nSQLAlchemy may be able to help with the database SQL script to integrate from the staging table to the target table.",

In my experience, Databricks wins on cost once you're processing substantial data volumes, but Snowflake can be cheaper for smaller analytical workloads. Consider your data ingestion strategy, tools like Windsor.ai can streamline data feeds to any of these warehouses, giving you flexibility to switch platforms later without rebuilding connectors.\n\nRun a pilot on a subset of your current workloads to get real performance/cost metrics.

You could just scan the folder, load only what’s needed based on the user’s selection, and cache results to keep things snappy. That keeps things simple and flexible, especially if your files aren’t massive.\n\nIf I were you I would first answer these questions:\n\n- How big are the csv files, roughly? A few MBs or closer to GBs?\n\n- Are the column structures consistent across files, or do they change?\n\n- Does anyone on your team need to explore the raw data themselves, or are you the one curating all the views?\n\n- How often is new data added to the data lake?\n\n- Are there any heavy computations or aggregations you’re doing often that would benefit from SQL?\n\nAnd then, \nOnce you know the answers to those, it’ll be a lot easier to decide if you need a proper database layer or if a well organised pandas workflow can get the job done.",

When the data volume finally outgrows laptop RAM, you can point the same parquet set at a warehouse like Snowflake without rewriting code. I’ve used dbt for model builds and Superset for dashboards, while DreamFactory sat in front to expose quick REST endpoints for the same parquet files when we needed them in other services. Stay on files for now and only jump to a real DB when scale forces it.",

And of course, how will your code even know it's a cost field?\n\nHere's another example, say there's a string field - your code won't know if it requires an adjustment to some of your business logic.  Maybe it indicates a cost type?\n\nSo, if data quality matters, then it's best to have a data contract, and when the upstream system makes changes to that contract then you coordinate with them.\n\nMeanwhile, you can compare every record to the data contract to ensure that every row complies and you don't have any unapproved schema drift.",

All streaming pipelines serialize to Protobuf\n2. All Protobuf schemas are shared via a monorepo\n\nCombined you get quite a strong consistency model for data interaction at the streaming level. Protobuf is backwards/forwards compatible, and it doesn't care about the field name only its integer ID. That solves 99% of the data interaction mismatches.\n\nHaving said that you're still ultimately persisting to a database somewhere, and that part will require an unavoidable migration. This is where the hack-ish solutions are usually found. Usually here you either go with the slow-but-safe versioning approach or with a simpler 'all downstream services upgrade simultaneously' one. Or just don't rename a field unless there's a strong business requirement. Pick your poison.\n\n\nEDIT: there is actually a cleaner option for column renaming in *some* databases, though I personally haven't used it. You could create a new column that defaults to values from the old one. For example in ClickHouse you could do this:\n\n    CREATE TABLE example (\n        old_name String,\n        new_name String DEFAULT old_name\n    )    \n\nThis effectively creates an alias for the same field (at the cost of duplicated storage), and  you can then slowly deprecate the old field at your leisure. The caveat being that inserts into the new column won't be visible in the old one. I don't necessarily recommend going this route, but it would prevent going down the versioning rabbit-hole.",

Azure Functions’ HTTP trigger can sit in the same resource group, talk to Postgres via psycopg or pgx, and costs almost nothing at your traffic scale; just wire up five functions (list, get, insert, update, delete) and use managed identity so you never store creds. If you’d rather avoid code, point PostgREST at the database: views become endpoints, row-level security handles auth, and you deploy a single container. Supabase is basically PostgREST plus auth and storage if you need hosted options. I’ve tried PostgREST and Azure Functions, but DreamFactory is what I ended up buying because it handed me locked-down endpoints and swagger docs in under an hour. For this scope, serverless or generated APIs keep your stack light.",

They can also update a CRM through its API endpoints, but that's not too different from doing so in any other CRUD apps, and your average analyst won't have the necessary permissions nor skill to handle authentication to use those endpoints.\n\nIn a larger context, the unmet need this feature is trying to solve is a common one: analysts often get asked if they can add some kind of write-back to their reports, such as documenting decisions, comments, events. If you end up working somewhere that has such a need and that extensively uses Power BI and Fabric, using these can be a great quick solution for enforcing clean data entry without having to build a full CRUD app, and it clearly beats using spreadsheets with no data validation for inputs.",

As a contractor, you have to pay the employer component of a number of taxes and other contributions, see below.\n\n\nUnlike full time employees, you are also taking on the significant risk of your contact not getting renewed at the drop of a hat. Contractors are always cut first when projects are completed or budgets get tight. Btw once there, don't let them death-march you to the finish line while only paying 40 hours per week with a promise that \"it gets better when we're done\". They will cut you off without remorse, I've seen it myself. That risk needs to get paid to reimburse you for any gaps between contracts spent looking for a new one.\n\n\nAll this to say it is customary for contractors  to charge significantly more per hour than a full time employee, between 50% and 100% more.\n\n\nThis recruiter is trying to pull a fast one on you because they sensed your lack of knowledge. Consider yourself informed, and use chat gpt to give you a professional phrase to let them know that you are aware that they are full of shit. Read below for details, and Google for employee vs contractor tax calculators to work out what your break even rate should be.\n\n\nhttps://accountinginsights.org/irs-worker-classification-employee-vs-contractor/",

Are you able to see all the rows from the batch-load process after some time?\n\n> I know the stream and batch load process are not ideal\n\nYou know it's not ideal, and yet you do it lol. Consider loading batch data into a separate staging table, then merge or insert into the main table after ensuring no stream conflicts.",

The merge key column is null fir these. Then I merge and update based on merge key = primary key and update the end date to close the old record and on the insert clause I insert everything from the second set.  This includes records with new keys and the latest version of records with existing keys. \n\n\n So when the merge key is matched then update and when it's null then insert.  You build the rows you want to insert and update in the selects in using clause.  Hope that makes sense.  ",

I’d slot three extras into your flow:\n\n\n\n1) Add a migration tool like Flyway or Liquibase so learners manage schema changes with versioned scripts and rollback drills instead of ad-hoc DDL edits.\n\n\n\n2) Wire up a tiny CDC stream (Debezium + Kafka or even a Postgres logical slot to stdout) so students watch bad updates ripple downstream, then trace them back upstream.\n\n\n\n3) Cap it with a contract-test stage in CI: Great Expectations for row-level rules, a schema diff gate, and a quick load test that fires malformed payloads generated by property-based fuzzing. Scraping the pgAdmin logs after that is an eye-opener.\n\n\n\nI’ve leaned on dbt tests and Datafold diffing for similar demos, and DreamFactory slid in nicely when I needed the REST layer auto-generated instead of babysitting custom endpoints.\n\n\n\nThose tweaks keep the sandbox lean while exposing every failure surface in a way that mirrors day-to-day work.",

I think contracts are great (I'm writing the book on the subject), but I think it deserves its own course and might make the course too big. Doing the schema checks at CI was my attempt at a \"taste\" of this. With that said, I've been also going back and forth on this, so this suggestion is great feedback as I make a decision here.\n\nAgain, thanks so much!",

Even with these instructions and all necessary context, LLM may fail to generate response you expect for questions like this.\n\nThis may sound a bit weird, but if you have limited number of questions like this, it makes sense to prepare a report (pivot table?) that answers on the question *precisely*. If you want to encourage end users to ask their own questions - which means creation of their own new reports - first of all you need to configure a data model (cube?) that contains all necessary dimensions and measures needed to answer on these questions.\n\nTaking into account *realistic* capabilities of modern LLMs, it makes sense to offer end users 2 kinds of prompts:\n\n* \"Ask question\" in the context of the concrete data model (facts + dimensions). LLM gets in the context lists of the available dimensions, measures, filters + instructions and maybe even low-cardinality dimension values. Result is a tabular report configuration (pivot table or flat table) with filters, which can answer on user's question.\n* \"Ask question\" in the context of the concrete report data. LLM gets in the context report's table data (which is reasonably sized and not is too large for LLMs context window), possibly with supporting instructions. This is a kind of assistance with data interpretation, instead of analyzing values in table users can simply ask smth like \"what is the best client by premium\" - and get an answer if this report has calculated premium values by clients.\n\nTechnically, with tools calling these 2 steps may be combined (LLM can compose a report, then load report's data, and give an answer), however this significantly increases a risk of wrong numbers in LLM response. In BI it is very important to get *right* numbers (not just maybe-yes-maybe-no numbers), so it is better to offer simpler but more reliable LLM-based functions.\n\nThis is how we implemented LLM-based functions into our BI tool recently, based on feedback from real users.

The \"terminal\" (or terminal emulator/tty/console) is the actual thing that you see on your screen that you can click and type in, and see characters on. Underneath that is the \"shell,\" which is software that knows how to take character sequences and interpret it as commands, and can then run those commands. If you type \"ls\" and hit enter, the terminal is what shows you what you just typed and the results, while the shell is the thing that was able to locate the \"ls\" command and run it. You can interchangeably use any terminal (e.g. iterm, konsole, ptyxis, ghostty, kitty) with any shell (e.g. sh, bash, fish, zsh, nushell).\n\nSSH, \"Secure SHell,\" is an encrypted server-client protocol for communicating with a shell on another machine. You still use the same terminal emulator locally, you still type in your commands and see the results. But behind that, instead of calling to a shell that's running on your machine (accessing your files, running your binaries, etc), you're sending all your keystrokes over the network to another box that has an SSH server running (called sshd). Then that SSH server acts sort-of like the terminal on that remote box, passing those keystrokes to the shell, which then runs commands on that machine (with their files, binaries, etc) and gives back the results.\n\nWhen devs say SSHing to another server, they really mean interacting with a shell\\*\\* on that server, from the comfort of their machine.\n\n\\* I'm simplifying a bit. Details @ [https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/](https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/)  \n\\*\\* Well, really SSH supports arbitrary data transfer. You can do port tunneling, send files over it (it's the default backend for scp and rsync), run GUIs remotely over a desktop gateway, whatever.

This is especially true in your case because the response says \"their expectations\" which suggests that you're getting the information secondhand.\n\nThey might have said the same thing even if there was nothing *wrong* with your code, but they had 10 applicants and one of them did slightly better than you, by whatever subjective criteria they're using to judge your code.\n\nAs far as actual issues go: As already mentioned, you allow the player to spend more than 3 credits on a spin, which violates the spec. But more importantly, you made up a formula that increases the payout if the player spends more, and you did it in a way that would be a **big problem** if this were a real casino. With a wager of 3 credits, the house has a significant advantage (a player will lose 1.333 credits per play on average). But with the way you're calculating payouts, a player who wagers 6 credits or more has a positive expected return per play, so they can easily just bankrupt the casino by playing repeatedly.\n\nAlso, this is a much smaller issue, but your test code in `SuccessfulGameTest` seems kind of sketchy to me. For one thing, I really don't like the structure of making all your test cases being dependent on running in a specific order, because it means you can't test them separately. For another, you're not *meaningfully* testing the final balance; if you start with 10000 credits and spend 800, then checking whether the final balance is >=800 tells you nothing about whether the payouts were correct.",

The most important part of your gambling game is the Reel logic, and you have no tests for that.\n* Your tests are kind of unusual. Most tests I see are self-contained at the method level. They set up a situation from scratch, they exercise the system, and they examine the result. Your test methods each run one part of a larger scenario. That's not necessarily wrong. It even comes across as readable and maybe is the best way to do it, but it did give me a \"huh?\" moment, which might be bad for an interview project.\n* The main logic of your game is, to me, oddly organized. You have a \"CreditStoreService,\" which is fine, but its interface is \"takes arbitrary logic to manipulate the balance.\" Why doesn't the credit store service just have deposit, withdraw, reset, and checkBalance methods? Why put the business logic of how to modify balances in the controllers and also the game service?\n* When a game is played, you simulate the result before checking whether the player was allowed to play. This has no side effects, so it's fine, but it struck me as odd.\n\nStill, all in all, a reasonably fine project. I don't see any obvious red flags.

When I see \"Agree\" or \"Disagree\", but they make similar points, then they have a different understanding of what they thought OP said.\n\nOK, so I'll start. I think OP believes learning a bunch of languages just to learn them is not good, at least, not at the start. Instead, pick a language, and begin solving problems, and not just learning how to write \"Hello, World\" in a dozen languages. \n\nOP did suggest that learning new languages didn't teach him more than Javascript did, but he admits that maybe some of that was failing to take a deeper dive in any of the languages.\n\nI don't think OP is saying every language is the same, but if s/he is saying that, I disagree.\n\nAs an analogy, this is like saying, what's important about learning a spoken language is what you want to talk about, i.e., the ideas, and not the words you use (which depend on language), and yet, you can be well spoken in English and don't know how to say the same thoughts in another language.\n\nWhy is it challenging? Natural languages like French or Japanese have a huge vocabulary compared to the syntax of a language. In particular, verb tenses are tricky for most. On top of that is learning the grammar, Is it subject-verb-object? Also, pronouncing words is really hard. Many non-Chinese speakers struggle with the tones in Chinese (assuming they don't also speak a tonal languages). On top of that, there are cultural differences, slang, whether to speak in complete sentences or to drop certain words, etc.\n\nProgramming languages don't have that complexity. But to say they are all the same is also wrong. For example, if you know Javascript well, but tried to learn Prolog, you'd struggle trying to find equivalent concepts. Prolog is that different from Javascript.\n\nHaving said that, I generally agree with the basic premise which is learn a language well enough to solve problems. Don't learn a bunch of languages early on, esp. superficially where you can't solve problems in any of them.\n\nMy minor quibble is the language does matter, at least, to how you think about a solution. Doing OO programming where you create classes and objects differs from doing procedural programming where you don't do that. That also differs from doing functional programming. You need to adjust how you think about programming. But in a sense, it doesn't matter which style who pick, just pick one and don't keep switching languages to know a bunch of them at a surface level.",

It is a fact, that some languages make you think differently, because they are making you base your implementations on other primitives. It is from _that_ kind of thinking, that expertise develops.\n\nWell, of course, if one wants to stay a mediocre dev with limited perspective due to limited exposure to the things that are out there, then no problem! The industry has already enough of this kind of dev and has (had?) insatiable hunger for mediocre workers.\n\nIf one wants to gain more insight though, one needs to get in contact with other languages and how they work and solve problems in them. Then out of the specific experiences with different primitives to work with, one forms a more educated overall picture and expertise.\n\nDon't obsess, alright, I agree, but don't assume, that because you have used Java, Python, JavaScript or another mainstream language for a couple of years, you know all there is to know. There is tons you don't know and there will always be tons you don't know. What matters is, that you continue learning. If all you can do is sling around some design patterns, then unfortunately quite soon you may become obsolete. You might need to become an _expert_ in computer programming, and that does not only include slinging Java classes and a few patterns.

We are in a profession of cult, rather than actual engineering.\n\nThe problem is also one of self selection. Some people choose to continue learning, and maybe project Odin could be a place where such people go to learn. Some are even fortunate enough to be able to do so on the job, at some functioning organization. Most others will not or are not at organizations that encourage learning.\n\nExample: In the past I have been at an organization that had fake \"learning days\". I was not allowed to learn about some advanced computer programming topics, but someone else \"learning HTML\", that was OK. Only that I learned HTML a long time ago, at school and over time I mostly kept myself informed about what new stuff is there. I have no need of learning HTML. It is something so basic, that I would be wasting my time doing that. Knowing HTML is such a widespread thing, that it is not even anything to boast about. Yet I was denied learning, because silly middle management did not have the capability to understand the impact of the things I wanted to learn. The perspective was always short term, and they let their own lack of experience and knowledge limit what others are allowed to learn on the job. It was completely dysfunctional.\n\nI think many people in this situation would not have energy left to then learn more in their free time. That is, if they were into being a developer out of passion and learning about computational processes, and not just for the good pay. We have too many of the not passionate devs in the industry, who will jump on any hype train, as long as it pays well, messing up project after project, and being lauded for it by incapable management.\n\nMany will continue to mess up projects, introducing unnecessary complexity at many turns. Management usually doesn't realize this, because they have no proper understanding of the detailed implementation ideas and what their consequences are. Or the ever-present silly phrases like \"80-20!\", \"YAGNI!\", balblabla, which are weaponized to cut against developer concerns. You are a ticket machine! We want you to be a small cog, that we can easily replace with the next generic developer!\n\nThey are not able to distinguish between someone really knowing their stuff and someone just going with the first best idea that \"works\" (until the next requirement change, when they have to adapt their half-assed solutions again). Developing computer programs without \"programming oneself into a corner\" is a valuable skill, but also a rare skill.",

There's a reason people say to start with tic-tac-toe or a TODO app. Building something small and self-contained is great \n\n2. Piggyback off of existing projects. Clone some open-source repos down, poke around, see how much you can understand. Pick something small and cool to rebuild as much as you can, using the repo as a reference. That way you can see how code is built and used in the real world.\n\n2. Tutorials can be really useful, but don't just build what's in the tutorial. Change or add \\*something\\* so that you can apply what you've learned.\n\n3. Maybe controversial, but I strongly recommend preferring text tutorials over video. I've found that text has a number of advantages. It's more similar to reading documentation. You can easily jump around back and forth without needing to rely on timestamps or trying to skip back and forth on a video. And I'd argue that reading long tutorials helps flex the muscle of quickly filtering relevant from irrelevant content, which is important when troubleshooting and searching for relevant documentation, browsing reddit and old Stack Overflow posts (if that's even still a thing) and even when chatting with an LLM and figuring out if it's hallucinating or giving you outdated information",

It starts with being able to truly understand a problem, explore multiple ways to solve it, and compare those options—thinking through tradeoffs, constraints, and implications.\n\nBut technical ability alone isn’t enough. Great engineers can communicate complex ideas in simple terms. They adapt how they explain things depending on who they're speaking to and what the context is.\n\nI’ve been conducting interviews in Big Tech for a while now, and here's what I look for: when I present a problem, a strong candidate asks questions and engages in a real discussion about how to approach it. That back-and-forth tells me more about their ability than the actual coding exercise. In fact, in most cases, I’ve already made up my mind before they start writing code. The coding just confirms it. It’s incredibly rare that someone struggles to design or explain a solution but somehow writes brilliant code. Communication and reasoning come first.",

Its a continual gradual process that takes years and as soon as i took a break, a lot of the specific details started to fade. Its challenging but can also be enjoyable. When I was in it, and something I was working on did what it was suppose to do and all the pieces worked. That was exhilarating. Not everybody is like that though. Maybe for others, its no big deal and it starts to make sense right away but it didnt for me. Id definitely give it a shot if I was you. If you can be consistent with it, you might be find it very rewarding.

(google rock paper scissors, lizard, spock). \n\nthen work through your code and see if you can make most of your code not care about which ruleset is used, and only the bits of code that need to print, process user input or select an AI move should be aware of it.\n\n\nnone of these things are needed, your code runs.

I particular like that you didn't fall into the trap that I see a lot of new programmers fall into where they list out _every_ possibility in 9 separate different `if` branches.

If you have a check to see if user loses, and a check to see if user ties, and _neither of those passes_, then the user can _only_ have won!\n\nHave you heard of something called a Python Dictionary? It looks a little something like this:\n\n```\nmy_dict = { some_property: 'some value' }\n```\n\nThe cool part is that you can access properties in that dictionary just like in an array: `printf(f\" {my_dict[some_property]}\") # \"some value\"`. If you make a dictionary of one of the non-tie options (i.e., either win or lose), can you think of a way to make the logic of your RPS even simpler?",

One, from the user's POV and two, from the functionality POV. **You don't need to know everything all at once.** Just ask yourself **\"What will the user see JUST when my program starts?\"** Code whatever it requires. Once it's done, question yourself again **\"Hmm, okay! Done with this! What will happen if the user tries to access this thing?\"** So, it will be like several branches of thoughts starting from the VERY FIRST question **\"What will the user see....\".**\n\nI hope I could help!

It's to develop new circuitry in your brain for thinking about computational problems (which you do by *the process* of writing code, which code assistance can skip, so you get the right answer, but don't develop the brain circuitry).\n\nI also find that (good) books, in general, go far more in depth and provide far more insight than most other mediums for learning, which tend to be shallow and focus on low hanging fruit. Even AI is going to be mostly low-hanging fruit, as it's basically a compilation of all the blogs and reddit posts and tutorials that are out there on the internet already.\n\nIf you want something other than a book, CS50, which is basically (good) book quality in video format. Very rare.\n\nAt the end of the day, technology has changed, but our brains have remained almost unchanged the same since the advent of modern computing. You can't cheat building up those circuits in your brain to develop new ways of thinking -- you need to learn, try, make mistakes, and learn again. I'm dubious as to the capability of new technologies to change that process that is so integral to our brain's biology.",

Databases let you bundle up two changes into a transaction, such that either both succeed or both fail, you never end up in a halfway state. For example: debit $100 from my account, deposit $100 into your account. Without a transaction, the first one could succeed and the second one could fail, meaning the $100 would just disappear.\n\n2. Limits: 10 million total cells. If you have just 10 columns, that means you'll never store more than 1 million records.\n\n3. No concurrency. What do you do if you have multiple clients all connecting at once trying to make changes. Let's say one is editing row 100 while another deletes row 50. If the delete happens first, that means what used to be row 100 is now row 99.\n\n4. History is \"chunked\". With a real database you can get a log of every single change to the database with a timestamp. With Google Sheets if a bunch of changes happen at the same time they get chunked together.",

Newbies often think that learning to code means learning syntax. But that's really not the case.\n\nIt'd be like assuming that you could learn to write poetry well by simply reading the dictionary.\n\nOnce you have core skills moving to a new language is often quite simple. I recently learned Go (I'm mostly a JavaScript and Java developer) and it took me a weekend. Not because I'm amazing, but because the core skills I already have are all applicable to Go too. I just had to learn new Syntax (which a good cheat-sheet helps with anyhow) and work through the quirks.\n\nI'm far from a total wizard with Go, but I have written a pretty decent API server using Gorm easily. \n\nMy point being, pick a language and just focus your efforts on going deep. Learn the core skills. Build actual useful things with it. And then, down the road, explore other languages if and when you need them. Which you choose is most often a practical choice based on how easy it is to do something in them, who else needs to work on the project, what is already in place, etc.",

You can see how a list is initialized and say, “That is useless, you can just keep an empty list rather than a pre-initializated list” or vice versa, you can say, “You already have the initial list data in memory, it’s cheaper to use it than to regenerate it a second time”\n\nThen you verify the tests pass with your changes.

Mature codebases have a lot of additional features making things muddy, and lots of comments and docs, which might seem like a good thing, but can also add to the noise when they are not relevant to what you are immediately trying to do.  Find some library that does the thing you need to do, and then go back into the commit history to find the first commits where the thing works.  The code will usually be way more simple than the current version, albeit with a lot hidden edge cases and lacking optimization.\n\nSo just keep reading source code, but also learn patterns.

Your comments about your portfolio website suggest that you got stuck in a “I have to pick the right thing” loop, and that stalled progress… and I’m going to assume (rightly or wrongly) that a similar thing impacts other projects.\n\nIf you’re anything like me… you start something, build up some good momentum, then reach a “decision point” where you’ve got multiple equally valid paths you could explore. At this point, you lose momentum, it stops being fun… and in your case, you move on to something that feels more fun again.\n\nFor personal projects (and, many a time, even professional work), better to deliver *something* that isn’t quite right than to deliver nothing at all.\n\nIf you accept that you might have to make big changes in the future (your “large front end revisions” you were avoiding), you can just pick something and see how it goes. If you like it, great… if not, you have another mini project ready for the future to redesign this to use some other design system (or whatever).\n\nAlso, yeah, you’re going to have times when working 8 hours a day on coding leaves you not wanting to touch a keyboard when you get home. Make sure you have another hobby (crochet is good) that you can switch to so you don’t burn out on coding entirely.",

While not easy, try to find a group of people with similar interest in coding, that don't just yap about how good they are but are genuinely interested and put effort, these people would motivate you just hearing about their work! \n\nI'll have to stress on the 3rd. unless you want to hit a super horrible burnout.",

It can make you more adaptable, more creative, and honestly, it’s just empowering to know you can build something from scratch. And who knows?

I kinda think your lying tbh, if you aren't, then my guess is your not trying hard enough, might sound reductive. But I dont use that phrase lightly.",

Start simple, just utilize the Developer Tools console that's provided with FIrefox / Chrome / etc, and experiment with assigning \"id\" and \"class\" attributes to HTML elements and then selecting them using javascript.

Small achievements should always be celebrated - especially when overcoming hurdles that have held you back a while.\n\n\nI'm a middle-aged hobbyist, and one of the things I've learned when pursuing other hobbies (Chinese, guitar, etc) is small steps. Good to have goals but need to crawl, walk and eventually run in that order.\n\n\nMost never get near to achieving their original goal because either their original goal was too ambitious and / or there is too large a gap between the effort and the end i.e. the amount of used guitars on sale when people realise that just learning to strum EAD chords takes approx 2 weeks of work.\n\n\nGlad to see another person presuming the time honoured text adventure (or in your case a CYOA). I too, have a number of goals that eventually included creating a MUD [multi-user dungeon]. I'm working on baby goals by first completing CS50x, then working ony simple RPG character generator.\n\n\nThe key is simple: get the basic concepts  working, then expand. Can I do points allocation for stats and include out of bounds error checking? Great! Can I get player input for name including out of bounds error checking? Better! Can I expand upon that and create a banned name list ruleset, et al?\n\n\nGoing in with lofty goals from the get-go, sees them cut down to size, and either the initial motivation disappears or one adjusts and creates smaller goals w/ a more realistic expectation.\n\n\nIf the original motivation remains intact, and one can embrace and actively enjoys learning - and has a realistic timeframe - then go for it!\n\n\nKeep your CYOA - simpe, very simple - to start. Once you have the basic structure, good method to handle and track decisions, then think about expanding. \n\n\nAll the best",

I think this is just one of those things that is true of programming in general, regardless of where you learn it, and being resilient and willing to do your own research goes a very long way.

        "body": "I have the following \"algorithm\" for reading a programming book:\n\nStep 1. Read through the book \"leisurely\". This is somewhere in between skimming and reading in detail. In this phase, for example, I would make a mental note of technically heavy parts (e.g. code examples) but would not go through them meticulously or line by line.\n\nStep 2. Go through the book a second time and make a listing by chapter of what \"things\" need to be done to really study it. For example, which examples should be tried out. What additional exercises should be done. Questions that I have (which could be answered by writing a program, for example). Other \"what ifs\" that come to mind (e.g. what if I try Y instead of X in this example).\n\nAfter step 2 is done, then basically I have a sort of \"todo list\" of sorts for what I actually need to \"actively do\" to learn that material \"for realsies\".\n\nStep 3. Go through the list that I made in step 2 and actually do those things.\n\nSuffice it to say that \"Step 3\" is what takes the most time and it requires the most concentration. I've found that I can do either step 1 and step 2 in a variety of environments, for example, even on a bus -- but for step 3 I need to be focused, e.g. in a \"library\" type of environment (people around me are quiet and concentrating).\n\nFor step 3 (\"implementations\") I need to use a good development laptop or workstation to actually work on the problems that I assigned myself (sometimes I will draw stuff on paper as well, e.g. diagrams or organizational notes) or that were assigned from the book author. Step 3 is sometimes \"unfinishable\" for me in practice because I tend to write \"too many\" little experiments to myself, or in the course of doing them I realize that it's no longer worthwhile to do some of them. In practice, when I'm doing step 3 I will make a little \"checklist\" to keep progress:\n\n\\[ \\] (123) foo: Implement foo example from chapter\n\n\\[ \\] (146) bar: Implement bar example from chapter\n\n\\[ \\] (146) \\*bar\\_rvalref: // Can bar example be redone using rvalue references?\n\n\\[ \\] (146) \\*\\*cmdline\\_calc: // Create a simple command-line calculator (e.g. calc 1 + 2 \\* 8 should output 17). Output goes to stdout. Also accept \"\\[\" and \"\\]\" as synonyms for \"(\" and \")\" if it is not ambiguous. E.g. x\\[5\\] is unambiguously an array indexing operation, whereas 7 \\* \\[1 + 2\\] is a grouping operation and equivalent to 7 \\* (1 + 2).\n\n\\[ \\] (146) \\*\\*\\*cmdline\\_calc: // Modify the calculator so if given the switch --arm, then the calculator also outputs machine code that would perform the same calculation using ARM instructions (output instruction set: ARM v4T without using Thumb instructions). Run the resulting machine code output via QEMU and verify that the result calculated in the emulated machine is identical to the desktop version's output.\n\n...\n\nIn my notation I write the page number reference in parens, and I use a \"\\*\" mark to mean \"it is a level-1, i.e. fairly easy exercise\", \\*\\* to mean it is a more involved exercise, and \\*\\*\\* or more to mean it is an \"advanced\" exercise.\n\nThe stuff after // is my explanations of what I want to do or experiment on; it can be somewhat vague because it is probably based on the example in the book so if I reread that part of the book, then what I wrote should make more sense.\n\nThese \"checklists\" work fine on paper (in fact I prefer them not to be electronic), but for the actual \"stuff\" that I am doing it is mostly a program and is mostly electronic (i.e. I just create something in a text editor or IDE). If I'm following a book with chapter 1, chapter 2, etc. style then normally I'll name subfolders with the chapter number and the topic, e.g. ch3\\_pointers, ch4\\_memory\\_management, etc.",

They allow you as the developer to control the way your class is interacted with. In the field, you'll rarely be writing code on your own. Most of us work on projects with at least 10 other people touching the code that we write, and on code that other people wrote. You won't always have the benefit of knowing exactly what was going through the authors head when interacting with a class. Also... after a few months or years you won't know what was going through your own head.\n\nSo, consider a scenario where a class has a static object in it which is critical to its function. Say.. an in memory data store or cache. Nearly every public function in the class calls this object and it would be really cumbersome to check for initialization in every function call. Plus, that leaves room for error. You or another developer later on might forget to check. But you could define it with a getter that checks initialization and executes lazy initialization if its not done. Now that initialization logic exists in one place, and you never need to worry about checking for initialization when using the object. And you don't have to worry about some other developer down the line writing dangerous code into your class that forgets to check initialization.\n\nSimilar with constructors. You can use the constructor to perform logic that **must** be done before the class gets interacted with. Go grab some service dependencies, initialize some variables, warm up the cache, whatever you need.",

However, one case I am currently using right now of a more complex getter is that I have to retrieve the firmware information of a co-processor that talks to my primary MCU application over a serial connection. I request that information and cache it when the program starts, but if I call my version getter and that value is invalid for whatever reason (firmware update, mainboard resets, etc) I can spin up the serial port and request the info again, then return the new information or an error code. \n\nFrom the application perspective, I am just getting the firmware version and it doesn't really concern itself with how. I don't have to almost ever change that code, and it can be reused in other places so that if I ever change how the firmware version is retrieved, it's in one spot and makes my job much easier. Likewise, if for whatever reason getting that information stops working, I know exactly where to look which saves time with debugging.",

However when you don't need to return a failure code, it's less typing to just initialize in a constructor.\n\nOne area I've found setters as being really nice is lets say you have a variable that should only be a number between 0 and 10, and you have a bug where it's being set to 100007.  How do you figure out why it's being set to 100007?  With a setter you can put a break point (or a conditional break point) in the setter, then trace up the stack to see where and why it's being set to 100007.\n\nAs for getter, unfortunately with java if the variable is public then if it can be got it can be set.  And see why setters are nice above.",

More on that at the end.\n\nPresumably, in a real (not a learning exercise) program, many of your variables have constraints that require validation, eg can a person's age be negative or higher than 200?  Can their name contain unprintable characters or whitespace like tab?   These constraints are put into the setters, and signal an error if the attempt to set them to an invalid value is made.  Getters protect data that the user can see, but should not change.  For example, with the person, you can maybe look at their address when making a map of your customers but this is not an appropriate place and time to be changing the values -- a getter can provide a look without letting you accidentally modify it.  To modify it you must deliberately call the setter rather than just an oops side effect on a free wheeling variable. \n\nBut when the getters and setters do nothing, and they often will,  their only purpose is to keep it consistent.  These 10 values have getters and setters and those 5 do not in class A,  those 18 do not and 11 do in class B, .. C, D, E, ... after a few classes, remembering which variables in which classes have getters and setters is overwhelming.  If you just assume they all have these functions and use them for everything, its that much less burden on the programmer.   They also abstract validation: when using them ALL of your validation looks the same:\n\n    while( !class.setter_for_variable(new_value) )\n    { \n        display bad input message()\n       new_value =   get new input from user ()\n    }",

For example, in the line `Name names = new Name()`, you have inconsistent pluralization. Which is it — one name, or multiple names?\n* In `Name`, you have some places where you have hardcoded the length of some of your various arrays. This isn't good, because this means that if you want to update the contents of one of the arrays, you will have to change multiple places in your code, where you should only need to change one place in your code for such a change.\n* Similarly, in `UserInterface`, you have one area that prints out a numbered list of all the actions that the user can choose from, but the logic that goes along with each of those actions is elsewhere in the file. It would be good to use a data structure such that if you needed to add an action, remove an action, or rearrange the actions, you could do so by only making one edit to the code, not multiple edits.",

It might make the code look better, something like:\n\n    switch(command) {\n      case 1 -> generateRandom();\n      case 2 -> generateWithLength();\n      case 3 -> generateWithLetter();\n\nand so on. But it is a matter of taste.\n\nYou could benefit from making a single method for reading a valid number from the input - something like: `getValidInput(int[] numbers)` that would only return one of the numbers in the array, or zero if something else was entered by the user. That would isolate your use of scanner to that method alone, and make the rest of the code easier to write without having to handle exceptions or different invalid inputs.\n\nIt is always a good idea to have a lot of small methods that only do one thing - my own personal rule is that if I have more than two levels of if-statements or loops, I need to make a method to combine them.

No, I am not referring to updating the content of string arrays through a method.\n\nLet's look at the `dCons` field as an example:\n\n2a. You define `dCons` as an array that contains 40 elements, which is perfectly fine.\n\n2b. However, later on, when you *use* `dCons`, your code looks like this:\n\n    dCons[random.nextInt(40)]\n\nHere, you have explicitly hardcoded the length of `dCons`. In the future, if you ever manually edit your code to change what is in `dCons`, you will need to update *two* places in your code — 2a and 2b. That's not good, because it's important that those two places in your code stay in sync.\n\nInstead, it's better to remove the hard-coded length in 2b, and have it *read* the length, via something like `dCons[random.nextInt(dCons.length)]`. This way, if you ever manually edit your code to change what is in `dCons`, you will simply need to update *one* place in your code, and everything else will automatically adjust.",

One of the keys to programming and software design is learning how to break the big overall goal into smaller goals. Then solve those and get them working individually, then stitch them together. \n\nSo for example if you want a stock analysis and trading platform, start by modeling the price of a stock at a given instance of time (a single bar, whether that's a day, an hour, a 5 minute interval, whatever it might be). Then build an overall history that accumulates those individual pieces, maybe give that the ability to calculate analyses like EMA, stochastics, or whatever. \n\nThen model a portfolio that can track buys, sells, profit/ loss, etc of individual stocks. \n\nThen build something that will fetch historical data from an online source and build up your historical data. Might also need that to analyze the data for cleaning: find holes, potential anomalies, normalize for splits, etc. \n\nI'm not familiar enough with crypto to know the analog, but hopefully that gives you a way to begin. \n\nPython would be fine for this if you're not planning to do real time analysis. If you want something that can analyze data in real time, you're looking at C, C++, Rust, Zig, or something else that's a systems level language. You don't need to start there, but that's where you'd want to aim to get.",

This is a much, much harder thing; many programmers who are best of the best cannot do this, because getting funding, finding a market, making something that is open enough for people to try but not so open that they never give you any money... all of that is just incredibly hard. If you want fast money now, this is probably not the way. But if you just want to contribute to *something*, or have *something* to put on a resume or application, then you have time.\n\nIf I were you, and if I *really* wanted to be a business owner more than anything else, I would first get a regular full-stack job. Learn what problems your fellow programmers have. Learn what problems IT has. Learn what problems the business has.

Don't downplay that experience, lots of grads don't even know what Docker is when they start.\n\nAt Metana we've had students from all kinds of trades backgrounds make successful transitions. What I've noticed is that people with hands on experience often do better than traditional CS grads because they understand how to build things that actually work in the real world. You don't necessarily need a degree for most programming jobs, especially in Canada where the tech scene is pretty good. Companies care way more about what you can build than your educational background.\n\nThe ADHD thing might actually be an advantage once you find your groove. A lot of great developers I know have adhd, that hyperfocus can be incredibly powerful for debugging and problem-solving.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you want to chat more about specific learning paths or what the job market looks like right now.

Don't let that scare you off though, it can absolutely still be done.\n\n\nOne piece of advice I can give on self-teaching (from an ADHDer as well) is pick ONE language and stick with it for learning. It absolutely does not matter which one you choose as long as it isn't completely obscure, or something like COBOL. The fundamental concepts are all the same in every language.\n\n\nI started with Ruby, learned C# through my first job, now work in C#, JavaScript/TypeScript.\n\n\nI'd recommend you start with JavaScript (alongside HTML and CSS) as you can use those 3 to build interactive web pages and get immediate feedback and a sense of achievement, which is big when self-teaching, especially for ADHD folk. Also even if you work in any other language, if you're working on a web page in any capacity, you will almost certainly need JavaScript so you might as well know it, even if you end up not using it as your primary language. \n\n\nFor where to get started, The Odin Project is a great resource to get you on the right track.",

This could easily be handled by a single kernel thread when it comes to CPU load, so it makes perfect sense to create virtualized threads, which expose the same API as a kernel thread, but all run on a single kernel thread.\n\nWhen faced with CPU-bound work, however, user space threads are simply not that useful. No matter how you slice your algorithm, you only have a fixed number of threads capable of independent computation, so even if you run 10 thousand virtual threads per kernel thread, all of them together can execute only as much real computation (not waiting) as the kernel thread itself. Of course, since managing user space threads has some overhead, this is also a net negative in performance for CPU-bound work.\n\nModern server applications are rarely CPU bound, though, so feel free to go as far as you want with your millions of user space threads, like Go has shown to be completely possible and manageable.",

If your program executes on a single core, there's no benefit. Multithreading (and lightweight async execution) lets a program benefit from context switching where a blocked thread can surrender the cpu until its data arrives. The OS scheduler will do this with processes as well. As long as the thread can still do work on the cpu, there's no point in switching off. Also, do note that cpu cores are pretty good at parallelizing independent work and simulating in order execution. We've had cpus with multiple ALUs per core for example since the 90s and the hardware will dispatch parallel instructions as long as there's no dependency within the execution window. You as a programmer don't have to specifically ask for this. The same is true for things like hard disk caching.\n\nOn the multiple cpu issue, it is worth testing or reading more about if you need this. There have been notorious cases like Playstation where hardware designers shipped multi-core hardware only to find that the OS hardly ever used more than one and never more than two. On the flip side, there are cases like Sql Server on Windows, where the server absolutely can scale across cores to process large volumes of data. I know that's an IO bound load, but often the whole load is aggressively cached when the request comes in so there's low latency.",

        "body": "It can be, if the executor of the user-space threads is itself multi-threaded and runs on multiple system threads.\n\nUser-space threads are designed to solve a very specific issue - to reduce the time a system thread needs to wait on operations that block (think: locking a mutex, waiting for IO, waiting for timer,...). It is implemented thusly:\n\nInstead of calling blocking APIs, we call their non-blocking alternatives . The non-blocking version of the API works the same, but instead of blocking, it returns \"would block\" error.\n\nA user-space thread is a state machine. The states are the values of thread-local variables at the points where blocking operation is called. Advancing a state means executing all the code up to the operation that would block.\n\nThis advancing of states is done by an executor, which runs directly on a system thread. The executor has a set of user-space threads. It advances a user-space thread up until the point it calls a \"blocking\" that would block. It then tries to find another user-space thread in the set, which no longer blocks and can be advanced. If all the user-space threads in the set are blocked, the executor (ie. the system thread its running on) blocks, until one of the user-space threads unblocks (operating-systems do have API that lets you wait on multiple blocking operations simultaneously, until one of them unblocks).\n\nAs you can see from this, user-space threads are completely useless for CPU-bound tasks (ie. tasks that don't wait on blocking operations). You might as well just directly run such tasks as a sequence, because that's exactly what a user-space thread executor will end up doing (likely with some additional overhead).\n\nHOWEVER! A user-space thread executor can be parallelized using system threads. You spawn multiple system threads (as many as your computer has cores) aka. a thread pool. Each system threads runs an executor, but they all share the same set of pending tasks. Now the tasks (in our case, user-space threads) can actually truly run in parallel.\n\nThat being said, user-space threads, as tasks for thread pools, is not the best abstraction for CPU-bound tasks. If you don't divide the work evenly between the user-space threads, then some of the system threads in the thread pool will be busy with big long tasks, while the rest are parked, waiting for something to do.\n\nA better abstraction are tasks that can be automatically broken down into sub-tasks that can be done in parallel. That way, the thread pool can automatically spread the load among the system threads. For example \"apply this operation to each item in a list\" can be easily split into processing sub-ranges of the list, or even individual items.\n\nThis is why pure functional paradigm has gained some notable traction in the last decade. It is trivially parallelizable, because the program is ultimately a tree of function calls where branches (ie. evaluation of arguments) can be evaluated independently of one another.\n\nImperative code, much less so, because it essentially describes a sequence of operations that are expected to be executed in order. Transforming that sequence into multiple independent parallel sequences (ie. threads) is not trivial.",

Build 2-3 full stack projects that solve real world problems. Don’t just build your cookie cutter todo app. \n\nYou should come up with an idea or a problem you’d like to solve in your own life, and then create an app around it. This alone will distinguish you from the masses that have the same generic todo app projects on their portfolios. \n\nYou will stand out as a legitimate developer if you do this. Also, make sure the portfolio website you put your projects on looks great and professional.\n\n2.) Any time you write code - commit it to GitHub. You will want to put your GitHub link in your resume and portfolio website so that employers can go look at your code. Make sure you can explain what your code is doing during an interview.\n\n3.) Apply to 10-20 software development jobs a day. Curate your resume and cover letter to each job description (use GPT to speed up the process).\n\n4.) Network like hell on LinkedIn. Reach out to anyone and everyone who works at a company you’d like to work at. Ask them for 15 minutes of their time for an “informational interview” and at the end, politely ask them to refer you. Or reach out to recruiters directly. Show them your projects. \n\n5.) If you land an interview - research their company and take a few days to build out a prototype app that is relevant to their company. Showcase it during your interview. This will make you stand out like no one else. It shows that you’re ambitious and will go the extra mile. \n\n6.) Be proactive. You can’t fail if you go hard at all the above every single day. The above 5 steps should be your full time job until you land a job. It might take time - but you’ll land something eventually - in fact it took me almost 2 years to land a job after learning how to code and following the steps above after 6 months of coding. So don’t give up.\n\nBonus tip: Never think that a job is below you. If you get an opportunity that sounds shitty but it’s software related, take it - because you will be able to build credibility to add on your resume which will help you land that dream job much easier down line.\n\nFirst dev job I took was a shitty TA gig at a coding bootcamp. Paid $11,000 annually. I did it for a year, leveraged the experience on my resume and landed a $70k gig as a junior developer 8 months later.\n\nEdit: I don’t have a degree in CS. But I do have a bachelors in psychology. Which may or may not have helped my chances.",

I'm also in Toronto, also a front-end-biased full-stacker. There's a fair bit of meetups for JavaScript, front-end, web perf. Go to them. Be seen there. Meet folks, talk about stuff, try to learn and show all the cool stuff you're building. Worse comes to worse you meet some cool new people, best case you start getting tips.\n\n\\- integrate your projects with the LLM companies APIs. Considering how popular these tools are in tech right now, you'll have a bit of an edge over people making boring boilerplate apps. If you want to be hired, working with these APIs will look good when you're demoing your work and show you're on the cutting edge.\n\n\\- Don't let doomers discourage you. Tech is a very boom-bust industry. The dot-com bust didn't kill software development, the latest trends won't kill it either. Get good, show your passion and you'll stand out over a sea of apathetic grads who are just in it for the six-figure payday.\n\n\\- Lastly, most importantly: only become a front-ender if you genuinely love it. Programming and software development are one of the best jobs in the world, but after a post-pandemic big tech hiring boom we're seeing massive layoffs and salaries are shrinking. It will still pay well but you need to set expectations and be willing to find a smaller place to skill up. I got my start working in a creative advertising agency, then was able to pivot into software.\n\nSource: BA Psychology+bootcamp grad, worked in the industry for a decade now.",

Second, a lot of those people are successful programmers who are good at what they do, so in a sense, they're correct. You can be a good programmer and be bad at leetcode.\n\nI would say, though, that the reverse is far less likely. There are far more good programmers who are bad at leetcode than there are bad programmers who are good at leetcode. For interviewers, this is usually a good trade. Sure, the leetcode arbitrarily filters out some good talent, but it also effectively filters out bad talent. Not all, but most. A person who has gotten good at leetcode is often pretty passionate about programming. \n\nProgramming is a wide field. There are people whose jobs look a lot more like leetcode problems. It's also critical to understand the basic tools you would use for leetcode. You should develop a basic intuition for time complexity. I always think that working on improving at leetcode problems will make you better. To get really good, you need to have a deep understanding of the language and everything happening under the hood. \n\nBut there are really 2 factors here: getting good at solving difficult problems, and getting good at optimizing simpler problems.

It's really nice to see someone trying to clarify something about the interaction of the language with the environment it's running in.\n\n`scanf()` is not moving the cursor.  The OS is.  Well, the terminal application is, with the help of the OS (and possibly BIOS).  It turns out that the cursor advances all the time.  Like when you type in the command to compile:\n\n```\n$ _\n$ g_\n$ gc_\n$ gcc_\n```\n\nAfter each character typed, the cursor advances (most of the time).  But terminals are very complex things.  Suffice to say that the terminal--with the help of the OS--manages receiving keystrokes and \"sending them\" to the application.\n\nIOW, the terminal receives the keystrokes.  It does what it usually does; advances it when you type a character, retreats it when you type backspace, etc.  Then, after it does what it needs to (though there are exceptions, like what happens when you press `Ctrl-C` on a Unix-like machine), it tells your C program: \"Hey, someone pressed a character, here it is.\"  Then, you do whatever you're going to do with it.\n\nIt's somewhere from \"a little\" to \"way more\" complicated than that in realities, but that's the general idea.  Just to finish this up, the complexity can come around buffering, which is how many character the terminal and OS will hold before sending them.  If it sent every character, one at a time, that could be inefficient, so sometimes terminals and OSes buffer.  Generally, in terminal applications, hitting `<enter>` will force/suggest the underlying bits (terminal, OS) to send the data to the application.  Also, it's the terminal that decides to move the cursor down (newline), and then return to the left-side on English/Western locales (carriage return).\n\nIf you're curious about how terminals work on Unix-like machines, check out **Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment** by Stevens, often abbreviated \"APUE\".",

Sometimes other characters change the cursor position, like a carriage return moving the cursor to the beginning of the current output line, a line feed moving the cursor down one line, a backspace moving the cursor backward one character, and other special escape sequences can move the cursor in other ways (such as to a specified row and column).\n\nAlso in most cases the operating system terminal driver echoes characters input on the terminal back out to the terminal.  This may happen automatically in the terminal driver without the remote program having to do anything, but the terminal driver can also be put in a mode where automatic echo is disabled and the program must deliberately echo input characters if it wants to.  A text editor, for example, may set non-echoing mode so that editor commands are not echoed when they are typed, and instead output from the editor program displays the results of performing the command.\n\nThe terminal driver in the operating system usually also handles input in line mode, meaning that an entire line of characters followed by a ENTER is buffered up and made available to the program after ENTER is pressed.  But the terminal driver can also be put into a mode where every keypress from the terminal is immediately available to the program, rather than being held and sent when ENTER is pressed.\n\nIn modern computers the terminal is often a program that emulates the behavior of a serial terminal, because the serial terminal model is so pervasive for managing program input and output.\n\nIn a simple program, output to the terminal is what moves the cursor, so calling scanf() does not cause the cursor to move, and if the terminal driver is in its normal mode of echoing input, it's the echoed output of input characters, or output from the program, that moves the cursor on the terminal",

We could leave either flag out of the call, of course:\n\n```\nsome_function_that_takes_flags(SAY_HELLO);\n```\n\nNow this function call only says hello.\n\n\nThis way of using flags improves code readability compared to having multiple separate booleans as function params. It also enables extending the list of options very easily without having to go fix a thousand different calls to the said function.\n\n\nHope this explains it.

An example is std which rather than being on/off sets your c++ standard to 17 or 20 or 23 or whatever else.\n\nSometimes an integer used as multiple flags is still called a flag, though its bitwise treated as up to 64 individual boolean/bit values.\n\nSo while the term OFTEN refers to single bits, it does not HAVE to, and it does not even have to refer to a 2 state toggle, but can represent the state of a multi-state (eg left/right/forward/reverse) entity.   And they can control anything that can make use of a condition, from a switch to a loop and in some languages, even a computation (eg in C++ you can use the false==0, true == 1 in a computation to zero out a term: its valid to say integer = 3\\*x+2\\*y + 42\\*(x>0) ) to conditionally add either 0 or 42.  What is common to all of it is that when you hear the term 'flag' you usually should think 'optional configurable/alternative behavior'.",

You'll normally never it in personal computers, because it's much more expensive; but for certain critical applications, a company or agency may decide to pay extra for it. ECC guards against memory corruption due to spontaneous magnetic flips in the physical storage medium, mostly from background radiation. This is not limited to, but includes cosmic rays, for which reason spontaneous bit flip increases with altitude and is worst in satellites (as u/MediumRay said). And of course, if a bit has spontaneously flipped, that bit could represent a variable in a comparand, or for that matter an operand.\n\nHow real is this problem as opposed to merely theoretical? Well, as I said, it's not enough of a problem to be worth fixing in personal computers, but still a concrete enough problem for there to be a manufacturing sector and a market for ECC RAM. People out there are paying a lot of money for this stuff, and probably for good reason. So in certain applications, it's a possibility real enough to pay money to mitigate.\n\nI don't think choice of language should be expected to have any effect. Ultimately an opcode is an opcode. The way to fix it is to buy ECC, not to program around it.",

I will however give you a great starting reference guide though - \n\n[https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)\n\nThis is a site that not only has documentation for just about anything you can do with HTML/CSS/Javascript(these three were as deep as we got) but also includes built in environments to start messing around and see what happens when you change different values. \n\nOne thing I do recommend though - learn HTML at least reasonably well before you move onto CSS. CSS is an *amazing* tool that basically acts as templates. It makes a lot of things much easier to do but it's important to know *how* they work under the hood if you want to really get your skills up. Trust me, HTML is not hard and you can get up to speed relatively quickly. Our course was like once a week for 12 weeks and by the end we could make functional websites with decent designs.\n\nOne amusing thing about HTML compared to other languages - it does not care how bad your coding is. It will try to run it anyway. You can have a garbled mess of garbage that god himself will not forgive under the hood and as long as the important parts are functional it'll still go, as opposed to other programming languages that tell you to die in a fire if you miss one bracket. Just something to keep in mind - your code may work despite being terrible(professor asked me \"what the hell is all this doing?\" one time when I had a solid 30 lines of broken code) so use some attention to detail to keep it clean.\n\nHope that helps a bit, best wishes!",

You can do else if statements for all the exceptions and errors you want to raise, but at the end of all of it, you can add 1 to the attempts, that way you're not repeating things",

Note that the last type argument of a `Func<>` is the return type. \n\nSo `Func<SomeObject, SomeOutput>` matches a method `SomeOutput MethodName(SomeObject arg)`\n\nSo instead of multiple ifs or switch statements, you can do something like this:\n\n```\nDictionary<string, Func<SomeObject, SomeOutput>> handlers;\n\nvoid Init()\n{\n    handlers.Add(\"A\", HandlerA);\n    handlers.Add(\"B\", HandlerB);\n}\n\nvoid Handle(string value)\n{\n    if(handlers.TryGet(value, out var handler))\n    {\n        var output = handler(input)\n    }\n    throw new ArgumentOrOfRangeException(nameof(value));\n}\n\nprivate SomeOutput HandlerA(SomeObject value)\n{\n    // Do something for for value A...\n}\n\nprivate SomeOutput HandlerB(SomeObject value)\n{\n    // Do something for for value B...\n}\n```",

Programming, especially once you can actually build cool Apps yourself can be very rewarding until it's not and you question why you even started. Just don't give up when you get to moments like that. Also don't let AI solve your problems. You might think you learned something if AI is doing the work but you actually didn't. If you gonna use AI then use it to ask questions about a concept you don't understand but don't vibe code your way to an app as you won't learn anything this way.",

Disclaimer: this is just my personal experience.\n\nWhat is really funny is that everyone assumes that physicists suck at coding. I have heard \"you're good for a physicist\" so many times, but I actually take it as a compliment. Most physicists don't care and want to make a throw away program. That's fine but if you want to learn how to make software that lasts longer than a single day, you obviously need to do something very different. I never really learned that systematically, I just kinda wanted to write stuff that was useful later, so I just naively tried to structure things more cleanly. I spent lots of time reading tutorials, reddit, other peoples code and whatnot. I did read \"Clean Code\" a year or so ago, and I thought it was ok but much is learned by trial and error, writing lots of bad code, rewriting it slightly better, changing the scope, trashing it again, and so on. Practice, practice, practice. And build nontrivial things, not just toy programs. If programs get big, you MUST apply some structure. I think you need to feel the pain of being stuck and then digging yourself out of that hole.\n\nSorry for the ramble, your post kinda resonated with me. Let me know what you think",

        "body": "If you want to learn a skill that will help you in the future regardless of it’s a job or your own business there really is two things that come to mind; soft skills and leadership skills. Soft skills are all about interaction with people and are very useful in the work place. They will help open a lot of doors regardless of industry. People in IT regardless of field have a very bad image with most people because a lot of us lack basics like conversation skills or team building. The old joke of a coder locked in a closet because no one wants to deal with him is what a lot of non technical people think of IT related jobs.\n\nLeadership skills are also very useful regardless of if you want to get into management or not down the line. Every project or team needs someone to lead it, why not you? It also helps with dealing with different levels of management. Something I learned a while ago is leaders don’t just lead those they are responsible for, they also lead their managers on up as well. Of the two this one has been very useful since I started developing it. \n\nAs for how to learn them; soft skills are mostly about interaction with people on a regular basis. Help desk jobs are great for learning them but going to classes about anything you are interested in person is a great start. Just get a conversation started and keep it going. One big skill to learn is active listening. As for leadership I can recommend a couple of books to get you started if you are interested.",

Feeling unsure about what to do next is completely normal, especially when you have multiple options in front of you.\n\nSince you mentioned interest in both full stack development and software development, here's a simple breakdown:\n\n# 1. If you want to become a Full Stack Developer:\n\nStart with web development. It's beginner-friendly, highly in demand, and offers a clear path. You can follow this roadmap:\n\n* HTML → CSS → JavaScript (vanilla)\n* Then move to React (frontend framework)\n* Learn Git/GitHub for version control\n* Then go into backend: Node.js + Express\n* For databases: MongoDB or PostgreSQL\n* Build real-world projects along the way\n\nThis path gives you visible, hands-on progress and prepares you for full stack roles.\n\n# 2. If you're aiming for general Software Development or Big Tech:\n\nThen continue with C++ and go deeper into Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). Companies like Google, Amazon, etc., focus heavily on problem-solving and core CS concepts. Your path could be:\n\n* Strengthen your C++ fundamentals\n* Learn DSA topics: arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.\n* Practice on platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces\n* Study core CS subjects: OS, DBMS, Networks, OOP\n\n# Still confused?\n\nTry both briefly spend a week or two on web dev, and then a week on DSA. See which one excites you more and where you feel more engaged. That’s usually a good signal for what path to follow.\n\nYou're not behind you’re just in the exploring phase, which is totally fine. Stay consistent, build small things, and clarity will come. You've got this!",

If you're processing less than 100,000 records I'd classify this adventure as \"premature optimization.\"\n\n> Would this even be the best way to implement what i want?\n\nIt depends.  Does this describe you?\n\n- You're willing to invest time and effort into mucking with low-level details of binary file handling\n- You don't need a working program quickly\n- You want to learn about handling large binary files\n- You're willing to write a lot of low-level unit tests of data handling\n- You're willing to accept some risk of data corruption bugs in production that you don't find in testing\n- You understand that adding more fields to your data, or the ability to look up fields based on something other than timestamp, is going to be a complicated extra feature\n- You're willing to accept the possibility of some subtle failure modes (e.g. it can be very tricky to write correct code in terms of atomicity and consistency)\n\n> if I want to remove parts and move everything back to \"fill in\" the space, it could lead to having to move very large amounts of data\n\nThis is called \"garbage collection\" and yep, it's a big design problem that pops up in lots of different applications.  You don't define \"very large\" but I would suggest planning for your garbage collection to take anywhere from a few seconds to several hours.\n\nOne option is to add a \"This record has been deleted\" flag to each record, then you can \"fast-delete\" by rewriting the byte that contains the flag (without moving anything else).  Then you could have a slow, infrequent garbage collection function that compacts everything.\n\nIf you want to avoid downtime, you should think about (slowly) writing the compacted data into new files in a separate thread while using the old file to answer queries.  Then you have some logic that quickly swaps to using the new file.\n\nOf course the easiest thing to do is just show the user a warning if, say, >20% of records are garbage.  Then it's up to the user to follow the procedure in the manual for running the garbage collection at a convenient time.\n\nI should also ask:  Do you know if (a) your deletion pattern is \"random\" / arbitrary, or (b) you always delete records in the order they were created?  If (b) you can simply delete each file as its records pass the \"too old\" threshold.  (The \"delete\" terminology usually implies (a), for situation (b) a clearer term would be \"log rotation\".)",

Programming is a trade, but instead of making building frames or plumbing or whatever we make software for people to use. So, you're talking about learning a new trade. \n\nSome of it is web sites.  From the little brochure web site for an electrician to, I dunno, TurboTax and other vast and complex stuff.\n\nSome of it is desktop software. Autocad, for example, is a really big and elaborate piece of desktop software constructed over many years by many master, journeyman, and apprentice tradespeople. We call them lead, senior, and junior developers. \n\nSome of it is mobile software. The reddit mobile app is an example.\n\nWe have \"boot camps\" to help people get started. https://freecodecamp.org/ is a good self-paced boot camp. There are many others.\n\nThe boys at Harvard offer their CS50 (computer science 50) class online for free, and you'll get a lot of really useful theory there. But keep in mind they are computer scientists. Think \"professors of mechanical engineering\". And most of us programmers use that theory to make useful stuff rather than to solve programming puzzles.\n\nThere's a related trade called IT (information technology). This one involves setting up and maintaining computers and networks and servers and all that stuff. It's not quite the same as programming, but just as helpful to end-users. If you have electrician chops, this could be a straightforward transition for you, because good wiring correctly installed is a critical success factor. It's possible you could do this under the IBEW umbrella (I think, I don't know from union stuff). \n\nWelcome to our trade. Like anything, you gotta practice. I hope to see something you made one day.",

Or, you may find something as slimmed down as Sublime works best for your particular taste.\n\nSeveral resources have been provided.

AWS, iPhone, Facebook, YouTube among others were all launched in that time period. There was massive growth every year as more people got cell phones, wanted apps and social networking and companies moved compute to the cloud. Fast forward to 2025, everyone who wants a mobile app has one, everyone who wants on the cloud is already there. What’s the iPhone moment now? LLMs? One of the reasons they are being pushed so much is that this is probably the only hypergrowth market around right now. While there will always be a need for engineers unless there is a heretofore unknown radical increase in demand, one that AI/offshoring can’t meet, the past 20 years of growth are gone. It’s a mature industry now.",

You don't actually have enough evidence to justify leaping to that conclusion. Big companies don't really operate in the way that you seem to think. Have you ever heard anecdotal stories where the janitor suggests something unusual to the CEO, that ends up saving a company millions of dollars? When that actually happens, the janitor is not usually the one who's actually put in charge of the global rollout of his good idea (nor is it his janitorial team/department), and at best the janitor gets a small bonus or maybe a one level promotion -- it's not as if the janitor suddenly becomes a VP off of one good idea.",

As your manager or mentor, I would want to work with you on that preoccupation because it can be career-limiting. Your focus should be on adding value rather than making sure you are getting “credit” for every thing you do. HR would tell you that is what your compensation is for and you can document on your self-assessment for your performance review. I would never utter the word “credit” again as this all transpires.\n\nHaving said that, this is a wonderful opportunity and quite flattering for anyone, never mind someone early in his career. \n\nI would suggest writing a lengthy email about your concerns. You can start it with, “As the architect of this process ….. it has come to my attention… and in order to ensure maximum success…. I want to make everyone is aware xxxxxxx” List the important stuff, like why you think this won’t scale and why each instance needs to be customized. But offer fixes to the problems as well. How can this be customized so that it does work for other departments? What work effort would be required? Be specific and as lengthy as you need to be, as you will be saving them time and possible embarrassment. Also, if it doesn’t scale, you could end up being blamed, (“who created this in the first place”)\n\nSend your email to all interested parties and cc: your boss. Again, make sure the email is emotionless, fact-based and solely focused on you trying to help the company and the team to succeed. Of course, this also serves as your documentation that you are the originator.\n\nTry not to assume the worst in people. You created something so good that an upper level manager thought it was good enough to scale to other departments. The higher up managers are, the less they know about what is happening on the ground, so don’t take it personally.",

I’ve been in contact with folks at my company since they first started layoffs in 2023. I personally know a couple of people who this summer are moving back in with their parents because they can’t land a job. That’s with my FAANG company in the resume. No it’s not Amazon or Meta. I know some with families who were forced to pack up and move across the country. I know some who got laid off after moving. I know some who can’t move their families so they have to fly across states every weekend just to be with them on the weekends. I know some who went from making 300k+ to around 150k - 80k. \n\nI don’t want to cause any alarm. But there are my personal anecdotes. I always try to keep in touch with coworkers, it’s just something I do. Yes, there are some who managed to land jobs at other high paying companies. But I’ve noticed that these people are either really smart or went to top colleges (Stanford, Cornell, MIT, etc). I went to a shitty state school and for the most part I’m severely average. Do I really want to be constantly grinding for the rest of my life? I’ve been interviewing candidates for the last 2 years. The level of talent is insane.

New grads and career changers are facing an especially tough time because companies are prioritizing candidates with direct full-time experience.\n\nPivots to consider- technical program management, business analyst in tech, implementation specialist, tech roles in traditional industries: banks, healthcare systems, and government agencies, sales engineering.\n\nAlso consider contract or part-time technical work through platforms like Toptal or directly with agencies.\nUse a service like Applyre to see what's out there. Also look into technical writing, training development, or even teaching coding bootcamps.\n\nYour education absolutely hasn't been wasted. The combination of technical skills and business knowledge is incredibly valuable, even if the current market isn't reflecting that. Economic cycles change, and your credentials will serve you well when conditions improve.",

Even people with solid backgrounds like yours are getting ghosted left and right. It's not a reflection of your worth or abilities, the hiring process is just broken in a lot of ways.\n\nSomething I've noticed works better than the traditional apply and pray approach is  that you need stuff people can actually see and touch. Your GPA and internships are great but recruiters want to see what you can build. Even small projects on GitHub that solve real problems can make a huge difference.\n\nAlso, have you considered bootcamps? I know it might seem like a step backward given your background, but sometimes the structured approach and job placement support is what breaks through. At Metana we've had people with CS degrees who just couldn't crack the interview process, and the hands-on training plus career support made all the difference.\n\nThe other thing is, what specific roles are you targeting? Sometimes pivoting within tech (like from pure SWE to product management, technical sales, or developer relations) can open doors that weren't there before.\n\nYour education definitely wasn't wasted even if it feels that way right now. Those problem solving skills transfer to pretty much anything. But I get the frustration, job hunting is soul crushing.\n\nTake a breather if you need to, but don't give up just yet :) The market will turn around.",

Generally speaking, if you are just building user-facing features, Android has a lower ceiling as most of the hard problems should be taken care of by the backend. You aren't going to build something out of a system design interview in your day to day.\n\nBut here are some examples where you CAN differentiate yourself:\n\n1) Building frameworks / features in a way that's easy to iterate on. What if your app wants to show every new UI screen with a certain template that serves a nice entrance and exit animation? Okay, now you have to build that animation out. But it would be inefficient for every engineer who wants to add a new screen to deal with that themselves, so you build it in a way with enough abstractions / modularity that it's easy to use for other use cases.\n\n2) Finding and solving problems that nobody knows exist, because they're not directly attributable to the product. Maybe your app startup time is too long, or you lose a lot of users while a certain page loads. You have the ability to improve this stuff and see incremental but significant gains in engagement.\n\n3) Influencing the backend / APIs - the backend doesn't always know exactly what's needed and what's possible from a mobile perspective, or edge cases that might arise. Being good at your job means you participate in these discussions, not just showing up to plug in their fully baked implementation to the mobile app\n\nI'd also add this: judging the value of an engineer solely in the context of \"What technically difficult problems can they build\" as if you need to be building something worthy of a case study in an algorithms textbook is a very junior way of thinking.",

In 2024 when I reached out, none of their companies were hiring devs anymore, or were actively laying them off, or my referrals had been laid off themselves.

Companies have been known to backchannel and torpedo candidates who have gone on public record bashing them. Especially in the tech world, it's not unheard of for one C-Suite to reach out to another to \"warn\" them about a problem candidate. A close friend of mine was let go after her first 2 weeks at a new company after the CEO of the company we both worked at got wind that she was trash-talking her experience on Facebook. He reached out to another exec at her new company, pointed out her posts, and said it would be risky to keep her on. \n\nAnother is that some companies love to sue. This is especially true when people sign a non-disparagement clause in a severance agreement. If a former employee starts talking shit and the company catches wind, you could lose out on your severance, they could come after you in court, or just make you suffer through a legal fight you likely can't afford. \n\nAs much as I would love to expose the garbage companies I've worked for, it's not without it's risks and frankly, many folks aren't in a position to defend themselves.",

Let me give you my perspective.  \n  \nI think your questioning isnt only about software engineering itself. It touches how we roll our lives on the big picture.\n\nAs humans, our likes change over time, **and this is completely fine.**\n\nOh gosh, if only you knew how cruel it is to realize for the first time you dont like to do that activity anymore that just a couple of years ago you could do with your hands tied. Did you lose yourself somewhere?\n\nAnswer: no. Actually, you still like to do it, you just dont have that blasting flame anymore, and its ok. You cant lose yourself, because you *are* yourself. But you have to know that yourself is not static, it will change. And so will you. \n\nSo now, you can bang your head against the wall wondering why you are no longer the person you were 10 years ago, or you can recognize that you may have changed, and if that is the case, welcome this change with open arms. After all, this is still you. Why reject it?\n\nBut I understand that everything may still feel blurry to you, as it is often the case when we have ourselves facing such big changes. So maybe you're best off waiting before moving. You know the saying, la nuit porte conseil. In your case, you may need many nuits. You already gave a BIG step: acknowledging that you may be changing. Now, give time to time, to see how this will unfold. Maybe it's just a phase. Maybe not, and you need time for your mind to recognize the change, to stick to it, to decide that you you want to live by it from now on, and to be able to justify itself to you, so that when you ask yourself why you changed, it can reassure you that you did it because it felt better that way.\n\nIn any case, dont rush to find it out. A definitive position will click when you least expect.  \n  \nAnd if its just a phase, well, I think you know how to go on with your life then.\n\nIf its not, remember you will feel 'empty' during some time during the transition, and this is a part of the process. Transitioning can take longer than you expect, but profit from every moment. Do things you wouldnt do in other times, and remember something really cool awaits you. Sooner or later, you will be gifted with new likes and will feel complete once again.",

Are you open to interviewing outside of Vancouver, maybe even in the US? \n3. Curious how you’re fitting all of that experience on a resume.

Mostly to pivot and be eligible for new grad/student recruiting pipelines again. \n\nYour best bet is to continue doing internships and get a return offer.

The good news is that your background is genuinely impressive and you're not starting from zero like most new grads.\n\nStop delaying graduation - you're essentially in limbo right now and employers can sense that uncertainty. Graduate in August and commit fully to the job search, but expand your geographic scope beyond Vancouver. Toronto, the US, or even remote opportunities could open doors that Vancouver simply can't right now. The trades and military options aren't bad backup plans, but don't abandon tech when you're this close to breaking through. Get your resume professionally reviewed, practice your interview skills extensively, and consider contract or startup roles that might be more willing to take a chance on someone with your background.\n\nI'm on the team that made [interview AI](http://interviews.chat), and I've seen how much difference it makes when people can practice handling tough interview questions and get real-time feedback on their responses - it might help you convert those eventual interviews into offers.",

Lean into the benefits of being in a city not flooded by big tech layoffs. If you make a good enough impression you can get your foot in the door before the company even posts the job.

I'll do this for the time being until I can land a much better-paying job that's at least IT-related or adjacent.\n\nAt this point, it's just outright borderline impossible to even get your foot in the tech work field door right now because there's just no way to get the necessary experience without time-traveling back to the past when entry-level jobs still existed or without compromising a lot of money(certain certifications, unpaid personal projects, volunteer, etc.). \n\nIt's also gotten rather tiresome for me to see quite a lot of out-of-touch folks in so many CS subreddits making the boomer assumptions that all of the latest CS grads who are unemployed are just too unqualified and incompetent for any job in tech and that they supposedly didn't try to get internships during college. They conveniently ignore that even CS internships have gotten a lot more incredibly competitive, selective, and oversaturated now than ever because they're aren't negatively affected by today's poor job market, especially in tech.\n\nOn the bright side with my temp agency work, despite not paying a liveable enough salary, at least the job itself was pretty laid-back in my experience when I briefly did it during my short time off from college before graduating.\n\nSorry for this TL;DR-length comment.

I made it to the late stages with five different companies, all past the technical round. But was rejected from three. I was able to end the prices with one when I got the offer at my current job \n\nWhat follows is my anecdotal experience. Companies are extremely picky right now. I would feel really strong about my interview performance. I would connect with the hiring managers and the CEO or CTO. I would feel great about my technical round performance. Then I wouldn't get the role. The reasons given, because I would always ask for feedback, were typically that I performed well, but someone was a better fit. Which makes sense. There were probably five hundred or more applicants. But a few of those I would see the same job posted a week or two later, those were frustrating. \n\nMy advice is to keep a pipeline going. You want a few of those initial recruiter interviews a week so that you have a couple of technical and later stage interviews going at all times. The process seems slower than it used to, like a month or longer from application to offer. \n\nAnd give yourself grace. This is really difficult and you are going to get down on yourself. My wife described it like buying a house, you get really attached to an idea of a place where you start imagining yourself only to be out bid.

Compared to the Netherlands, the US is a massive country where each role and each company and each city will lead to a VERY different life. \n\nIf you move to the US you might be working 80 hour weeks with barely enough to pay rent and get laid off after 2 months, OR you might work 40 hour weeks, earn $300k+, have plenty of vacation days, and stay at the same place for 5/10/15+ years. \n\nSo, my advice:\n- Apply around to roles in mid- or large-sized cities (NYC, Seattle, Chicago, etc.)\n- Interview IN PERSON (do not assume anything about a company based purely on what they sell you during an online interview - make sure their success is tangible) and thoroughly research employee reviews \n- Only accept an offer if your gross income will be 2x the household median income or higher FOR THAT SPECIFIC AREA \n- Do not actually move until you have signed an offer and your start date is <2 weeks away \n- Keep an emergency fund of at least $30k \n\nIn general, just be smart about it and you’ll be fine. \n\nEdit: just want to mention that this advice is specially for OP. Someone with less experience or who lives in the US already doesn’t need to have as high of standards. ",

They might only have 2 weeks PTO, might be 100% in the office, might have a terrible company culture, are extremely low paying (less than 104k), etc.\n\nFor others, it's great. They have 4-7 weeks PTO, are hybrid, or even fully remove, with a great company culture that is extremely high paying.\n\nAnd a million flavors in-between. There is no single concept of being a SWE in the US. There is a ton of variety.\n\nMy main advice is to never move before you actually have a job lined up. Don't move to SF with the hopes that the move will land you a good job, because there's a real possibility that it won't. If you want to move to SF, look for jobs in SF, and only move once you find one you like, that meets all your personal criteria.\n\nAs for COL, AI, and google searches aren't good here. Don't rely on a calculator to tell you that you need to earn $X. Living in a big city is inherently different than living in the burbs. Those calculators try to project what it would cost for you to buy a 2-3 BR house in the middle of the city, which is obviously millions. But in reality, nobody living in the city is buying a 2-3 BR house. They're buying a 0-1BR condo. It's an inherent difference in lifestyle. Calculators don't take that into account. They're also not great at taking into account neighborhoods. If you want to live frugally, you can absolutely find neighborhoods that are cheaper. If you want to live extravagently, you can absolutely find neighborhoods for that too. Calculators just average out an entire city, as if there aren't 100 neighborhoods within that city each with their own COL and culture.\n\nCompute the COL difference on your own. When I moved from the Midwest to the East Coast, I actually looked for apartments that were in an area I wanted to live in. That gave me a realistic number of what it would cost for me to move, and what my COL hike would be. Find apartments you would *actually* live in. That's your COL increase.",

Either way that's a physiotherapist/doctor issue. \n\nDepression would be a therapy thing, I imagine that it's linked to your health too. I'd be pretty sad too if I had to live with chronic pain. \n\nDon't worry about your girlfriend, if she's good for you she won't leave you because you lost your job.. but the caveat is that she might have a chat with you or *consider* leaving you because you're not willing to fix your situation. No woman in the world wants to play mother to their boyfriend (unless they're abused or manipulative). Either way, you're smart and driven enough to work in this industry I'm sure that wouldn't be the reason a good girl would leave you. But your depression and anxiety? it might contribute, not specifically because you have depression or anxiety, but because of what depression and anxiety can do to you and those around you. So you need to really lock in and get those things sorted. How? idk, therapy? but ask someone more qualified than me (probably a therapist lol). \n\nAt the end of the day, no matter what job you pick you still have to pick a flavour of shit to eat. I've worked everything from warehousing, labouring, construction to office based engineering.. all are good and all can be shit. \n\nAt the worst you could probably try a more \"chill\" job that pays less, like part time stocking shelves or something.

During that time the employer has 3 chances to attempt to acquire a H1B to retain the worker.

Then ~6-12 months after all that they're owning major enhancements on their own or they've found employment elsewhere willingly or otherwise.\n\nSenior engineers own entire product areas assigned to a product team. Product manager wants shiny new feature in the shipping module, senior engineer on the shipping team works with UI/UX and architecture to design it and implement it.\n\nStaff+ engineers own entire business domains or product verticals -- using my previous example, we have a few staff+ people in \"logistics\".

It’s a small team and everyone on it really loves their work so it’s very fast paced and I get to make meaningful contributions all the time which is great. I am a junior and have a ton to learn but with it being a small but stable team I am able to work on a lot of real work with real contributions which is nice, I am never sitting there trying to find something to do and was given really good training which I think is rare.",

Having regular production incidents implies you have a fragile product. That's a problem. It's not sustainable.\n\nThat's one of the main things I focus on during the reverse-interview process. I really dig deep into on call rotations, how frequent calls are, when the last incident was, what the response was during that last incident, etc.\n\nUnless I'm unemployed and desperate, I will not join a company that says they get after hours calls more than a few times ***a year***. Let alone per week. The type of company you join is very much in your control.\n\nThere is a bit of a differentiation between after-hours calls and business-hours calls though. During business hours there's all sorts of support issues to work through, but I'd never really describe them as all hands on deck critical production incidents. Either way, during business hours I'm OK with incidents. That's stuff I work through as a normal part of my job. It's the after hours prod fires that I'm not OK with.\n\nHere's my anecdotes for after-hours on call incidents:\n\nCompany 1: I was called once in my 3.5 years here. The team as a whole was called a couple times I think. There weren't any during business-hours support fires either.\n\nCompany 2: Across 5 years, there was a single after-hours prod fire I had to deal with. There were some small fires during business hours, but nothing major. Even if we didn't get them fixed during business hours, we'd just wait until the next day to fix it, so it was a very casual business as usual.\n\nCompany 3: Across 2.5 years, 0 after hours calls. This company was a bit of a shit show, so they had a lot of small fires during business hours, but again nothing was ever serious enough that it couldn't wait until tomorrow morning. We were not working after 5pm.\n\nCompany 4: Only been here a year, but so far 0 after hours calls.",

        "body": "I had a guy like that on my team. He wanted the whole codebase changed basically and when he didnt get his way he'd go to Jr engineers PR and lightly suggest these nitpicky changes. \n\nI dont mind changing a variable name or a method name or even a small refactor in a file I am touching. Things that wont add a shitload of time to the PR. Like if im already making a change to a file and someone had a nitpick comment I think I can quickly add, ill add it. \n\nBut sometimes in the cases where it is beyond the scope of the PR I think doing what Sidereel said is the way to go. Most jobs reveiw you on your PRs and output. If it doesnt have a task, then they assume you didnt do it. Even if you do it yourself, it's better to create a seperate task because now you have the proof that you worked on something. Like let's say your task involves, creating a new method in Foo class to make Foo multithreaded or some BS like that. Principal Engineer who loves to nitpick, adds \"since you are touching this file, this other irrelevent method (let's call someMethod) just doesnt look good in this file and would be better used in Boo class. Please move it to Boo class\" When you look into it, you realize Foo::someMethod gets called in a few files that could take at least an hour of your time to fix, build, test, etc. You can either change it in the current PR because it's easier than having to create a new branch, rebuild, retest, etc. But the downside is when the current PR gets checked, you wont get credit for that refactor becuase that wasnt part of the task. So your manager will see all the tasks you have completed and he wont give you credit for that refactor. He will view it as the PR took you longer than it should've.   \nBut if you create a seperate task, sure it might not get fixed right away but once you do it, you will get credit for the refactor. Software enginneering is about playing the game. A piece of advice I heard was, it's better to do two tasks and show your manager all the work you did than to do 10 tasks and not say anything about it.  \n\nSome higher level engineers dont care about your career that much they care to get what they want in the codebase. They have the belief that it's on you to defend your career (which it is) and if you are going to be a pushover than so be it. \n\nI learned that mistake a little too late. When the higher level engineer ask for something, I did it with little pushback. I wasnt afraid to say something I just didnt think it was a big deal. But then my PRs had more iterations than they should've and would spend an extra day or two longer due to some of these changes this guy wanted. Guess what was said in my review session? That my PRs take a bit too long and have a bit too much iterations. Guess who told my manager that? The higher level engineer. \n\nI think if it takes too long and is outside of the range of the PR, just politely say \"I gave it a quick look. It seems that this is outside of the scope of the ticket. WE can have a quick chat and if it's really needed I can create a seperate ticket for this.\"",

It's not something managers give people right away at the first sign of poor performance. It's something managers give people they already plan to fire. It's a paper trail. That's the sole purpose of a PIP, to serve as a legal paper trail of poor performance so you can't claim the company wrongfully terminated you.\n\nYou should absolutely start applying to other companies.\n\nOne aside though... it sounds like you're blaming all of this on the fact that you're quiet, don't chit-chat, do your work, and leave. Are you sure that's the cause? I'm quiet, I don't chit-chat, I do my work, and I leave, but I've never had issues like this. I've had bad managers before, but it doesn't have anything to do with my introvertedness. Just ask yourself that question.

The fact that it was a \"stupid\" mistake doesn't reflect poorly on you at all, especially since you weren't the one who introduced it. What matters is that you identified a critical performance bottleneck, diagnosed the root cause of database deadlocks, and implemented a solution that increased concurrent request capacity by 50x. That's the kind of impact that makes interviewers sit up and take notice.\n\nThe startup context actually works in your favor here because it shows you can thrive in environments where you have to wear multiple hats and solve complex problems with limited resources. Frame it as a story about your problem-solving process - how you noticed the performance issues, investigated the database connection patterns, identified the deadlock scenario, and engineered a fix that dramatically improved system scalability. Interviewers love hearing about real-world debugging skills and measurable improvements to system performance. I'm on the team that built [ interview AI](http://interviews.chat), and this is exactly the type of technical story that tends to trip people up when they're trying to present it effectively, so having a tool to help you practice articulating the impact and technical details can make all the difference in landing the role.",

At the time the max db connections was about 10 which to many of us didnt make sense because the design was meant to be more than 500. Through various debugging and unit testing skills I discovered that there was a potential deadlock that went unnoticed. I presented my findings to the team and after resolving the issue we starting seeing the max db connections go up to 500 as expected\".\n\nMaybe tie in the business impact of it too. Like it saved the company millions of dollars in troubleshooting or some BS.\n\nI dont see how this story makes you look bad. You didnt make the error, you found it and fixed it. Honestly, debugging skills is something that many companies value. Because many of these codebases are complicated especially in databases. If you can find a difficult bug in a large and bad quality codebase, you can defientely do it in a large, better code quality one. I would leave it and use it as an example.

Each product manager has a different set of skills. Each product demands a different set of skills.\n\nThere is inwards and outwards focused parts of the job. I've seen plenty of introverted product managers so long as you can still articulate and do the coordination part of the role, not every product manager is the energy spewer.\n\nYou can understand whether you will succeed in product management by the views you take on things as a developer. How much you prioritise the business goals over the technical goals (etc, etc).\n\nDo you feel comfortable taking what the team is telling you and communicating that to leadership (spending time on powerpoint, and project management software to communicate this). Do feel comfortable interpreting and communicating changing demands from the leadership to the team?\n\nI will regularly talk about what I don't know and the path gaining that knowledge. Having said that tools like NotebookLM and equivalent have made it much easier to become a rapid expert on a given subject.\n\nGaps in CVs depend heavily on how you sell it. Selling it as T shaped individual is an amazing way to make yourself look better not worse. I've taken large amounts of time off and live a fairly unorthodox life (nomadic) and if anything it's helped my career rather than hindered it. I'm seen as a little bit crazy and edgy and that helps break preconceptions.\n\nThings like taking up sailing or other activities can be a great way of demonstrating that you have depth. Writing and art are both things that are very shareable and show passion. Being an amazing writer can be a great way of enhancing your (introvert focused) communication.\n\nLong and short though is that I wouldn't lie at all. I would definitely take everything you believe about yourself and spin it to explain why that would make you a good product manager. Every development experience that exposed you to good and bad product management. Every time you stepped in to wear that hat.\n\nI'm expecting there to be a real hybridization of some of these roles anyway over the next few years with the increasing impact of AI, so enhancing your skills on this side is a wise move regardless of whether you become a fulltime product manager.",

That intellectual honesty built more trust than any amount of confident bullshitting ever could. \n\nYour dev background gives you a massive advantage because you actually understand what's possible and what's painful to build, which is surprisingly rare. Own that art/writing gap. It shows you think differently and have a broader perspective on user experience and storytelling, both crucial for PM work. \n\nThe buzzword thing is spot-on; the best PMs translate complex ideas into simple language that engineers, designers, and executives all understand differently. If you want to level up your PM knowledge systematically, Product Alliance has some of the most comprehensive interview prep and frameworks I've seen. Their modules cover everything from product sense to execution and they're particularly strong on teaching you how to structure your thinking without relying on empty jargon. \n\nDon't fake being someone else.

I also studied like crazy for each interview and prepped according to reviews posted on Glassdoor. \n\nIn my hunt, i found a lot of jobs that were hiring where one could “get by” while still applying. Think local/state government contracts as well as contracting for companies. Pay was fine, benefits sucked, but those seemed easiest to get. \n\nSo the answer is, it depends. \n\nNot counting the BS applications i sent out after accepting this offer to keep unemployment, i was at 35 total.

The work piled up, as I was expected to be an IC sometimes, help other ICs, run a team, and help run a department. Meanwhile, the pay did not scale with the work, and in fact the job opportunities compared to IC opportunities were not as sustainable. This meant less jobs open, and lower salaries at the top end compared with other senior engineering positions. \n\nI feel that you have to find the right situation with a manager who can effectively protect your time and scope, so you aren't doing too much. You also need help, politically, so you're not swimming upstream against people more senior than yourself. Of course, you have to be pretty dedicated to doing a good job, on top of that. It's a lot. \n\nI do believe that there are probably thousands of successful engineering managers/leads, but I also believe that many are burned out or are burning out. Maybe if you feel excited, it's worth trying, but if you keep getting burned out, it's time to retreat back to the IC world. I'm honestly still trying to figure out what I'd do next. Good luck OP and let me know if you have any questions. I was a team lead/engineering manager for several years at big banks, with 30 total YOE.",

I love being a people leader but when times are hard - political storms, scope cuts and bad decisions being forced on you/ your team - it can be super demoralizing. But you need to push on and remind yourself that you’re doing this for your team.\n\nUnder performers should be easy to spot - if an associate's deadlines are slipping or their deployments are shoddy/ causing issues - ask them to walk you through the task, since you recently were an engineer you should be able to easily tell where the holdups are. You can start by asking them where the holdups are and see what they say/ take it from there. The goal is two fold - teach/unblock and diagnose the situation (how unrealistic an ask vs how much of this was them)",

Not everyone on my team has the skills to manage epic level work streams, but everyone is forced to try. Once you can delegate the work streams, the job then becomes about planning what those work streams will be, coordinating the various stakeholders, and inevitably dealing with whatever crisis comes up.\n\nWhen an engineer is under-performing, it's on them to ask for the help they need. With 8 people on the team, that's a lot of individual work to over see, and I imagine it'd be all consuming. Therefore, it's okay to look out for the engineers on your team, make sure they have the work streams they need for a good review, but you need to let them do the work and decide when they need help. I'll never be able to apply my own standards to under-performers, but to some extent doesn't it doesn't matter. If an engineer isn't a net benefit to the project, and I can't help them become one, I just involve management and we deal with it that way. Team lead is not a people management job: it's not command, but the soft power of influence.\n\nAt least on my team, as a lead I try to focus on three things: planning, communication with other teams, and review of our execution. Most of my focus is on long term planning, and the sprint plans are basically up to the engineers. After all, the team lead is in a unique position of owning the outcome of the team, that all parts fit together and contribute to whatever goal management put you on. From that view, the single most important thing you can do is ensuring the project is going in the right direction.\n\nDoing a great job as a team lead, you'll essentially make yourself redundant. Most of the work you are describing, could be by the people on the team with only a little coordination cost.",

The rest of the world is generally less so, you will need to achieve a high level of fluency before you will have any luck looking for work and even then, there are some cultures (ex. Germany, Turkiye, most of eastern Europe) that would rather hire someone from that culture who speaks English over an outsider who speaks their language. You will never have priority over someone from that culture, unless you offer a particular technical skillset that they can't find. This is xenophobia imo but it is what it is.\n\n2. People tend to be misled by online courses claiming they can become fluent in 3-6 months. You can learn the basics of many languages quickly, but actual fluency can take years, especially if you want to read and write Mandarin. In terms of professional development and career payoff, the ROI relative to effort is very low. You could learn several new tech stacks well in the time it would take you to learn Mandarin.\n\n3. The tech industry works primarily in English. One of my former employers had teams in China and Portugal that I worked closely with and it wasn't uncommon for them to discuss technical problems in English.\n\nI speak several languages to a relatively high degree of fluency and, while it's a great hobby for personal growth, the payoff is really poor for career opportunities.

Really only you can answer this question, because the answer is very much a personal preference based on what's important to *you*.\n\n>15 vacation days vs 25\n\nFor example, this on its own makes the decision a no-brainer for me. I'd choose Squarepoint. WLB is the #1 priority in my career. 15 vs 25 vacation days is *significant.* No amount of TC, outside of \"fuck you money\", would ever make me give up 10 vacation days.\n\n>5 days in office vs 4\n\nSame here.... this by itself makes the decision a no-brainer for me. Way back in 2016 when I got my first hybrid job I made a promise to myself I'd never work at a 100% onsite company again. Amazon would be breaking that promise. Whereas I could deal with 4 days in-office.\n\nAmazon also doesn't have a great reputation for WLB those things aside. That would also give me serious pause.\n\nBut all those are things important to *me*. They might not matter at all to you, maybe you want to pursue TC, it sounds like Amazon might be offering more money. What's the yearly bonus like? Sign-on bonus is a one time deal so I'm not sure if I'd rely on that $190k TC holding up for your 2nd year.",

From my experience, 99% of new devs (interns, salaried, contract, whatever) get that same feeling when jumping into an established company with an established codebase. No reasonable person will expect you to \"just get it\" right off the bat. Keep asking questions until it clicks. It's the only way you will learn.\n\nThat said, what I wish I had done much sooner was to just spend time with the software. Poke around. Get a feel for what the user's experience will be. Try to understand what problem it is that your software is trying to solve.\n\nFor me, I jumped into smart agriculture development with zero farm experience. It wasn't until I sat in a combine and just drove around for a day that I understood why x button is there, why menu z is nested in menu y, etc.\n\nFrom there, you can start to understand the hows and whys of the software design. Most frameworks just tackle one area (except maybe for the \"we've got it all\" frameworks like Qt), so understand what frameworks/middleware you're using and, more importantly, why you're using it.\n\nAnother thing you can do it almost any industry is look at other people's PRs. Presuming the title is \"fixed a bug where x would happen when you do y\", make a chain in your head between x and y and the chunk of code that was modified. It's a decent way to start connecting those dots. Plus, informally, it looks very good if you can say \"oh yeah, I saw something about that in Tim's PR\" since it shows you're engaged and taking an active interest.\n\nOn a less technical note, nobody gets mad at the new guy for asking questions because they understand it's all a lot to take in. They have all been exactly where you are right now. What people DO get upset with is a developer who has been onboard for 6 months, a year, 3 years, or whatever and still doesn't know some of the basic things. Ask questions, take organized notes.\n\nOtherwise, if you have any specific questions about the industry you're in, what frameworks you're using, etc, feel free to ask her and we can lend a hand or at least point you in the right direction!",

Pretty much every first time intern will experience the imposter syndrome. The company knows you’re still a student. The company knows that the point of an internship is to learn. You are not dumb, my friend.\n\nMy advice is to find a colleague, maybe someone in your team or someone who’s working on something you’re curious about/interested in, and schedule a 30 minute meeting with them. Ask them about their journey and their role in the company. And then talk to them about yourself and your journey. If you like the conversation, make it a point to speak to them regularly. Congratulations, you just got yourself a mentor.\n\nThe mentor will look out for you. They’ll give you some guidance and hopefully show you the ropes. They can help you parse the code base. And if they don’t have an exact answer, chances are they know someone who does. They’ll help facilitate those other connections. See, something you learn is that people love flattery. And there’s nothing more flattering than a young person latching on to you and seeking you out because you gave them clarity. That’s the power of networking.\n\nBest of luck out there. Deep breaths.

The reality is that your academic background gives you skills many traditional developers lack - you can talk to stakeholders, understand complex problems, and build solutions from scratch without hand-holding. However, big tech companies might worry about your code quality, collaboration skills, and knowledge of industry best practices since you've been working solo. The key is being upfront about what you know and what you're eager to learn, rather than trying to oversell your experience.\n\nYou're not really overqualified for mid-level positions - you're differently qualified, which can work in your favor if you frame it right. Focus on the problem-solving aspects, the full ownership you've taken of projects, and your ability to work independently, but also emphasize your excitement about learning team dynamics and industry standards. Many companies actually love hiring PhD holders because you bring analytical thinking and persistence that's hard to teach. The trick is convincing them in interviews that you can adapt to their environment and that your unconventional path is an asset, not a liability. I'm on the team that built [interview copilot AI](http://interviews.chat) to help navigate those tricky \"explain your background\" questions that can make a huge difference in landing the right role.",

I joined the industry more than a decade ago, and things have already changed substantially. Even if we assume AI takes the first rung of coding jobs, the difficult part of software was never writing code, it's figuring out what we need the code to do, navigating various corporate processes, and knowing that the code we write will work as we intend it. What I see happening, is that in 5-10 years, programmers will be super-efficient, and our job will look more like a tech or team lead that serves as the owner for the code and interfaces with management and stakeholder.\n\nAnyway, software isn't going anywhere, it's going to continue changing, but no matter what, we're going to have more software in 20 years than we do today, and someone is going to have to build it, or at least be the person responsible for it.\n\nJob security in software doesn't come down to the coding skills, it comes down to all the non-coding skills you have. Are you experienced enough to learn new concepts? Can you lead a team? How well do you do working on ambiguous problems? Do you have a track record of producing results in difficult environments? How well do you work with others? These are the driving questions that determine employ-ability. You'll learn how to pass software coding assessments in school, but after that, employ ability boils down to the ability to contribute to companies bottom line. That's never going to change!",

If a listing has been live for more than two weeks with no hiring manager activity, pops up every quarter with the same wording, and shows fewer than five employee views from the company on LinkedIn, it’s probably resume-fishing. I always DM a current team member asking, \"Did this role open internally?\" – no reply or confusion is a red flag. Also watch the applicant count: 200+ resumes in 48 hours with no status change usually means the req is on hold. Instead of grinding those, push referrals; a thirty-second ping to an alum landed me three real interviews this year. I’ve used Huntr to track applications and Simplify to autofill forms, but JobMate is what I ended up using because it actually submits apps for me while I network. Ghost jobs are real, learn to spot them early.",

Creating an academic class is a lot of work. At a minimum, the syllabus is set at the beginning of the semester. In a fast moving field, that is plenty of time to get behind. In reality, courses are written and then used for several years, so you’re probably years away from the cutting edge. Working with it in the field is by far the best way to keep up.\n\nIt sounds like what you’re actually after is an excuse to leave employment.",

It's also an intersection of computer science and maths. Most people here are more theoretically maths/stats heavy. Think advanced stochastic theory, measure theory, etc.\n\nIf you want to be.in the camp of majority of people here / software engineers that want to be implementing, building, or having sufficient conceptual knowledge around AI / ML - then you can get it from any combination of uni, self study, work and practical experience.\n\nMost unis offering these programs are masters by coursework. Some might have a small thesis component or project at the end. A masters by coursework is just units/subjects similar to your undergraduate. Most people take them to shift into a new field. A master by research is for those considering dipping their toes in research - effectively \"create new body of knowledge and how to build on others research\". It's more likely for someone to upgrade their masters by research to a PhD. They are two different purposes.\n\nFor your situation - \n\nYou could consider a masters coursework and supplement it with practical experience and self study. \n\nThe industry moves fast and you still won't learn things that people talk about now that trendy like mcp, ai agents, LLM, rag, all those tools people talk about like cursor / Claude etc.  These are just implementations / practical applications and they will change quick, some will be adopted and accepted and other dropped.\n\nThe masters program would be useful if you need a planned study program and if you wanted theoretical foundation that underpin AI  (provided the uni program unit) such as statistical learning, machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning Bayesian theory... How hopfield neutral networks work , Monte Carlo etc work. Remember ML / AI is actually intersection of CS and Maths. So when you pick a uni program, make sure it has a balance of CS and Stats. If you really wanted to go deeper, your maths level will need to go deeper.",

Are new masters graduates who actually like doing ML getting jobs? Absolutely. They do need to be from a \"top\" university, however. (PhD hiring is, as ever, less prestige-obsessed, but it's still pretty bad.)\n\n\nThe tricky part for you is your level of experience. The typical ML masters new grad has 0-2 years of experience and should expect to be busted down to entry level. You should expect that, too, just with a faster promotion path. Whether that's acceptable to you is a different question.",
