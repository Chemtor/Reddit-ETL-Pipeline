You're correct that this stack is overengineered for *a simple case* of anomaly detection.\n\n>Could you have achieved the same outcome with far fewer dependencies/failure points?\n\nAbsolutely. A very simple, yet very error-prone, stack could be: direct DB writes + Postgres + pg\\_cron/cron + dashboard.\n\n>What could you scale to with a far simpler stack?\n\nThat simple stack can handle tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of events per minute. The real problem is not just the raw throughput, but the architectural fragility. This is tightly coupled and brittle, and has other issues apart from scalability:\n\n* Adding another consumer requires us to change the existing architecture/code\n* DB failure causes data loss and downstream reporting failures\n* Schedulers like pg\\_cron/cron lack automatic retries and timeouts\n\n>Would this stack you have built be required for the typical workloads you'd be working with in a real system?\n\nYes. These patterns are fundamental to high-volume data platforms. I've chosen each component to solve specific problems that emerge with high data volumes, complex workflow orchestration, and advanced processing requirements, though not all of them may be required in every case.\n\nThank you for your feedback.

Take every opportunity to learn. Take online courses and build things. I became a DE by taking a bunch of courses, presenting a business case that transitioning to DE software could save us money, and building it. Now I use it to solve every problem I can to build my skills. I even did the courses on the clock to meet my company's yearly training time goal.\n\nYou mentioned contractors, you may not have a senior employee, but those contractors know more than you. Hire them to do the things you don't know how to do, and then have them teach you. Include it in the SOW as \"knowledge transfer\" or \"support time\". This is literally how I learned a bunch of Azure products. Now the next time that task comes up, you know how to do it, and you don't have to hire the contractor.\n\nLastly, get a project manager. Make the case that you can't be in meetings AND be building stuff, and that having a PM will save you on contractor costs by letting you build more things yourself.\n\nLeverage your company for your personal growth, it's a win-win.",

Your opportunities are expanding and you still have probably 25-35 years to pick up anything you missed.",

It seems to me that Spark features in \"big\" (for a varying definition of \"big\") projects and platforms a lot. Polars seems to feature in smaller projects and platforms a lot. Postgres seems to feature in older, more RDBMS-driven architectures a lot too. But this isn't a stack, just \"some things I've seen\".\n\nI am not experienced enough to *really* say, but I can propose a \"hot-take\" theory of why this is. I am not myself very confident in this, again. But the argument goes like this:\n\nA standard stack in our industry will not be possible without a standard stack in web/backend. Fundamentally, data is a byproduct of a company's main business at first. A company may become \"data mature\" or \"data driven\" by converting this byproduct into a core loop of the business, in fact even its moat, but no one starts a company with \"data driven\". When you're starting a company, you can build software that will become your moat, but you can't \"build data\". In effect, I think by the time a company starts even thinking about data engineers, it is already stuck with some existing and effectively immutable architectural components, and our systems must use tooling that plays nice with those. So until these upstream components become standardized (e.g. the SQL/noSQL war in OLTP land finishes definitively, REST is fully replaced by gRPC, etc) - our systems won't.",

        "body": "Edit - I can’t believe I missed this. in the near future we are going to see an enormous change with AI writing code. It’s possible that the offshore resources will be entirely replaced with AI coding. It’s also possible that companies will demand generalized data professionals (kimball, analytical engineering, master data management, etc) and then those generalized people will just instruct AI to build solutions in the technology of the year. If this starts to become the trend, then you’ll no longer need to keep up with mastering what language or platform is the yearly favorite and focus more on implementing value - how to ensure AI assisted code generation is working successfully at your company. This would be a very interesting and disruptive time to be a data professional! (If it happens)\n\n\n——————————-\n\n\nOne of the things I’m keeping my eye on is whether companies start switching develops each time management attends a conference and decides to change their stack. To be clear - I’m not seeing it now - but here’s the scenario I’m looking out for. \n\n\n1) outsource DE to India. \n2) hire X dev’s with current stack\n3) management changes mind on stack\n4) replace current India team with new India team who know new stack\n5) repeat yearly, each time manager attends conference\n\nThis catches my attention because of 1) the current trend of tools changing quickly, 2) the enormous availability of cheap labor offshore. \n\nKeep in mind, if managers want to do this, they will have no issue finding offshore bodies to fill roles.\n\nSo - as an onshore senior/lead Im happy I’m deep into a business domain (subject matter expert) and would be needed for more then my coding skills. \n\nIf you are worried about this scenario you might start by asking how you can fit into this paradigm. If a company won’t hire you because you are not a 10 year expert on an acronym that was invented 2 months ago - then can you fit into a leadership/guidance position to enable “hot swappable” developers? I point back to the other comment in this thread - do you know Kimball? Do you know business processes, business data, and how to mature raw data into actionable insights which can reduce cost and increase revenue? If the answer is yes, you will likely be ok. If the answer is if no - I just know SSIS and I really can’t do anything unless my team lead holds my hand - then I would set some goals for career development.",

It's just that most data projects don't need this scaling and would benefit more from the speed and strong guarantees of an OLTP, as understood by Duck Lake.",

A lakehouse is just storage plus some transform and serve. A streaming platform is just ingest plus a bit of transform. The tools evolve, but the functional flow is the same.\n\nThat Exasol guide you shared is good for grounding, and pairing it with hands-on projects (like building a mini pipeline with Fivetran → Snowflake → dbt → Looker) really locks it in.",

I managed a team doing the platform work in this case, and we did build some great stuff: a linter that would block PRs if the SQL was messy, really useful costing analysis comparing actuals to planned budget, etc, etc.  But it was a brutal fight to attempt to prevent the entire solution from collapsing under the weight of tech debt.  It would have been far easier to have actual engineers build the data pipelines.\n   * In most of the data engineering teams I'm on we also build the platform anyway: all the reusable code, libraries, extra tooling for deploying models, quality-control checks on the data, etc, etc.",

You can definitely learn to code in those but reviewing, refactoring, and optimizing takes a lot of on the job experience to do well. \n\nI suggest really diving into understanding the broader concepts behind modern data engineering and working on some projects in Python at the very least.

Anyone can “just do the work,” even outsourced labor. What sets you apart is exploring new technologies and processes, then implementing those that bring value. This continuous improvement is what justifies senior/lead pay over time.\n\nYou might reach a lower-tier senior role without these skills, but it’s rare and you won’t progress further (lead/principal) without them.\n\nThe one real exception: niche legacy tech experts.

For me, Databricks is the poster child for this sort of nonsense.\n\nIf you want a really good acid test, see how any given tool solves an age-old problem that is still around today.: Import a fixed width format file. They are still incredibly common. Lots of vendors want to talk about JSON, Parquet, or XML; files with built in structure. See how they handled files with no or limited structure like fixed width or CSV. These are old formats so one would expect there to be a solution, but there isn't a good one yet. I always thought AI would be a good way to tease out the structure of a fixed width file, but it struggles to figure out where the columns begin and end.\n\nRight now, the majority of \"what's next\" is certified 100% rehashing of old ideas with a fresh coat of paint.",

As a result, this memtable currently does not work for RocksDB. To work for RocksDB, I need to make the active block also sorted, then I need a skiplist for that, and then the memtable design is actually a RocksDB in memory, which is worth a try, and I will try it later.",

In all fairness the few times I have used ssis at work, I have it a shot initially when he asked me to, I put the packages in my own GitHub repo.  Not it’s good that I have a version but I brought up that that’s just my copy from dev. I can’t see what’s on production. I’m not saying that I want or need production level access but I’d a real pipeline where there is some tangible proof that my dev package went to production aside from him saying he copied it to production. It would also be great for him in case something goes wrong with a new update then he can roll a package back to the previous working version.\n\n\nOverall I get your point and it’s valid and I know I get sucked up in the python vs ssis argument because that’s what started everything and I’ve felt that my dba outright didn’t listen to some of my concerns because I wasn’t doing things his way.

Recently I was told that he does allow me to use an smtp server to notify myself of failures. This is true and I only have one counter to it right now and that he doesn’t use the emails for the the packages he has  built in the past that my team relies on so often I am stuck trouble with stakeholders emailing me because he doesn’t let me know that something went wrong on his end. This brings my next point.\n\nBetter data practices. You could say that I could do this with SSIS and I could if I had the opportunity to but it’s not my environment and the dba will not let me try anything different in his environment. I want to standardize things like ci/cd and proper data pipeline monitoring as well as documentation.  From my point of view it seems easier to do so with a tool that aligns better with my skill set and the skill set of my team if I cannot change anything in SSIS environment. I mentioned in another comment that the dba didn’t go for implementing ci/cd in his environment.\n\nShorter product delivery times. This isn’t really because of ssis vs python. I could make an arguement like that but I know that that is subjective.  This is more about man power and ease of deployment.  There are more coders in my agency than gui developers and the business units are required to build their own data pipelines (dba words because he said that he doesn’t have enough staff who know ssis to support the business units. He only got two new people in the last few months and they aren’t trained.) from my point of view leaning into a coding based orchestration tool or a coding solution in general will alllow the business units to really build their own data pipelines efficiently and then IT and the dba can just manage production which is what he seems to want anyway. I guess I’m saying this will play to changing skillset of employees and allow the organization to develop faster as a whole instead of business units feeling frustrated by a slow IT.\n\n\nTechnical debt.  This one is tricky because I can see both the IT setup as technical debt and mine. My team is technically acting like a shadow IT in some ways and that always resulting in technical debt. However the dba is on an outdated SSIS. By that I mean he still uses msdb and hasn’t upgraded to ssisdb which would at least allow for basic version control.  Additionally as I said, he doesn’t really have anyone who knows ssis well on his team and therefore if he leaves one day my organization is in a pickle.  He can say similar for what I want to do but I am documenting everything I’m doing so there is at least that. Also I am training and have already trained people on my entire environment in case I leave. I do know that this point is probably the most debate point that I am making however. Overall I’m saying that if we move to a more modern setup that fits better with the skillset of those in and outside of the agency (outside matters since they are required to build their own data pipeline) then I think we can eventually get off ssis completely and overall have a more manageable system that more people are familiar with.\n\nI typed this up very quickly so it may not be the most clear response.",

The cloud databases are good because they are scalable so you pay less with smaller data volumes.  The big ones are Snowflake and Databricks that are full featured, but more costly and generally want you to commit to some amount of spend with them.  Google also offers GCP and AWS has Redshift (not recommended).  One other you might want to look at is Motherduck, which is quite a bit cheaper than some of the others.   You could also go the postgres route as those are fairly cheap on a number of clouds, but aren't optimized for analytics workloads though they are usable for smaller scale warehouses.\n\nThe database is the core, but then you need to figure out how to ingest the data from your source platforms to the warehouse and transform the data into table structures that support your reporting needs.  Again, there are a multitude of patterns and tools available.  A lot of companies with basic installs are using Fivetran or Airbyte to ingest the data and dbt to transform it.  Personally I wouldn't pay for those, but it simplifies the setup where teams are small or inexperienced.  \n\nThe real hit though is going to be contracting someone to build it.  It's absolutely not something you want to figure out on your own as someone that just writes some SQL and python.  Mistakes can cause issues with usability, create rework and even higher costs depending on your stack.  And to add to the fun, there are a lot of bad consulting firms out there that don't know WTF they are doing, so taking the lowest bid isn't necessarily going to get you to where you want to be.\n\nGood luck!",

You could also practice building your own small projects, like data pipelines with datasets on sites like StrataScratch and Kaggle, to get hands-on experience beyond the course labs. Reading resources like Designing Data-Intensive Applications or following open source projects such as Apache Airflow or dbt can give you deeper insight into real-world systems. These additions will make the knowledge from the IBM course more practical and well-rounded.",

Under the hood, NumPy typically uses C-level memory management (`malloc`/`free` or aligned variants) from the system runtime, though it also supports custom allocators.\n\nIn contrast, I expect stampdb to have lower overhead since it uses a straightforward C++ `std::vector` for memory management. By default, `std::vector` relies on the C++ allocator API, which eventually ends up at `malloc`/`free` as well. Our current plan is to provide only the thinnest wrapper around the C++ core.

But when you want them, they're very useful indeed. \n\nTo begin with, without multi-table transactions, to try to emulate them, you end up implementing compensating transactions:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/compensating-transaction\n\nWhich are difficult to get right, are eventually consistent (meaning, in the interim the inconsistent state is visible, and no guarantee on how fast your comlensating transaction will succeed, and generally just are a pain. They don't add value or spark joy. \n\nThere are also other features that are a lot easier to add to an engine once you have full ACID support. \n\nFor example, zero copy cloning a table - the copies can be modified independently, without data duplication for the shared parts:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/tutorial-clone-table-portal\n\nOr having a transactionally consistent snapshot across tables, instead of trying to use Delta time travel to achieve it:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/warehouse-snapshot\n\nIsolation wise, we get true snapshot isolation within the engine - queries via the Warehouse either see changes in no tables or all. The individual logs aren't written perfectly simultaneously though, so Delta log consumers benefit from that less, but still some - can see some parts of a multi-table committed transactions sooner maybe, but is guaranteed it's part of a committed transaction, not potentially part of an emulated multi table transaction that failed and will have a compensating transaction trying to cover it up sometime later.\n\nPerformance, we can potentially batch up multiple transactions into a Delta log entry. We have a nice fast transaction log, instead of relatively slow block blob storage operations being required on every individual commit.\n\nLocking, iirc, mostly the same - could maybe support pessimistic locking though, which iirc Delta can't. But paper probably says for sure.",

But it's difficult to capture which parts of the Polaris engine we kept in a soundbite, and we've talked more about the result than the lineage I think. \n\nLet me start putting that to rights :) \n\nHere's the original Polaris paper for OP's benefit:\nhttps://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.14778/3415478.3415545\n\nWe kept the Polaris distributed query processing - it's a key part of Fabric Warehouse. But in Synapse SQL Serverless, it also had responsibility for the distributed aspects of query optimization (somewhat similar to the \"Chrysalis\" split query optimization Synapse SQL Dedicated had before that). \nThat's completely overhauled in Fabric Warehouse in favor of Unified Query Optimization:\nhttps://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626246.3653369\n\nWe also took Batchmode query execution as seen in Synapse SQL Dedicated, SQL Server, etc. But it's even faster. \n\nOn top of that we have several significant additional big improvements coming down the pipeline. I'm pretty sure several of them will get papers eventually, but don't know anything concrete on that front off the top of my head. At least one of the improvements heavily involves the Polaris engine ;)",

But, it's a massive investment, and 3 years in we're still working on adding components that our manager estimated we'd have done in the first 6 months.\n\nIf you don't need that, its good, but get documentation of your code, your sql tables, try and centralise into a single semantic model if you can (short of data warehousing).  But the one thing that we keep running into with people creating their own dashboards is that they change the queries, they're no longer performant, take forever, use more resources, and they're reloading and recalculating the same details x 10 different queries in a power bi dashboard x 10 dashboards.\n\nSo, consolidation - if you can at least run the data out to a table, and then have any dashboards read from that table, then you'll be saving yourself.\n\nTry to source control your dashboards.\n\nIf you're using PBI online, if you can use things like datasets, that centralise the data, go for it.\n\nStored Procedures may give you more centralised control, semantic models are more or less exactly what you're creating in PowerBI anyway (source -> dim/fact tables + relationships + measures).\n\nCreating a centralised semantic model/warehouse that has all of your tables and data in one place, that you write your code and measures and everything once will definitely allow you to reuse it multiple times and is a big win.",

I’m coming from a DBA/SSIS/sql-heavy background though, and those approaching from a more software engineering background will likely recommend different approaches based on their favorite tech stack and their CI/CD and version control preferences.\n\nI’m not a big fan of text-to-sql or promptql-style approaches mainly because I feel like that’s something that should be more for data exploration and presented to the end user rather than a way to streamline your reporting pipeline - all my opinion though, I just don’t like that added layer of abstraction from data when I’m thinking about robust data processes.",

The programming fundamentals you've built over 4 years transfer well to data engineering - you understand APIs, software architecture, and debugging which are core skills. Many data engineering tools have .NET support or similar paradigms to what you're used to. The main gaps you'll need to fill are around data pipeline orchestration (Airflow, Prefect), cloud platforms (AWS/Azure/GCP), and getting comfortable with SQL + maybe Python or Scala. Your API integration experience is actually really relevant since data engineers spend a lot of time building ETL pipelines that pull from various sources. Companies definitely value programming experience over pure data background - it's often easier to teach someone with solid dev skills about data concepts than to teach a data person how to write maintainable, scalable code. I'd suggest building a few portfolio projects that show end-to-end data pipelines and you should be competitive for junior/mid-level data engineering roles pretty quickly.",

So make sure you have some of those user types in your discovery meetings, because too often I've seen them skipped and not able to provide feedback and the catalog turns into shelfware that does nothing but extract metadata from your systems.\n\nLike everyone else in the thread has said, open metadata is rather popular and can be self hosted. Alation can get really expensive as you tend to pay per connector IIRC. Atlan has a lot of integrations, but I don't recall if you can host it.

Now, that said, you can enable various features, assuming you have the proper credentials, to do data sampling, and reverse metadata to write metadata back to the service, which is helpful for things like Snowflake, Databricks, Redshift, BigQuery, etc. In the case of the OP, they want an on-prem metadata solution that isn't phoning home for anything, which OMD will do, assuming there is a connector available for the things they want to connect to it.

They have a lot of short-term (6 months to 1 year) missions with TJMs between 500 and 750€ (in top tier companies).  \nI know for sure that they work with TotalEnergies and, despite the fact that they look, most of the times, for experience with geosismic data, during the interview this is often seen as secondary. What comes out is that the experience with moving data from one sink to another is much more important (and also a little bit of PM).  \n  \nIf I were you, I would also add Streaming to the portfolio and that will be it. Experience with near-real time analytics is quite rare and very in demand in big companies (mainly for IoT applications). Once you have done your first mission, you will be aware of the \"rouages\" and more capable of correcting the \"cap\".\n\nA+",

In the event that there's any issues it would have a set of contacts to send a summary of the issues found to.  As you can imagine the more frequent this happens the better, ideally every 5 minutes or so, so that someone will get an alert as soon as they've entered bad data.\n   * then copies the validated data into an appropriate raw bucket/raw database area where it can then go through a typical data pipeline for transformation.\n\nThe above can be done in a variety of ways, but is fairly straight-forward.",

Basically you pull in all the data into a central file or table as above and you manually identify duplicates. Then you give them an \"master\" ID. The next day you do the same and manually process the new records, etc. Can be done in excel with Vlookup + copy paste, using simple code into CSV output, in PowerQuery, ...\n\nNow if you want to share this data between applications, you should seriously consider changing the way this data is stored in the first place. You don't really need an MDM but reather some serious business process reviews: who is responsible for making a new \"contact\" or \"invoice\" ? Which tool generates those?

Our data stewards use excel to maintain various reference tables and it’s a pretty nice and easy to use interface for them.

The system is nice for a DBA / DE to administer, and has a snap in for excel, permissions are in Active Directory.

It is a search engine designed to return documents from a search, not create complex visualizations or calculations. If you want to do that, you should do it in a real query engine.  I can’t even tell you how many times I have been consulting, and I saw folks trying to do what you are.  The only real way is to run the data into a real analytics engine like Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.  Then materialize the result back to a different index.  If the data exists in a raw form outside Elastic, re-extract it to one of those tools and skip Elastic until the final product is calculated, then load Elastic with that.",

Try to have a nice diagram up there if it can simply make sense (maybe 4 users pointing to a pile of 25 tables etc).\n\n2. Take it to your stakeholders and tell your story. Make them aware of what they/you own the care and feeding of. Don't just phrase it as bad! It's likely this complexity actually an impressive job of non devs building a surprisingly effective and complicated system to help empower them to do their jobs.\n\n3. Come to a \"What do we do?\" conclusion with stakeholders. That's a two part \"Who?\" and \"What?\". `Who` could be you, outside consultants, a new hire, or the users themselves. `What` might range from \"Accept the corruption risk and keep rolling\" to bring in a completely new tool and move the users to it. \n\n4.

Detecting water levels, from enough places, maintaining those sensors over the long term, getting power to the sensors, data from those sensors, and gathering all that data into a central service.\n\nActually consuming that data is the easy bit.\n\nThis is why I think it'd work well as a community project - get local communities, schools etc to adopt, deploy, maintain - perhaps even build - their own sensors.

For what you're talking about, the app side of it is pretty straightforward (conceptually). It just needs to be able to check for flood alerts and deliver those alerts to users based on their location data.\n\nThe very hard and expensive part is all the infrastructure you need to track and collect that data. You refer to that as the \"other half\" of the problem but it's probably more like 99% of the problem. Ideally the Malysian weather service would provide flood alert warnings, like the [NWS does](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) (used to do?) in the US. I can't read the website for the [Malaysian weather service](https://www.met.gov.my/), but you should start there to see what information they currently track and provide to the public. It could be that they have an API similar to the NWS that provides alerts.\n\nAll that being said, I was a little curious why an app like you describe doesn't exist yet. And it does look like there are already [apps and warning systems in place](https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2024/10/07/dont-panic-all-the-steps-apps-numbers-you-need-for-malaysias-flood-season/152650). Are you sure that this an issue that needs a new app to solve it? Maybe it's just an issue of people not being aware of their options. You might be able to accomplish more by helping people download and learn to use existing apps and resources.\n\nETA: removed overuses of \"already\"",

        "body": "So, how serious are you in working in this?\n\nFor near real-time river water level (around 15 to 30 minutes delay), you can get information from https://publicinfobanjir.water.gov.my/. Which also has rainfall data. So you don't actually need to develop a device and place it your self. \n\nIf you explore the website above:\n\n* Water level information, such as normal, warning, danger, caution.\n* There are links to some states sensor telemetry website.\n* State specific infobanjir. With more detailed information, such as camera feed.\n* Link to [https://nawabs.water.gov.my](https://nawabs.water.gov.my), where some data is open to public, but some data needs login.\n\nThese are public domain governmental data. There are more public data under various subdomains under [water.gov.my](http://water.gov.my), but it's not really surfaced out to public.\n\nYou can get some MetMalaysia forecast data freely through https://api.met.gov.my/.\n\nYou can use this data, especially the water level, show alerts in you app (or notification) when it passed the warning level.\n\nAs for your technical question, you actually will need more of backend + frontend. Backend means a server getting all these data from the various public sources and processing them. Frontend means your mobile app + website. Your website and mobile app will show the data from your backend.\n\nI'm saying backend, because you may need aggregate the data first, then process them into the form your frontend can use. \n\nYou may skip the backend, and do everything in your mobile app, but there's no guarantee that the format and access of the data would not change. Not to mention, you mobile code will be so bloated.\n\nAs for your question of native or cross-platform. If you need advanced platform specific functions, you will need native. If you don't, cross platform is fine. Do note that simple device function such as camera, GPS, storage are considered basic, and easily supported in most cross-platform framework. Anyway, example of cross-platform framework are Flutter, KMP, and React-Native. Of which, I'm familiar with Flutter, and would recommend Flutter.\n\nSo, you want to make publish an iOS app? This is a hard requirement from Apple, you will need a MacOS hardware to produce the installer file. You can either rent a MacOS during the app compilation or get one yourself. You would also need 99 USD per year. \n\nFor flood detection, you need to monitor water level and rainfall predominantly. If you want flood detection in wast coast, you will need to monitor wind field as well. \n\nThis is possible. How long it would take, depends on your complexity. Simple app that get data from JPS and MetMalaysia API and show them in your app, probably 3 months. Not including getting the developer account, the Google/Apple process. You want flood detection, you will need a backend to process all this data, and for machine-learning forecast on your own. It will take probably a year?\n\nHere's are some other nation example. [https://signature.bmkg.go.id/](https://signature.bmkg.go.id/) (seems to be offline right now). https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/flood.\n\nI do know several private companies that is working with government on a current project that address most of your concerns, as well as to match the service provided by the example above. To extremely summarise it, it monitors rainfall, produce instantaneous flood map (through ML and pre-forecasted based on rainfall condition), and more importantly the impacts. So you can see which road/bridge will be flooded, and how deep the flood it is. At a 1 km x 1 km resolution. Most of these information should be public domain once the system has been deployed, with certain information available only to government departments.\n\nAnyway. You will need basic Computer Science for coding the frontend and backend. You will need some Meteorology (of which no universities in Malaysia specifically teach it), to understand basic weather and climate knowledge. If you want to delve into forecast, you will need to understand Dynamic Meteorology. You will need System Administration if you want to deploy your backend yourself, instead of going through paid services. You will also need learn several programming language, depending on your choice of frontend and backend.\n\nIf you want authoritative knowledge of Malaysia weather and climate, you can read https://www.umpress.com.my/index.php?route=product/product&product\\_id=1059.\n\nAnyway, there's one thing you need to understand why Malaysia forecast is not that great compared to other country:\n\n1. This is a country in tropical belt. The hardest type of region in the world to get accurate forecast. Compared to USA, UK or Japan forecast, those are easily done. Even UK forecast experts says Malaysia forecast is much more challenging officially (after some Malaysia minister question MetMalaysia experts and tries getting input from oversea experts).\n2. Believe it or not, our climate and weather can be affected by winds all the way in Siberia Russia, MJO in Indian Ocean, ENSO in Pacific ocean. So many things needs can affect Malaysia weather. In comparison, UK and US mainly only needs to monitor polar region, and jet stream.\n3. Under ocean phenomenon like Thermohaline Circulation should have some effect on Malaysia weather, but I have not look into that specifically.\n4. Most weather modelling software were developed by upper latitude northern hemisphere countries, which means they don;t really focus on the physics of tropical region like Malaysia.",

One option is to use a wildlife camera that simply runs off of a battery you can change every couple of months. You can time it to take pictures every x minutes, and send them through a mobile data network or something to the server. Once there, simple computer vision solutions can be run (and I don’t mean deep learning, just normal image manipulation and OpenCV or the like) to detect where the water is on the image. If it crosses the place or percentage of the image, you can issue a warning theough the app. The key here is placing the camera somewhere it sees the water and the bank at the same time and is not blocked by vegetation, maybe on some pole or the wall of a house. Also important to cover the lens from rain so that the pics are not just wet blobs. If you want, you can also place some reference point on the bank and measure its visible portion’s length on every image.\n\nIf you’d like to chat about the data collection and processing aspect of things, drop me a DM.",

It \"looks weak\" without it because it is weak.

I've been watching people self-study vs university students, and the holes in their learning is immense. All they do is WebDev and LeetCode. They think they know Big O but they don't. They don't know that it's worst case and why worst case is the one that matters because they don't know what p and np are. They're failing interviews because they can't explain what a log is from high school math or a limit from Calculus. They think it's not important. They don't know binary or anything about how data is stored. They're grinding \"DSA\" but they don't know that cache misses make a program 100x slower, because they never took \"useless\" courses like architecture or operating systems. They don't really get what references are because they never managed memory. They don't know how to comment or write documentation. They've never seen an actor diagram. There are entire courses on all these topics. This is just off the top of my head.\n\nMeanwhile, cheating has ramped up big time over the past ten years. People were paying Indians thousands of dollars on Chegg and Upwork to do their entire coursework for them. I know this firsthand. That was before AI too. Now it's totally fucked. Teachers literally can't give homework and it's a learning crisis. I don't know why people pay so much for education just to cheat and get the paper but it's not long before employers catch on.\n\nEveryone has it backwards. The degree is what's invaluable, not the paper. If someone actually pays attention in school, they will learn things that others will never know. The reason why so many think education is useless is because so many cheated their asses off.

You will get a bunch of ppl saying \"you need a degree\" and while it's SIGNIFICANTLY harder to get a job without one right now it's not impossible (I co run a local only mentor group and in the past year I have seen 5 ppl with no college degree get jobs) AGAIN it was very tough but they had no degree to speak of.\n\nThe other problem is the market is \"tough\" for ppl without work experience.  BUT you aren't gonna be applying now and no one can tell the future, most self taught devs that aren't a part of a local group type thing/serious accountability group take about 2-3 years to get to a \"job ready\" knowledge base from my experience over the past 5ish years running my local group.\n\nWith college being out of the question for you this is gonna be a long journey so I would ask myself \"why do I wanna get in this\".  The ppl that come into my group and do it for the money/remote/travel the world traditionally don't make it and really the remote stuff is shrinking up A LOT.  But if you have legit reasons and even if they are the aforementioned ones Odin Project is still a great start to see if you really really wanna push through\n\nThis is what we do at my group.  Watch a 1-4 hr html/css course, then watch a 2-6 js for beginners course on yt.  Then just start building things (this works for us cuz we meet every week so they have us and the other ppl in the group who are super driven)\n\nNOW this does get a little harder if it's just you or you don't have a group like that but the key take away is you need to start actually building things as soon as possible, because you ARE going to suck and that's fine we all did, but that's when you learn.\n\nI have seen ppl with comp sci college degrees that can't build anything cuz they haven't yet.  Check this post out regarding the build thing \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j9lo95/comment/mhe6xfw/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j9lo95/comment/mhe6xfw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)",

So here would be the steps:\n\n- Tell the AI of your choice to write some small application. You want it small to ensure you can fight it all by yourself, but make sure the AI doesn’t actually just knock it out of the park in one shot; if so, try again until you get something sufficiently buggy.\n\n- Debug the code. You might think that this needs to be fancy, but I cannot stress enough how basic this is. It can literally be just notes to yourself with a date explaining your thoughts. I wager it could say things like: “So, the AI said it wrote X using Y method. Whaaaaaat is happening - I better check the documentation for Y. That is *not* how it looks, the documentation from Y imports completely different methods….” Etc\n\n- Document the whole process, by which I mean the prompt used, the AIs response, the code it gave, and your debugging notes.",

        "body": "I will go in the exact opposite direction if some comments here: This is a tough question to answer, because it doesn't really matter. I mean, languages are cool and all, but learning a new programming language really is not that hard, once you already know how to program. You can learn any language similar to the ones you already know in a week. \n\nThe more important question is: What kind of project structure, architecture and patterns do you learn. If you are going for \"applications and tools\", that can also mean many things. GUI or no, Desktop or mobile, which target audience does it have, what should it do? \n\nIf you want to be the most versatile, able to learn \"anything(TM)\" that might come up in a few weeks time, I would suggest having experience in at least one project / language out of all of the following categories (and each project must have a minimum complexity to \"count\"): \n\n  \n\\- 1 web based frontend. Can be pure html/css/minimal JS, or be fully based on a JS framework. maybe a homepage for a simple business, without a shop, like a bakery or a hair salon. \n\n\\- 1 non-web based frontend. A C# GUI in windows, a Java App on Android, a Swift UI on iOS or a QT-App in any language you want, it doesn't matter much. Probably a complexity between a calculator and a calendar would be good. Games work, but are normally structured differently, do I would advise against using a game engine unless you want to stick with gaming. \n\n\\- 1 complex application, written in a low level language, optimized for speed. A raytracer is the classical option, because it has good visual feedback, but a compiler, OS parts or a real time embedded component can all work. Suitable languages are C, C++ and rust. A compiler has the additional benefit of teaching you more about programming languages in general.\n\n\\- 1-2 APIs. It is great if you have both written a REST (or similar) API, accessible through the web (in theory, you don't need to deploy) as well as a library, that exposes a C-standard API for use from other programs. They are pretty similar in conception, but quite a bit different in practice, and understanding how both of these actually work, can be hugely helpful, even if you are only using them, and never have to build them again! \n\nYou should 100% have experience in one Object Oriented language. The best options are Java and C#. OOP (or some half hearted attempt at OOP) is still the standard in most industries. \n\nAdditionally, you should be comfortable in a language, suitable for scripting. Python and JavaScript, but also Bash are all options with different advantages. You need to know at least one. \n\nI think everyone can learn something from trying something completely different, so you should have done one project in a completely functional language. Haskell is my favourite, but F# and Clojure are also options. You will have to re-learn to think about programming, which is exactly the point of the exercise, not to use this exact language again in production.

        "body": "Just a heads up, doom is way, way more complex than you think. They teach entire college courses on it because it is an incredibly good demonstration of \\*a lot\\* of proper computer science concepts. And the way those games render is not at all how modern stuff renders, so you're going to have an extra step going from oldschool pixel plotting to modern programmable shaders.\n\nThose games were made in C. You could use C++ or rust or java, I would suggest C++. You'll need to pick up a graphics API. Anything that can plot pixels arbitrarily would be good enough, something like SDL.\n\nI'm not trying to discourage you, but \\*making\\* something like doom is very difficult. \\*Porting\\* doom is not, because Doom itself is built to be portable, you only have to rewrite like 7 files to port doom, but \\*making\\* doom is and of itself a very, very difficult CS problem. You don't just need to know comp sci, you need to know best practices, and have a good grasp of boolean algegbra. Doom is going to be throwing around terms like \"R-trees\" or \"Binary space partitioning\" so be prepared.\n\nAt the heart, what you want to make is a raycaster. Not \\*ray tracing,\\* but raycasting. The idea is you will write something that shoots rays out into the world, checks what they collide with, then renders that collision. It shoots a ray for every vertical column on the screen. That will get you a basic wolfenstein-like look, but those games, \\*especially\\* doom, do way more than just ray cast out in to the world. If you want to do raycasting, brush up on your vector calculus, you'll need it.",

        "body": "I finished a BS in computer science in Dec 2020, in a very similar situation - barely got through capstone, no internship experience beyond the capstone itself, no personal projects and no clue where to start with one - and it took me a hot sec, but ultimately I actually ended up in a Java web dev job, even though I'd spent 4y focusing on low level programming in C/C++ and thought I'd go on to do something wildly different.\n\nI know the panic, the uncertainty and despondancy, but it's normal. CS education isn't technical school -- it taught you how to figure out how to develop solutions, how to learn new skills as a project demands, it almost certainly did NOT teach every single skill you'd ever use on the job. You will learn as you go, that is just the nature of the field. The knowledge snowballs, yes, but getting a new project, having no idea how to complete it, and having the skill to research and teach yourself is THE most important skill you can take away from formal CS education.\n\nAI is a research accerator and a peer programmer in your pocket. My employer recently started expecting us to start using AI like we've been using IDEs -- a core tool to speed and supercharge our development. So start/continue using AI as your coding partner and a research aid. Don't vibe code - hell no - but anything you'd search the internet to know, ask AI first, then dig a little deeper, fact check it - its the faster version of digging through stack overflow and stack exchange and reddit to cross reference the collective knowledge, right? And have AI write code, do a peer review, build on what it writes, feed it back in - go back and forth with it, like you would peer programming. Use it to bounce ideas around and fill the gaps in your knowledge. If you rock up to an interview with the skill of knowing how to utilize AI effectively in your development, then you WILL be the most attractive candidate, because, honestly, a lot of experienced devs are behind the curve figuring it out and we're feeling the heat from our employers with all their crazy high hopes for AI.\n\nIf you like web dev, there are still plenty of jobs out there, even if the job landscape has thinned out and changed in the last 5-10 years. But also be open to try anything - I NEVER thought I'd end up a web dev, I didn't do well in those courses in school so I thought it was the LAST thing I'd ever do, but I'm SO GLAD I gave it a chance and I ended up liking it so much more than I'd ever thought I would.\n\nAlso, I got lucky: I was a year and a half out of school and struggling to get an interview for junior roles and was kicking myself for not trying to get an internship the minute I graduated. Some internships will accept you shortly after graduation, but most won't accept you more than a year out. But when I reached out to a connection about a junior role at their company, their company countered by offering me an internship which turned into a full-time offer and I've been there nearly 3 years now. \n\nSo 1) If you want workplace experience after graduation, definitely don't give up on internships (plural, even if you finish one, don't assume its gotta be one and done); post-grad internships are out there and experience is experience and employers love demanding 2-3y of experience from new grads and junior devs for some crazy reason. 2) Build your connections, reach out to your connections, never stop making them even after you land a job; they don't stress that enough in school, hell it probably should be it's own course its that important.",

They are highly motivated to find you something. \n\nI highly recommend doing remote or hybrid.

Every line you write or fix or debug is a little closer to competency.\n\nEDIT: Specifically for your concern about knowing syntax, you won't remember how to perfectly write the syntax for everything you learn.

Trying to shove all those languages into one project sounds like a pain. I'd try to use the language the course requires and not mix in others.\n\nAnd, fortunately for you and the other students, these languages are generally in the same family. SQL is meaningfully different, and it is good to learn a bit about databases, and the problems you get there should generally be exercises in thinking about data structures and constraints.\n\nBut C#, Java, PHP, and Python you can all approach from an OOP POV, and they all generally are relatives of ALGOL, which means that you can to a degree guess at both syntax and semantics for languages you're not all that familiar with.\n\nAs you get more experienced you should start feeling like keywords are mostly trivial, and that most libraries are something you look up the docs for when you need to but don't remember long-time, unless you actually use it often.",

Pick one of your favorite languages and learn to make a program that with interface with a database by sending http requests to that application. (Exact language doesn’t really matter. Python Java etc. this is API development experience) \n2. Make a front end using your Java framework or using Javascript/React to be the user interface to interact with that database using the API you built (don’t focus too much on looks, focus on making requests to your API and retrieving data and adding data to the database)\n3. Learn a little about docker to stand all your services up \n\nThis is a great project for people trying to get practical experience before an internship, the idea itself doesn’t matter too much. Could be a twitter clone, simple picture display app, anything. But the core learning is about using a language and making an API, a MySQL database and a little bit of frontend interacting with that database. That’s fullstack in practice, but if you keep your scope small you’ll get exposed to a lot more about how software development works",

Had you done that, you would have found countless posts telling you to start with small and simple projects and grow in all directions. A ToDo List app may be too ambitious for your skill level - not programming wise, but design wise.\n\nYou need to learn the design and planning processes that go from idea via specification, detailing, breaking down, solving individual parts to final implementation in a programming language.\n\nYou most likely directly started at the computer and naturally were dumbfounded and got stuck. You tried to write a novel without even having a detailed plan of what you want to write - common \"writer's block\".\n\nSit down with pencil and paper and flesh out your ideas before programming. Write down what your program should do, what parts it should consist of, what features it should have. Then, think about each individual feature. Determine what you need for that particular feature, make a detailed plan/roadmap.\n\nThis specifying, breaking down, analyzing, solving process is the really important part of programming, not the implementation in code, that's the actually easy part (and the part that to a certain degree can already be covered by AI).\n\nAs with every similar post, some book recommendations: \n\n+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul\n+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas\n+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman\n+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles Petzold\n\nAll these books focus more on the process that leads to the implementation in code than on the code itself - hence, the used languages are fairly unimportant.\n\nAlso, consult the **Frequently Asked Questions** in the *sidebar* here for a cornucopia of project ideas on many different levels.",

You can challenge yourself to do it at different levels to learn everything that comes with it, something like :\n\n- level 1 : using python lists and methods like append and remove, use print and input to make the whole thing work in the terminal (can do a simple menu like 'if input()==\"1\" : list.append(input(\"What do you want to add?\")) elif input()==\"2\"...')\n\n- level 2 : using OOP to create each task as an object, you can set up your classes to have some more info like a date, the person the task is for or notes, make your methods yourself \n\n- level 3 : using a database to store the tasks, you can use sqlite3 for a local one that's going to be in a file or if you're up to it you can make a proper server to run your SQL in.\n\nFor bonus points you can make it into an app with an UI, I quite like QT at a beginner friendly level, it comes with PySide6 and has an app called \"designer\" you can use to create the UI graphically rather than writing it completely in code.\n\nThe more you do, the more you learn.

Let's take a look at SQLAlchemy (https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/) as an example, because I like how their docs are layed out: \n\nIf I were to start using this now for the first time, this is what I personally would look at in which order: \n\n1. Installation guides, both for beginners and for \"Python veterans\". They are short enough, so I can skim them both quickly. \n\n2. both tutorials. I will probably follow along with the \"Quick Start\", because it's short and will let me see some concepts hands on to start with, and I will skim the longer tutorial, as I personally already know how SQL works, and how an ORM works. If I were new to either of those concepts, I would work through it completely. \n\n3. I skip the migration notes, because... duh. \n\n4. Now we come to the complexity: In the section \"Reference and How to\" I would stop reading \"everything\", instead I would skim the chapter titles and try to remember, which information is available. Later, when I go ahead and actually map my first classes, I will open \"Mapping Python Classes\" and \"Relationship Configuration\", and then, when I go to test it, I would probably read more configuration stuff, so that I can be sure I didn't miss any important config options. \n\n5. I will skim the relevant Dialect Documentation, PostgresQL in my case. The most important things to note will probably be highlighted, and if I skimeed it, I will be able to go back later when there's an issue and be able to know, where to find the relevant information. \n\nEverything else I would just search in the docs, as it comes up. Such as error messages, or how to do a specific kind of relationship. \n\nJust reading and skimming what I outlined above will probably take 1-2 hours. Reading the entire documentation would take days, and I would forget nearly everything. The important part is not to know what to do outright, but where to find the information you need! You also need to understand the core concepts, of what a library is trying to do, and how it's doing it! All the small details, while important in the moment, will just take up space in your head and not really get you anywhere on their own.",

        "body": "There's a concept called the Entity Component System model, or ECS which solves this issue in a way that also makes writing high performance code much easier. \n\nThe idea is that instead of having discrete classes for different kinds of creatures, items, or other game entities with all sorts of complex logic attached to them, you create simple data structure called an entity. An entity is usually nothing more than some kind of ID value, like an integer, UUID, or even a string. You then \"attach\" additional small components to that entity which give it additional properties. It's these components that hold the data that would have been held in the class. So the `hasHealth` component would hold maybe 2 numbers, max health and current health.  \n\nAll of the logic for the various components is handled by a set of \"system\" classes. Their job is to handle the logic associated with the various components. For example, the health system would handle adding or removing health on entities with a health component.\n\nTypically the way ECS are written let you query the world for entities with specific components (or the components of an entity and such), or sometimes more complex conditions like \"has components x y and z, but not a\". This query then will find the components that match and produce a list of entries which can then be processed by the system.\n\nThis is probably complete overkill for what you're doing, but it's becoming a very popular way to write games. It gets rid of the awkward problems that come from a more object oriented approach, and completely strips all dependencies between components and entities. This allows you to build up unique entities simply by combining different discrete components. Of course, for unique interactions you would occasionally still need to make 1-off components, but a *lot* can be done with only a small collection of basic components when you can freely mix and match everything, and implementing new kind of entities is often just a matter of figuring out what components they need.\n\nThis roguelike tutorial in Rust does a great job of explaining/teaching how you might use an ECS in a roguelike game: https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/chapter_2.html\n\nRoguebasin has a very basic Python implementation of an ECS: https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Entity_Component_System\n\nThere's a ton more information on ECS out there, this was just meant to give you a very very rough idea of the overall concept. There are quite a few ECS libraries out there in a whole ton of languages, but it's not that difficult to write your own either (at least as long as your not trying to squeeze every bit of performance out of it).\n\nHere are a couple blog posts that explain ECS and implement one:\n\nC++ - https://www.codingwiththomas.com/blog/an-entity-component-system-from-scratch\n\nC++ - https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/\n\nC# - https://matthall.codes/blog/ecs/\n\nHere's an ECS FAQ: https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq?tab=readme-ov-file",

A lot of people can’t handle the fact that they are not cutting it via their own lack of work. There are outliers that succeed way more than they should and those that fail way more than they should because at the end of the day there is always some portion of luck. For example, maybe your interviewer is just having the worst day of their life but doesn’t feel empowered to cancel their interview obligations. Or maybe your interviewer just got amazing news and would pass a goldfish on to the next round. \n\n\nI one hundred percent want to emphasize DO NOT LISTEN to random people complaining about the job market. Everyone’s experience is unique and literally everyone I know who worked towards a computer science degree (or something very adjacent) found gainful employment.

You don't need a degree for this, but if you want to study it at this level, you will also be reading a lot of scientific papers as well.\n\nIf you want to be an engineer, like an actual engineer that requires certifications and to be able to code well enough that you're applying engineering principles to every project. If you want to be a REAL engineer, then that usually means gaining certifications from accredited organizations and/or governments. Think about it this way: A software engineer is, ideally, the type of person that creates software systems for things like nuclear power plants, utilitiy companies, hospitals etc.I look at it as you're working on aserious infrastructure projects and your code cannot break under any circumstances because the consequences could be catastrophic, costing people lives and stuff It always needs a failsafe if bad things happen. Like it still has to work somehow even if AWS or Azure servers go down. Multiple redudancies and all that.\n\nIf you simply want to code, you're a developer that mainly works n consumer grade apps. You don't need a degree or even necessarily certifications. You just need a somewhat robust portfolio, personal and volunteer projects, getting your apps into app stores, etc. IF things break down, people are merely inconvenienced.\n\n  \nDon't listen to all these others about a CS degree being meaningless.

At a big tech company some people can easily stay busy doing nothing but that, never thinking about the product.

The key to this is to look at the center line\n\n    4321234\n\nEach number is listed twice except 1, so you can use the formula `2n - 1` to indicate the width. In this case, `n` refers to the largest number (or the initial number picked).\n\nThe pattern is basically in two parts. There's the stuff reaching the middle line\n\n    4444444\n    4333334\n    4322234\n    4321234\n\nThen, there's the rest of it.\n\n    4322234\n    4333334\n    4444444\n\n### What's the pattern?\n\nYou'll notice the numbers are basically seven 4's on the first line, five 3's on the next line, three 2's, and finally one 1 at the end. So the pattern is: 7, 5, 3, 1.\n\nThe idea is you print the numbers doing down, like \n\n   43\n\nThen when you reach 2, you print 2 three times, \n\n   43222\n\nThen, you do 3 4 at the end (going back up).\n\n   4322234\n\n\n### Coding logic\n\nSo, let's see how we can do that one line. Let's put it in a function\n\n    void printLine(int size, int patternLength, int currNumber)\n\n        // Step 1. Count down\n        for (int i = size; i > currNumber; i--) {\n           printf(\"%d\", i);\n        }  \n \n        // Step 2. Print repeated numbers\n        for (int i = 0; i < patternLength; i++) {\n           printf(\"%d\", currNumber);\n        }\n        // Step 3. Count up (you do this)\n\n        // Final newline\n        printf(\"\\n\");\n    }\n\nSo, then you have the main function\n\n    int main() {\n        // Assume the user enters in a size and it's stored in size\n       int size = readSizeFromUser();\n       int patternLength = 2 * size - 1;\n       int currNumber = size;\n       // Print the pattern up to the midpoint\n       for (int i = size; i >= 1; i--) {\n           printLine(size, patternLength, currNumber);\n           patternLength -= 2; // Next number is printed this many times\n           currNumber--; // The next number is decreased from the current\n       }\n       // Another loop to go from 2 to size to do 2nd half\n    }\n\nI've left a lot of code out for you to think about, but hopefully, you get the idea.",

Programming books also occasionally contain such problems in the exercises sections but are normally paired with whatever you were supposed to learn in that chapter.\n\nFor this problem I would try to figure out the \"general rule\" (someone already said that it is the distance from the center). Usually this will result in the easiest-to-test and most-likely-to-be-correct solution.\n\nIf you can't figure out the general rule, take a piece of the problem which is solvable and then work backwards from there. For example, for n = 3, the middle line is this:\n\n    32123\n\nFirst write a loop that outputs just this line, for any n. That's part of the problem. Then work backwards to make it work similarly for the other lines (so that the line before middle is 32223, and so on). Doing it this way is fine too, but there are more opportunities to mess things up or to get edge cases wrong.\n\nFor the given problem this is not really a problem, though, since \"exhaustive testing\" is pretty straightforward. You can run your entire solution on all values of n = 1 through n = 9 inclusive and make sure that the output is according to the specification.

Can you entirely avoid branching aside from the necessary loops by writing a value every time? How can you generalize your condition to give you a number to write instead of a boolean? This will prevent a large void in the middle.\n\nSomething that might make it more efficient: how can you restructure the loops such that the number to be written at each position can be directly inferred from only the iterator values at that position, so aside from the code configuring the loops, nothing else needs to be aware of how large the square is? If you try to make n only exist in the loop headers, I think you will find a more elegant solution without a big mess of addition and subtraction of i, j, n, and 1 going on inside every iteration.

We can convert ranges by subtracting n from all members. From there, it's just whichever coordinate that's farther from the center what takes precedence. \n\nFrom that, we can derive a function like this: \n\n    printBullseye(int n){\n        for(int i = 0; i < 2*n-1; i++){\n            for(int j = 0; j < 2*n-1; j++){\n                int iDif = abs(n-1-i);\n                int jDif = abs(n-1-j);\n                int distance = iDif > jDif ? iDif : jDif;\n                printf(\"%d\", distance+1);\n            }\n            printf(\"\\n\");\n        }\n    }\n\nEDIT: I realized while driving to work that I should've converted the range by changing the for-loop start positions instead of cluttering the function with more math.

At some point you need to just start building small projects, if you cannot think of a small project spend some time thinking about how to split a larger project into smaller modular ones. Set a time limit for your project, then once done or time has run out reflect on what you wanted to achieve, what you did achieve, what problems you encountered, how you solved them and what you would do different next time, afterwards, move on to the next project. Repeat until you feel confident to tackle bigger projects.\n\nA note on AI, having someone or something constantly tell you solutions to problems, diminished learning results. Your brain just gets lazy and used to it. This isn't even unique to AI, this is just how learning works, reddit can do the same if people wouldn't be so openly hostile towards people asking for help with minor issues. Instead tell your preferred AI that it should never just give you the solution and just analyze your code and point out where an issue might be. Then attempt to solve it by yourself. Only use it if you are actually stuck or don't understand the stack trace of error messages. As sometimes error messages can be terribly obscure.",

Particularly [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). It’s how I myself started coding, with python same as you. It has a bunch of problems arranged by difficulty going from 8-kyu (easiest) to 1-kyu(hardest) iirc. You can start doing some of the 8 kyu ones and progress as you see fit. You have as long as you want to solve them, and once you do you can see other’s solutions.\n\nDO NOT USE AI, or be very careful in its use. Always always always understand the code you’re using. And especially for these types of projects, I’d say don’t use ANY code generated by ai, it kinda defeats the purpose. You can use it as a googling aid “how do I get the length of an array, but not as an actual coding assistant “give me a loop that finds the highest value”.\n\nAlso, when you see code by others, don’t think you learned whatever you saw because you understood it. That don’t mean shit if you can’t recall it when you need to. Seeing the solution to the problem is obvious, and easy to understand. But if the next time you find that problem you can’t remember or recreate the solution, you’re still fucked. Until you can generate the code/algorithm yourself from scratch, you don’t know it.\n\nGood luck out there.",

Nowadays this topic is often called \"serialization\" i.e. turning some abstract data representation into a serial stream of data, and back again.\n\nJust as one example, look at how the [\"Protocol Buffers\"](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/encoding/) binary encoding format works. It defines a general-purpose way to describe \"messages\" in terms of their fields, and each field's type determines how it is encoded, in such a way that you can always tell where one field ends and another begins.\n\nIt uses the same \"length prefix\" approach that you'll see in a lot of other formats, but it also uses a variable-length encoding trick for integers, which means that small integers take up less space than large ones. This applies to the data itself, but also to the type/length metadata.\n\nReusing an off-the-shelf encoding format like Protobuf will save you a lot of tedious manual work.\n\nOr if your goal is just to obscure the data from casual viewing with a text editor, you can just do something even simpler and compress your JSON representation using something like gzip. Maybe add an extra custom header so various tools don't automatically recognize it as compressed data.",

There is nothing special about a txt file that makes it different. In fact *all files* are merely a sequence of bytes. Opening a file with a particular header marking it as txt tells whatever is opening it “hey, this data is in such and such format like UTF-8. Read bytes of this length and display this data as characters.  A dat or bin file just *doesnt* say “hey, read me as text”, but is still just an array of binary. You actually usually can simply open these in text editors to view broken gibberish if you’d like.\n\nAnyhow; if you’d like to store data in txt, there are countless tutorials; it’s often taught as an intro method when first learning file handling anyhow. Decide on a schema, the easiest probably being each piece of data on its own line, since reading txt files line by line is simple.",

As you are trying to create your own format you'll have to make something up yourself. There are catalogues of already taken magic numbers online.\n\nThen goes header. On offsets from the beginning of the file specified by the format specification there are several numbers telling information about the file: time of creation, modification, size, etc. For example, if you specified that bytes from 16th to 24th will mean time of last modification, you take amount of milliseconds since UNIX timestamp (start of 1970), transform it into a 64-bit integer and write into these bytes.\n\nOne way to add arbitrary data to your file is to add the list of offsets. Say on predefined position of 32th to 40th byte you write the offset to the first bit of an array of entries in your binary file. Computer follows this offset, where you write, in sequence, offset to next array if it exists (or 0 if it doesn't), amount of offsets to various elements in this array, and then list offsets, each is a 64-bit number. Now the reader can read and save them. By following these offsets, it may find your data. Data entry may look like an integer specifying length of a string or array and then bytes of this data.",

So when you're reading the code and want to know what the value of the constant is, or if you want to change it, you have to go looking for what source file it's in. A small hassle, but non-zero.\n\nThe thing about using more memory is also technically true, since the constant has to be stored in memory at the exported symbol address, since the compiler cannot know whether anything outside of your code will also use that symbol. This is hardly of any consequence, but slightly annoying. The compiler also can only optimise away the fetch of the value in the actual file where the definition of the constant is, not in any other file. This is also hardly of any serious consequence to performance, but slightly annoying.\n\nCould you elaborate on what the weird problems using a literal instead of a variable would sometimes cause are?",

Modern x64 is a fully fledged high level language at this point, with types and error detection, complex bit manipulation algorithms that execute in one clock cycle, double the gflops per core than last decade GPUs, cycle counters and cache orchestration, all of them are available in userland and 90% of these instructions are never used, no matter the language, flags or compiler\n\nCoding in assembly is only worth the hassle when you use the ISA extensions, since compilers are 10 years behind what intel has been pushing.\n\nMacros and self standardization is the key to work with 2000+ lines of assembly code without losing your mind. I don't recommend using intrinsics, they produce a lot of garbage code and obscure certain useful details of the instructions. I find MASM + MSVC 2022 + win32 to be the easiest way to make visual applications for windows. Once you get the gist of it, you'll find out that everything inside a computer is assembly. If you like something cool inside a program, you can just disassemble it and copy the code to MSVC to see how it's done. Everything suddenly becomes open source.\n\nSearching the web for help is futile when it comes to new extensions in ASM, the best source of information is the intel SDM and some agner guides. I starte my journey with Creel's videos. They are amazing, all of them. \n\n[https://youtu.be/rxsBghsrvpI?si=24bxlEVBEENobRFF](https://youtu.be/rxsBghsrvpI?si=24bxlEVBEENobRFF)",

Do not do that. Your teacher is not qualified to be teaching you. Unfortunately, you are where you are. \n\nWhat you \\*should\\* be asking is, what did you spend all that time on instead? I am going to give you the bottom line, I have worked in software for over 25 years, almost \\*invariably\\* the people in the field who a) get very good and b) enjoy their lives at work are those people who would not have done what you have done, because the project would have excited them from the start and they would be desperate to get hacking on it. \n\nThat's not you and you need to accept that. The question is, is this now your best option? If you tell me you have spent the last 3 years sitting on your ass and playing video games, maybe any kind of switch is going to take time, if however you told me you have been busy with other hobbies and interests, I would honestly and seriously tell you to choose one of those to turn into a profession if you can. \n\nSoftware development isn't going anywhere, but the gold rush is \\*over\\*.

If you can't be bothered and just want to get through your day, you'll be miserable and a nuisance to everybody around you \\*even if you can find a job\\*. \n\nBe careful with this.

There are cases where an AI backend is a wonderful and effective thing, but it is not always the case. For many tasks, thats just a crazy bloat, which slows down the app, makes it like 10x more expensive to run, and consumes much more electricity, all that to achieve the same exact result. \n\nSo, just go and make projects you enjoy. And as for the AI, do not use it as a default solution to everything. Might be a fun addition sometimes, but not always. Instead, if you want, use it as your stack overflow summarizer, or debug assist.

It might limit how many jobs some companies would have but it won't take every job.\n\n3) Just about, maybe a tiny bit riskier especially since there's so many people that do it. Electrical is a very safe area in general since it's not as popular and so many areas need it. \n\n4) Frankly, just learn how to learn. Take in stride what your teachers say about how to get information. Because even years down the line there'll be points where you don't know what to do but if you can look up the right things in order to learn what you need you'll be good. \n\nGenerally uni will teach you coding from scratch so it's not like you need to learn a whole lot by yourself beforehand. Ofc that will help with assignments and allowing you to feel comfortable with coding but not required. I do recommend you learn a little with whatever language your school uses the most in order to be ahead of the curve.

While college programs don't usually require that you have any previous experience, it will be a big advantage for you to have already gotten some experience on your own time, especially if you're already familiar with the programming languages that specific college uses in its first few courses.\n\nIt is definitely possible to get really good at coding in five years. Going right into freelancing from that point is harder, though, because colleges don't really give you the set of skills you need to be a professional. Being a junior programmer on a team and learning about stuff like code reviewing and navigating large codebases and source control and development methodologies is sort of a separate education from the college degree.\n\nI'm not at all scared of AI taking the software jobs. I think it's a useful tool, but I don't imagine it replacing the need for programmers any time in the next few decades. On the other hand, plenty of people I respect disagree with me. AI is probably equally a threat to lots of jobs, including programming but also art, engineering, and medicine. I wouldn't worry too much about programming specifically.\n\nMy advice: figure out what programming language your intended university uses for its introductory classes. Learn that language. Find a big pile of beginner coding problems and regularly practice. Try and do something fun with programming that ties to some interest of yours. Make a game. Make a guitar tuner. Make a thing that calculates football statistics. Whatever you find interesting.",

        "body": "Hey :) I am currently writing my Master Thesis in Cybersecurity at a University in Germany. I started out with two years of informatics lecture in my school which ended 3 years before I graduated Gymnasium (I think similar to high school). I can tell you that I did manage to get my Bachelors degree (but not with high grades) and my Masters degree did work out much better.   \nI can tell you, that you will learn coding well enough if it is similar to my experience in Germany. But as you go on I felt that theory is taught over practical things and I felt little prepared to enter the job marked. What I would suggest more than focusing on learning everything there is to know in theory, get a job on the side and learn there. \n\nI feel the need to tell you that if given the chance of doing it again I would not study CS anymore I would start out working and earning certificates on the side, but that is my personal experience.  \nIf you want to learn some techniques of CS and if you have the spare money to earn some degrees, I would recommend Hack the Box (students pay less per month) and Portswigger/BurpSuite. They are really beginner-friendly.\n\nRegarding AI, I think if you get some courses in CS focusing on AI you would get a head start, as many currently employed and finishing students did not get the possibility to take these. But there are also different specialties in CS that only few people want to specialize in. Most of the students in my experience are not really good at the mathematical part (e.g. cryptography), I have an interest in law in the side of being a CS major and worked for some time in a field which focused on the area where these two specialties meet. There are not a lot of law students who have an interest in computer and not a lot of CS students have an interest in law. If you want to be special find an area which most of your peers do not like and get good at it :)\n\nIf you have any further questions feel free to message me :)",

Depending on the quality of the classes at your institution that will require more or less outside effort on your part but that’s going to be the case no matter what you study.\n\nThis may just be my opinion but I wouldn’t worry about whether or not AI will impact your job. It will, that’s pretty much a given at this point. Now that you know that, you have 5 years to get familiar with the ways you will interface with AI tools so that you can make sure your skills stay relevant. Keeping your skills up to date is  a requirement of most jobs, certainly most tech adjacent jobs, so you just know one space you’ll need to focus on well in advance. \n\nThese are valid questions but I don’t think any of them are actually unique to computer science and you should probably be asking the same questions about anything you’re considering as a career.",

That may slow things down. Since the facilities need more land area but also cool temperatures, why can't they be built at least partially underground to conserve both land and water?\n\nPerhaps u could focus on building things that would help build up city services or get things modernized for underdeveloped areas.\n\nI understand that everyone wants to make lots of money, but since u have found a full-time job already, u have set yourself on a good path to make a life u want. Maybe your idea for using IT could help u work with non-profits and places that can't pay hundreds of thousands up front, but that u can help because u want to serve the public. \n\nTry to think of longer-term projects for your skills. \n\nI wish you the best and am happy that u have already accomplished so much.

Case in point, my entire cycle has been spent refactoring something that was written in January (I'm guessing with AI tools) that is beginning to break in subtle ways.\n\nThough the job has undoubtably changed with these new tools at our disposal, I think there will continue to be software engineers for the foreseeable future. So from that perspective, there's still a value to learning your craft.\n\nAs for the market, there's nothing I can say but I feel for you- I hope openings for juniors open up again. I think the decision to stop hiring juniors is incredibly short sighted, but it is what it is. Do your best to network and turn non-leads into leads. Listen to whatever career progression framework your bootcamp offers.\n\nAs for burnout, take a break if you can- try and think about this from a long-term perspective and try and enjoy learning and making things for their own sake. That's what this career is about at the end of the day and there's nothing wrong with giving yourself space to reconnect with that. Good luck.",

Did it do the job - yes! Would a graphic designer do an infinitely better job than a generic WordArt - Of Course! Just because you gave a tool to layperson, doesn't mean it'll cut out a specialist",

        "body": "I hate to break it to you but CS is math + language. 😂 A lot of humanities students will say “they are not good at math” for different reasons.  I think that’s because yeah…, repeating exercises is boring af. BUT repetition is also what makes things stick. Think of music, which in fact is also a language in its own context. You hear a song enough and you can recognize it. \n\nWe communicate with symbols and logic. You gotta learn what the symbols mean in the specific context and then how to use them to express what you want. \n\nSo a breakdown of an example you gave in another comment. \n-Program in C (language/format)\n-Seconds to minutes (formula)\n\nEven if you don’t know that 60s = 1 min by memory, you can find the formula and write it down. The C language will have a way to write the function, the variables and handle any printing or user interaction. That’s the part you gotta know or find out about the language beforehand (like rules or properties). The coding skill comes from being able to write down that broken logic into the computer code. So you gotta be familiar with the language and how it works. \n\nBut in general terms you can do things for everything. Problems will sometimes have a full sentence to just say something is equal (the same) to another thing. You can usually simplify it into formulas or terms like: 3 bananas + 3 apples = 6 fruit. Instead of thinking “how pretty we can say something” in the language we’re thinking “how fast can we make a computer understand it”. I can say “I would like 6 of that delicious fruit, please good sir.” or I can say “6 fruit”. In logical terms they mean the same. “I would like” implies addition for me, which would different to “Here you go, some fruit…” which would mean a loss for me. \n\nI hope that gives some perspective of the fundamentals of logic and operational thinking.",

It actually has little to no impact about the long term existence of the field of computer science and IT.\n\nYou can look at stats like [https://www.trueup.io/job-trend](https://www.trueup.io/job-trend) if you are interested, but as a kid, I honestly wouldn't worry about that. The only take-away you should be learning from this is just maybe be prepared for a more chaotic job market with ups and downs.\n\nWhat matters more for software being worth or not to invest in as a child is just if the field is large enough.

Any *actual* animation that a user makes will have some finite length, even though there's no predefined upper limit on how big that can be.\n\nAny standard data structure such as a list, dictionary, etc. will allow you to put as many entries in it as you want. The only practical limit is the amount of available memory. \n\n(Technically, there's usually also an upper limit defined by the maximum value of the integer variable storing the data structure's size, typically on the order of 2^31 which is roughly 2 billion. But you're likely to run out of memory long before you hit that limit. And nobody is likely to be creating animations with 2 billion frames.)\n\n>  See, I would really love to poke around in the code of a pre-existing animation program to see how they did it, but once again, when I try to search about the code of an animation program google doesn't listen to me.\n\nThe specific programs you asked about are closed-source and proprietary, so the source code isn't published anywhere. Google can't find something that doesn't exist on the internet.\n\nThere's a 2D animation program called Synfig Studio which is open source: https://github.com/synfig/synfig/ But it has hundreds of thousands of lines of code so it's not going to be easy to understand for a beginner.\n\nBut see, for instance, this class which defines a `Keyframe` object and a `KeyframeList` which is a sorted list of keyframes at different times: https://github.com/synfig/synfig/blob/master/synfig-core/src/synfig/keyframe.h",

So if that's you, you need to start getting that applied experience yourself.\n\nIn terms of practical skills, I'd suggest going through [\"The Missing Semester of Your CS Education\"](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) from MIT CSAIL. This is the kind of stuff that self-motivated, self-taught people tend to just figure out on their own, but if you don't, then your university probably won't teach it to you very well. So having it all laid out in a \"syllabus\" can be helpful.\n\nAside from that, just pick a language, pick a project, and start building *something*, anything. It doesn't have to be a unique idea, or a million-dollar business, or even particularly useful. Writing a complete program, and actually putting in the work to make all of the details work the way you want them to, is irreplaceable experience. Start small, and when you find yourself not being challenged enough, move on to something bigger.\n\nThere are a million pages you can find online with simple project ideas, so just pick something that appeals to you. If you like networks, write an HTTP server from scratch with raw sockets. If you like games, build something simple and turn-based with a minimal UI, such as Tetris or Scrabble or chess. If you like productivity apps, build a clone of Google Calendar or a simple photo album organizer. You get the idea.",

But I’ve recently decided to be more disciplined with my own ideas and projects, and to actually use my free time from university to invest in myself outside of my coursework.\n\nThe thing is, I still have no idea where to start, what project to pick, what language to use, or even how most of the IT world is structured and how things work in practice. Then I talked with a fellow student and friend who’s really motivated. He’s built a lot of automation projects (like web scraping) in his free time, and he even makes money from them, which I thought was really cool.\n\nHe gave me one important piece of advice: don’t choose a project you think is useless. If your only motivation is money, it won’t be enough to push you through the difficulties of a tough project, especially since there’s no guarantee it will actually make money. Instead, pick a project that’s useful to you personally. That way, even if you don’t gain anything beyond the learning experience, you’ll at least have built a tool that helps you in your own life, which is already a great benefit.\n\nSo, I asked myself: is there anything in my life that I could automate? The answer to that question will be the project idea I’ll work on.\n\nOf course, I know there are countless other directions you can take with programming projects, not just automation. So if anyone here could share what kinds of project paths or categories exist, that would be really helpful. I’d love to explore more options beyond just automation.",

I don't know what the context is here -- and anything involving working with raw data is well above the level of this sub -- but the gist is probably this:\n\nYou have an HTML file, which contains a table presenting some text, two cells per row. The *tr* is the element for a row, the *td* the element for a [cell](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/td). Each of these cells has a class called \"datavalue,\" and from that HTML file, you could write a script that grabs everything out of any cell with the \"datavalue\" class, so you end up with a text string of \"003F00502040003F00502040\".... (I assume that there are also rows with 00, 04 , etc.)\n\nThe screenshot is a [hex editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_editor) of some kind -- I don't know which one but they basically all do the same thing: they open a file and let you directly see and edit the raw data. Right now you don't have the actual raw data, though, you have the text \"003F00502040003F00502040\" etc., so you'd have to convert that to the equivalent data file. (Don't worry about the specifics of that, there are probably built-in functions for it in whatever language you're using.)\n\nThen in the hex editor you can view what the bytes of the file are, where they are in the file, and what characters they would be if it was supposed to be readable text. This data is almost definitely not supposed to be text, but without more context I don't know what it's supposed to be. (i.e., the 00 3F and 00 50 are probably supposed to be 63 and 80, but I don't know exactly what the 63 and 80 are being used for.)\n\nAgain, all of this is very much above the level of this sub.",

Doing `cin >> text` when `text` is a `std::string` just reads a single word, defined as a sequence of non-whitespace characters. The other words are left in the input buffer. So after first reading the word `\"Going\"`, then the next time you try to read an integer, the next word will be `\"to\"`, which can't be parsed as an integer, so it'll fail. And you're not checking for input parsing failures anywhere in your program.\n\nThe console output seems to indicate that your IDE has a debugger, so you should be able to use it to single-step through the code and see these kinds of problems for yourself.",

For another, most of their projects are reimplementing other projects that are in use and define a communication protocol. So, learning to read and be exact with those protocols is actually really important so that the programs that interface using the protocol are compatible.\n\nAs to your point about whether to recommend it, sure I agree it's not right for everyone, but I personally feel the tests are quite reasonable.

If you don't have it memorized you probably don't need it often enough. Being able to find the answer when you need it is so much better than having the answer memorized.",

Got some interview prep from one company telling me to prepare to be able to write a debounce from memory, and to brush up on asynchronous data fetching, manipulation of strings and arrays. Felt we were quite clearly going to do some sort of data fetching, list rendering and filtering. Nope, full blown JS fundamentals challenge around building a Wordle game in 45 minutes, obviously no AI allowed. Bumbled my way through the whole thing trying to remember the best way to map over stuff and comparing index's for matches and partial matches. Didn't even get close to finishing. Was surprised they did that challenge despite looking for a RN dev as it’s a different vertical than what they are looking for.\n\nSecond company interview didn't send any prep, passed the second round which was a live 1 hour coding test in RN, third round was a discussion on architecture with some white-boarding. Passed it until they pulled a gotcha right at the end with 15 minutes to go. Gave me another coding test on JS fundementals, which I passed, not satisfied they deleted that one and gave me another with 5 minutes to go that I couldn't finish in the allotted time. They haven't even bothered to get back to me.\n\nI question the people who decided the processes to be honest, I don't think they know what they're looking for.

The overzealous vibe coder trope.\n\nWhat that underlying question is looking for is not to shit talk AI and be dismissive of it, nor is it to circle-jerk over AI and how it's revolutionized your life. It wants a more measured answer that talks about the pros/cons of AI, where it's useful, where it's not, and demonstrating understanding that it needs to be used with caution no matter where it's used.\n\nWe all get that it's not good at complex tasks. We all get that it sucks at being able to understand business logic to do anything useful. We all get it sucks when it needs to work in a large codebase across multiple files.\n\nBut it has some pros you didn't seem to mention at all.... the biggest one, which is what I use it for regularly, is as a faster Stack Overflow. Back in the day, when I was getting some error I wasn't sure why I was getting, I'd go Google that error. Then I'd sift through Stack Overflow questions until I find one that's close enough related to what I was doing that it can push me in the right direction, and usually hit my head against a wall until things finally work.\n\nNowadays when I get an error, I type into Copilot \"Why am I getting \\[pasted error\\]?\". Copilot looks at my code, scours the internet/docs to find answers that are directly relevant to my code, and can give me relevant answers way faster than I could get on my own. It's of course not always right on the first try, but with a follow up prompt or 2 I almost always end up with an easy fix with very little effort from me. This is like 90% of what I use AI for, and it's absolutely been a massive benefit.\n\nI also like it for very mundane tasks that are conceptually simple, but are time consuming. Coming up with unit tests is one. AI can easily read code paths, and shit out enough tests to get good coverage. It's usually pretty bad at *implementing* the unit tests, but I can take over from there, it did the boring part for me.\n\nAI's also great at just asking general questions. Why read through AWS's terrible docs when I can ask a single prompt, and get a right answer most of the time.\n\nI'm on your side that I think AI's pretty bad at doing most code generation tasks beyond very simple or very isolated stuff.... but you're being overly dismissive if you can't think of any ways it can make your life easier.",

So a lot is on the individual if they know they need to grow that area and practice it themselves\n\nAnd then with technical skills there’s a lot of room to make mistakes and failsafes to catch you.

        "body": "I mean literally every post on Reddit tells you this lol.\n\nAnyway, I was always a weird nerd, hung around nerds, shy non-popular guys etc. But because I was always great at sport and athletic I would hang around jocks and even gangsters so I learned how to get along with alot of different people.\n\nThis is a big question so there's nowhere to start really but for Reddit I will say this, biggest killers for the guys here are the following: Introverted, self awareness and over-valuing intelligence. I can explain lol.\n\n1. Introverted: People use this as a self-built cage rather than just a label. It shouldn't even be a label the way this word has a mental hold on people on Reddit. Firstly, yes you can be naturally inclined toward introversion or extraversion, but there's caveats. Being introverted or extroverted doesn't neccessarily mean bad at social interaction versus good. I've seen plenty of extraverts who fucking suck at social situations and introverts who are great, they just prefer to be alone more often. You can be good at social skills and continue to carry your special little introvert label if you want, it's just going to be a little harder than if you were an extravert ***simply because you're getting in less reps.*** An extrovert will try and fail more = more chance for success. Also, you can switch between being introverted or extroverted, this isn't WoW where you can't cast a spell because you chose the paladin class. You're allowed to try being extroverted for a week, year, decade if you want.\n\nLike OP said it will feel weird at first, but ask any guy who got ripped from being fat if he felt like a natural in the gym the first day he picked up a weight. Nope, he worked through the pain and embarassment and got the reward. The good thing about social skills is that it doesn't even take that long, nor do you have to always be the social guy.. you can just learn the skills and keep it in your back pocket until you need it.\n\n2. Self awareness: Reddit copes alot by thinking that extraverts in engineering are just \"smooth talkers\" wrong. Smooth talking is a skill that comes with social skills, but it's not the whole pie. Some social people over-use smooth talking and get found out real quick and exposed, luckily here on Reddit we're all extremely intelligent and know what's best for the world so that won't be our issue... right?\n\nThere's a negative connotation in engineering for having good social skills and confidence. I get laughed at by my friends for having \"good english\" and \"talking shit\".. like that's something to be embarassed about? In reality, I have great language skills to explain things to people of all levels, and I can basically nail down concepts into managable pieces for customers to understand without confusing them with jargon.. that's a skill that requires intelligence, humility and understanding concepts. Engineering isn't just about calculating numbers really fast, or memorising a fourier transform, we're here to sell products and create ideas. You NEED to be able to communicate those ideas or else the math and physics is lost in the void. What's the point of being able to create nuclear power if the government is scared of it and thus bans it because you can't explain to them why it's neccessary. \n\n3. over-valuing intelligence: In the sense that people here like to min/max intel stats, that's great. More intelligence is always good, but again that's not a license for you to suck at conveying your ideas or to treat people like shit. Yes conceptually a team of really high intel nerds will be good for a company, but in reality we live in a market where we need to promote ideas and actually be able to understand from person to person. You can't do that by being very intelligent but a dick or can't explain your ideas to people in simple terms.",

I definitely prefer FTE.\n\nDiff strokes, however:\n* i generally try to befriend my coworkers, and so generally 'team building' isn't something that i see as a something that is a chore, more like i don't even tthink about it\n* Benefits via staffing agency SUUUUUUUK. You may not notice this much if you are young, single, and generally in good health, but its HUUGE when you have kids. I have twins.\n* the employee 'type' doesn't change how I engage w/ my coworkers - i'm a bit of a jokester and always try to lighten the mood, make work fun - to me that makes sense just cause, in theory i'm sitting next to you 8 hrs a day, i better like clocking in. But a lot of folks prefer keeping work & personal separate, that's totally fine too.\n* with regards to layoffs, generally in my exp contractors are 'first to go' of the engineers - not first to go like let go, they just don't renew your contract. A much bigger/critical layoff usually they cut ties with the staffing agency completely, i've seen.\n* for me it's all about stability, longevity, benefits. my contract ends just before december but i only recently started and i'm trying to bust my ass to get an extension / converted\n* not being eligible for some of the better FTE perks, sucks. Its like, I work just as much as any other person on the team, it'd be nice if i can be included in certain things \n\nThere's some things i like - like being held to 40 hrs a week, any overtime needs approval and you actually can get paid for it. generally that means i'm off the hook for pagerduty. Net 7 (getting paid every week) is nice too",

I have always preferred FTE in the past because you get the good salary, there is no waiting to see if you get extended, the benefits will be better, you get PTO, and paid holidays.  And who knows, you might even get a bonus, and a promotion.   Who knows!\n\nI seemed to fall into temporary contract work when FTE positions were not available.   I never minded doing some contract work.   I didn't worry about office politics like the OP said.   In some cases, I got holiday pay and even bonuses from some contracting companies.   But what I didn't like was short term extensions.   I worked for one client who did first 6 months, then another 6 months, and then it was 3 months, and then 3 months.   I had to leave.    I told my manager, who was a great person BTW, that I simply can't keep extending for 3 months.   As soon as you start the 3 months, you need to start looking again halfway through ... if you;re going to extend me, at least make it for some length of time, but I know she didn't control the money, so that was that.\n\nNowadays, I've been getting laid off a lot, the FTE roles don't seem to last very long themselves.  Yeah, you might get some extra benefits from FTE, but longevity isn't one of them.     I definitely have friends who have been contracting at one client for years and years, they have been around longer than most FTE employees.  They just keep getting extended, and they know the work, and it's not hard.    \n\nSo, pros and cons for each ..........",

It forces you to think thoughtfully on your solutions.\n\n\nNowadays it usually recommended to do something with cloud infra.

That is more than enough to host a discord bot, simple website, bot to do some scrapping or something. \n\n\nAnd these projects typically walk you down the path of setting up a box with database connections/setup etc... And then you can flesh it out more with a simple devops ci/cd flow etc.. You can make these architecture as simple or complex. You really do learn quite  lot from networking, design problems, coding challenges etc... \n\n\nAnd you are right. No one gives a shot about a calculator app. There is very little educational value besides experimenting with a language at a basic level.\n\n\nBut really just start.

Being a bit quiet, or loud, or odd, or by-the-book, or socially inexperienced are not traits limited to people with autism or ADHD. And all of us can improve.\n\nI had crippling social anxiety starting my first job and now I’m getting promoted and my boss explicitly mentioned I’m extremely well-liked in the office. People like my empathy more than they give a damn about my ADHD. Gen Z in general struggles with social skills because we were locked in a room during COVID for core developmental years.\n\nDon’t panic, you’ll be fine.\n\nedit: and watch The Residence on Netflix if you haven’t. If you pride yourself in your technical skills and know you are autistic then it could be a nice reminder that autism makes some people better at their jobs. Your brain works differently than most and that can be quite handy.",

        "body": "The pattern you usually see is this: if someone comes from very humble beginnings with no networks, no capital, and no guidance, and still becomes wildly successful, there’s usually an incredible amount of luck involved. Like, you know, fortune striking them at just the right moments.\n\nTake Steve Jobs as an example. People often point out that he was poor, which is true, but he also got some extraordinary breaks that almost nobody gets. He met Wozniak, who happened to be a genius at building computers, at exactly the right time. Woz let Jobs run with the business side, they launched their first product, it took off immediately, and suddenly Jobs was financially independent. Apple went on an upward spiral so fast he never really saw any serious failure early in his life. That kind of alignment is rare.\n\nIf you’re coming from very humble beginnings, you usually need multiple strokes of luck like that to become extremely successful. Getting to moderate success or financial independence is possible with hard work, but the billionaire-level outcomes are much harder without serious tailwinds.\n\nFinance and tech both show this in different ways. Finance is even more network-heavy. Running a fund is all about raising money, and raising money is basically a game of connections. Technology is also about contacts in the Valley when it comes to big fundraising rounds, but the barrier to entry can be lower.\n\nSo if you’re poor, you can still make it, but you’ll need a lot of luck. Even if you claw your way up, the climb is steeper. No contacts, no capital, and no safety net mean it will take much longer to reach the same level as someone who started with connections.",

        "body": "  \nI've been on both sides of this. I started my career as an 'ambitious overachiever,' burned out hard, and then tried the 'maintain boundaries' approach. Here's what I learned.  \n**As an Ambitious Overachiever:**  \nFrom my personal experience, going above and beyond only **works if you're able to \"showcase\" your work.** That is, people in the company need to actively **see you as someone who goes \"above and beyond\"** in order for it to matter. You should also make sure to **document your achievements and positive feedback** received so you can later present them to management when discussing raises, promotions, and so on. I would also say, though this is also another personal experience thing, that **going above and beyond in every category is both ineffective and leads to burnout.** It's better to **have one project which you own/lead and excel** **at** at a time, and do the \"regular\" amount of work on your other projects.  In addition, it is important to build rapport. You don't have to be an extrovert per se, but **people should leave feeling positively after talking with you.** \n\nOn the downside, **career progression** at any one company inherently **depends on how much room there is for promotion** and the budget of your department. Plus, overperformance makes you advance faster but rarely do you ever skip progression tiers. You may be a truly stellar, outstanding, junior engineer, but you won't get promoted to senior engineer immediately. You'll likely just spend one year less in junior, one year less in mid, and so on. It also only partially protects you from layoffs--**you'll be the last junior engineer laid off**, but if they're **laying off all junior engineers you're still gonna get laid off.**\n\nSomething I learned the hard way is that no matter how much of a \"go above and beyond\" employee you are, **one period of poor performance**, even if do to extenuating circumstances, **can very quickly destroy your reputation** as an overperformer. If this happens, you should immediately look for a new job unless you really love your current workplace. I also found that **opportunities to truly excel can be difficult to find and sometimes even be gatekept.**\n\nIt is important to remember that much of **your excellent performance will evaporate** when searching for a new job **unless you're able to show public artifacts** which showcase it. Maybe references can do this too, but you need to tell the new employer to actually contact them. I got laid off without any public artifacts to show off, and it made job searching ***much harder.***\n\n**Do great work but maintain boundaries approach:**\n\nI took this approach after burning out, though that burnout was partly due to a toxic coworker.  \nI found it to be less stressful and often my outcomes became more consistent, which many employers value more than someone who does overall better work but in an inconsistent fashion. In general, it's only seen as a bad thing at (healthy) companies if it's the kinda role where overtime is inherently expected or a startup. How your work itself is recognized largely depends on your manager and how well they understand it. I'd say your manager's **subjective perception of your work matters far more than the actual work quality.**\n\n**Advancement** felt like it **depended** more **on the state the economy**. Good economy, relatively normal advancement rate. Bad economy, slower advancement rate and layoffs. \n\n**Summary/takeaway:**\n\nBrute-force 'tryharding' is rarely worth the investment and often leads to burnout. If there's a project you can take ownership over, do that and make sure to 'show it off' like a salesman.  Make sure to have evidence to support your skills for both internal promotions and getting jobs elsewhere. **Be an intelligent, strategic achiever who works to own and lead projects while building the skillset you want, rather than an overachiever for the company you work for.**",

The question should be more nuanced though- people (especially engineers) LOVE to microoptimize on a single variable when that isn't actually productive because our lives are multifaceted (e.g. either minmaxing saving money, or being a yolo spender). \nMy practical recommendations are 2 things\n1) oscillate based on priority. Some projects are important, high-vis, high-impact and will leapfrog your career more than the rest of your work combined. Spending a bit more effort here pays dividends. Similarly, if you're close to a promo you care about, it's worth doing a bit extra. Rest of the time, it's okay to just do enough.\n\n\n2) understand the rubric better. Unlike school where assignments are graded 0-100%, work is very ambiguous. Understand who controls your career trajectory (usually your direct manager and maybe skip level), and optimize for success. Find ways to proactively make your manager's job easier, and make your manager look good to their management. This will do the most. \n\n\nOne anecdote I've shared a few times: I grinded really hard when I joined this job, manager denied my promo again and again based on random nitpicks from career ladder doc. I eventually threw in the towel and said fuck it, that manager left, my new manager was chill and I kept sandbagging. I'd be responsive and helpful on shared projects, but I was also literally playing video games during the day (wfh). Despite all this, my new manager pretty soon put me up for promo successfully without me asking, and handwaved a bunch of career ladder \"requirements\". I did have to do a bit of extra work since manager asked me to draft my own promo doc (usually manager duty, but fair enough trade lol). It's all fuzzy and hand wavey end of day as long as those in charge approve ",

Without stars and citations, GitHub repos and arXiv papers are laborious to evaluate and are indistinguishable from slop.\n* Our work inevitably requires some research, which usually doesn't pan out. If a manager makes a bad hire, and they're not competent in ML themselves, they have to wait through a long string of failures in order to decide \"okay this person is incompetent\" and finally fire him.\n\nSo hiring managers have to be very, very careful. In such murky circumstances, it's rational to resort to costly social signals. Publications in conferences, placements in Kaggle competitions, and of course experience at prestigious companies are reliable signals of competence, only because they are so costly to fake. They'd rather overpay for a highly-qualified candidate (not you or me) than gamble on someone less-credentialed who passed their interview (which they know isn't terribly high-signal to begin with).\n\nThis is all many times more extreme for researchers, for whom a PhD is mandatory.\n\n>But i see people doubling their salaries all with just taking a single course on basic ML....how???\n\nThis would be news to me.",

However, based on what you wrote, you and many others have been both mislead and duped by these influencers. Many influencers show off a lavish life style funded by millions of dollars in debt. They aren't rich by any means. Only faking it.\n\n>I’ve noticed that in tech communities especially software engineering, there’s a lot of emphasis on talking about compensation packages, benefits, and perks. You see it everywhere from “Day in the Life” YouTube videos where someone shows off their free lunches, nap pods, and flexible schedules, to posts comparing salaries across companies.\n\nTech encompasses a wide range of compensation, benefits and perks. What you see on social media is the top 10% of all tech. It would look completely different - perhaps even bleak, if someone actually showed the day in the life of a median (50th percentile) or worst (100th percentile) job.\n\nThey certainly don't have free lunches, nap pods, and may be even lucky if they get free coffee. They might be filling out time-sheets and staring down some of the worst-maintained technology with very strict deadlines and constraints for changes. Depending on the country, the median can range anywhere from $40K-80K. Does that sound super cushy to you?\n\n>Don’t get me wrong, I get why this happens. Tech jobs *can* be cushy, with relaxed work environments, decent pay, and nice benefits. That kind of lifestyle is attractive to students and career switchers. But sometimes it feels like people act as if tech is the *only* field with these kinds of perks, which isn’t true.\n\nDo you really get why this happens?\n\nBased off of your perspective you don't. The phenomenon is more broadly categorized as \"keeping up with the jones\" within the last century. Only with the internet it has allowed people to share their accomplishments across a larger audience that would not have been possible before.\n\nPreviously such people would only be able to reach as far as people similarly within their economic circle. People irrespectively have been comparing themselves to others within their social circle for millennia. The rich compared themselves with other rich. The poor compared themselves to other poor. The middle class compared themselves to other middle class. Its competition, its standard human nature that we haven't grown out of.\n\nThe internet and more specifically Social Media has given everyone a microphone to broadcast themselves.\n\n>There are plenty of non-tech office jobs that can be just as cushy and well-compensated, if not more so in some cases. For example:\n\nAny job can be cushy if you're in the right positions. But your perspective is off-keel and your barking up the wrong trees. Within ALL professions, there is the top, middle, and bottom. What you see on social media being \"cushy\" jobs is nothing more than a facade - including in the industries you mentioned. They are designed to spark envy.\n\nMany of these high paying jobs are not \"cushy\" in the slightest - at least if people are actually performing their job. These so-called benefits only exist to extract more work hours out of staff. You get subjected to the political machinations resulting from the Jack Welsh Rank-And-Yank (the Hunger Games).",

But there's a really deadly spiral that a fair amount of people get stuck in.\n\nThey land at a shit job where the things you're talking about are the norm, then they get burned out and desperate for a new job, and because of that desperation they fail to do their due diligence in the reverse interview and/or aren't picky enough with the new job, so they end up somewhere just as bad. Rinse and repeat, and your entire career is just shit job after shit job.\n\nIt's a hard cycle to break once you're in it, because you never ditch that feeling of desperation.\n\nLayoff/management changes aren't really unique to our industry. What is fairly unique to this industry is our painful interviews, which only makes it harder to get out of the deadly spiral once you're in it because you're both burnt out from your shit job, *and* the shit interview process. Double burnout.\n\n>How do I just find some peace in this field?\n\nSo the things you're talking about re: stress, unrealistic deadlines, mismanagement, shit culture, etc aren't *inherent* of this field. They're inherent of toxic companies. The trick is finding a company that isn't toxic. Just because a company has lower pay doesn't mean they'll be lower stress/not toxic. Just because a company has higher pay doesn't mean they'll be higher stress/toxic.\n\nThis requires you to get really get at reverse-interviewing to sus out companies like that, *and* to be able to have the patience to not humor offers from companies that sound like they'll have cultures like that. I've said \"No thanks\" to plenty of companies.\n\nI've worked at 4 companies since graduating, 2 more if you count my internships, and I'd only describe one of them as turning toxic. That one was *great* to work for for about 2 years, but they had a CTO change who slowly tried to turn up the heat on the devs, which resulted in me and most of the good devs jumping ship before it got really bad. The other 5 companies though? Great WLB/cultures. I left one because I wanted to move to the east coast (100% onsite days), some of my friends are *still there* 12 years into their career. I left another one cause I was sick of the industry it was in, but honestly this was probably a mistake. The 3rd was the one I said turned toxic after 2 years. The one I'm at now is still smooth sailing over a year in.\n\nGood companies are out there. You just have to find them.",

He would get off department calls, and the second he hung up, one of our managers would say, “oh good, he’s gone, now we can get some real work done.” So…\n\nFortunately for me, the business saw how little value he was bringing within 6 months after, and suddenly he was forced out in a matter of months once his old boss (and best friend) left him high and dry to pursue a higher position.\n\nI hate to admit it, but someone once told me, “50% of your career is what you know, and 50% is who you know.” I’d hate to think they are right, but I’ll\nbe damned if there isn’t a pole of evidence to support it.",

So if you’re the same my advice there is to approach everything in a similar way, learn the underlying concepts (even if they’re “outdated”) before moving onto the more modern approaches. For instance, with frontend web, just start with plain HTML/CSS/JS, then start bringing in some libraries like JQuery (or maybe could skip this part), then move onto more modern frameworks like React, etc. And similarly when learning something like React, just start with that, then later start integrating other libraries into it (say for state management, etc.). \n\nWhat parts of git, CI/CD, unit testing, DBs, are you struggling with?\n\nAlso maybe some books on different architectural design topics might help with the OOP or general software design principles.",

Keep in mind there are many different software domais to know, you are simply more familiar and comfortable with lower level code. \n\nTo me it seems it sounds like you would benefit from studying things from the ground up. Frameworks are abstractions of behavior. And like most of the not low level software, it's made up of low level software. So maybe read up on how to make a rest server from the ground up. Or how to use JS to create a simple framework. Granted that's if you want to go in that area.\n\nAlternative look for roles more focused on C/Unix, you can also start using AI tools to judge your code and see what they come up with. As much as we hate AI it can be used to learn what to learn. Ask what's expected of a Dev in a role you want, then make it give you a small project to practice the skills you are lacking. But keep in mind that you can't simply code for yourself, you gotta pretend someone will have to use your code sooner rather than later. 5 years ago getting feedback on thst without coworkers was hard, but now you can ask AI to help you figure out how to do something better.\n\nGit and CI/CDs are tools, learn them like such, an online class for git will teach you more than you need.\n\nTesting your own code should just become 2nd nature to you for low level, it's just code that verified other code is doing what you expect it to. Web framework tests have more in mind depending what you are testing, so I wouldn't touch that just yet.\n\nAs for OOP C code, have you tried looking at how some popular repos do it? Tbh certain languages have poor OOP implementations so it will always look ugly for them. And tbh some OOP code will be ugly regardless due to the complexity they can accumulate.\n\nDon't give up!

That will be your next job application!\n\nOr at least, given the 85 or so companies I have worked for or with, that's how it's had to be. Anyone showing ideas above their station, well, you know yourself now what you get.\n\nSecond, despite what most people would like to think, there is no top exec keeping an eye on you, ready to pluck you for stardom! I have only ever seen a company's butt tighten up like a snare drum when it comes to spending money on someone, i.e. promotion, training, etc. This whole idea of the company needs to value you or needs to encourage you, that's not the aim of the game for most companies.\n\nAnd to people who just want to say, \"I guess you worked for shitty companies\", 85 or so in so far, I've yet to see it any different. If yours is different, let me know how to apply! Even the nicest of places to work get fidgety when you tell them you've gone done achieved something big that's worth a lot more on the job market. That goes double if there's someone already in the position you're working towards.\n\nAny promotion means a move. Just bide your time, learn your stuff, get your experience on your CV, and most of all, shut the hell up! Those four words are the best advice I can give you for almost any industry.",

Keep conversations up with your manager (ask for skip level 1v1s) to ensure you stay in communication so your manager can continue to gauge how you are doing vs. what your lead is saying. That then allows your manager to know how to work with the lead to make them a better leader as well. It is not being arrogant when you say I’ve worked on this and this and this and these are the outcomes. If you mess up, own it and say I learned my lesson and don’t do Y again. That goes a long way and gains lots of respect, which helps with stability.\nIt doesn’t hurt to put feelers out there for other jobs, but each job has his own crap to deal with. I would evaluate the opportunities you have and get vs. this lead being a pain. This lead may not be here for forever either. If the lead is your only problem, do skip level 1v1s and go from there. Remember, everyone is learning. The lead, yes is being not a great lead, but likely it’s their first time being a leader and trying to figure it out and needs some guidance. Just like you when you first started. Try to highlight the wins with the lead too! Maybe that will get them thinking more positively as well. And maybe the lead is thinking of you as more senior than you are due to the work you are doing. So reminding them how young in your career you are can help.\nRegarding leaving the field, this is more of a corporate life issue than the field. I deal with this in cybersecurity (got a degree in compsci so why follow) too. You will run into these issues no matter what field you are in. Unfortunately school doesn’t teach you how to traverse corporate life. I say it sounds like you are doing a great job and have a lot of opportunities to grow. Do skip level 1v1s with your manager, communicate what work you are doing and the outcomes with both your lead and manager, and see what happens. Best of luck to you!",

You need to not only finish your own work but also grow people and that’s pretty hard to do remotely. Maybe you are the exception… Have you done that successfully while leading junior dev’s growth remotely? you just confident because you’ve been an effective IC remotely? Those are two different things, tbh. Your manager’s concern is not unfounded. Especially since you’ve never been a manager before. Learning how to be a manager as a remote manager…good luck. I’ve had 3 remote managers at this point in my career and none of them grew me nearly as much as my co-located managers.\n\nAlso, managers are supposed to (imo) shield their reports from unnecessary office politics as much as possible. How would you do that if you aren’t even in the office to keep tabs on the said office politics? Your reports, especially the junior ones who don’t know how to manager up, may suffer alone and not know whom to turn to or how to deal with it.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind…it’s fine to stay an IC and prioritize family. Not every stage of your career has to be growth oriented. Please don’t become a manager for the sake of the next promotion - those usually end up the worst managers. Become a manager when you are ready to mentor and grow people. When you are thinking about starting a family, it’s ok to take a backseat and coast/autopilot a bit in your current job. You can always become a manager later. But your kid(s) only grow up once.",

There are also levels beyond staff (senior staff, principal, distinguished, fellow).\n\nThere's different leveling structures across the industry like Amazon's SDE1/2/3 and Microsoft's 59-80, and there's companies with different title progressions (e.g. again Amazon, where there's no \"staff\", or IBM, where \"staff\" means mid level and comes before senior), so talking in terms of \"L5\" just makes it easier to talk about level equivalency across companies.\n\nEach level has rubrics for both hiring and promotions, largely based on amount of scope/impact, and these rubrics are similar across different companies for the respective levels.",

The reason why a lot of new grad roles start very (typically between 2-4) is that anything under might be an intern role or a role at the company that is just lower. And for which level you interview for, it depends on your previous experience. Assume L5 is senior, if you apply to this role most companies will assume you have been senior or you have showcased senior capabilities already. Some companies will up level you or down level you depending on their definition of the level. For example meta e3 is new grad and you actually can’t have experience (I think you need less than 1) , so above that you can be E4, if you have the experience you might be E5, if you have 3 yoe but you experience aligns highly with what they want and you perform well in interviews they might up level you to E5 (rare).\n\nAlso L6 is not necessarily best engineer or something. You can move up your career just having a lot of luck too (probably still a good worker). I know someone at my company who went from L3 equivalent to L6 equivalent in 1 year (internal job change, pm).\n\nYou move up by showing that you have already been performing at that level. Sometimes you can’t move up though due to budget and other office politic reasons.",

Imagine spending a bunch of time and money moving to California, and then the only job you can line up require you to move to Detroit. Now you're hit with 2 major, very expensive, moves instead of 1.\n\nI'm not sure how coming from Japan will impact that... Are you a US citizen? Would you be able to do remote interviews during US business hours? If so, where you live *currently* shouldn't play a huge role in your job search. The fact that you are willing to relocate for the job is what's important.\n\nI've never relocated internationally, but I've relocated for a job twice in the US, moving across the country both times, and never found my location to be an issue during the job hunt. The fact I was willing to relocate is all the company cared about.",

Places like Buffalo and Rochester, NY even have plenty of entry level SWE jobs despite not being huge trendy cities. \n\nI would first consider what I value about where I live(do you like it warm, or snow, what outdoor activities, city size) and then consider what companies are there and how easily I could put down roots and network.  \n\nIf I was a young person right now I'd probably pick NYC, Boston, Seattle, maybe Philly to stay cheaper.

I was labeled a \"temp worker\" with no benefits or PTO, yet I was given consistent a 40 hour schedule each week, with no expected end date.

(machine learning based, but was a good example of data handling as well)\n\nI just kept taking on more challenges because they didn't have others who could do it. my suggestion is to aim for old \"fossil\" type non-tech companies. they are trying to modernize so they want people with these skills, but they don't pay super well, and wont have any mentors for you. They will like people who can independently teach themselves how to work with new systems.

        "body": "I actually gave a short talk about this last week. My short opinion is \"yes, but a bubble doesn't mean the technology is worthless\". \n\nRight now what most people call \"AI\"  (which is really just a small subset of generative AI) is almost definitely in a bubble. There's an unbelievable amount of investment in it, a ton of business ventures that use it without a clear plan or analysis, and a lot of integration in places where it doesn't add much value.  There are also a lot of people banking on it doing things in the future that it doesn't do right now, and putting money into it based on an assumption that \"it'll do everything we need soon\".\n\nThere's also an issue at the very top. Companies that provide the service are not making money off it yet, and they will need to either raise their prices or lower their costs to make it profitable in the future. They're all hoping to win a market share and then hike up the prices. This is disastrous for businesses which are, by-and-large, planning as though their current rates will be stable forever.\n\nUnlike blockchain/crypto, however, AI does show many profitable use-cases. AI does work that would cost money, and it provides services people will pay for. Business analyses DO show that AI is successfully being used by businesses sometimes. It's just that most businesses don't know what works or doesn't work, and are using the technology blindly.\n\nI would liken it to the \"Dotcom Bubble\". The internet as a business technology was absolutely in a bubble in the 90s, and that bubble crashed. It wasn't because \"having a website for your business\" was a bad idea, it was because people were trying to do it without a good plan. Nowadays every business has a website, but unlike the 90s we've established clear use cases which provide value instead of just guessing what works and what doesn't.\n\nI expect AI to be the same. AI will \"crash\". There will be downtime where a lot of businesses disappear, and from the ashes will rise a few clear uses where generative AI is used by almost every business.",

Whether you would call that a bubble depends on what you think will happen when the market for the technology moves beyond hype into a mature, useful stage. There are many realistic and valuable business applications for LLMs, computer vision, etc. These tools are incredibly powerful and will only get better as the models get refined and as more skilled developers work on them (whether they are newly trained in an ML-specific context, like me, or they're crossing over from more rigorous, traditional SWE backgrounds).\n\n\nI'm currently a manager in a non-technical role but taking point on some exploratory AI projects, and I'm looking for a role as an ML engineer down the road. What I'm paying attention to, both in my current role and in my job search, is whether the product brings real business value. Investors and execs don't understand this stuff, they see how quickly and confidently chatgpt spits out text and they believe it's magic that's going to relieve them of the burden of workers. Dishonest hype men are more than happy to take advantage of that. \n\n\nBut if you actually understand how these models work on even a rudimentary technical level then you can smell the bullshit from a mile away. I'm not going to peddle bullshit and I'm not going to go work for bullshit except as a last resort. I think that very few companies can survive selling bullshit (though some do) but I won't be surprised to see a lot of snake oil AI startups go under in the next few years, so I don't want to bank on that for my future.",

If you have a medical facility near you, any communities related to them are also a good place to look because a lot of doctors have nannies. New residents and med students with kids in particular may be looking to nanny share to save some money. \n\nYour other option is to aggresively consolidate your day and hire in-home help for that time. For example, make your working hours 9AM-1PM (or whatever). Find a part time nanny who is willing to do 4 hours per day. Then tell work that your hours for meetings and other syncronous work have shifted into that mid-day block or to hours when your husband is home. \n\nBoth of these options, a nanny share or a part time nanny, will run you a similar cost to high quality infant daycare, but will keep your child from getting sick with all of the daycare sicknesses. It's also better for babies that small to be home. Group care is just not the best option for that age, so if you can avoid it, you should.

Or are you part of an SA team/pool? It’s possible you’re meant to act as part of a technical oversight team and provide guidance/approval on new architecture, etc. That would be my guess. My assumption is you’d have some more heads-down time but potentially have a different kind of context-switching. Not sure if you’d be working with multiple teams/projects at once or not. \n\nGood luck, sounds very stressful. ",

        "body": "People here have good advice but I'll tell you my story as it's very similar to yours. Advice at the end.\n\nSome background here: My wife and I had twins 4.5 months ago. My wife is a PM at a startup (she has anywhere from 2-4 hours of meetings a day), I'm a senior dev at a more established company (I have 30 minutes of meetings per day), and we both WFH full time. Also, I often can get away with working 10 hour weeks but the occasional crunch time for a project means I'm working 40 hours. My wife had \\~3 months of maternity leave and I had 2 weeks of PTO that I used all up front when the babies were born. Ours were also underbaked (lol) at 37 weeks which is actually full term for twins. Our twins for the first \\~4 months were also EXTREMELY clingy and could not be put down. We we wearing them almost all hours of the day.\n\nOur original plan was to attempt to balance them between meetings and work - we thought this might be feasible since my meeting schedule is so light and my working hours are extremely flexible.\n\nTowards the end of my wife's maternity leave, we realized things were only getting harder with the twins. On days where I happen to have a few extra meetings and she does as well (nearly every day for her) we really didn't have a backup plan other than 2 screaming babies behind me on camera or me skipping meetings. \n\nSo in the final week before she went back to work, we hired a nanny who came to our house to watch the babies from 9-2. That offered us enough time to get things down and squeeze our meetings into this time window and then do any work we needed to follow up with later in the evening. Even this was not a very sustainable lifestyle as we found ourselves far too often working into the night when we were exhausted from taking care of twins most of the day. Our nanny didn't end up working out - she was unable to care for the babies as they needed a caretaker who had more energy (you can read my previous posts for more context here) so we ended up letting her go a few weeks ago and we are currently on week 3 of working while taking care of the twins. Let me tell you, it is extremely difficult. I take meetings in my airpods with screaming babies and then run out of the room to give my scrum update and then immediately after (2 min later) run back into the room to continue looking after them. I take meetings on walks. I cram as much work into their short nap windows as I possibly can. My wife and I both work late into the night to make it work. It is HARD. I would not wish it on anyone.\n\nMy wife just put in her 2 weeks notice and work and I just landed a new job that gives me a raise to cover enough of her loss in comp that we should be fine for her to just be full time SAHM for now.\n\nTLDR;\n\nMy situation is slightly different than yours - 2 WFH parents with 2 babies. But I think you also will find (especially with your heavy meeting load) that it's just not sustainable. You might make it work for a few weeks but inevitably you'll find that you can't dedicate enough effort to either work or your baby and likely both will suffer for it.\n\nMy advice would be to spend the time now (before you go back to work) finding people in your network/community/neighborhood who would be interested in nanny sharing and then find ways if possible to reduce spending in other areas of your life to free up some funds for this. It's not going to be easy. But it will likely be SO MUCH easier than trying to do everything yourself.\n\nDM me or I can put you in contact with my wife if you have any questions!",

Maybe do a trial run of trying to take care of your baby while also doing those type of tasks. Is it doable at all? I’ve found it to be really tricky but maybe you’ll have better luck. If you are able to make some progress here, you’ll be one step ahead if you decide the changes at your company aren’t something you want to deal with.

She attended three days per week and my husband WFH the other two days and took turns watching her. We worked evenings and weekends to make up for it. When she became mobile, we sent her to daycare four days per week.\n\nIt's hard to WFH with a baby. It can be done, but you're really doing both your job and your baby a disservice. Luckily we found an amazing daycare with teachers and staff we trust. Our daughter adjusted really easily - it even helped her establish a good schedule and nap in a crib! We truly consider daycare as part of our \"village.\"\n\nI hope you have an amazing remainder of maternity leave and soak up all those sweet snuggles.

I would recommend picking what vibes with you the most since that will help shape your success here. Remember, after a year you can switch teams so you're not on your first team forever.\n\nI work in Infra because I just was never a big product person. I like working on things that make other developers more productive, rather than a new shiny feature. But of course this means my family, friends, etc. never really \"get\" what I actually do or get to see my work, which I'm fine with. If you wanna have the \"Yeah, I built that pride\" then product would be a good fit. For me I looked mostly at the language and general technologies the teams worked with. Once I found a team writing a majority Rust day-to-day it was an easy call for me.\n\nI would talk about org / team pulse scores, oncall workload if any, priorities on the team and for the org. Talk to the EM, the TL, and try to ask to speak with a normal IC on the team 1:1 and just have a conversation.",

It's not that you have to have a deep understanding of every layer, top to bottom, but at least be able to sketch it out and know a little bit about what it does. It's totally normal if the parts \"far\" away from where you normally work you don't know so well. Nobody will care whether or not you can describe how CAN signaling works. You should probably at least be able to describe what it looks like when the CAN messages are delivered to you though.\n\nThis in particular is a red flag, so hopefully it's a joke:\n\n>“Tell me something about RTOS”\n\n>“Uhhhh…you have tasks and the scheduler schedules them….”\n\nYou've worked on this thing for 2 years and haven't put in the work to understand *any* part of it? An open ended question like this is really your time to shine, you get to steer the conversation. Be able to crush those kinds of questions.\n\nAnd to be clear here, you don't have to know everything about it by any stretch. But you should have at least a couple nuggets of hard-fought learning. Something you debugged or implemented where you had to go brush up a bit?\n\nYou're going to get questions about work you've done, and you want to be able to hit more or less these couple items in the response\n\n1. What problem you were trying to solve with the example you give?\n2. What did your changes build leverage from the layer below, how is the layer above going to use them?\n3. How does what you did work, to a decent level of detail?\n4. What tradeoffs are there to consider?\n5. How did you validate what you did?\n\nThink back to some tasks you've done and try to answer those questions about them. Try just writing the answers down, don't worry about how long it takes you.\n\nIf you're not able to do it, even after some time and thought, you need to start revisiting how you're trying to grow your skills as an engineer. Make sure you understand the context around stuff you are doing. Occasionally take something apart you don't understand, even if it works, just to learn it better.\n\nIf you're able to do it after taking a breath and pondering on it a bit, then you probably just need to work on your speaking skills and confidence a bit. Running through the jot it down exercise will help you there as well. If you have some willing friends, try just explaining stuff to them, and have them ask you questions about it.\n\nAnd hey, no need to despair, these are all things you can practice and improve. Most of us deal with some level of imposter syndrome too, you're not the first guy in this situation and you won't be the last. Put in the effort and you'll be just fine.\n\n  \nGood luck!",

These companies care way more about your ability to solve algorithmic problems, design systems, and write clean code than whether you can explain bit timing from memory. The embedded knowledge you do have actually gives you a solid foundation in systems thinking and low-level concepts that many general SWE candidates lack entirely.\n\nYou're probably overthinking this transition. Your embedded background demonstrates you can work with complex systems, debug tricky issues, and understand performance constraints - all valuable skills that translate well to general software development. Focus your prep time on the things that actually matter for these roles: data structures and algorithms, system design, and getting comfortable with the languages and frameworks they use. The fact that you can navigate codebases and solve problems is exactly what they're looking for, not your ability to recite protocol specifications.\n\nI'm on the team that built [AI for interviews](http://interviews.chat), and we've seen plenty of engineers successfully transition between specialties by focusing their interview prep on the core competencies that matter most for their target roles.",

        "body": "I came from defense company where i worked on a radar for 4 years. I then went into one of the companies you listed and worked in their cloud services for aobut 3 years. \n\nYour concerns are valid. \n\nI dont know how closely related my first job is to your job but here was my experience. \n\nAt defense, work life balance was a lot better. I didnt have to think about work after 5 pm. The tasks were good enough to keep me engaged but i didnt need to know anything crazy or expand my knowledge really. You could get by and not understand everything. So when you said the quote about not really understanding RTOS, i get that because i worked on things that at the time if you asked me to explain it, tbh i only knew the basic overview of it, not the ins and outs. One of my tasks was actually coding a lot of the receiver and transceiver code too lol. But i was a big overperformer even if i only did like 20 hours a week and chilled the rest. In defense, nobody really disagreed as everybody was just there to give their hours and go. We never really dealt with customers as our project wasnt fully completed. \n\nAfter 4 years i wanted to go for bigger and better and i got in the big tech company (again it's one of the ones you lsited). They wont give you an embedded engineer to ask you things but they may ask you a system design question and the question could be related to what you have experienced at your current job. So youd have to explain how the receive and transceiver work for example. When it comes to coding questions, i think praciticng leetcode and really understanding Data structures is good enough. I think the problem in the interview iwll come when they ask questions like \"tell me a time you disagreed with an older engineer/customer?\" or \"tell me a time you had to deal with an angry customer?\". Unfortunately in embedded stuff, that doesnt come up as much, especially in defense industry. I cant speak for you job but can you answer those questions?\" The vibe i get from your post is that you just do you and there isnt much pushback from either side. \n\nAlso, be careful chasing these big companies. Like i said i got into one of the cloud systems and for 3 years the work was hectic. I was doing 5x the work and it still wasnt enough for them. I got PIPd after two years and then fired half a year later. Personally the project was just a lot and they expected 60+ hour weeks but it was more like \"only do 40 \\*wink-wink\\*\". Seniors and principals were too stressed and overworked to helpout and get on calls to help jrs. Everything was a meeting. Standups would take 2 hours because they wanted to discuss something. As a mid-level i was expected to lead meetings and projects. The culture was just toxic and the thing is they can be like this because they know there's a million other people gunning for your job. During reviews you were compared to what your coworkers were doing not what was expected of you. so if you exceeded your own expectations, but all your coworkers are working 60+ hours and have 60+ hours of work to show while you only have 40 hours of work ot show, your manager will go \"why are you so behind?\" and telling them you stick to 40 hours isnt enough. Again this isnt all projects in big tech. Like i knew a guy who worked at AWS which is supposed to be the worse of all of them, but his project was very chill where he doesnt think aobut it after 5 pm. It's very project dependent. All im saying is dont just do it for the money and fame, really consider it. There's plenty of big companiees that dotn fall in that faang bucket that pay just as well. Remember our career pays very well regardless of industry. Even if you make 120k, you are making more than most careers. So dont sell your life for that 200k. Apply to these companies, but make sure it is a right fit for you. Also dont fall in love with the bonus/RSUs they will throw everything at the bonus/RSUs to get you in the door, those are not guaranteed. I didnt know this until i got there but RSUs have a long vesting period. At my last job, i didnt get it until my 1 year anniversary and even then i only got like 20% a year and it wouldnt completely vest until my 5th year.",

I also think the miniature painting hobby is pretty opaque when you first start out, and my hope is that once it's all said and done it will be genuinely useful for new folks who want to understand that term they've seen thrown around reddit constantly but never explained.

        "body": "The \"open-ended\" questions typically involve market-making scenarios, probability puzzles with multiple valid approaches, or trading situations where you need to make assumptions and justify your reasoning. They want to see how you break down problems, ask clarifying questions, and adapt when given new information mid-problem. You can't really drill these like you would technical coding questions, but you can practice explaining your thought process out loud and getting comfortable with saying \"I'm not sure, but here's how I'd approach it.\"\n\nJane Street's bar is high and they're looking for a specific type of analytical thinking that either clicks with you or doesn't. But the uplifting part is that if you've made it to round three, they already see potential in you. Focus on being genuinely curious about the problems they present, don't be scared to ask questions, and show them how your mind works rather than trying to guess the \"right\" answer. The topics can range from basic probability and statistics to market dynamics, so having a solid foundation there helps, but your reasoning process matters more than perfect recall of formulas.\n\nI'm on the team behind [interviews.chat](http://interviews.chat), and we built it specifically to help with these kinds of challenging interview scenarios where you need to think on your feet and articulate complex reasoning clearly.",

In vscode you can command click the stack trace lines in the terminal to go to that part of the code. Usually you can just click the line that is right before an external library call. But, you can also click into external library code stack lines and even edit it if you want to add print statements there.\n\nA few of the tough errors I see people get stuck on are circular imports. But, it's not hard to break those.\n\nA lot of people say to use debuggers. I usually find print statements quicker.\n\nI think it helps if you have a more experienced person that can explain the information you're missing when you get stuck.\n\nThere are some categories of errors I see people get stuck on, but that would be a lot to go over. if theres something in particular you struggle with I could maybe give advice.",

Started at 75k and worked my way to about 90k (not a huge bump but defense doesnt pay that crazy). I decided to jump ship during the last hiring boom of covid. Ended up at a big tech company (one of the bigger ones) for 200k TC. I took it without even thinking. \n\nDefense - i loved my co-workers and was moving up the latter quickly. It was so chill and the work was fun and easy. I did 20 hours of work and chilled the rest of the week. I was my team's scrum master and developer and i didnt think about work after 5 pm and was a top performer. There werent any real deadlines and i could sit on a task for 2 months and nobody complained. \n\nBig tech - things got hectic quickly. I was working for their cloud service. What i didnt know is that cloud is where work life balance goes to die. At first i wanted to respet my balance and stuck to 40 hour weeks for the most part. Then it slowly got more and more hectic and since i was remote id idnt realize my coworkers were pulling 50-60 hour weeks sometimes mroe. so after a year i obviously was behind the rest and even if my work was to my standards, they compared me to my coworkers standards and i got less than average. I drank the kool aid for a year and worked like crazy. Matched the 50-60 hours but i realzied i just didnt lvoe the work but the economy was shit so i kept it going. After a year i got another bad review and a few months later fired. \n\nIm not saying dont take AWS, for the money it sounds amazing. You might have a way better experience than i did. I know someone who works for AWS, has 300k+ in TC and it's one of the easier AWS projects where people sign off at 5pm and dont think about work. They dont even have on-call.  You could land ion a project like that or you could land in a project that requires 80 hours from you in tough weeks. \n\nIm just saying sometimes the fame and fortune isnt what it lives up to be. You need to decide if you will be ok with the potential burnout. Also it's not always you will find a job with coworkers you like.",

You’ll feel overwhelmed at first  that’s normal moving into big tech. Oncall can suck, but it’s not endless misery. You can make it better by fixing root causes, tuning alarms, and pushing back on what’s worth paging.\n\nWill you grind 60–80 hours a week? No. Major incidents can happen, but you can (and should) set boundaries. If you’re up half the night, escalate to your manager, hand off, and rest. That’s encouraged. I never had Slack/email on my phone if it was urgent, they paged. Otherwise, it waited.\n\nMake good use of your time, learn a ton, and enjoy the pay.

Being expected to figure things out on your own in a small team is actually pretty common in consulting. A lot of firms put people on islands where they have to be the expert, even if they’re still learning. It’s not a bad thing but it also means you haven’t had the chance to see how larger dev teams work day to day. \n\nYour role ties with Cloud Engineer or Cloud + Automation Engineer fits well. If you want to move toward joining a dev team, you could focus more on backend development with Python frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, Django) and data tools, while still using your cloud knowledge to stand out. If you want to stay close to infrastructure, doubling down on Azure certifications and automation tools would make you stand out as a cloud engineer. If you’d rather move toward development, deepening your Python, databases, and API building skills will help.\n\nBefore you leave your job, build a clear learning plan, pick projects to show off your skills, and maybe even contribute to open source to give you the momentum you’re looking for. That way, when the market improves, you’ll be ready to land the kind of structured dev team role you’re aiming for.

You might find backend, automation, or even systems programming a better fit. Python is especially powerful because it crosses into both software development and cybersecurity. For cybersecurity, it’s useful for scripting, automating scans, and working with security tools.\n\nIf you’re interested in cybersecurity, focus on Python scripting for automation. Networking basics (which you’ve started on). Linux security and command line skills. Certifications like CompTIA Security+ or CEH (these can help open doors). If you’re more interested in software development, building a few solid projects (maybe a command line tool, an automation script, or a backend system) will help you stand out.\n\nEU companies often look for flexible engineers who can do multiple things. Stick with Python as your main tool, add depth with either Java or C#, and build some focused projects.

It’s also used in Android development and large scale data platforms. C# shines in desktop applications, enterprise software, and especially in game development with Unity. So even if you’re not into web dev, both still have strong non web uses.\n\nFor projects you can still build things that stand out without touching frontends. Automation tools to write a Python or C# script that automates boring tasks (like cleaning up files, organizing data, or generating reports). System utilities to build a command line tool for network scanning, log parsing, or monitoring resources. Cybersecurity mini tools which are things like a password strength checker, simple intrusion detection script, or vulnerability scanner. Data focused projects to parse large datasets, visualize trends, or build small machine learning models. Game or simulation projects using C# with Unity or even Python with Pygame, create a small but complete game or simulator. Make the project useful and complete not just half finished code.

Stay active on LinkedIn, connect with alumni from your school who are in tech. Recruiters care more about what you can do than what your degree says.

I know where I can compromise on certain areas, to focus on the critical things, and deliver a product that enables the business to make money. If I have to make everything perfect before I can ship anything, my business can be losing huge amounts of money in lost opportunity. If I ship something faulty we can directly or indirectly lose money. I also know where I can push out a feature to a reduced and experienced audience to gather early and critical feedback to ensure we build the best possible thing.\n\nGetting a product released and in use is critical, so you can start getting realworld feedback on how it's performing and adjust development prioritises in response. If you take the skyscraper approach and don't deliver the final product for a long time, you don't start receiving real feedback until it might be too late or very hard to change course.",
