Although for smaller writes the data is stored within the database itself, so it is doing the planning for that. \n\nObviously under the hood duckdb is querying for the metadata and then executing the query. I thought you were saying that when using duckdb you had to attach to the Postgres, then write the metadata query, then use that info to write your main data query. So what I was saying was that you just attach duckdb to the Postgres db and then you can start writing queries in duckdb as if the Postgres db actually contained the data.\n\nBut yes even that might be too much for less tech savvy users. Plus other db formats that are able to read parquet files could implement the ducklake format more natively so that they are both the repository and the query planner. I don’t think the execution is locked to duckdb in any way.",

This usually when a DE is needed for delivering this data.\n\nComing to the engineering part. You are a DE who needs to bring that data in. You need to design the workflow, test it, deploy it, expose the data and of course maintain it. This is more or less what a typical DE does. \nNow, depending on the business, the volume of data, the stack etc data engineering might be from code less till fully open source. During the early days, a business will usually go for a managed service to set up the data platform. If the volume increases they usually switch to open source solutions(spark on emr, airflow, hive metastore, etc) for cost cutting reasons. As you understand there are cases where data engineering might involve more than data related tasks such us managing infra, setting up permissions/vpc/etc, modeling, database administration, unit testing, scripting etc. Do these tasks fall under the DE's responsibilities? Big discussion so not sure. Is it common for DE's to do these? Yes (I'd like to say it is something common but not sure either). There have been cases where I did some swe tasks like api in js.\n\nThe tasks themselves tend to be \"boring\" compared to swe since they are less \"creative\" and more \"engineering\". You are trying to build something robust and resilient so you have as less maintenance as possible. It's more puzzle solving than creating.",

The core problem might be, that I've first discovered today, that a large portion of blogs cover either marketing material or trivial copy-pastes of the docs, and was a bit shocked. I think I also did this wrong here myself. The goal should be to only reference posts that had some appeal and only add their relation to the current topic. I mean, that is basically how science has resolved the issue and I think it works fine for them 😅",

While it has certain drawbacks it makes us think more like a software developer rather than a traditional Data Engineer with SQL scripts. I really love their branch based development where you can tested your code with production datasets as input (fall back option) to your current dataset under development. I personally am a huge fan of their data lineage tool. Unlike other data platforms creating a pipeline or a DAG can be done in a few mins. They have thought through all these concepts way ahead and in my opinion their platform is way ahead of other solutions. Foundry had this concept of table format way before Iceberg or delta got popular. \n\nOne take away I have is if your organization needs a data platform that needs traditional data warehousing alot Foundry sucks in that area. This is a great solution for Extraction and Transformation but if your organization depends on datasets mostly for creating charts and dashboards with strict SLAs. Foundry can only be used as compute layer and then load this data back into snowflake or other data warehouses.",

But keep in mind there are dark sides of a lot of these aspirational businesses; Apple wanted to change the world and they did but they still exploit the labor of foreign sweatshops.  Tesla wanted to increase EV adoption and they did while at the same time working to block legislation for high speed rail which would have reduced carbon footprints even more by giving an option to those that can't afford EVs specifically because it might cut into their EV sales.  Nonprofits in foreign countries spend a lot of time distributing aid but at the same time outcompete local vendors and stifle the local entrepreneurship that actually would bring those countries closer to prosperity and instead keep them in a cycle of dependency.",

Extracting data from an RDS instance\n\n2. Extracting data from an external API endpoint\n\n  \nYou have to give permissions to the orchestrator (most likely ECS task) to access the RDS instance and also secrets such as API key and RDS password. \n\nBut let us say the ETL logic lives outside (separate ECS tasks) then the orchestrator essentially only needs permissions to kickoff those tasks. The individual tasks get separate permissions to access their specific instances. This is in line with the least privilege principle often recommended for defining permissions.\n\nGiving the orchestrator too much permissions is exposing you to a lot of risk. There are some newer approaches like the ETL logic is defined in the orchestrator but the flow/task itself runs in a specific pre-defined compute which seems like a better balance. So if you do want to put it all in the orchestrator make sure you leverage such an approach.",

GitHub feels a little hacky and more work than either of the two above. \n\nAnother way is to connect access requests with a jira (or something similar) ticket and the ticket parameters map to specific snowflake roles. You could pair this with a scheduled task to remove access if you want timed access or leave this parameter blank for perpetual access.",

        "body": "Great question, thanks for asking and giving me a chance to explain a bit more :)\n\nJust to clarify up front: Heimdall isn’t trying to replace Airflow (or Dagster). It’s meant to complement those tools, especially in big data environments. We actually use both -- Airflow and Heimdall -- and each plays a different role in our system.\n\nIn our setup:\n\n* Airflow handles scheduling -- the \"when\" something should run (\"run this job daily, but only after X completes\").\n* Heimdall handles orchestration -- the \"what\", \"where\", and \"how\" something runs (\"run this Spark job with version X on cluster Y, with these configs\").\n\nSo why build Heimdall for orchestration instead of just using Airflow for everything?\n\nA few reasons:\n\n**1. Consistency:**  \nWe want a single, unified interface between all tools and data systems (Spark, Trino, Clickhouse, etc.). Heimdall abstracts away infra details -- our users just submit workloads the same way every time (from user's p-o-v, the way they submit SparkSQL and Trino query and get results is exactly the same). We can manage things like version upgrades, logging, error tracking, etc., in one place. Similar to what Netflix’s Genie does -- it creates a clean boundary between clients (humans and systems) and infrastructure.\n\n**2. Security:**  \nEngineers can run and test jobs locally -- even against prod data -- without needing shared credentials (we integrate with many systems, zero creds for those on laptops). They just use their own identity, and Heimdall enforces everything (RBAC, logging, etc.) in one place. Airflow submits jobs *through* Heimdall, so we get a centralized entry point to everything.\n\n**3. Simplification:**  \nBy offloading orchestration to Heimdall, our Airflow operators got *really* simple -- each is maybe 10-20 lines of code, no matter how complex the job is. This helps us avoid the usual “infra logic leaking into pipeline code” problem. Heimdall gives us reusable building blocks that keep our DAGs clean.\n\nThere are other reasons too, but those are the big ones. Happy to go deeper into any of them if it’s useful.\n\nAnd just to be clear -- we still really like Airflow. :) It’s become much more lightweight for us now that it only handles scheduling. We’re even looking at turning Heimdall-based operators into lightweight sensors, so we can run thousands of DAGs on a small Airflow box.",

You are now competing with individuals with decades of strategic cto experience with your few years. You either have a strong exit, or be prepared to sell yourself downwards to re enter normal engineering positions. It’s a double edged sword.\n\nComp: cash is king if it’s a startup and team you know very little about, equity is always a risk but has the highest reward. If you take cash and funding dries up, high comp means you get the axe first. If you take equity, it better be no strings attached, decent % and you need to understand fundamentally what the projections out could be. You will owe taxes on the equity as it vests/earns so if it’s sizeable are you willing to pay cash now for something that could implode.",

Do you plan to implement connectors in Python?",

While visual ETL tools like NiFi/Openflow have clear limitations for teams operating with modern DevOps practices, they do serve a purpose for specific use cases, particularly when you need quick data ingestion without the overhead of building them,.The key is choosing the right tool for your team's scale and engineering maturity.\n\nA lot of teams end up with a hybrid approach: using managed connectors for standard data ingestion (like marketing platforms) and custom code for transformations. The everything must be code approach works great at scale, but smaller teams often benefit from reliable, maintained connectors that handle data extraction while keeping the business logic in reviewable code where it belongs.\n\nFor example, Windsor.ai offers a solution that connects data sources to destinations like Snowflake, BigQuery, or your BI tools. It provides the connector breadth that teams often seek from tools like NiFi, but with API driven architecture that can integrate into data stacks.",

First, it sounds like you have good/smart people even if they aren’t familiar with modern platforms and technologies (public cloud, etc.). Someone mentioned “data mesh” and that came to mind to me as well. Specifically, the principles around ”data as a product” and “self-service” as these are largely about organizational empowerment and alignment more so than technology choices.\n\nIt sounds like the teams need some guidance on how to organize and get work done. I recommend looking into the following.. the teams and company may be doing some of this already but it’s hard to tell from a short narrative. Each of the topics below embody principles of modern data teams.\n\n1. Agile\n2. DataOps (the modern data value chain and how to build data capabilities and the operations around them)\n3. Data as a product - creating things that matter and generate value for the business. The tech is not the point.\n\nIf you want to go deeper on organizational design ideas for technology teams, I recommend the book “Team Topologies.” What you read in the book is helpful and insightful but it’s not a blueprint - in my opinion - to simply go and follow. Instead, take what the book teaches, overlay it with your company, teams, and culture, and determine what your own organizational next steps should be.\n\nHope this helps give you some ideas on where to start.",

The DBA team ground to a halt so that the lead DBA could spend all their time and attention nannying the change. The analytics team ground to a halt because they wanted to manually check and manage 50+ reports and talk to all the stakeholders of those reports to find out how they wanted the reports to work with the new data. \n\n\nIn other organizations I've managed this by creating a data lake, creating pipelines and DAGs and incremental models with tests.

Analysts see double-digit growth in spending and most large companies say they now have a formal program, so the field looks set to expand rather than shrink.\n\nIf you want to stay relevant, grab a respected badge like CDMP from DAMA for broad coverage or DCAM from the EDM Council if you work with banks or insurers. Vendor tracks for Collibra, Informatica, or Microsoft Purview can pay off fast when your projects already use those tools. Mix the classroom work with a small home lab on a free Snowflake or Databricks tier and you will have real proof that you can turn policy into practice.",

This greatly reduces cost of cloud computing, but still allows you to take advantage of certain cloud native tooling, such as Power BI connection to database without gateway middleware. There are also some advantages on the data security side of things. I would not be surprised to see more companies approach data infrastructure this way in the future, as we see cloud computing cost skyrocketing, and a mass emigration from the cloud.\n\nOther than allowing for half the data infrastructure on prem and the other half in the cloud, I can’t see why anyone would implement this approach on a strictly cloud based environment. Generally, OLAP based systems are faster and more efficient at data transformations than OLTP, so you might not be getting any cost advantages. You are also managing yet another pipeline, and likely need another DBT project implemented with incremental models. This approach also reduces visibility and traceability of your pipelines, and complicates CI/CD. \n\nThere are plenty of reasons NOT to do this. I would not recommend this approach unless you have some convincing reason to do so.",

Normally, the hierarchy would be defined in the OPC UA server, which would provide a template for you to use. So, the first option is to manually define the node mapping with the full path, second and probably best option, use tags for grouping with the bracketed notation config. This is still something that I want to try out.\n\n2. This is a continuous process but should be similar for batching processes. You would monitor the same process tags at the end of the day. You can add additional tags to the data to add batch specific info - maybe using a processor plugin like starlark or even a Python plugin in InfluxDB. \n\n3. The PLC uses OPC UA by default and also offers a Pub/Sub connection. This is a standard industrial protocol so used it as is.",

The the customer wanted to start tracking shift updates, so let's say shift is cancelled due to sickness or is re-scheduled. So we started to receive updates through the API but we had no way of linking the updates to the original shift. The source system was puzzled what my problem with the data was...\n\nThe company responsible for the shift logger was later bought with good money. That gave me hope that maybe even I can get rich for doing something silly",

Sounds like your upload speed may be pretty slow as an organization if you're thinking about compressing before moving to the S3. Questions I would have:\n\n- How much time are you actually saving between uploading raw files vs time compressing and then uploading? Are you really saving time between running a compression, uploading then having spark load compressed files?\n\n- Are these daily files appended into your target tables or are you doing upserts? \n\n- What's the likelihood of needing to reload your tables from scratch? \n\n- Is the data easily partitioned outside of the daily extract? \n\nGenerally, I recommend trying to keep the files as I receive them but there are reasons to do slight modifications. Reason being storage is cheap, compute is not. That first time you have to reload from your raw storage, even after just a couple of weeks of daily storage, you're probably ahead of the game in terms of cost running spark against gzip files. Again assuming you're using some kind of pay as you go system.\n\nPersonally, for something like this I'd probably split the difference and convert the csv to parquet with snappy compression. That should give you a sizeable storage savings while still giving you performant reads if you need them down the line. Again a lot of this depends on what you have available to you, converting to parquet, depending on the data, will likely be more time consuming than just gziping the data but your reads should improve. Honestly, I'd benchmark all 3 and then evaluate them against what changes you expect in that source system for an extracts and how quick it will happen.",

This means you can't get the decompressed data any faster than a single node decompressing it.\n\nIf you're doing dynamic schema it also has to do two passes over some portion of the data. So it will read a certain amount to figure the schema, then start back over again once it has the schema it has come up with.\n\n> (Option) Add a step to decompress the files before we read them\n\nThis is probably pointless, spark is doing this for you on-the-fly. The only reason to do so would be because you are reading the source multiple times. Even then, the extra file size and resulting network transfers will offset some of the gain, and you'd have to pay the 'cost' of fully processing the data at least once just to get to that point. If you did anything like this, you would have spark just take the original CSV data and save it to compressed parquet, so that later stages can work off of that for faster re-runs or recovery from a node failure.\n\n---\n\nThere are some other things you can do, but anything effective will involve having the source do something different, because they're the ones producing the files.\n\nUploading uncompressed will be faster for you to process it, since spark can split the read across all of its executors. If you have a lot of cores in your cluster this could be a significant speedup. The tradeoff is that storage costs will be ~3x higher, and it will take ~3x longer for the provider to upload the data.\n\nA potentially easy change for the provider is to upload multiple gzipped files. Since it is a CSV, if they don't have newline characters inside the data (it really should be replaced with an escape sequence), then they can split the file by line count and then gzip each file. You still get the compression, and when running the ingestion job you can give spark a glob (or list) to read multiple files as a single dataframe. That will let you split up the decompression work. Note that this is not about splitting *after* the compression, as that will cut off csv lines in the middle -- you want to split the raw CSV by line count *then* gzip each of those files.\n\nAnother *possibly* easy change is to swap the compression algorithm to bz2. Iirc this one includes the ability to jump to blocks automatically, so spark can properly split the decompression.\n\nThe best way might be to see if they can grab the [DuckDB CLI](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/cli/overview.html) -- it is a single standalone executable, so you wouldn't need any special installation scripts or anything, and as a CLI they just need to run a duckdb command instead of gzip. You can send [commands as arguments](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/cli/arguments.html#passing-a-sequence-of-arguments) for the CLI, so you could make a command that will read the original CSV file then write it to parquet (with compression applied by default). The command would look like `duckdb -s \"COPY (SELECT * FROM read_csv('your_input_file.csv')) TO 'your_output_file.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);\"`. If you read into the DuckDB docs you can also see how to specify the CSV schema so all the typing can be done correctly at the outset, which is handy for you because parquet will have actual types for its columns, which in addition to being compressed and splittable, will make the ingestion job faster.",

        "body": "I've had experience with multiple clients with similar use cases -- specifically dealing with many single tenant use cases (same schemas) and aggregating into a warehouse for analytics.\n\nA few questions you have to ask yourself: \n\n**What are you optimizing for downstream?** \n\n\\-If your use case is dashboarding and analytical queries across large datasets, Redshift will scale better than Postgres. It’s columnar, optimized for scan-heavy queries, and handles large joins better. At 2.8TB and growing, Postgres will get painful for historical analysis.\n\n\\-Syncing data into Redshift with 5-10 min lag is fine using CDC, we have multiple customers doing that at terabyte scale and we are consistently getting <5 min latency even after taking into account the time to run Merges.\n\n**Is it important for data to get into the \"warehouse\" quickly and it's ok for analytical queries to be slower?** \n\n\\-If this is the case, CDC to get data into Postgres will be faster (seconds, instead of <5 mins). But the tradeoff is analytical queries will take much longer to run on Postgres vs Redshift. \n\n**As for your questions:** \n\n1. Depending on the use case downstream, you might want to think about fanning in from many single tenant DBs and writing into large multi-tenant table. Separately you could do a 1 to 1 sync and then use dbt to transform and combine the tables. Our CDC pipeline ([Artie](https://www.artie.com/?utm_source=reddit)) can either fan-in in-flight or do 1:1 syncs, so we've done both. \n\n2. Postgres vs S3: very diff roles. When you land in S3 in parquet files, you'll have to write the logic later to Merge delta files and recreate the current table view - that's overhead you need to consider. \n\n3. Redshift will be easier to manage long term IMO. You’ll likely outgrow Postgres for analytics. Redshift can save you a future migration.\n\n4. DMS is great to start off, but at certain scale it becomes unreliable. We've observed that it starts causing problems with data consistency and latency when you start doing mid-to-high 100s of millions of rows a month. That's when we see a lot of DMS customers migrate over to Artie (disclaimer: I work there) for a CDC pipeline that they can trust to scale with them. \n\n5. We see folks mostly running materialized views, but admittedly we have less visibility here.",

An api is often a set of service layer or business layer web services using rest/json or soap formatting, but it certainly does not have to be. There are UI layer apis, which are usually js, iframe, or css interaction points. There are apis that are simply methods you call when you add someone else's code to your project.

        "body": "I'll provide a contrasting point of view since most people are trying to convince you there's nothing special about C++. I believe C++ is very problematic for newer programmers because a huge list of reasons. The general dismissive advice is to just program in the \"safe\" areas of C++, but there is no way for a beginner to know where that is.\n\nThere are basic problems right off the bat for a beginner.\n\n1. No real package management system. If you want to use libraries in C++, you'll often need to download someone's .hpp and .cpp file and figure out how to compile that into your program and use it. That directly leads into\n\n2. Compilation. No other modern language has a system as complicated as C++, you are going to struggle with your program finding your headers, things are going to compile and not link the right libraries, these words don't even make sense to beginner programmers in other languages. But of course C++ programmers have tried to solve this and that causes problem number\n\n3. Build systems, C++ has 3 popular build systems, and they don't necessarily work well with each other. You got make, cmake, autoconf and just regular writing the compiler arguments yourself. These systems are extremely complex, introduce a whole new language to learn, and are often impossible to debug. People will tell you that a newbie doesn't need to know about any of this, well they do if they want to be doing anything substantial using existing code instead of implementing every single thing themselves.\n\nSo all of that is before you get a program running, so once we've figure out how to compile code, what happens when we write code and try to learn stuff from online?\n\n4. C++ is extremely fragmented. C++ has gone through multiple incarnations, from C with Classes to C++11 to more recent versions. The way you write C++ code differs dramatically between pre and post C++11. By default the majority of the code you write based on basic examples will be considered incorrect. For example, you'd think you can generate random numbers using `rand()`. You'd be dead wrong, C++ developers do NOT suggest using `rand()` to generate random numbers, it's not guaranteed to generate a uniform distribution or numbers that are sufficiently random. People will even tell you off if you use iostream, the basic recommended way to handle input/output in every tutorial, because C++ code is supposed to be fast, and iostreams are considered slow. Basically C++ does something wrong in some initial implementation, and has to maintain that for backwards compatibility forever, so they implement a whole new different correct way to do it, but a newbie has no way to tell if they are looking at outdated and bad code or new code.\n\n5. Standards vs Compilers. Suppose you are super keen and keep up to date with new language features. You see that C++23 has some cool new feature you want to try in your own code. Well too bad, it probably hasn't been implemented yet. The standards committee are independent from the people that write the compilers. So the committee declares that the new version of the language has this new feature, and it's someone else's job to actually implement that feature into the compiler so it can actually be used in code. This is done bit by bit, so your compiler will support some C++23 features and not others. Hell, some features are in the spec and NEVER get supported. So if you're a keen beginner and see people present cool new features and code patterns you want to try, bad luck, try again in 5 years and pray that compilers have caught up.\n\n6. C++ data structures are heavily memory focused. This isn't the memory management that people usually talk about. These are the standard vector and collection types that manage the memory for you like in other languages. Except in almost every case, you interact with these objects via iterators, which dips down a level of abstraction and makes you think about memory anyway. So where in another language you might run `sort(s)`, in C++ you run `std::sort(s.begin(), s.end());`. That seems ok, until you start using references and pointers, and `sort` shifts the values in memory and you end up not pointing to what you thought you were pointing to. That's just a rookie mistake, but most algorithms do things in-place in memory and it's an easy mistake to make. On top of that you get pointer invalidation, where sometimes the automatic memory management just takes your data somewhere else and all your previously declared pointers are now pointing at nothing. The simplest way to accidentally do this is when you are using `push_back()`, when the allocated vector fills up it'll relocate somewhere else.\n\nI could go on. But the overall point is that\n\n1. Compilation and library management in C++ introduces significant complications to beginners that simply do not exist in other highly used languages.\n\n2. C++ has many conflicting ways of doing something, and there does not exist a single agreed upon set of teaching material for beginners to learn best practices.\n\n3. C++ has MANY hidden pitfalls that will cause beginners to write broken programs. Almost by default any code you write intuitively will be considered wrong in some way. The simple `for (int i = 0; i++; i < s.size()) { s[i]; }` should be written as `for (const auto& v : s) { v; }`, note the additional syntax and operators that might be unclear to beginners. Also you were meant to use `size_t` instead of `int` for the first loop, but that's almost never presented in basic teaching material.\n\nC++ has more complicated language constructs than other languages, worse developer support, has no single high-quality resource for learning, and online resources are litered with bad practice that beginners have no ability to distinguish.",

The only situation where this might be a thing is where you're copying around data needlessly, but using references in C++(just like Python does by default) is an idiomatic language feature. \n\nBarring those cases, C++ code can be like 100 times faster than Python, unless you use Numpy arrays or something(which is written in C, so hardly counts as Python code).\n\n>I also understand that there's a huge responsibility in managing memory safely. \n\nYeah, except if you use smart pointers, C++ even has automatic memory management.

Honestly though, there are probably very few cases where that's useful.  But also, since C++ is an old language, there are C++ compilers for many platforms and operating systems.  C++ is also unmanaged, not running in basically a VM like C# and Java, so it's a little more efficient in that regard.  Also, you're relatively unrestricted in what you can do with C++, so if you know what you're doing, C++ is a very powerful language.\n\nSince the C++11 standard, C++ has gained a lot of more modern features too.  I think it's pretty cool what C++ has gained since then.",

        "body": "For clarity : My answer is based on my own experience in this field, but I have formatted the response with AI for clear reading, AI will never generate knowledge like this.\n\nHey, wishing you a bright future—read to the end! No way is programming dead, trust me. The idea that AI will wipe out coders is a myth. Tools like GitHub Copilot are like having a brainy assistant—they make you faster, not replace you. Coders who skip AI might lag since it cuts problem-solving from weeks to hours. You’ll learn quicker, debug faster, and tackle big stuff, but AI needs your creativity to work. Coding’s been around forever (before you were born!) and isn’t going anywhere—it just evolves. Use AI to level up, and you’re golden. It’s totally worth jumping into in 2025. The industry needs solid coders who solve real problems. Stay curious, keep learning, and you’ll stand out, no matter how many others code.\n\nLearning paths depend on you. Self-taught is awesome but tough—you need discipline to avoid scams or getting lost. A mentor, even paid, can save you tons of time by guiding you right. Tons of top devs are self-taught, so it’s doable with grit. Bootcamps are great for fast, practical skills—3-6 months and you’re job-ready if you pick one with mentorship and job help. Check Course Report for legit ones to dodge duds. A CS degree gives deep theory for stuff like AI or systems coding and looks great to employers, but it’s pricey and takes years. You don’t always need it for jobs like web dev But remember that if you don't learn the deep theoretical stuff like systems design, algorithms, data structures, computer architectures and operating systems, and only the final technology like web development, you will reach a stage where you will not develop, and you will not move up the career ladder until you have comprehensive knowledge and experience in all aspects, not just simple technological skills like html, css, etc. Whatever path, you’ll need to self-learn, so try Coursera’s “Learn How to Learn” to master studying. Tech’s got endless free resources—use them! I’d start self-taught to test the waters, then maybe a bootcamp or degree if you’re hooked. Just know bootcamps focus on jobs and might skimp on theory like algorithms, which you’ll need.\n\nPlease do not be tempted by crash courses, all of them aim to teach you how to use the programming language only or just a basic understanding, and do not teach you deep programming concepts, the least professional course may take more than 50 hours of learning, and time is not a condition on the professionalism of the course, but for example, you will not find an in-depth algorithms course of 10 hours ...\n\nFirst, see if coding’s your thing with Harvard’s CS50 on edX—it’s free and a fun intro to programming with bits of C, Python, and JavaScript. It’s not a full course but a taste of what coding’s about. You’ll know if it clicks and get a sense of next steps. After CS50, don’t jump straight to a track like web dev—focus on building core programming skills, like algorithms, data structures and solve a lot of problems on websites like hackerrank,leetcode,codeforces, and so on... . These are the foundation of coding and crucial for any field. You can learn them while exploring a track (like web or AI) or before picking one—it’s up to you. Python’s a great first language—easy, versatile for web, AI, or data, and super in-demand. But it’s not about the language; it’s about getting loops, functions, and logic, which apply everywhere. Think of coding like swinging a hammer: easy to learn, hard to master. Start with computational thinking to grasp how computers work before diving into languages.  \nTo gain a solid foundation in your level, I suggest reading books that will develop your way of thinking. It can be read while you are studying CS50. There is a great book called Computational Thinking: A Beginner's Guide to Problem Solving and Programming by Karl Beecher. I really like it and still read it from time to time, even though I am experienced but it's really a great book.\n\nExpect bumps—coding’s all about solving problems. Don’t quit when you’re stuck; take a break, hit Google or Stack Overflow, or use AI to explain (but don’t let it solve coding challenges—that’s cheating and you learn nothing). Everyone learns differently—some pay for courses to stay motivated, others grind free stuff. Stay consistent, even 2 hours a day. You’ve got this! Finish CS50, then focus on algorithms, data structures, databases , operating systems, programming with C++ and OOP, and any programming fundamentals that didn't covered in CS50(because 8 weeks not enough to know what you should learn ) (try free resources like FreeCodeCamp or books like “grokking algorithms”). Hit us up for next steps.\n\nWhat you did was the right move, you took the initiative to ask, keep doing that when you have questions, always ask the experts and don't rely on the answers of laymen or non-specialists, not even AI, AI can help you along the way if you know what you're doing, but it may not be appropriate at all times.\n\nAnd not all paid courses are good and not all free courses are bad, I can give you advices for hours, but unfortunately that is not the way you will develop, you have a path that you must discover for yourself, what I discovered is what you will discover, but you will discover it in your own way and with your own understanding, so I said it directly to you ... You may not always be convinced, so I'm not going to give you all the advice as much as I'm going to give you what works for you at your current stage.\n\nAnd remember that not everything is clear at the beginning, meaning that I cannot give you everything from the beginning until you are an expert in the field, but this depends on you and your research, reading books and learning, I only guide you to the beginning of the road. Good luck!\n\nupdate : CS50 (also called CS50x which is the most popular course of the CS50 series) may be difficult for some students, but in some countries computer principles are taught in schools, if you don't have knowledge about it, you can watch the content of the CS50T course first and learn more about computer principles and how to use Windows and what is hardware and software.",

Unfortunately, nobody listens and everyone is blinded by marketing scheme. It's a very toxic environment today in the tech industry where everyone wants profits with zero effort. Then they all blame the tools when they themselves are the culprits. I've been in the industry for decades as well and see the same reaction every time a new tool emerges. I was just telling my postdocs the other day to figure out a way to harvest the energy the cycle of people blaming the tools so we can make the tools available at no cost with that energy.",

        "body": "I have thought about this a lot lately.  I disagree with you when it comes to students.  They absolutely SHOULD NOT use A.I.  A.I. destroys your ability to think.  It may not happen immediately, but it does.  I've read countless stories from developers that lose their ability to not only think critically, but can't even remember basic syntax over time.  This isn't just happening to programmers.  This is happening to other fields as well.  The brain is a muscle and if you don't use it, you can't develop it.  Now, I'm not saying that its not a valuable tool.  It definitely is, but if you are a student or still in the process of learning, A.I. takes away the process of learning that develops your critical thinking skills and the repetition that you need to learn syntax when you are learning.  This is also why you take so many math classes.  Are you going to use Trigonometry or Calculus out in the real world?  Probably not, but that's not the point.  The point is that the process of doing it helps develop your critical thinking and analytical skills.  The same goes for programming\n\nI'm speaking from experience on this.  I'm a 3rd year CS student.  My first year I made the mistake in using A.I. in my Computer Science 1 class.  Its essentially the 1st class you take that teaches C++ and programming fundamentals like OOP, abstraction, and recursion.  Halfway through the class, once we started working on anything remotely more difficult than defining a function, I used A.I.  I didn't realize how much I didn't learn anything until I got to Computer Science 2 the following summer.  I couldn't write anything beyond basic console apps.  I turned off all A.I. including Intellisense, and went through my Computer Science 1 book and did all the projects from that class again.  I actually retained the information that time.\n\nI have seen so many posts about people who are on the last year of their CS degree, or even graduated, and they don't know how to code.  I don't know how this is even possible if you aren't just copying code for projects.  This summer I'm in Data Structures and Algorithm Design.  Last weeks project was to write algorithms for linear sort, merge sort, quick sort, and selection sort, and print to console the running time along with their Big O Notation to prove their runtime complexity.  I would love for someone to tell me how they did that if they don't know how to code.",

That means using AI features like autocomplete are necessary. You also need to learn how to engage with AI to ask the right questions, rather than try and get the code. Use it to figure out the problem rather than solve it. This is sooo hopeful.\n\nBut on the negative, I had to stop half way through school and turn all my auto complete off, I had to take the productivity features away, because I wasn’t learning the proper syntax and way about setting things up. When it came time to do tests and I wasn’t allowed to use these, I was helpless. That got me to thinking, for coding interviews, the same was going to happen. So I did, I stripped away the AI portions of what I was working on, and things got slower, but then they got quicker, and I started making better decisions.\n\nIt’s a double edged sword! You need it, but you also need to learn how to function without it. I realize that once you’re working in a professional environment you won’t be scrutinized, but rather promoted to use AI tools, but for a young dev, you also need to not skip the nitty gritty. It’s like when I went to school for electronics engineering too, you can’t just use kmaps, you have to learn some binary algebra first.

Worst case scenario, try to recreate a project you saw on YouTube or something. Even if you break things, that’s better than nothing.

You don't yet know how complicated something outside of that zone might be, how far away it is, and how much else you need to learn before.\n\nSo - to sort of answer your question:\n\n>So how does one bridge the gap from being a programmer who can only create a terminal CRUD to becoming a programmer that understands how to build something like a compiler?\n\nBy gradually making projects that are harder and harder, always make sure that you know how to build *most* of it, but that there's some aspects you don't yet know how to do. And then you research those specific parts, using books, tutorials, ask around and so on. And you learn something. Then you either build a new project, or expand on the one you already have, and learn yet more things!\n\nThe same way you'd \"bridge the gap\" from fixing a puncture on your bicycle, to being a formula one car mechanic - by learning more and more and more - and at some point taking a dedicated class, course or job in exactly that, but there's usually no straight line!",

How long does a randomly generated alpha-numeric GUID has to be in order to ensure it's collision-proof?  \n\nIt sounds like you're thinking about this the same way I did when I first looked into the subject. \"So, I'm supposed to generate a big-ass random number while jillions of other devs are simultaneously generating big-ass random numbers and just hope that none of us bump into each other? What's the logic here besides 'Trust me, bro'?\"  \n\nThe secret, at least for [Version 1 GUIDs](https://guid.one/guid/make), is that it's actually not entirely random, and that's a good thing. The idea behind a GUID is that it should be unique in time and space. With that in mind, it's pretty easy to deliberately avoid collisions by incorporating spacial (physical or logical space) and temporal components in combination with randomness.  \n\nIdentifying the exact latitude and longitude of the device generating the GUID is often infeasible, so a common practice is to use the machine's MAC address, or a hashed namespace (e.g., company/app URL). Basically, you're saying that this particular GUID was generated by *this* computer at *this* time, down to millisecond precision (or at least, as accurate as the onboard clock can be). That's probably good enough for most uses, but to kick it up a notch, we also generate a pretty good-sized random number, *and* check it against ones we've already made, and increment it if, by some miracle, we managed to come up with two of the same random number in the same thousandth of a second.  \n\nThe thing to take comfort in is that you don't actually need to be unique in all of time and space in the universe. You don't even need to be unique in the history of computing on Earth (although you almost certainly will be). You *probably* don't even need to be unique within your organization. What you care about most of the time is being unique within your application, or, really, within the primary key column of one single table.  \n\nWith that in mind, you can be confident that the pretty good-sized random number generated by Mike's computer at 3:14:15.926 PM on June 10th, 2025, to be used strictly for identifying records in sale_item table in SysCorp's home grown CRM, isn't going to conflict with any other GUIDs in that table.  \n\nFurther, if some rando in Timbuktu, or in the sandwich shop across the street, manages, against all odds, to generate the exact same GUID as one of yours, it doesn't matter, because *they're not putting it in your database.*  \n\nI hope this helps you feel better.",

As a simple example, in C and C++, there is a preprocessor step, and there is nothing like that in Python. It is not a \"huge\" concept in and of itself, but it does take some getting used to, and to learn how it can be used effectively, and when to use and not use it, for example.\n\nAnother peculiarity of C++ is that when doing OOP, member functions are not virtual by default.  You must \"opt in\" to make a function virtual. In almost all other languages (including Python), methods (that is, functions placed onto a class) are always virtual. And because they are always virtual, you might not even yet know what the difference is between a function being \"virtual\" or \"non-virtual\", for example. But you will learn this when you learn C++.\n\nC++ also has function overloading, which Python does not have.\n\nC++ has templates (generic functions), which Python does not have.\n\nPython also has some stuff that C++ does not have, or which is hard to do in C++. For example, \"generators\" in Python are pretty useful. Maybe you can do something similar in C++ but it will not be so convenient. Python and most dynamic languages have an \"eval\" facility which lets you evaluate code \"on the fly\" but this kind of thing does not exist in C++. Again, it can be done but you will have to implement it yourself (e.g. by calling out to a compiler to compile code, or else embedding your own small compiler along with your executable).",

Just because you can do the former does not automatically mean you can do the latter.\n\nYou need to work on what is *before* the code, on the design, on the problem analysis and solution. \n\nStart with pencil and paper. Sit down. Read the problem statement multiple times. Break it down into sub-problems. Break the sub problems further down. Then, solve each of the sub problems individually, as *you*, the person, would. Track down the steps. Check the steps against some sample input. Then, once you have a working solution, start implementing it in a programming language.\n\n> So I used AI a lot and since then I had been using Ai to code most of my stuff (even my personal projects). \n\nYeah, you chose the easy way out and effectively *outsourced* the work instead of digging in and doing the work yourself. This is now biting you in the back.\n\nStop using AI and start actually investing effort to **learn**.\n\nDon't blame your educational institution. You have the entire knowledge of the world in front of you. There is no excuse for not learning anymore. You have resources in abundance. Yet, instead of utilizing these resources to improve yourself, you have decided to effectively hire a third party (AI) to do your work. You have nobody to blame but yourself.\n\n> So my question is, how do I relearn programming? Where do I start? From the beginning?\n\nYes, you start at the beginning again. You did through your materials and support them with the internet. Check the **Frequently Asked Questions** here in the subreddit sidebar for recommended learning resources.\n\nStop using AI for anything apart from getting deeper explanations. Under no circumstances use it to do your thinking, to give you solutions, to give you code. Do not copy-paste code from somewhere else. Type it yourself.\n\nLearning programming requires effort. Learning programming requires practice. You need to come up with your own solutions. You need to struggle. You need to fight. You need to fail. You need to solve. This is how learning works, not through letting others (AI) do the work for you.",

Ai in 5 years most likely will not be able to replace a person at determining the correctness of some code. \n\nThe best path forward is to keep an eye on the tools.

The best option might change over time, but currently for windsurf you can purchase their lowest tier subscription and get unlimited use from their base model. If any kind of expense is a problem, then use a normal code editor and ask a free ai service for code, like perplexity or Google or Bing.

It's oversaturated and B2B and B2C products are no longer considered novel or deep tech. It's also what AI has the most data on and is gonna be able to get good at the easiest.",

At 15, you're not even close to starting your career, let alone getting the ball rolling enough to rely on your experience / tenure to help you settle down.\n\nFirst thing to mention (even outside of AI) is that this entire field goes through ups and down. Software development is not immune to economic downswings unless you luck out (there are some jobs out there that are more \"essential\", but not most), and we're in one right now. The current job market, plus all the AI advancements in the news, has everyone worrying about AI, but it's a scapegoat to larger issues over-hiring from Covid, interest rates, and tax laws (Section 174 being a big one).\n\nAnd in regards to AI, if software development gets to a point where a non-technical person can use AI like a \"cheap high-quality on-demand agency\", nearly every job is getting replaced. Put \"will doctors\" into Google search, the first result is likely \"will doctors be replaced by AI\".\n\nBeing concerned about AI ***right now*** is pretty ridiculous. I've not seen any major instances of \"AI replacing developers\". There have been some decent showcases of AI reducing workloads (AirBnB did some interesting work in regards to testing migration), but even those are pretty limited. In general, it helped cut out some of the mundanity with repetitive boilerplate code, and helped people who have never written code to get things started, but that's about it.\n\nBeing concerned about AI in 20 years is perfectly reasonable though. We've seen major advancements over just the last two years, but we still are not completely sure if there's a \"ceiling\" that might cap what AI can do, or if those advancements will continue to accelerate.\n\nOverall, if you're passionate about something, especially at such a young age, it's worth investing some time into that passion. No one knows what the world is going to look like in 5 years, let alone 20. People who are really passionate about what they do, and put in the time and effort to make smart decisions, tend to make things work.\n\nEdit: grammar",

That role is absolutely critical, since AI can't take over management, and someone needs to be responsible for ensuring the technology get built and solves the problem you think it does.\n\nSo how has AI changed out life? I write code faster (for some things), I get better search results, and I can have in-depth conversations about parts of my life I wouldn't otherwise talk about, with an agent that is willing to walk through very specific scenarios for hours and hours.\n\nAs for other people, my job is to basically use LLMs to save costs. We don't need to automate away a full job for their to be fewer people hired, we just need to take a fixed cost center and figure out how to do the same thing for less effort.

I’ve been trying to do a “code for 15 minutes every night” kinda thing to help me (I work midnights at a hotel and primarily code there as whenever I’m home my gf likes me to spend my time with her) cause generally once I start I get dragged into doing it all night but there are still night where I open my laptop open vscode, look at it and then shut it and open Netflix or YouTube lmao.",

When you dominate the syntax you start to develop a skill to write the code without thinking in the semantics but in what can be possible output. \n\nIt’s a process that takes time because we in normal days solving a problem we use the real logic but in programming you have the abstraction to representing real situations in a programming language. \n\nIf you think in closing a door, you imagine the door fiscally and the knob, but in an algorithm you could think in the coordinate of the knob or if the door is open or close or even if there is a door, so after you have this clear in you mind so you translate each action in code. This is a process to take time to become automatic, similar to drive a manual transmission, the first times you really think a lot when changing the velocity, but after you don’t think on that at all. \n\nFurthermore, if you don’t know something exists (a solution) how can you know about it. I mean, my point is I am very ignorant about some music if I never listen before, but the first time you hear it you can know if you like. Solving problems is like that, you don’t know the solution and even where to start, but with practice and learning how others approach the problem you will develop this sense of recognising patterns. \n\nA way to deal with this more in practice is learning how to debug and learning debugging tools, so you can see the step by step of the code and the output. \n\nTake a look at (python/C tutor)[https://pythontutor.com/c.html#mode=edit] try it and solve some algorithms there.",

As soon as I finish a course and specialization, I get the Coursera certificates, even if I didn't want them - CU Boulder gives students a limited version of PLUS. Additionally, my work pushes us to get certified, so I get quite a bit of certs from O'Reilly and DataCamp as I prepare for Certifications.\n\n>\\- Has a certificate *ever* helped you get a job, interview, freelance , or anything like that?\n\nInconclusive, I have a BS in Computer Science, an Internship, and 1 YOE as a full time SWE. I can't tell anymore if the certificates contribute to me getting some traction here and there. Some make it to my LinkedIn, but none ever make it to my resume. Unless recruiters actually look at my LinkedIn, I'm willing to bet certs haven't actually helped. Can't say for sure, though.\n\n>\\- Why do you think they were such a big deal a few years ago?\n\nGoogle and Coursera put some heavy emphasis on marketing for their professional certificate programs during a time when there was high demand, low supply. This increased visibility and market conditions created an ideal environment for MOOCs and certifications of completion to boom.\n\n>\\- Would you recommend someone new today focus on getting certificates—or just build stuff?\n\nSame advice I give on r/coursera , I recommend newcomers to focus on skills and projects.

But when companies were trying to suck up as much talent as possible, it was worthwhile for them to grab \"juniors\" who still pretty much didn't know how to program but were motivated and then you could teach them how to program on the job.\n\nThe market is tighter now, so companies aren't as willing to hire enthusiastic beginners. They want people who can actually program.\n\nThe \"build stuff\" advice is good in that the only way to learn how to program is to *do it*, but frankly little learning projects and stuff like that (especially anything based off of tutorials - no one cares you can write a todo app) don't say much to an employer, either.\n\nEmployers *do* care if you've *shipped product* \\- that is, you've produced real software that solves a real business problem and has real actual customers. You get experience doing that which is really irreplaceable. A key thing is when you're working for someone else (whether a boss or customers), you're put in situations where *you have to solve problems you don't know how to solve yet*. For a little learning project, you'll just naturally end up building it the way you know how (or how a tutorial is telling you how to do it). But when you've got external demands on you, you're forced into situations where you have to build or fix something and you have no clue how to do it - and maybe no one else on the planet does either - so you have to figure it out. That \"figuring it out\" is the actual vital skill people want.\n\nOf course, that puts you in the \"you need to have experience to get experience\" trap, so if you're just starting out the gold standard remains \"4 year B.Sc. in Computer Science + an internship\". It isn't the same as professional work experience, but it shows some ability to do hard work over an extended period of time and to follow instructions.",

I started with that as well as C. This kicked my ass thoroughly, but I managed to join a closed source project for an old MMO game emulator. There was another one that was the competitor around 2003 that was open source. We had decided to merge but they made an interesting choice during the merger. This strange language called C#. This was a very early version of it. But I couldn't believe how cool and approachable it made things. I personally loved it. Others hated it and said nothing serious could ever be built with it. But me being new to this, I loved the idea of removing so much complexity behind things like memory management, it was like magic. You could get so much done by doing less. This decision fractured the team. The C++ diehards refused to work with it and eventually left to continue the C++ version, I stayed on the C# version. Fast forward some years, the C# version was pumping out more and more features while the C++ version couldn't keep up. Eventually the C++ version of this project died out, but the C# project is still alive today (sort of, it's gone stagnant since about 2018 or so). But it's incredible to see how far C# has come over the years. It's what I use in my current job (the little bit of coding an architect does anyway). \n\nI think it's important to know how languages like C/C++ work as they provide a better understanding of what's going on under the hood. But I also think it's better for someone new to start with something more approachable like Java & C#. That's good you decided to delve into it after learning Java. It's all good stuff to know, but certainly not a requirement. If anything, can make you really appreciate everything these higher level languages are doing for you.",

Then rinse and repeat. \n\nI was tired of just copy pasta tutorial videos and then not being able to recall anything. Now I can print “Hello, World!” with confidence :)\n\nI eventually plan to go back at the end when I finish the whole tutorial/lesson/class on what I’m watching (like 4-8hrs of said programming language) to refactor and make all the lessons and mini projects code to be more efficient. And that’s in hopes of refreshing concepts as I clean the code getting some hands on experience, even if not crazy complex.\n\nAn example: at the end of my current YouTube class/lesson, or maybe in the middle when topic is touched, I plan to somehow create an array or some data structure to be able to rotate my lessons/miniprojects to run and output instead of hard coding each function I want to run.

Well, you can start small, I would assume that tictactoe is too simple for you as well, what about something in between, like Pacman? You can add a lot of interesting depth to that game. \n\nSome part of it is visual, which usually helps make it a little more interesting and captivating. But there's also stuff like Ghost behavior, which can be solved in a lot of ways. You can do it with more traditional search algorithms, you can make deterministic tabled graphs to use for look up. They both need to flee and pursue Pacman, the 4 ghosts all act differently, so figuring out how to add that nuance in, once you find the solution you want to use could be an interesting little thing to tweak around with.",

Similarly, you can have a UI without being a front end expert, just keep it very basic, like just use a template and be done.\n\n3. You can just have projects with no UI, this is extremely common. In fact, a project should really just solve one little tiny problem if possible, and if someone else wants to make a separate project that wraps your project with a UI then fine.\n\n4. Not that this probably matters for you, but there is a subtle difference (front end devs can correct me if I'm wrong) between front end software dev versus UI/UX design. You can design for functionality (and performance etc.) on the front end without really worrying about the design itself. You can conversely design a UI without getting into the functionality or even writing any code.",

        "body": "Hey, first off - it's awesome that you're already this deep into programming at 18. The fact that you can zone in for 9 hours straight? That’s a real sign you’ve found something you’re genuinely passionate about. A lot of great devs started the same way - just getting lost in code.\n\nSince you're learning C#, that’s a strong start. It’s used in tons of real-world applications - especially in enterprise software, game dev with Unity, and even backend web stuff (with .NET). So don’t think it’s a “just-for-school\" language - it’s got legs in the industry.\n\nIf you're eyeing cybersecurity and want to branch out smartly, here's a quick breakdown of useful languages based on where you might go:\n\nFor Cybersecurity:\n\nPython – absolute must. It's everywhere in cybersec (automation, scripting, tooling, etc.), super beginner-friendly, and has a massive library ecosystem.\n\nBash/Shell Scripting – essential if you're going to be dealing with Linux servers or writing security automation scripts.\n\nC/C++ – if you ever want to understand exploits, memory management, or reverse engineering.\n\nFor General Dev / Building Stuff:\n\nJavaScript + HTML/CSS – if you ever want to touch frontend or build tools with a GUI.\n\nGo – gaining traction in cloud & network tooling, really nice for fast and secure backend systems.\n\nSince you're enjoying it already, I'd say:\n\nStick with C# and get comfy building small projects.\n\nStart Python next - you’ll love how fast you can get stuff working.\n\nMaybe check out TryHackMe or Hack The Box once you’re comfortable with the basics - great intro to hands-on cybersec.\n\nAlso, shameless plug, but I’ve been using this app called BootSelf lately. It gives you an AI mentor that helps explain code and quiz you with flashcards. Pretty helpful if you're learning solo and want to stay on track. There's a free version if you're curious.\n\nYou’re on a great path - you don’t need to have it all figured out right now. Just keep following your curiosity, and you’ll build the skill stack naturally.\n\nGood luck, and keep building 👊",

For learning systems, check out courses/materials online. I recommend Nand2Tetris, it’s a wonderful resource. \n\nThere’s no reason you can’t learn C and learn systems at the same time, but it helps to have some familiarity with how C works before diving into a really complex systems project like an OS kernel",

My first advice is to go in knowing your audience and what they expect and to tailor your level of detail to that audience. If the audience is non-technical or time is short, it's best to just give a recommendation or answer and let them ask questions. Maybe list the possible choices with a few pros and cons first. If it's an hour long review of said recommendation with a client technical team, be ready to go through the twenty considerations that led to that recommendation as they want you to be thorough. Teaching really does help. After you've explained polymorphism to freshman a few dozen times with a worked example, you can do it with an interviewer who already knows it pretty easily.\n\nMy other suggestion is that you want to keep a conversation going but at the same time it's fine to pause and frame your answer. There's a video of Tim Cook taking a question at a shareholder meeting where he literally sits at a conference table for almost a minute thinking before giving a twenty second answer. It was complicated and he wanted to check all the angles in his head and decide how to phrase his answer succinctly.\n\nIt's fine to use a whiteboard or paper if needed as long as you're not being rude. I get interview questions about how I'd design something complex and I'll do that with the interviewer. We'll basically sketch the landscape and they'll add things and ask questions as we go around.\n\nI will also stress that BSing technical interviewers usually doesn't work. You may be able to lie to them, but your answer will still be technically wrong and they'll just think you're confidently mistaken. I like people who say they don't know and tell me how they'd find out as long as the question wasn't too foundational. I say a lot of things like \"I've never used that product, but I assume it has X/works like X/can integrate using X/runs on X, right? If so, I'd find the docs and plan to implement it using \\[high level approach that works with the underlying tech\\].\" If it's weird they'll just tell me and I'll give an answer that works with the weird. Show you know the first principle or pattern and can learn new things.",

Don't hate yourself just because you failed an interview. I flat out froze up in my first two interviews, it happens.\n\nThe way you improve is by first looking up mock interviews on YouTube, and learning what a \"good job candidate\" is even supposed to look / sound like during a coding / behavioral / systems design interview. This is not one of those things that's \"obvious\" in the sense that you should \"just know\", especially if you don't come from a white collar background and aren't used to presenting yourself as a professional. You gotta at least see a good example.\n\nAfter that, you gotta do what you can to prep. Look up \"X interview questions\". Replace X with Python, Java, Springboot, Javascript, React; whatever you think may be relevant based on the job description. You usually don't need to be extremely thorough, just some skimming to be sort of mentally and emotionally prepared for the kinds of questions you're going to run into. If the questions do seem wildly off from what you know, just do the homework and try your best to study up.\n\nAnd beyond that, you need to be honest with yourself. Did you really know the answer, just not how to phrase it? I did a lot of random LeetCode / Hackerrank before I even did my first coding interview. I knew ***nothing*** about DSA though, I relied entirely on my intuition to solve problems. That ultimately meant I was bad at doing coding interviews, and I had to swallow my pride and work through neetcode before I got to a good spot with coding interviews.\n\nEdit: I also verbalize everything when I interview prep. I'm not a naturally good speaker, so I try to talk through everything to be good enough for interviews. It's important to not talk too \"hastily\" though, you typically want to talk like you're trying to hold a conversation.",

I'd say with Go there's a slightly higher chance the interviewer wouldn't be as familiar with Go and might ask you a question about your syntax. Should be fine if you're good at it, though.\n\nPicking C as your primary language for interviews can occasionally be a weakness. While C is a great language, there are some things that are just a lot more tedious in C. Just about any problem that involves appending strings, for example, is more tedious in C, especially if you want it to work with arbitrary sizes and handle errors correctly - whereas C++ and Go have nice high-level string objects that you can easily split, append, and so on.\n\nIt depends on the problem.

Currently I am not aware of your future plans. i.e :- If you want a new job in an another field of programming , If you want are currently preparing for an interview or are planning to do so.\nSo, simple stuff, you said you made games, you can start from there, maybe study more DSA (or from the start if you believe you hadn't understood a thing.)\n\n\n2. Depends on what YOU want. Skillset or More Money from levelling up what your job requires.\n\n\nIf you have the same interest as the thing you work, that's the cherry in top. If not, you can work something else. Maybe strengthen your unity skills, one good indie game can make you hell lot of money. You can try freelancing and other things.\n\n\nAlso, as you said that your are finding new things everytime you learn something, don't get overwhelmed. I've been a unity game dev for 7 years and everytime I open Unity documentation almost always I find something new. Coding is such a thing that would not fully end even if you die. It's natural to get overwhelmed and fell lost but don't,my friend, it's a long journey.\n\n\nAlso please don't try to learn everything at the same time, like you metioned java, 5 other things, first master one thing and then move on the other.\n\n\n3. You can use AI to either make you an intellectual or completely destroy your brain, depends on how you use it. ONLY use it when you are stuck on a problem or a bug for a few 20 minutes. AI doesn't destroy anyone, they let AI destroy them, it has been the best thing that happened to me because I used it responsibly.\n\n\nThis was my answer, believe me , thing will get better, you WILL overcome the doubts you have, just believe in yourself,good luck and ALL OF THE BEST BROTHER, YOU CAN DO IT.",

This is why, in general, doing is far more important than reading.\n\n>How did you go from understanding the theory to actually applying it?\n\nThat's backwards. You understand the theory by applying it. Work on a project, encounter problems, fix the problems.\n\n>Any good projects or tutorials you’d recommend for practicing?\n\nAny project that you personally care about and are motivated by. And it's far more useful if you work on it yourself instead of just copying it from some book or video. \n\n>Or even just personal experiences — what helped it all *click* for you?\n\nFirst, figure out the properties of your problem, and then find a solution that best fits those properties. Try thinking about the future, like \"what if I wanted this to work for both 32-bit and 64-bit floats?\" or \"what if I wanted to change the database I use without having to change any other part of my program\" and the solutions guide you to SOLID principles naturally. \n\nI think that it's important to always have a reason for everything you do. Don't follow the SOLID principles because someone told you that it would be good to do. Understand what problems they help you solve or avoid. If you don't understand, then don't use them. Eventually, you might encounter a debugging session that frustrates you, and you might then realize that the use of SOLID would have avoided you the headache. It's hard to internalize these things without experiencing that frustration concretely first.",

Well, those patterns never really resonated with me and using Java helped solidify to me that OOP cannot be the simplest way to organize things in a maintainable way.\n\nIn my career I’ve seen a lot of patterns, and the one that really clicked for me was pure functional programming. Working with a language that doesn’t have mutable objects, null values, or even a semblance of classes was such a revelation: nearly all the problems the golden rules try to mitigate come from mutability and complex hierarchical state. Pure functions always return the same result, given the same arguments, which makes testing them incredibly easy and fun. And if the language has nothing but pure functions, then all applications built with it are incredibly easy and fun to test.\n\nMy point is, it’s okay if some aspects of programming don’t click. Maybe they will later on, when you’ve seen how following it avoided issues or cutting corners lead to issues. Maybe you’ll come across another way of looking at things (like FP for me) that finally makes sense and helps put everything else in a new perspective.\n\nJust build things you want to build, that’s the only way programming is going to start making sense. Try following the rules and try breaking them. Come up with your own solutions and once done, analyze if what you did actually followed a common pattern, just in a roundabout way. If not, was it better than the common pattern? Why did it work, would it scale to a larger codebase or a project with 10 developers?",

Dependency injection means some external body knows all about the internals of an object and injects other objects into that object as needed.\n\nNow the OOD model still works if you think IoC as some kind of God object that has control of the construction of every object in the system. Because IoC is a God these objects literally pop into existence.\n\nOnce you understand this, it makes a lot more sense.

Return a option from the devision (for example rust's `checked_div()` functions) so that you have to check later if you tried to divide by zero. Arguably another flavor of 1, just more explicit.\n5. Return a sentinal value such as NaN, which when any math is done to it returns NaN, but is also not equal to itself. Just about every floating point type does this.

A consulting company usually wouldn't care how you accomplish a task as long as it works. A product based software company will usually demand more as they have invested a lot of effort and resources in that product.\n\n> Now, I have found out that, that I'm really dumb. I had been using web servers for an year in JS and only recently I figured out the entire architecture when I had to build an HTTP server from scratch in C. It has been a huge challenge and still is.\n\nA common pitfall many new devs fall into. Do you really need to understand everything about everything? Don't get me wrong, I want to differentiate between you wanting to know how HTTP server works architecture wise and you feeling like you have to know how HTTP server works. One serves to broaden and enhance your skills while the other only serves to impede you.\n\n> If I learn how to apply a concept without first trying to understand it completely, is this a good strategy?\n\nIt depends on what you are trying to understand. Do you want to know if it is possible to do a task using a particular concept? Sure, you can implement messaging between two clients using BLE(Bluetooth Low Energy) by following a YT video. Do you want know the limits of what you can do with BLE? You then go and read the RFC for BLE, learn about it's specs, versions etc.\n\nTL;DR:- Both approaches are fine, it all depends on what you want. Want to get something done and don't really care for implementation details, go for application over mastery. Want to know what is possible and what isn't? Go for mastery over application.",

As an exercise that combines these topics, I recommend making a small hangman program. Try reading the word from a .txt file, handling the guessing part in the console, and outputting your final answer + the amount of guesses it took to a new .txt file. This will cover comparing matching values between an answer/guess array.\n2. To cover some basic math and parsing, you could also try reading a string of numbers e.g. \"15326\" from a .txt file, then calculating the average and median (requires sorting), and outputting that to a .txt file.\n\nGood luck on the exam!",

I can't speak to how it compares to other codebases but for someone who has only worked on small projects for classes, it's pretty daunting. Plus, while I have basic familiarity with Java, I don't know C# at all.\n\nI looked at a bunch of other mods for the game and decompiled the source code to get some starting points, but it wasn't long before I ran into roadblocks that no amount of Googling would have ever resolved. Normally, I'd probably have just given up. Being able to make tangible progress has been hugely helpful in keeping motivation up and frustration down, and I feel like I've learned a ton about C#, Unity games and even certain OOP concepts I wasn't super familiar with.\n\nBeing able to say, \"Okay, here's how this other mod did Y, can you give me some ideas on how to implement similar idea X?\" Or, \"I understand what this piece of code accomplishes, but why is it structured like this?\"\n\nYou have to be willing to challenge the AI's ideas sometimes, too. Like, a specific weird issue I was having with this mod the AI suggested a very \"brute force\" solution that probably would have worked, but I was 99% sure was not the correct or \"ideal\" way to do it. So I would say, \"No I'm pretty sure you're wrong. I can see a bunch of methods in this source file that may be applicable to our situation, maybe we can find an alternate path?\" And then we found a better solution together. The AI didn't solve the problem for me, it just saved me the frustration of having to parse thousands of lines of unfamiliar code in the hope that I was on the right track.\n\nIt definitely leads me astray sometimes, it hallucinates methods pretty regularly but *conceptually* it's implementation plans are usually pointed in the right direction. I treat it like a pair programmer, not a code monkey, and I can say with complete confidence that I have a better understanding of coding because of it.",

That solid foundation will make it much easier to pick up new technologies down the road. From what you've shared, I'd say focus on either Python or Java for now. Both are powerful, widely used, and have a lot more to offer than most people realize at first.\n\nOnce you're confident in one language, you'll be in a better position to understand how and when to use other tools specially in project-specific contexts.\n\nYou'll hit plenty of bumps down the road, so no need to get frustrated this early on. :)",

Sitting down and actually breaking down each element, what do I want, what do I need, who will be doing x and who does y? What “date” should I be using and why?\n\nLearning how to define the success factors and set realistic goals is vital in coding. As I’m going through it I’ll jot down possible approaches and methods I might need going forward. I don’t need to fully code them now but I need to make sure I have everything tight for when things get complicated later. \n\nYou won’t be designing every system you work on from the ground up but you will need to be able to read and identify what the other coders were doing, what were they thinking when they made this method or class and where does it go? You won’t be able to feed full applications into an AI to read them out to you when you’re on a team. \n\nI also put a lot of work in before I started college and got advanced entry into Y2. At Christmas I was miles ahead of most in the class and took the foot of the gas looking at other languages instead. Come April I realised I’d slipped too much and had work my balls off to catch up. Yes I had a basic understanding of what we did but I couldn’t use it effectively. \n\nThe best example was SQL. I could read SQL, I knew where the query was going how things joined but I struggled trying to fix it together myself. I used AI while making my database connections and had to constantly look back to do them from scratch myself. Eventually I just stopped using the AI designed methods as this is something I need to be able to do. \n\nWe had interviews presenting our final projects at the end of the year and they asked “You have well designed methods for database queries in the first 4-5 frames but you don’t use them later in the project. Why?”  I explained that while I would be using those methods from the helper files in real world conditions, I wasn’t happy with my understanding of them. I couldn’t do them from memory and kept making errors, so I decided to drill them in by typing them out each time. \n\nThey loved that answer. It showed I was able to use helper files and methods to keep code clear and concise making the project easy to read, but I also knew how to make and adjust the process to perform custom tasks. They asked me to isolate certain conditions and how I would pick out individual combinations and I was able to do it on the spot because I knew the system and understood how it worked. Some of the others struggled with that as AI had done all the thinking for them. \n\nWhen it came to exams I flew through the test because I A) understood how I would do it. B) was able to identify what they were looking for and how to trace back to it. And C) I made the mistakes and worked my way through them so when they happened there I knew what I was looking at. \n\nTLDR:\n\nDon’t use AI to design everything. Yes it’ll spit out loads of lovely code that works for this window of the project but it won’t improve your skills or work when you only have this small section on larger projects. \n\nKeep pushing in college, you might be ahead right now but that’ll slip real quick it you get lazy",

What sqlite cannot do, is process multiple *WRITING* requests at the same time, as this requires exclusive access (either locking of the WAL (Write Ahead Log) or a pending db lock). sqlite does support multiple concurrent *READING* requests\n\n\n### WAL Mode\n\nSince WAL was introduced, if it is activated (by default sqlite uses the older rollback-journal), readers and writers do not block each other any more, and reading doesn't block other readers.\n\nSo sqlite, with WAL enabled, supports multiple readers at the same time, and supports reading and writing at the same time. The only thing it doesn't support, is multiple writers at the same time, those are forced into sequential access, because they need to lock the WAL.\n\nhttps://www.sqlite.org/wal.html\n\n### Rollback Journal\n\nIn this mode, which is the default unless the journal pragma is set otherwise, sqlite still supports multiple readers and only one writer, but; other than with WAL, readers in this mode block writers, and vice versa.\n\nWhat this means (since sqlite version 3): If someone writes to the database, the DB goes into a `PENDING LOCK` mode...allowing current reads to finish, but disallowing further reads from the DB. As soon as the last read finishes, the database goes into `LOCKED` mode, the writing access does its thing, and then the lock clears.\n\nThis means, with the older journal mode, if a lot of writes happen on a DB, read performance suffers.\n\nhttps://www.sqlite.org/lockingv3.html#rollback",

I haven't seen any sqlite distribution that wasn't for a loooong time.\n\nGood code should check however, wether the sqlite compilate used supports this, and if it does, which thread safety mode it uses. The catch here is that there are 2 different modes:\n\n`SQLITE_THREADSAFE = 1` means multi-threading is supported, but auto-serialized. This is slower, but safer.\n\n`SQLITE_THREADSAFE = 2` means true multi-threading is supported, but there is no auto serialization. If this is the case, and in many sqlite distros this is the default now, *threads cannot safely use the same connection concurretly*. In this case, a connection-pool is usually the way to go if you have multiple threads accessing the DB.\n\n\nhttps://sqlite.org/compile.html#threadsafe",

I have heard from many non-IT people and only a handful of specialised people that I should know everything and that this is the only way to stay relevant and employable in today's and the future's job market (specially due to ai). \nOn the other hand, with majority of IT and CS people here on reddit, in my uni and knowledgeable students in other fields as well have have advised me to be skilled in atleast 1 to 3 things but it isn't necessary to know everything from a to z, since it is highly possible that I will end up being half skilled in everything rather than being fully skilled in everything. \nI have heard that it is certainly a competitive field that requires constant upskilling too. \nI honestly don't know whether I should learn all the programming languages and tech tools out there, but what I do know is that it is very unrealistic to believe that a human should know it all, even if it is in another field. With the artificial intelligence competition increasing day by day, I honestly don't know if most people will even have jobs in the future though. It's scary, even if people try to ignore the impact of ai and tell me otherwise. I don't know what to do either. I am confused too.\nI wish you a lot of success and happiness in life!!🧿😁",

Somedays I spend hours on fixing a bug that turns out was a typo. Other days my output is godly and Ive impressed myself with how much I could do. Unless 2 people are working on similar things, or the exact thing, programming \"together\" kinda just sounds like being in the same room and typing....\n\n\nIm not saying that you shouldnt find your tribe of course, just that it may look different than you expect, but not in a bad way. Meetups can be fun, and theyre full of like minded people who desperately want to talk about what they're building over drinks or whatever, all without any computers or actual code. \n\n\nI drank the Vim kool-aid after meeting up with a bunch of programmers at an event held at a brewery where an Emacs vs Vim debate broke out, cause i heard a bunch of cool stuff and went home to try it lol. But, if Im programming \"with\" people in a room stuff like that doesnt come up as much and it always seems to devolve into the \"best\" coder of the bunch being -unintentionally- assigned the role of \"bug fixing tutor\". \n\nEvery group is different so maybe you find what youre looking for, but in my humble opinion (which is not law, do whatever lol) I would look for events where programmers meet up near you and do stuff like rock climbing or bar hopping instead of meeting up to program. Trust me, programmers are super annoying and they will talk about programming while you're bowling or whatever.... after you've found some homies, THEN go make a discord where you all can program and chat together. \n\n\nDoing a meet up also means you will be interacting with programmers who have at least a single additional interest other than programming... Bless those savants who live and breathe code of course, those geniuses are above us all and doing stuff that is always more advanced than my dumbass could do...... but..... people whose only interest is programming can be a little difficult to mesh well with for a lot of personalities lol \n\n\nIf everyone in this sub all joined a discord to hang out, how many of us do you think would stick around long term given that right now the only thing we have in common is programming? Probably not a lot. But if you like to watch cricket and you go to a meet up for programmers at a bar to watch cricket, you'll meet people who are much more likely to vibe with you and be involved with your interests!\n\n\nHonestly, this is just a lot of words to say \"go make friends with at least a couple shared interests\", in my experience that is the best way to immerse in a culture. Imagine you're studying and trying to follow Atomic Habits advice. Would you be motivated to learn if you were held accountable to some random dude you met who only interacts with you because you both are using Java, or a friend who will absolutely shame you and tease you for being a dumbass and neglecting to study? \n\n\nAtomic Habits doesnt say \"force yourself to be a certain way\", it says to join a culture where your desired behavior is the standard. I dont know about you, but the culture that Ive found that has promoted my programing career is a culture where we work hard and play hard and we all laugh at Jeff cause the team he roots for sucks. At least thats how I would recommend beginners get more involved with other beginners and non-beginners.",

The demand, i.e. desire, for R&D hasn't gone away- it's arguably only getting more intense than ever in strategic technologies what with all the \"but china\"-isms. But the cost of financing R&D has ballooned between the hike in interest rates (keeping zombie companies on debt fueled life support, incentivizing borrowing to spend on growth, i.e. R&D) and loss of immediate tax breaks. (ammortization is the same in the long term- but getting the full break that year is the difference between 20% cost reduction and 4%. If not for the previous years of instant \"refunds\", they'd have stacked 4 years of ammortizations and have the same effect right now.)\n\n**The loss of the tax advantage for R&D and the hike in interest rates would have suppressed wages, but not diminished the demand for employees.** What we're seeing is collusion between major tech employers to time their layoffs with the DOGE cuts to create a glut of desperate, highly senior, non-pay motivated talent in the market. The longer they can perpetuate it, the more desperate those people will get, and it creates a hermit crab conga line of companies firing their less senior staff hired when times were good to bring in more senior staff who've finally gotten desperate enough to accept lower pay.\n\nThere is an argument to be made that because other companies are laying off tech staff and the abundance of tech graduates is creating an environment where wages are so severely depressed that it becomes in the interest of companies to also layoff their staff to rehire cheaper replacements *without direct collusion*, but **when that sort of behavior occurs in the banking sector or stock market, there are regulations in place to prevent the situation from becoming a feedback loop that tanks the institutions.** \n\n**This cycle of mass layoffs will repeat every time companies think they can get lower wages, more experience or both from a new hire over their current staff until the US gets serious about passing labor protection laws.**",

When you're growing, you need to hire a lot of people to take bit bets on many projects. You have to pay more and making interviewing less frictionful if you're hiring a lot of people. If you're focusing on profitability, cost cutting by reducing labor is a huge lever.\n2. Tax issues like Section 174 also have an effect. For big tech companies, it doesn't matter as much since these companies are very profitable and have strong cashflow. They're already paying a lot of corporate income taxes in most cases anyways. For startups and not yet profitable, growth companies, this makes it more financially challenging to operate. It also pushes them toward profitability and cost cutting, but this may not be viable for more growth-oriented business models.",

Then again, 0% interest rates already sounds unsustainable.\n\nMy hypothesis for the bad market:\n1.  Too much new grads and bootcampers, entry is impossible.

A rockstar SWE living in bumfuck nowhere Montana might be making a very \"normal\" salary at a normal company, and a dumbass SWE living in the Bay Area might've weaseled their way into a top-paying SV startup. And we *certainly* don't make \"2x or 3x\" what ***most*** other white collar fields make. Maybe if by \"most\" you include working in fast food, but definitely not white collar.\n* For one, this isn't an inherent trait of a SWE career. It *never* has been. There are lots of fully onsite companies, even top tech companies. But it's also not unique to SWE. It's a trait *of a company*, not of a role. At every hybrid/remote company I've worked at, ***everyone*** is hybrid/remote and is afforded that same amount of flexibility. Marketing, sales, legal, IT, etc.\n* It's genuinely interesting to you and me! But to a lot of people out there what you just described is more boring than watching paint dry. Different strokes for different folks.\n* Variety also exists in many other careers... You know those prestigious companies you're talking about? And the exciting startups you're talking about? Guess what they both also hire? Non-SWE's.\n* Now you're just saying \"White Collar careers are the best careers by far\". This has nothing to do with SWE.\n* If you work for a large, well-known company it's just as likely (I'd argue significantly *more* likely) that you'll be working on some boring internal tool that has 20 internal users. Scale is also not inherent of this career. \"I work for Google\", \"Cool, what do you do there?\", \"Oh.. uhh... I manage a dashboard that lets a small team of internal users track internal budgets between departments\".\n\nIt's a great career, don't get me wrong. But all of what you're describing isn't inherent of a SWE career, nor is it unique to a SWE career. There are billions of people. When you use words like \"best\", you're forgetting that the overwhelming majority of humans out there don't care at all about the things you care about.\n\n*Your* \"best\" career is someone else's living nightmare. Someone else's \"best\" career that makes them love waking up in the morning (someone who *enjoys* a manual labor job and like working outside, in extreme conditions for example), might be ***your*** living nightmare.\n\nIf you enjoy SWE, pursue it. There's really no point in trying to argue it's the objectively \"best\" field. Let people do what people want to do with their lives.",

He said there was way more politicking than there was coding, and a huge portion of the company is run by Indians and the Indians will look out for other Indians no matter the consequences. A majority of the problems could be summed up as following. His manager's friend. also Indian, was hired to be on his team even when he couldn't code his way out of a cardboard box. Said friend's work would be passed onto the non-Indian team members and then those team members would get blamed when the extra work wouldn't get done on time. When stack ranking came around, one of the non-Indian team members was piped to further the Indian take over. My friend said this was a common occurrence throughout the company. \n\n\n\nShould you take the job?

That was the whole point of the layoffs. If all these big tech companies lay off employees at the same time, the hiring pool is suddenly filled with lots of talented employees. All of these employees need jobs and are competing with each other. In order to get employed again, some of these employees will take big pay cuts. So the companies are able to hire new staff at the same or similar level of talent for a reduced cost.\n\nThat obviously won't work forever. And once the economy improves some of these employees will jump ship. But it's what these companies have decided to do in the short term.",

I had been to university at Cambridge and I saw a lot of friends moving into high profile, \"respectable\" jobs in law, journalism, finance. I felt like I wasn't enough.\n\n\nI didn't really understand where tech could take me and I privately thought I wasn't good at it.\n\n\nSo I started looking at going into law, politics or journalism, something vaguely related to my (non tech) degree and which had some kind of prestige. Somehow I settled on law and began planning a career move.\n\n\nBut very quickly I realised it was the wrong choice. The law students I met seemed highly competitive and political, much more than any programmer I'd ever met, and there was a vague desperation to them. I read frank accounts of how numbing the work was and the crises of many lawyers who hit 40 and realise they're wasting their lives.\n\n\nI didn't leave technology in the end, I embraced it. I was looking for a career to fill holes in my self-image and try to counter my gnawing self-hatred. No job will do that. And I began to appreciate how creative I could be as a programmer once I accepted that I will never be perfect at it.\n\n\nOver the years I've become very thankful for this choice. Programming is what gets me up in the morning, there is nothing else like it for me. I will always be learning and it will never get boring.",

The response rate, even for rejections, rounds to zero. I have my very first real interview since graduation next week, and I got it by reference from someone at the company.\n\nApplying online is sending your resume into the ATS abyss, that is to say, far from the eyes of any real-life human who can make a hiring decision. The lack of responses and offers might be a personal deficiency, it's always possible, but current hiring practices have made job seeking an abysmal, soul-sucking nightmare. We are fumbling around in the dark through a winding graveyard of ghostpostings, scams, and poor practices. Your success does not necessarily correlate with your  merit. That's just the way it is. It's a game at the end of the day so you gotta play by its crooked rules or get left in the dust. We chose the wrong time to join this industry OP. Tough luck.",

It's relatively common to have weak support (either by a manager carousel or lack of E6+ sponsors) that can block your promo - ask me how I know lol. \n\nMore subjectively, I think it's worth finding a team that you trust in their feedback (there are some people who are 10x more critical than average), and if you care about timelines, a staggering of levels (if there's like 8 E3s, it might take longer for your promotion to come through). \n\nAs an aside - I think performance will be much more about stakeholders talking about how great you are / other people in PSC, and objective metrics are somewhat secondary, esp for E3->E4.",

Theres an idea in big tech where you need to make impact, which means “what can i do to make something easier for another engineer”.

I admit I’m in a decent position due to a well-known but not FAANG company on my resume (as a previous role, not current role), name brand school, and yoe. \n\nI dropped to about 50 jobs on LinkedIn and other job boards, heard back from 8+ decent companies (like companies you might recognize, not just no name startups). Hit rate is much better for recruiters who reached out to me via LinkedIn or email. I honestly had to stop responding back after the first week of showing “open to job opportunities” on LinkedIn because of the overwhelming amount of messages for various startup roles, mostly AI. Went through the process for about 20 companies so far, rejected by 15, with the rest still ongoing but probably not able to finish before the offer deadline.\n\nBehavioral questions and hiring manager rounds I think are a cakewalk, just prepare your stories ahead of time. Hardest part is grinding leetcode questions to shake the rust off implementing DFS, binary search, etc. Feels like school again. System Design is okay. Can be challenging sometimes, but I feel like it’s easier to fall back on work experience with this and supplement with some studying. As opposed to coding questions which doesn’t have as much overlap with real work, and it feels like you just need to study solutions to a lot of different questions and practice.\n\nI don’t doubt that the market is grim out there for new grads or early in career folks, and certainly worse than a few years ago for senior folks. But at least from my limited pov, it’s still okay. When I get rejected, it’s still mostly because I fucked up a coding question.

If he gets hired, that off-screen person will do his work for the first couple weeks then taper off and the guy just calls in to daily standup with excuses for why he’s blocked again, and continues for as long as it’ll last before he gets fired (which takes surprisingly long at a lot of companies). \n\nIt’s a nightmare from the hiring side.

In practice, it means that the law says an employer has to post a job ad for a role that had already been filled and ramped up a year+ earlier.\n\nThe undertone of these kinds of exposes seem to be that some cohorts are more \"deserving of the opportunity conferred by the law\", but arguably the immigration lawyers involved are actually going by the spirit of the law (even if it may technically be malicious compliance) when they ask the H-1B worker to provide job descriptions with excruciatingly high level of detail to construct these job posts. It is already hard enough to get candidates to match nice-to-haves in a regular job post, so who else can check every checkmark in a huge and highly specific list other than the person that is already doing the function, and with zero ramp up time, to boot? Or so the rationale goes.\n\nOne could argue that labor market assessment ought to be done upfront, and it actually is in some countries, notably the LMIA in Canada, but as Canadians might attest, that's not necessarily successful in practice either.\n\nPersonally I'm pretty cynical about political reform in general. \"Don't ask what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country\", as Kennedy famously said, if nothing else because the political machine doesn't really have your personal interest at heart in the first place.",

If you go this route my advice is to not go into a meetup with the intention of finding a job. Obviously that is the main objective but just go to the meetup with the intention of building your network and talking to others in the field. Also have the Linkedin app on your phone so you can easily connect with others at the meetup.",

If something isn't literally on fire, you probably don't need to drop everything else to do it today. Normally you agree on milestones and delivery deadlines upfront, or at least in advance.\n\nSecond is deconstructing delivery timelines based on whether it's due to technical complexity or due to scheduling. The former presumably means you've done some due diligence before estimating, and you should be able to articulate what the time consuming parts are with some degree of granularity, and their respective estimates. The latter is about what prior commitments you already have, and you have to decide how negotiable it is to make changes. Maybe you can deliver things faster by dropping/negotiating other things that have lower priorities or charging premium to work overtime or hiring a subcontractor, maybe not. If you can't, then be transparent about having other commitments. In other words, urgency is a feature, and you can charge money for it.\n\nIf it's a question of perception, you could try to explain via analogies, e.g. in law movies everything happens very quickly, often within the same day, whereas in reality, they drag on for months/years because in the real world things just take time.

What's so difficult about it?\" are asking those questions because what they *really* want to know is When will it be complete? So your response to these questions should be a date you'll have that feature complete. Once you give a deadline, you'll get many fewer of these questions and if you do, just refer them to the aforementioned date.\n\nThe other part of this is just that non-technical people just don't know how hard things are. They've been taught, through drag-and-drop website builders and, sadly, AI-marketing, that things are easy. A new form should take an hour to add, right?? It can also be helpful to explain, as part of the communication providing them with the estimated timeline, what goes into the feature you're building. If they ask for a button to send a report to their email, for example, you can explain that part of your work means preventing security issues, handling permissions, formatting the report, testing it, making sure the email doesn't go to spam, etc etc.\n\nAs for the full-time job part, if they knew you had a full time job when they contracted with you, you can remind them of that, but I honestly think that's unnecessary to include. Just focus on giving them the timeline and they'll back off. It's not coming from a place of malice for them; they're just feeling in the dark probably.",

Some changes are easy to make, like hanging pictures. Some changes aren’t necessarily hard they just take time. For example, in order to paint the walls you have to take everything off, cover floors and furniture, sand the walls, paint multiple coats, etc. \n\nAnd some things might seem easy on the surface but require a lot of behind the scenes work. For example, moving a stove from one wall to another. Because there is tons of complicated, specialized work hiding behind the walls. You have to move the gas lines, and you have to do it in a way that doesn’t interfere with or disrupt the electrical, plumbing, hvac, and god knows what else is behind the walls.”",

You get an internship you have to be a currently-enrolled college student, and I'm not aware of any companies that significantly increased the number of interns they hired each summer. On the flip side, even companies that had layoffs continued to hire interns each summer at a similar rate.\n\nMy observation wasn't that tech companies changed their interviewing practices, they just hired more. They'd interview as many people as they could and hire everyone who passed, rather than the usual case of some \"passing\" the interviews but still not getting selected over even stronger candidates.\n\nOverall tech companies are still growing and hiring.\n\nI'm seeing a trend to hire more in LCOL areas and countries - not outsourcing, but actually opening offices in other cities and countries.\n\nAnother issue is that the number of CS grads has doubled in the last 10 years and is still rising. It's quite possible that the number of CS grads is going up faster than demand, so the issue isn't that hiring is down (in historic numbers), but rather that demand has grown faster than supply.",

In my area, I’ve noticed that whenever there’s big layoffs from big tech there’s suddenly a change in job postings looking for unicorn applicants from big tech with salary lower than what you’d expect coming from one of those big companies.\n\nMy advice: Look for jobs that don’t carry a title like “software engineer” but are at companies with software engineers. I technically work a “data” job but most of what I do is building internal tools and dashboards for business analysts and data analysts. \n\nI’m one of a few here at my company that have a CS background and I became a lead within about 6 months after being hired as a “Senior Developer”. I’m paid well because I’m the one who tests if new software or applications will help the team improve in some capacity. \n\nIt’s generally easier to get a job doing something technical at a company for a couple years and then pivot over to software engineer in the same company than it would be to get hired directly as a software engineer. In some cases you even get to skip the whole ten interview plus projects pipeline a bunch of companies are trying to do now.",

Meeting with people, asking questions, finding out who your stakeholders are (business and management), who their stakeholders are. What are their goals? What are their pressing needs? You’re building to enable them, largely, but as an engineer, you can see needs and designs they can’t always see. So being witness to their conversations or structures can be eye opening.  \n\nHaving 1:1s and asking questions about the application/applications you’re working on will help. Who do you ask to learn more about specific parts of the app? What dependencies does your app have and who’s responsible for those? How do larger changes happen in the org? Are there special-interest groups/committees regarding your domains? How do you join them?",

How are they staying within the country?\n\nSome of them end up leaving. There are ways to stay, but for a lot of those people they need a legitimate job that pays legitimate money, and if they can't get that, then they end up having to leave because of not only immigration status but also finances.\n\n>Also, could this hiring freeze combined with the layoffs be intentional to make the foreigners leave the country without overstaying illegally on an expired visa? Basically slowing down hiring for 90 days until the foreigners on visa have to self deport?\n\nHiring freezes and layoffs are company-driven decisions. Those companies have no incentive to drive foreign workers out of the country - that would just make the cost of labor for them go up. Most companies want foreign workers to be available.\n\nSo this makes no sense. Companies are doing layoffs because layoffs = higher profits, and that has always been true.\n\n>If people on those visas do an unpaid internship, for example, can they stay in the country until they find a real paying job, even if it takes more than 90 days to find the job since they're not unemployed technically while doing an unpaid internship?\n\nYes. As long as it's a valid unpaid internship - i.e., an internship that is consistent with their field of study/profession. Like, on OPT you can't go get an unpaid job as a janitor and have it count. But you can, for example, work as an unpaid researcher for your former grad program (I've seen this done several times).\n\nAgain, the problem with that strategy is that you need to then have the finances to float you until you do find a job, which isn't something everyone can do. And in a lot of cases, if you get to that stage, a lot of people end up preferring to just go back to their home country and not have to deal with that situation.",

The tech stack, the team, what your role will consist of, what the expecations of you will be, what an average day of a SWE looks like, what kinds of major projects are coming in the future, etc should *not be a surprise*. These are all things you should be asking about in the reverse interview.\n\nNext time you job hop, make it a point to reverse interview. Otherwise you're literally just rolling the dice that you'll end up at another place that you thought would be doing X, but is actualy doing Y. You need to be the one rejecting companies you don't want to work for.\n\nThat being said, I don't think your situation is that bad. Firstly, *you got a job*. In 2023, as a new grad. That's a win, regardless of the stack you're using.\n\nAlso, especially this early in your career, companies won't necessarily require an exact 1-1 match of their tech stack expectations. You know Java. That's big. You can learn Spring on the side, or even on the job, it's not that hard. Just because you haven't worked professionally with Spring doesn't mean you're unqualified for Java/Spring positions.\n\nAnecdotally, I've switched stacks completely many times. Companies aren't DQ'ing me because I have no experience in their stack. They know I can learn on the job, and my resume paints that picture. One company I was talking to used Java/Micronaut, which was a completely new concept for me. That interested me, I had some great conversations about it with my interviewers, its pros/cons compared to Spring, etc. I got an offer. My confidence, and my interest in learning the new tech, made up for lack of experience in a core technology that company used. You can do the same, swapping out Spring/Micronaut with GWT/Spring.\n\nAll that said, right now you're disqualifying youself without even trying. You've made this whole post freaking out about starting to find jobs... *but you haven't started lookign for a job*. You have no idea how it's going to go for you. Make sure your resume is on point, get rid of the negative thinking and start oozing confidence because you're an intelligent SWE that can pick new things up easily. Companies will see that. My confidence, warranted or not, is what gets me my jobs offers.",

Or did you assume it'd be OK to wait until 8am?\n\nObviously an expectation of after-hours responses isn't healthy, it creates a bad WLB. Your time outside of working hours belong to you. But that doesn't change the fact that if it's an expectation, then from your employer's perspective you're not meeting expectations.\n\nAnother side of this in addition to employer expectations is your own professional boundaries. Did you clearly communicate your working hours? When contacted after hours did you make it clear that it was *after hours* for you and that you'd get back to them first thing in the morning?\n\nEspecially in a distributed world where people may be in different timezones, and where a lot of people are setting their own hours, some people just don't realize if it's after hours for someone else. That may be insensitive to not consider that before firing off messages... but it's not uncommon.\n\nEven on teams with a good WLB though, after hours messages happe from time to time, for various reasons. Sometimes it's urgent issues, sometimes someone just fired off a message without realizing it was after hours, sometimes someone was just sending a message before they forgot and aren't expecting a response until the nxt day. I don't guarantee to be reachablea fter 5pm, but f I get a Slack/Teams message after 5 I normally just pop in a quick response: \"What's the urgency on this? I'm not at my laptop (even if I am), can this wait till the morning?\"\n\nCommunication makes the dream work. which actually kinda ties into a secondary issue... are you even sure this whole after hours debacle had anything to do with your managers review? Were you having 1/1's with your manager talking about what was going well and what wasn't? Your manager not renewing your contract should not have been a surprise. Sure that's also a failure of *them* for not communicating, but communciation goes both ways.",

Simple as that.  But before you join the \"fuck that toxic company\" chorus, keep a couple things in mind.  The firm doesn't care about you -- that is totally true.  But it might be different for individuals.  This is a natural opportunity to network with them.  People move, so stay in touch, make a good impression, and show them what you can do.  People respond to positive people, so try to keep that going.\n\nNow to the caveat.  In my experience (in the US), interns are usually non-exempt.  So I don't expect them to go past their paid hours.  If you have a boss that doesn't understand that, that's not good.  But ultimately, it's your choice.

If that's how you feel about them, then you need to give them that feedback during the internship so they can address it.\n\n>Also, we have a new boss (boss of my boss) and this guy totally skips my direct boss to text me always outside working hours (once it was 6 pm, another at 7 and the most recent was a message this Friday at 9pm) which I always reply at 8am in the morning, and he never replies until he just texts me days after after working hours once again, am I wrong here?\n\nThere are two answers here: the practical one and the ideological one.\n\nThe practical one: \"Hey big boss, is this something urgent you need done right now - and if so, by when? If not, is it ok if I get back to you tomorrow at 8am?\". You just *have* to ask. I've been doing this for 12 years and got a new VP 2 years ago and the first time he asked me to do something at 5pm on a weekday I immediately assume he meant that instant (because I've had bosses like that in the past), but I asked \"hey, do you need this right now?\" and he immediately went \"oh god no, no - do not work on this right now. This is a tomorrow thing - I just wanted to get that in front of you because I won't have time to chat about it tomorrow\".\n\nBut i've had VPs that would have expected an answer that moment. And then you have to decide whether you want the job (which means you should do it), or whether you think this is BS and don't care to work for a company like that (in which case you don't).\n\nAnd that's the ideological answer: if you don't want to work for a company that expects you to be on call without being officially on call (i.e., getting paid more for it), then you shouldn't just go along with that stuff.",

Make a new database with the UI and do CRUD operations. Can get up to speed in 1 day. Oracle isn't nearly as common as it used to be and MySQL is the cheapskate version of Oracle. MSSQL is good though.\n* **Learn one of AWS, Azure, GCP**. I used to think no one used GCP but I saw one company switch to it because it's cheaper. Recruiters were always cool with me only knowing 1 of the 3 since the others are easy to learn at that point. Using on the job goes a long way, else get an entry level cert that you see listed in a few job applications. The only cert that not a scam for this reason but it is crazy expensive. Thus your employer pays. Probably need a book or course and the exam has extra cheating detection.\n* **Learn one of Docker or Kubernetes**. You can learn both but there's some overlap. Pick what you see more in job descriptions. I guess Kubernetes and that's what I've seen more as well.\n* Microservices, yeah this is on the job experience. You can't teach yourself, or you can, but it won't matter to a recruiter.\n* Less important: Compliment Java with another language. Could be Python, Kotlin, Go aka Golang or TypeScript/JavaScript with your choice of React or Angular. Actually is important but if not used on the job, it ranks here.\n* Less important: Use Jetty with Spring Boot, preferably now on the job for local testing. I haven't used Tomcat on the job in 10 years. Cloud crap is taking over but local servers is a nice plus and they don't use cloud data. Bonus: Mock a database with JUnit + Mockito or PowerMock or whatever. You should know JUnit.",

Most people in the field have a degree, and it puts you on a level playing field.\n\nNot having the degree is going to close doors -- there's no way around it. That doesn't mean that there are no open doors for you, but it's going to limit you. Particularly if you ever think you might want to work in another country, your visa may hinge entirely on having a CS degree.\n\nWhen changing careers to software engineering, I went and did exactly what you are considering and got a Masters in CS. I have never even once had regrets, and many of the opportunities I've had wouldn't have been possible without it. If you have the time, and can afford the expense (I received a partial scholarship), I cannot recommend it enough.\n\nAdditionally, considering the current job market, it is so competitive for new grads right now that I don't think companies are taking risks on giving someone their first CS job with no work history and no degree. At this particular moment in time, I think it would be incredibly difficult to get your first job in the industry unless you already have personal connections to do so (getting the first job without a degree and proving yourself is the biggest hurdle) or are prepared to work for absolutely abysmal pay or conditions (which may have lifelong career repercussions -- people will probably know exactly how your previous employer paid you and treated you, and it can be a struggle for your wages to catch up even as you move to better and better companies). Getting the degree also gives time for the current job market to possibly improve, though I don't know I'd put money on it getting better so that's neither here nor there.",

When I got my new job they were offering me a good bump from my last job (about a 30% raise). When I told my GF (we live together) she looks at me and says \"OMG we will be able to buy so much for our house\".I dont want her to sound like she is money craved, it's more like she is a spend-mentality where i am save mentality. My mindset is I will live the same regardless of how much money I make (to a certain degree) and just save the rest and hoepfully retire younger. When I heard about the 30% raise my first thought was \"ok I can set about 10% of that to pay off some stuff from when I was unemployed, then when that's down invest that 10%, maybe with another 10% i will put in my savings/invest funds and then the last 10% will be for anything for us\". When she said that I was taken a bcak. My GF is someone who will pay and buy for her own things so I have never felt like she has cared about it. She'll buy me clothes even when I dont ask for it. She makes good money too. She has good money saved but when it comes for future money she hasnt really prepared well for it. She is definetely more of a spender than a buyer. \n\nTo your point about people not wanting to go down. I gave her some tips to help her save more and told her to put maybe a couple hundred bucks per paycheck. She did it and for over a month she was crying about how little her paycheck was now looking. Again this is a girl who makes 6 figures. I think she is around 105k and in a no-income state her take home is probably around 70k.",

My manager/PM is in charge of deciding how I use those 40 hours, they get to choose my priorities, so if they want me to address something immediately, I will. But *I'm* in charge of setting expectations, and enforcing my professional boundaries of a 40 hour work week. So the question goes back to them, they can trade one priority for another. They don't get to tell me \"Everything's gotta get done\", that's just a sign of poor management if they try. Luckily for management though, a lot of SWE's are scared to establish professional boundaries, so they just decide to quietly do everything and inflate their hours beyond 40, which is not sustainable.\n\nWhen unknowns pop up in tickets that I've estimated, I very clearly communicate those things as early as possible. \"X, Y,and Z came up while doing this ticket. We can either make a 2nd ticket to tackle next sprint and close this one out partially complete, or we can include that increased scope as a part of this ticket and it'll carry over\".\n\nIt's all about how you respond. Obviously having completely clean sprints would be great, but that's rarely how things go. When things come up, tickets carry over. It's pretty normal.",

This varied by team, but sometimes someone would act as a point person for the sprint from other teams. I don't recall if this was the same person every sprint, or if two different people played the roles.\n\nPerhaps your manager would be open to tracking the additional work that way. It might also be helpful to track how much time is being spent either not fixing things the right way or poor planning. Some of what you're describing sounds like requirements might be inaccurate, which adds to these issues popping up. \n\nThere could also be an increased culture of testing. There used to be a practice back in the day that whoever broke the build was the new buildmaster until the next person. Or, you can rotate the role. It may give people more appreciation of what they are committing (realistically, there are some people who will never care). But if you go with a per-sprint role, maybe that can be a pointed ticket/story to cover that work. \n\nSounds like your manager might not like those ideas because they just want to push features, but it's worth at least having the discussion. It's real work, and it may help the team find ways to be more efficient in the long-term. \n\nAnother huge advantage of these rotations is spreading knowledge across the team. What happens if you're on vacation, or you're not longer on the team? This helps protect against that. It will also hopefully expand peoples' skillsets. It will help everyone and the team as a whole.",

So that discrepancy - like, $400-$500K - *that* is really tough to offset.\n\nBut if you're just sacrificing $25K a year, $75K total? That probably is worth getting a PhD.\n\nNow, [as some have commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1l3ueaa/comment/mw3rrha/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) if you get your PhD in something ultra-specific, you might actually be limiting your career growth and potential. *But you don't have to*.\n\nA lot of people do their PhD in a relatively broad area of CS, or an area of CS that has applications acrosss industries and areas, and in that world you don't get the same negative impact of specialization.\n\nSo to me, that is important - if you go to do a PhD with a focus on going back to a corporate/industry job instead of staying in academia, then make sure you shape your PhD (research, publications, etc.) to match that. Don't let the incentives of your academic-minded colleagues and advisors (i.e., publications) to take precedence over your priorities (i.e., developing proof of skills that are valuable in the workplace).",

Even if you think it's your own voice and ideas, having an LLM rewrite your stuff will invariably introduce semantic shift as well as ideas that aren't your own. Using an LLM to help you write like this at all will instantly torpedo any academic aspirations you have. You're going to need to learn how to express your thoughts on your own. \n\nChatting with LLMs can make you feel like you're learning a lot and that you're making deep insights, but that's the sycophantic nature of chatbots. But it's actually very shallow because it doesn't understand anything. It's just good at generating sentences and paragraphs that looks good on the surface. It might seem deep to someone who's deep in the Dunning-Kreuger well, but it's mostly just superficial repetition to an expert.  \n\nYou didn't engage any other thinkers at all, didn't connect anything you're saying to any published work, and there's just zero rigor. Be careful \"self-studying\" philosophy in this way. It's not preparing you for an academic program in philosophy. This is the equivalent of someone self-studying about CSS and learning how to change colors and themes on a webpage, and thinking that they've made some insightful leaps in the theory of computer science. \n\nSo just be careful with that. If you want to learn how to do philosophy, you need to deeply engage with a large catalogue of serious literature. LLMs, pop writing on Buddhism, and Sam Harris won't cut it past a 100 level undergrad philosophy class.",

It wasn’t meant to be anything academic but just a way for my friends from different backgrounds to visualize meditation, mindfulness, etc. i really enjoy casual writing for my friends which is the purpose of my blog. I do engage with big writers in the field and want to do more formal writing(without LLMs assistance) so that’s why I want to go back to school. I think being in an academic setting and engaging with real professors and classmates would allow me to step past the stage I’m at currently which I agree is not very good. I do believe in my capability of growing to write more academically as I have a strong argument against simulation theory that I have talked to both cs professors and philosophers professors about and got good feedback. I bought all the relevant existing literature(Dennet, Bolstram, Chalmers) so I can reference and engage with literature. But in short, I definitely agree with you and need to completely change my writing style and approach to succeed in any academic sense.  If you have any other advice on what I’d need to succeed let me know! Really appreciate you’re criticism",

The fact that interviewers kept pushing about certifications despite your detailed technical explanations shows they're following a checklist rather than assessing your actual capabilities.\n\nGetting multiple certifications in a short timeframe isn't a red flag when you already have the underlying experience - it just shows you're adapting to market demands. The reality is that in today's job market, especially in Europe where compliance and formal qualifications carry more weight, having those pieces of paper can open doors that your experience alone might not. It's frustrating and somewhat backwards, but playing the game strategically by getting certified in technologies you already know well is a smart move that demonstrates both your existing skills and your commitment to formal validation.\n\nI'm actually part of the team behind [interview assistant](http://interviews.chat), and we built it specifically to help people navigate these kinds of tricky interview situations where you need to articulate the value of your experience alongside formal credentials.",

We plan way too much (in halfs,) don’t stick to it, then thrash. Very compartmentalized as if whole sections of the company are external vendors. The best thing they have going for them is a supposed blameless culture, but this often manifests as a lack of ownership/responsibility for actions. \n\nIn the past I was at a company that grew from 50 to over 1,000 and they were basically the opposite. Fast, not much process, pragmatic staffing. We planned more flexibly, often week by week, and later monthly as we grew. Culture was very open and encouraged cross functional behavior and leadership. The only thing I didn’t like here (besides stress that built over years) was the subtle blame games that happened behind your back. \n\nSo like I said, complete opposites. Both are political but often this behavior came from career big tech people. Try as we might to start fresh, people bring their baggage and it impacts the culture throughout the industry, for better and for worse.",

Slightly more money isn't worth the risk of moving to a single client, imo, but if the consistency of a single product is enticing then I would say that's a good reason to consider the offer.\n\nFood for thought: most \"full time\" roles don't actually take up a full 40 hour week. You'll need to align with their schedule more rigidly, and give them priority, but there's no reason you can't keep your easier/smaller clients. Some people take on multiple full time roles, even.\n\nIf you think this is definitively a 40+ hr/wk workload for that single client, though, then that would probably be the dealbreaker for me without a more significant pay bump. You've already accomplished the hard part of freelance--finding clients. I wouldn't leave the flexibility behind for an almost-equivalent salary. It's also still a contract, so they can drop you at any time, leaving you with nothing.",
