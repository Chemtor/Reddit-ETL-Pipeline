Jupyter Hub too, you don't need it, it's just a collaboration tool and not sure why it would be recommended to use. Jupyter notebooks yes, but Jupyter Hub? MLFlow makes sense, orchestration is important, and I have never use Feast but I feel this section doesn't tell me what I want to know in this context. You list different AI models, which is also a bit awkward considering how much they change, but why not list ML models like Tensorflow Keras or XGBoost/Catboost? \n\nTo be even more honest, I don't think your audience will get past the first row of tools. If somebody is looking at this to learn, they'll stop there because why bother with the other tools when AI and vibe coding can do it all?",

But for “frontend data engineering”, as i call it, the data is all there, but you’re just finding the data with optimized queries and transforming and loading into a dashboard or whatever. For some, that’s enjoyable. For me, not so much. \n\nThen “backend data engineering” is more storage, modeling, and infrastructure. \n\nYou can def up skill with tools like spark and airflow to automate some of those processes. Those skills def transfer to “backend” data engineering a bit more. \n\nAlso, use Python.",

You can find software engineers specializing in multiple different specificities but they’re still someone who writes code to solve a problem. Same for DEs: they write code and design systems to solve data problems. Analyzing data and working with business requirements around data systems is also part of it. Creating reports can also be part of it (although that’s more of a data analyst thing in my opinion).\n\nGenerally you will find multiple different realms of data engineering when looking for jobs. To me it sounds like you need to be more specific with yourself about what exactly it is that you are interested in within DE (is it writing Spark ETL jobs? Is it writing SQL pipelines? Is it working with Kafka/streaming systems?) and then filter your job search based on that.",

We started with accounting data, because it was the cleanest and slowly migrated the data silos into centralized database. If we met any resistance, we told them that if they wanted their data reflected in the monthly report, it had to come from the centralized database. Since the report was highly visible, they had to agree and after some initial growing pains (mostly historical data cleanup and arguments about what to name things), the automation and built in error-checking won people over. \n\n\nI've worked with a lot of organizations since then and most of them don't have the demand or the inter-departmental communication necessary to break down data silos. It sounds good in theory but if the marketing team only cares about marketing data and doesn't mind getting financial data a month late, then why go throught the considerable time and effort to build a third system to combine marketing and financial data? Especially if after the system is created, you have train people on how to use it, how to keep the data clean, and how to maintain the 3rd system. ",

That way people can just query the Parquet file to get link(s) to where they can download the dataset.\n\nFor the DGUIDs, I have to be really careful. I don't want to say that I have modified any statistical information, so I have emailed Statistics Canada with the blog post I made, so hopefully they address some of these issues. I could do the fixes on the client-side and call it **backfill-dguid**, so the user is aware they are back-filling the field.\n\n**Edit:** For the DGUID I want to experiment with linking to Overture Maps, as they have boundaries on places/divisions. They have something called GERS \\[4\\] that I can link to, that is a stable ID throughout time. Look at the interactive table that I sent you, there's tons of data from outside of Canada, they just have no idea how to link it to statcan data.

With that stack you can pitch yourself as a senior who happens to be deep on Microsoft rather than a mid-level up-skiller. Main point: layer modern tooling on your existing strengths and you’ll stay competitive.",

Both of them offer a free account for testing with limitations (Databricks daily limit, Snowflake also limited 30 day trial but you can create a new account later). Databricks notebook / compute environment is very similar to Fabric so that's what I'd recommend.\n\nAlso pandas isn't really appropriate for any of these environments as it not parallel compute optimised (the whole code ends up running on the driver node). You may end up working with some code some data scientist wrote in pandas but you likely shouldn't be writing it from scratch (although pyspark does have pandas api on spark which is mostly cross compatiable). All of these platforms have a variant of SQL and I've found data teams who migrate from on-prem to cloud tend to prefer using it as they're not as comfortable with python, but you could also familiarise yourself with pyspark which will be relevant for both Databricks and Fabric.\n\nFor loading data, I would get comfortable with e.g. using spark.read() for either append, overwrite or merge. Beyond reading CSV, look at reading/writing parquet and look at processing e.g. JSON files and handling semi-structured data operations (e.g. exploding on list elements) as you will often need to ingest from APIs with this structure and then flatten it for a reporting requirement.\n\nI would also familairise yourself with data platform design patterns, e.g. Databricks medallion architecture. In practice companies will implement it in different ways but it's worth getting comfortable with teminology and how it's generally applied:\n\nhttps://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture",

They're fine tools for other situations, but it's very likely you can accomplish everything you need already using using just the features of SQL Server.\n\nPersonally, I'd prefer to get everything to one server which you can do pretty simply with either Replication or Log Shipping (though there's other options too).

Once that slice feels solid, adding purchase or inventory tables becomes copy-paste instead of redesign. Airbyte’s plug-and-play extractor will get the first two tables moving, Fivetran could handle the ERP later, but DreamFactory still helps me expose a couple oddball legacy views over REST without extra drivers. Keeping scope to two tables forces me to learn the full path and keeps rework cheap-exactly what I need right now. Vertical slices first so I can learn fast without drowning in scope.",

        "body": "There's a lot of good questions here to unpack. I work in this area, so I can give you an overview.\n\n**What is real time? Is near-real time enough? (tldr; question)**\n\nThis is defined differently for different use cases and there isn't one definition for this. \n\nFor example, the definition of real-time is different for real-time operating systems (think RTOS) or high-freuquency trading (they literally measure cable lengths to minimize propagation delays) and other use cases. For data engineering, \"real-time\" rarely means milliseconds in my experience, but is very often seconds and even minutes, depending who in the org-chart you talk to. \n\nThat said, a lot of large-scale compute workloads we see often do end up in the milliseconds. The most common place I see those is in the security space, but their setups don't resemble a typical data engineering environment. Instead of CDC, Kafka, warehouses and ETL jobs, you will see transactional workloads, APIs, and processes directly talking to one another over HTTP.\n\n**Complex transformations (2)**\n\nIt's historically been pretty hard to pull off but that's changing. The foundational work/papers to do this at scale is fairly recent (I'd say, last 2-3 years), so it's not surprising you haven't seen off-the-shelf solutions here that live up to the promises.\n\nFundamentally, to compute in real-time, you need to be able to compute \"incrementally\". That is, update views over your data in real-time by only observing how the input tables \"change\" (inserts/updates/deletes). No batch engine (like the ones you mention, Trino, Spark etc) can achieve this, because they are designed from the ground up to recompute queries from scratch, which gets slower as the data size increases.\n\nFor an actual incremental engine, I encourage you to give [Feldera](https://github.com/feldera/feldera) a spin (disclaimer: I work there). It let's you define pipelines as tables and deeply nested views in SQL. When the tables \"change\" (get inserts/updates/deletes), the views are updated incrementally. The guarantee is that the amount of work a pipeline does is proportional to the size of the changes, not the size of the overall data. It's main strength is that it can do such incremental evaluation for **arbitrarily complex SQL, including recursion**, not just simple queries (as you seem to have noted about alternatives).\n\nWhat this means is that pipelines do so little work per event, that it routinely hits the millisecond timescales in real-world workloads (users have even reported 4ms latencies to keep views over terabytes of data, with low tens of milliseconds being more common). Of course, it depends on the queries, the arrival rates and what not. But we do see users run some beastly pipelines that update at sub-second speeds over billions of rows (think 10K line Spark SQL code, with 100s of joins, distincts, aggregates, and what not).\n\n**Infra bottlenecks and processing delays (1, 3)**\n\nYou are spot on here, but not due to actual hardware issues (modern hardware is ridiculously fast and if anything, most software and cloud infra sucks at taking advantage of them). NVMe storage and modern CPUs can pack quite the punch.\n\nWhen it comes to building real-time systems **end-to-end** however, you might still end up in the seconds to minutes range, even if the analytics/compute side is instanteous. This is because most data stores and plumbing infra aren't built for high volume real-time ingest (i.e., they cannot handle inserts/updates/deletes to data).\n\nFor example, if further downstream of Feldera, you want to serve the results off of something like Delta Lake, you have to incur the additional latency from having to run Delta Table merges before you can serve this data. We have (painfully) seen pipelines update complex views in milliseconds only for things like Delta Lake and Kafka to add another minute afterwards. There are of course ways to architect around it, but it does take a lot of custom systems work (see the security industry context I mentioned earlier).\n\n**Hype vs reality (5)**\n\nThere is a tremendous amount of hype and marketing here. Don't believe any vendor (including me :)) -- reality about this space is that it is quite nascent, and whether you can hit the right operating points around scale/latency/throughput does depend on your workload and the laws of computational complexity at play. Throw your worst queries and most challenging use cases at them before you make a decision, rather than believe any hype.",

Most reporting & dashboards can be 5-30 minutes old with minimal impact. \n\nAnd 5-15 minute latencies allow you to do all the same stuff you would do with a daily process.  Works great.

They expected nothing to touch protobuf over gRPC, much less have xml over rest beat it so badly.

Some other comments here have covered it -- matching things by name or by address, rather than by concrete id values.\n\nNot only does it need a variety of fuzzy matching approaches, it also requires domain knowledge to understand what types of fuzzing can be used rather than just plain string distance. You want to know how to parse things like addresses or names into components, with different rules for different types of addresses/names. You want to figure out which aspects can be ignored or moved around, or can have specific changes.\n\nEven when you have it working well, it is still only 90%, and the last of it is always a continuous manual process of fixing things that didn't quite work, and your rule set just can't handle the subtleties that a person can manually implement.\n\nA great annoyance is the business looks at it and thinks 'this is easy for me to figure out, why can't you just write an algo for it? it should be easy' - not understanding how trying to implement all the nuance of human understanding is impossible.

I won't get into them here, but say for instance Fuzzy Matching is involved. Sometimes the fraud team will keep these secret since if folks were aware of the nature of the detection analytics they could circumvent them. I'm referring to sophisticated stuff you can't really do this in PowerBI, not basic calculations or lookups. \n\n- If this access is absolutely necessary, the fraud team should make every effort to limit who on their team can view the data, they should have procedures for granting access, and document who has access and who approved it, ie I wouldn't advise a \"free-for-all\" but I would be pretty upset if PII was restricted. \n\n- I had access because I was one of the 'trusted few' at the company. I was maybe one of 10~ employees out of 100k employees who had the level of access needed to conduct this work, the others being legal, the CEO, CFO, etc. There were maybe 50+ other folks in my org, but the PII was masked for the rest of the employees. They could download aggregated statistics from dashboards, but not the PII or row-level data. \n\n- You may want to involve in-house Legal. Anytime I granted access to the raw PII data, we involved legal. \n\n- There are excel-level controls, like encryption and security, you can tell the team must be enabled anytime they send an email - we did this as a policy. There's no real way to enforce it, but we'd always encrypt the emails and the excel file if we ever shared it. \n\n- On that note, aren't there controls in your company which monitor the sending & sharing of Excel documents? ie if it is ever exported to a flash drive or printed? \n\n- Speculating here - I think Microsoft has a data governance tool, Purview, which might detect things like PII containing columns and restrict the sharing of the excel report? Might want to look into that. I briefly used it but can't speak to its applicability or effectiveness in this situation. \n\nJust my thoughts - could also maybe learn from them exactly what procedures they need to do in excel and see if you can design queries to handle it? I could see the financial industry being a bit more sensitive than where I worked so, these controls might not be enough.",

Row-level policies masked PANs to last-4 unless the user had the fraud role, and even they got an auto-expire token after 24 h. Every extract got watermarked with the ticket number so leaks were traceable.\n\n\n\nIf your stack is mostly Databricks, hook the VDI to Delta Sharing or Power Query so analysts still build pivots. For quick looks, spin up a Squirrel SQL style web viewer that limits results to 10 k rows.\n\n\n\nI’ve tried Immuta and Privacera, but DreamFactory slots in nicely when you need to expose just a few masked endpoints to vendors without opening the whole lake.\n\n\n\nThe safest move is to isolate Excel in a monitored sandbox instead of banning it.",

For uncached ad-hoc queries, set a hard timeout and ask clients to batch. If you really want to squeeze the VPS, move the Parquet layer to a Trino or DuckDB service and only ingest the hot partitions into Postgres nightly; that keeps storage and vacuum overhead low. I kicked the tires on Hasura and Postgraphile, but DreamFactory ended up easiest when I needed a quick autogen REST layer with per-key RBAC.

I don't really recommend it for most use cases. \n\nConnections and editing in Grafana is a simpler experience but it has its own annoying quirks (the plotting UX is underwhelming and has weird data transform abstractions that I find myself fighting with rather than enjoying) and it's generally not as flexible as I would like it to be. I don't use any of the advanced alerting features. I'd like to, but I haven't figured them out yet. My favorite part of Grafana is the units and formatting support, it really is nice and convenient. It's not great, but it's better than superset.\n\nNiFi gets a lot of hate, but I am a firm believer in \"there's a time and place for every tool\". The time and place that NiFi was developed for was the NSA. A lot of the stuff that it was good at was classified and got dropped when it was published. Now, Nifi is good for moving data around from point to point, not data transformations. You'll want something else for more advanced data transformation, such as something with real scripting language support (nifi's code editor sucks ass. Basic user interface tasks are also hidden behind different context menus and it's a pain to use, generally. The JOLT processor advanced interface is pretty good though). It is however an okay tool for setting up long-running batch processing jobs from your database to something else where you want to have visual feedback. I set up a number of web scraping flows with it (not really a good use case) and I'm looking to migrate to something that sucks less.\n\nDagster and Airflow are the NiFi alternatives you'll want to consider. I have used Airflow in the past, and am considering moving some of my existing data transformations to Airflow.\n\nI have no complaints about Postgres. Postgres owns.",

For instance, triggering a maintenance request from an IoT dashboard, generating a marketing cohort from a customer analysis report, or manually triggering a data refresh.\n\n3) \"Adjustments and Corrections\". Manual adjustments for reporting made to separate tables and \"rolled up\" in the BI solution.\n\nThrough integration with Power Apps, Power Automate, and third-party solutions these have been available in Power BI for a long time.  The introduction of Fabric User Data Functions, and the integration with Power BI reports just brings this capability into the product itself.",

They can also update a CRM through its API endpoints, but that's not too different from doing so in any other CRUD apps, and your average analyst won't have the necessary permissions nor skill to handle authentication to use those endpoints.\n\nIn a larger context, the unmet need this feature is trying to solve is a common one: analysts often get asked if they can add some kind of write-back to their reports, such as documenting decisions, comments, events. If you end up working somewhere that has such a need and that extensively uses Power BI and Fabric, using these can be a great quick solution for enforcing clean data entry without having to build a full CRUD app, and it clearly beats using spreadsheets with no data validation for inputs.",

This allows you for partitioning, clustering, grant RBAC, ...\n\nIn the last 20 years more complicated file types have been enforced in data engineering, like Parquet (think of it as a self describing CSV which has an header with column names and data type) and Iceberg.\n\nI don't know if this answer your question but to recap basically you need to combine a query engine with a metadatastore to have a complete database/datawarehouse otherwise you can only transform data from point A to point B.",

Without a metastore, you'd check storage directly.\n\nBut if the table not already existing doesn't affect the required logic, you can just write in overwrite or append mode without the need to handle table existence. Either will implicitly create non-existing targets.\n\nFor pure DDL operations (just creating a table, not writing any data), if you're using the SQL API then `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` [is available](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-syntax-ddl-create-table-datasource.html).\n\n> can add some parameters to your query to do it ?\n\nYes. Notebook widgets (not advised, notebooks are poor code artefacts), script or function arguments. But you may want to pin this to the runtime state (or lack of) of the target table, a config value, or some combination of these.\n\nTypically what Spark code for data warehousing \"looks like\" is some sort of workflow orchestration using a DAG, in something like Luigi/Airflow/Dagster (and/or dbt), which will invoke stuff (scripts, notebooks, dbt runs) as needed and with the required parameters.\n\nYou can totally run dbt against Spark, the connector is [officially supported](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/spark-setup).",

        "body": "> do modern BI systems need an analytics Database\n\nTechnically no, in practice yes. \n\n\nThe reason is that productive systems like ERP are built for recording transaction data, i.e. a fine-grained log of events and facts. Technically this translates into lots of short-lived requests to the system, e.g. \"store this order\", \"lookup this invoice\" etc. That is, the system load per request is low. \n\n\n\nThis is different for analysis oriented queries, where we typically want to show aggregate results, e.g. \"order volume in the last 3 months, grouped by product / region / customer segment\" or \"show \nall customers who's order volume over the last 3 months is less than their average over the previous 12 months\".\n\n\nThese aggregated queries require a different data model, at least a different set of indexes v.v. the data model for the transaction system, aka operational database. Of course it's technically possibly to run these aggregate queries against the operational database directly, however it will strain its resources and potentially result in bad performance for end users.\n\n\nAnother aspect to consider is that the data needed to answer these kind of queries often span multiple systems, e.g. orders are tracked in one system, invoices in another. That is, we have to combine data from different systems, which is notoriously difficult (as in requires dedicated effort) unless there is an infrastructure that supports it.\n\n\nWith this in mind, it is easier to build a seperate database that is optimized for aggregate queries, and does not interfere with the operational database.\n\n\nRegarding the argument against storing data multiple times: That's a very common objection and it sounds logical. You don't want arbitrary copies of data stored just about everywhere - that's a valid concern. However, the need to serve analytics demands are equally valid, and following the above line of argument, they require a different technical setup. So there's a trade-off between avoiding data duplication, and the need to have well-performing systems for both operational and analytics needs.\n\n\nThey key is to build the analytics database (whatever you call it) by a controlled and managed process, that is the data is not stored arbitrarily, but the process is designed to keep the data up to date, the purpose of the duplication is to serve analytics needs, and there is ownership assigned.",

What they don't want is you bailing and taking all that  knowledge out the door.",

And of course, how will your code even know it's a cost field?\n\nHere's another example, say there's a string field - your code won't know if it requires an adjustment to some of your business logic.  Maybe it indicates a cost type?\n\nSo, if data quality matters, then it's best to have a data contract, and when the upstream system makes changes to that contract then you coordinate with them.\n\nMeanwhile, you can compare every record to the data contract to ensure that every row complies and you don't have any unapproved schema drift.",

All streaming pipelines serialize to Protobuf\n2. All Protobuf schemas are shared via a monorepo\n\nCombined you get quite a strong consistency model for data interaction at the streaming level. Protobuf is backwards/forwards compatible, and it doesn't care about the field name only its integer ID. That solves 99% of the data interaction mismatches.\n\nHaving said that you're still ultimately persisting to a database somewhere, and that part will require an unavoidable migration. This is where the hack-ish solutions are usually found. Usually here you either go with the slow-but-safe versioning approach or with a simpler 'all downstream services upgrade simultaneously' one. Or just don't rename a field unless there's a strong business requirement. Pick your poison.\n\n\nEDIT: there is actually a cleaner option for column renaming in *some* databases, though I personally haven't used it. You could create a new column that defaults to values from the old one. For example in ClickHouse you could do this:\n\n    CREATE TABLE example (\n        old_name String,\n        new_name String DEFAULT old_name\n    )    \n\nThis effectively creates an alias for the same field (at the cost of duplicated storage), and  you can then slowly deprecate the old field at your leisure. The caveat being that inserts into the new column won't be visible in the old one. I don't necessarily recommend going this route, but it would prevent going down the versioning rabbit-hole.",

Even something lightweight like duckdb or a cloud based pgsql could work, especially if you’re layering a BI tool or dashboarding solution on top. But that does add more setup and ongoing maintenance.\n\nIf not, and you’re mainly just showing charts or summaries from selected batches, then pandas might honestly be enough. You could just scan the folder, load only what’s needed based on the user’s selection, and cache results to keep things snappy. That keeps things simple and flexible, especially if your files aren’t massive.\n\nIf I were you I would first answer these questions:\n\n- How big are the csv files, roughly? A few MBs or closer to GBs?\n\n- Are the column structures consistent across files, or do they change?\n\n- Does anyone on your team need to explore the raw data themselves, or are you the one curating all the views?\n\n- How often is new data added to the data lake?\n\n- Are there any heavy computations or aggregations you’re doing often that would benefit from SQL?\n\nAnd then, \nOnce you know the answers to those, it’ll be a lot easier to decide if you need a proper database layer or if a well organised pandas workflow can get the job done.",

Cache the converted parquet once at ingest, store minimal metadata (batchid, path, row count) in a tiny SQLite file so you can list options instantly, and use Streamlit’s st.cachedata to avoid rereading the same files. When the data volume finally outgrows laptop RAM, you can point the same parquet set at a warehouse like Snowflake without rewriting code. I’ve used dbt for model builds and Superset for dashboards, while DreamFactory sat in front to expose quick REST endpoints for the same parquet files when we needed them in other services.

If you’d rather avoid code, point PostgREST at the database: views become endpoints, row-level security handles auth, and you deploy a single container. Supabase is basically PostgREST plus auth and storage if you need hosted options.

As a contractor, you have to pay the employer component of a number of taxes and other contributions, see below.\n\n\nUnlike full time employees, you are also taking on the significant risk of your contact not getting renewed at the drop of a hat. Contractors are always cut first when projects are completed or budgets get tight. Btw once there, don't let them death-march you to the finish line while only paying 40 hours per week with a promise that \"it gets better when we're done\". They will cut you off without remorse, I've seen it myself. That risk needs to get paid to reimburse you for any gaps between contracts spent looking for a new one.\n\n\nAll this to say it is customary for contractors  to charge significantly more per hour than a full time employee, between 50% and 100% more.\n\n\nThis recruiter is trying to pull a fast one on you because they sensed your lack of knowledge. Consider yourself informed, and use chat gpt to give you a professional phrase to let them know that you are aware that they are full of shit. Read below for details, and Google for employee vs contractor tax calculators to work out what your break even rate should be.\n\n\nhttps://accountinginsights.org/irs-worker-classification-employee-vs-contractor/",

It's very simple to learn: data exists somewhere, we extract it, we do things with it.  But there are 1000s of ways of doing this.\n\nSometimes even the engineers themselves are unable to explain how data hops from place to place, or why. I've found doing 'walk-throughs' of the data pipeline to be incredibly valuable, and they are easier to understand when someone sketches it out by hand on a white board or paper instead of just pulling up random scripts and expecting you to understand code with zero context. \n\nAnd, in general in the corporate world, always assume that every single person you're going to talk to is a horrible teacher,  gives you no context that you need, or does not understand the context you're missing.\n\nFor example, your first day you may sit down with someone and they will say \"we take data for daily crude futures, run it through our model, and load it into this report\" or whatever.\n\nThey will not explain why they are doing that. They might just assume you know what a \"crude future is\", how it helps the firm, why the data needs to be prepared a certain way, why they look at things with one language vs the other, etc.\n\nWorse, maybe they won't teach you at all. Maybe they know you don't know any of this stuff, and will not want to spend time teaching you.\n\nOne piece of knowledge or behavior you learn this year, when you're young, compounds for decades, so it is incredibly important and valuable for you to maximize the amount you learn. You do this by being annoying sometimes and asking dumb questions.\n\nVery, very often interns are terrified to ask questions, so, they often do  narrowly-scoped tasks and never understand what it is or why they are doing it.\n\nA healthier approach is to adopt the opposite mindset: be terrified of NOT asking questions. Anytime you feel the 'feeling' of confusion, it's a very good thing, embrace confusion, become addicted to it, since that feeling is actually your brain learning.\n\nNot being confused is a bad thing, it means you're overconfident, which will make you very dumb over time.",

We had Microstrategy for years and it liked a snowflake structure, which was a pain in the ass for us.  We moved to PowerBI where we could build a nice simple star schema, but things like ragged hierarchies can get complex as in the link below.  You may want to look for solutions to ragged hierarchies or whatever related to whichever BI application you are using.  We don't have a great need for drilling through hierarchies so we just went with L1, L2.... and the user adds the parent and child descriptive entities if they need that.\n\n[https://www.daxpatterns.com/parent-child-hierarchies/](https://www.daxpatterns.com/parent-child-hierarchies/)",

The merge key column is null fir these. Then I merge and update based on merge key = primary key and update the end date to close the old record and on the insert clause I insert everything from the second set.  This includes records with new keys and the latest version of records with existing keys. \n\n\n So when the merge key is matched then update and when it's null then insert.  You build the rows you want to insert and update in the selects in using clause.  Hope that makes sense.  ",

Retain the original address string, regex the zipcode out (there's probably one some mad bastard wrote out there) into the zipcode column, take the rest of the string and dump it out into the street address column.  You now have three columns: `original_address`, `street_address`, `zip_code`. Layer on top of that with more lookups for cities if you want.\n\nThe most advanced thing you can do is pay for an address API which will take your address as a string and then return where it thinks it is along with a confidence value.  Anything below a certain confidence value you review.",

Even with these instructions and all necessary context, LLM may fail to generate response you expect for questions like this.\n\nThis may sound a bit weird, but if you have limited number of questions like this, it makes sense to prepare a report (pivot table?) that answers on the question *precisely*. If you want to encourage end users to ask their own questions - which means creation of their own new reports - first of all you need to configure a data model (cube?) that contains all necessary dimensions and measures needed to answer on these questions.\n\nTaking into account *realistic* capabilities of modern LLMs, it makes sense to offer end users 2 kinds of prompts:\n\n* \"Ask question\" in the context of the concrete data model (facts + dimensions). LLM gets in the context lists of the available dimensions, measures, filters + instructions and maybe even low-cardinality dimension values. Result is a tabular report configuration (pivot table or flat table) with filters, which can answer on user's question.\n* \"Ask question\" in the context of the concrete report data. LLM gets in the context report's table data (which is reasonably sized and not is too large for LLMs context window), possibly with supporting instructions. This is a kind of assistance with data interpretation, instead of analyzing values in table users can simply ask smth like \"what is the best client by premium\" - and get an answer if this report has calculated premium values by clients.\n\nTechnically, with tools calling these 2 steps may be combined (LLM can compose a report, then load report's data, and give an answer), however this significantly increases a risk of wrong numbers in LLM response. In BI it is very important to get *right* numbers (not just maybe-yes-maybe-no numbers), so it is better to offer simpler but more reliable LLM-based functions.\n\nThis is how we implemented LLM-based functions into our BI tool recently, based on feedback from real users.

The \"terminal\" (or terminal emulator/tty/console) is the actual thing that you see on your screen that you can click and type in, and see characters on. Underneath that is the \"shell,\" which is software that knows how to take character sequences and interpret it as commands, and can then run those commands. If you type \"ls\" and hit enter, the terminal is what shows you what you just typed and the results, while the shell is the thing that was able to locate the \"ls\" command and run it. You can interchangeably use any terminal (e.g. iterm, konsole, ptyxis, ghostty, kitty) with any shell (e.g. sh, bash, fish, zsh, nushell).\n\nSSH, \"Secure SHell,\" is an encrypted server-client protocol for communicating with a shell on another machine. You still use the same terminal emulator locally, you still type in your commands and see the results. But behind that, instead of calling to a shell that's running on your machine (accessing your files, running your binaries, etc), you're sending all your keystrokes over the network to another box that has an SSH server running (called sshd). Then that SSH server acts sort-of like the terminal on that remote box, passing those keystrokes to the shell, which then runs commands on that machine (with their files, binaries, etc) and gives back the results.\n\nWhen devs say SSHing to another server, they really mean interacting with a shell\\*\\* on that server, from the comfort of their machine.\n\n\\* I'm simplifying a bit. Details @ [https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/](https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/)  \n\\*\\* Well, really SSH supports arbitrary data transfer. You can do port tunneling, send files over it (it's the default backend for scp and rsync), run GUIs remotely over a desktop gateway, whatever.

My favorite was modelling the \"sick hobbits\" problem: \"There are 1000 hobbits on an island. X hobbits begin 'sick'. Each day, any healthy hobbit travels to visit another hobbit. If a healthy hobbit visits a sick hobbit, the healthy hobbit becomes sick. At the end of the day, all sick hobbits are removed. On average, how many hobbits will become sick? On average, how long will the contagion last, how many days?\"\n\nOnce implemented, then vary it up by changing how many hobbits are visited per day, how long the sick hobbits stay around (maybe more than one day). This type of problem is good for learning because the code for it is just a page or two.\n\nBuilding programs into projects is another skill in of itself. To do projects, you need to start worrying about system design, modularity, testing, and more advanced debugging. So, start with something a lot smaller so you can get syntax, data structures, and control flow statements down. Then move on to larger projects where you'll then need to train additional skills. The issue with projects is that you're being forced to learn too much all at once, I suspect a person would feel completely lost.\n\nI'll hate to mention, but the 'easy' leetcode problems are generally good for learning programming language syntax and basics (again, the basics are syntax, control flow, and data structures). I busted leetcode out recently to help learn Python. I don't think leetcode easy problems are necessarily the best or the most interesting; but if you can't find or come up with similar problems to the 'hobbits' problem above, then leetcode could have some decent ones for training/learning.",

Companies had rooms full of manuals, and you had to look up, or photocopy, or buy your own documentation to know the api, usage etc.\n\nThen HTML arrived, actually IBM had another online format, but very similar just before html. At any rate, people who used the online documentation were more productive than those still reliant on paper, the change happened and today no one even considers having a paper copy of documentation (seldom anyway). The old guys were like \"What you can't remember that api?\". They were soon out-produced by the newer guys.\n\nNext came stack overflow, and other question / answer assists, and productivity increased for those that used it. Soon, it was required knowledge if you wanted to be competitive. Again, old mentality guys said \"You don't already know that? You have to look it up?\". Again, outdistanced soon.\n\nI'm sure you get the pattern. \n\nAI is the next documentation tool. This time the \"example\" code it provides is even closer to what you need.

When I see \"Agree\" or \"Disagree\", but they make similar points, then they have a different understanding of what they thought OP said.\n\nOK, so I'll start. I think OP believes learning a bunch of languages just to learn them is not good, at least, not at the start. Instead, pick a language, and begin solving problems, and not just learning how to write \"Hello, World\" in a dozen languages. \n\nOP did suggest that learning new languages didn't teach him more than Javascript did, but he admits that maybe some of that was failing to take a deeper dive in any of the languages.\n\nI don't think OP is saying every language is the same, but if s/he is saying that, I disagree.\n\nAs an analogy, this is like saying, what's important about learning a spoken language is what you want to talk about, i.e., the ideas, and not the words you use (which depend on language), and yet, you can be well spoken in English and don't know how to say the same thoughts in another language.\n\nWhy is it challenging? Natural languages like French or Japanese have a huge vocabulary compared to the syntax of a language. In particular, verb tenses are tricky for most. On top of that is learning the grammar, Is it subject-verb-object? Also, pronouncing words is really hard. Many non-Chinese speakers struggle with the tones in Chinese (assuming they don't also speak a tonal languages). On top of that, there are cultural differences, slang, whether to speak in complete sentences or to drop certain words, etc.\n\nProgramming languages don't have that complexity. But to say they are all the same is also wrong. For example, if you know Javascript well, but tried to learn Prolog, you'd struggle trying to find equivalent concepts. Prolog is that different from Javascript.\n\nHaving said that, I generally agree with the basic premise which is learn a language well enough to solve problems. Don't learn a bunch of languages early on, esp. superficially where you can't solve problems in any of them.\n\nMy minor quibble is the language does matter, at least, to how you think about a solution. Doing OO programming where you create classes and objects differs from doing procedural programming where you don't do that. That also differs from doing functional programming. You need to adjust how you think about programming. But in a sense, it doesn't matter which style who pick, just pick one and don't keep switching languages to know a bunch of them at a surface level.",

The industry has already enough of this kind of dev and has (had?) insatiable hunger for mediocre workers.\n\nIf one wants to gain more insight though, one needs to get in contact with other languages and how they work and solve problems in them. Then out of the specific experiences with different primitives to work with, one forms a more educated overall picture and expertise.\n\nDon't obsess, alright, I agree, but don't assume, that because you have used Java, Python, JavaScript or another mainstream language for a couple of years, you know all there is to know. There is tons you don't know and there will always be tons you don't know. What matters is, that you continue learning.

I was not allowed to learn about some advanced computer programming topics, but someone else \"learning HTML\", that was OK. Only that I learned HTML a long time ago, at school and over time I mostly kept myself informed about what new stuff is there. I have no need of learning HTML. It is something so basic, that I would be wasting my time doing that. Knowing HTML is such a widespread thing, that it is not even anything to boast about. Yet I was denied learning, because silly middle management did not have the capability to understand the impact of the things I wanted to learn. The perspective was always short term, and they let their own lack of experience and knowledge limit what others are allowed to learn on the job. It was completely dysfunctional.\n\nI think many people in this situation would not have energy left to then learn more in their free time. That is, if they were into being a developer out of passion and learning about computational processes, and not just for the good pay. We have too many of the not passionate devs in the industry, who will jump on any hype train, as long as it pays well, messing up project after project, and being lauded for it by incapable management.\n\nMany will continue to mess up projects, introducing unnecessary complexity at many turns. Management usually doesn't realize this, because they have no proper understanding of the detailed implementation ideas and what their consequences are. Or the ever-present silly phrases like \"80-20!\", \"YAGNI!\", balblabla, which are weaponized to cut against developer concerns. You are a ticket machine! We want you to be a small cog, that we can easily replace with the next generic developer!\n\nThey are not able to distinguish between someone really knowing their stuff and someone just going with the first best idea that \"works\" (until the next requirement change, when they have to adapt their half-assed solutions again). Developing computer programs without \"programming oneself into a corner\" is a valuable skill, but also a rare skill.",

There's a reason people say to start with tic-tac-toe or a TODO app. Building something small and self-contained is great \n\n2. Piggyback off of existing projects. Clone some open-source repos down, poke around, see how much you can understand. Pick something small and cool to rebuild as much as you can, using the repo as a reference. That way you can see how code is built and used in the real world.\n\n2. Tutorials can be really useful, but don't just build what's in the tutorial. Change or add \\*something\\* so that you can apply what you've learned.\n\n3. Maybe controversial, but I strongly recommend preferring text tutorials over video. I've found that text has a number of advantages. It's more similar to reading documentation. You can easily jump around back and forth without needing to rely on timestamps or trying to skip back and forth on a video. And I'd argue that reading long tutorials helps flex the muscle of quickly filtering relevant from irrelevant content, which is important when troubleshooting and searching for relevant documentation, browsing reddit and old Stack Overflow posts (if that's even still a thing) and even when chatting with an LLM and figuring out if it's hallucinating or giving you outdated information",

You need to decompose the problem recursively until you arrive at lots of small problems with trivial solutions.\n2) Just go and implement it. If you don’t know how to do something in a given language, google it and you’ll be fine.\n\nI’m working on my chess engine right now, and this process has made a problem with no obvious solution (at a glance) decently easy to solve. The important thing is to start with something very small, and with each project you make something bigger. You wouldn’t go to the gym and lift something ridiculously heavy on your first day, you need to build up to it.\n\nAlso, good luck with university!

Having a problem to solve, understanding the requirements, and partitioning the solution into manageable chunks are some of the more difficult tasks when participating in any project. Right now, though, programming seems like the hard part, because it's still new. Over time, and with practice, you'll begin to develop the fluency you need to confidently express your ideas in code. Like learning to ride a bicycle, one day it's all just going to *click* and you're not even going to realize it's happened until you're cruising.\n\nYou still have a lot more to learn in CS, and it's probably going to get harder before it gets easier. Use that to your advantage! Take everything you learn as an opportunity to practice writing code. Way back when I was in college, I wrote my own collection of all the data structures and algorithms I learned; reinventing the wheel not only helped me to better understand what I was learning, but it gave me lots of practice.

Great engineers can communicate complex ideas in simple terms. They adapt how they explain things depending on who they're speaking to and what the context is.\n\nI’ve been conducting interviews in Big Tech for a while now, and here's what I look for: when I present a problem, a strong candidate asks questions and engages in a real discussion about how to approach it. That back-and-forth tells me more about their ability than the actual coding exercise. In fact, in most cases, I’ve already made up my mind before they start writing code. The coding just confirms it. It’s incredibly rare that someone struggles to design or explain a solution but somehow writes brilliant code. Communication and reasoning come first.",

Its a continual gradual process that takes years and as soon as i took a break, a lot of the specific details started to fade. Its challenging but can also be enjoyable. When I was in it, and something I was working on did what it was suppose to do and all the pieces worked. That was exhilarating. Not everybody is like that though. Maybe for others, its no big deal and it starts to make sense right away but it didnt for me. Id definitely give it a shot if I was you.

Whichever editor you choose though, just make sure to record whatever config setup you end up with so you can easily spin it up again in the future (e.g. dotfiles repo). Between the two I prefer neovim, but that's mainly because of the kickstart project that provides a neat baseline config.\n\n  \nMe personally I stick to vscode with the vscodevim plugin most of the time.

So in Python you expose a web server using something like Flask, which when queried with a web browser serves a file containing HTML depending on the route (path in browser) and method (GET, POST, etc). The advantage here is that you could use a template engine like Jinja2 to serve dynamic content. The old TurboGears framework (yes I'm that old), Flask, or Django are commonly used with python, PHP is another commonly used one using the Laravel framework for example.\n\n2. API driven, here you serve endpoints (routes) with a web server and various methods just like with the server side rendering but instead of serving HTML you serve some other machine readable media formats like JSON, JSON-RPC, XML, etc. You then combine the \"backend\" with a frontend website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that calls your backend routes and then utilises that data to change the front end. React, Vue, Angular, (Ember if you're old), or more raw JQuery, are tools/frameworks to help you do that.\n\nProbably about a third of all the programming information on the Internet is about how to do this, how to get started in it, etc.",

Essentially, your backend program is responsible for preparing data to be consumed by the browser in some form or another. The simplest web program might look like this:\n\n    print('<head><title>Hello</title></head><body>Hello, world!</body>')\n\nThis can be run by telling your web server to run this script as a CGI program. This is not a modern recommended practice for several out-of-the-scope-of-this-discussion reasons but it's great for educational purposes. The idea is, you set up your web server to serve any given route by running this program and then sending the output to the client. Using this example, Python itself isn't handing HTTP requests, the web server is, and it's adding additional context that can be accessed through environment variables or even reading STDIN to handle posts, etc. \n\nOnce you've got that, you can start doing more clever things, like mapping out endpoints and having the browser make asynchronous requests to those end points to dynamically update already-loaded pages.",

In whatever language you've chosen, learn as many built-in functions (and operators, syntax, etc.) in that language as you can (with the theoretical goal of learning all of them). New programmers often make things harder than they need to be on themselves, because they don't realize all of the tools that the language offers (and they try to write extra utilities themselves, or reach for code from the Internet or third-party packages, when the language already offers a helpful tool built-in).\n3. Just like how when you're at the gym, you don't do each exercise only once and move on to a new exercise, apply the same approach to coding. Once you get your code working, start over from a completely blank slate, and try to do it again. See if you can look up even a *little* less than you needed to look up last time, or if you run into a little bit fewer bugs than you did last time. You'll find that once you do something five or ten times, you have a *way* deeper understanding than you thought you did after you only did it once.",

It's to develop new circuitry in your brain for thinking about computational problems (which you do by *the process* of writing code, which code assistance can skip, so you get the right answer, but don't develop the brain circuitry).\n\nI also find that (good) books, in general, go far more in depth and provide far more insight than most other mediums for learning, which tend to be shallow and focus on low hanging fruit. Even AI is going to be mostly low-hanging fruit, as it's basically a compilation of all the blogs and reddit posts and tutorials that are out there on the internet already.\n\nIf you want something other than a book, CS50, which is basically (good) book quality in video format. Very rare.\n\nAt the end of the day, technology has changed, but our brains have remained almost unchanged the same since the advent of modern computing. You can't cheat building up those circuits in your brain to develop new ways of thinking -- you need to learn, try, make mistakes, and learn again.

Decide what works best. \n4. When making a decision or a trade-off (for example to make a function static or not, or to use a particular data structure), explain to yourself why you are making the decision that way.  Consider adding that as a content.  \n5. When you change your mind about a decision or trade off, figure out if you're doing it because (a) the requirements/constraints changed, or whether you just had incomplete information, or (b) you made the weren't decision at first.  If (b), think about how to make a better decision next time. \n6. Look for opportunities to collaborate with other thoughtful programmers.  Ask for feedback.  Think about it when you get it. \n7. Extend these ideas of feedback and improvement to the other activities too - design, documentation, architecture, and so on. Even choice of language. \n8. Read code.  Read books.  Compare to your own work and experience.  \n\nIterate: observe, consider, adapt, repeat.\n\nBasically, improve your skills by practice, evaluation, and iteration. \n\nPractice alone won't get you there -  you have to do enough thinking to get as much benefit as possible out of every learning experience.",

It's far more important to come up with a good solution than to come up with a clever one.\n* Second, nobody sees a problem like that and just immediately knows the solution. You have to figure it out. Figuring it out might mean experimenting, trial and error, going back over things you learned before, going down dead ends, taking a break and coming back to it later, or even asking for a tiny hint here on r/learnprogramming\n\nThe most important thing is that you need to persevere longer and not just peek at the answer. It might take you an hour, it might take you a week. But if you force yourself to keep trying until you get it, you WILL get better.\n\nOn the flip side, if you give up and look at the answer, you will never learn to code.\n\nGo back and try again. Don't expect your solution to look anything like that solution. Don't aim for any specific length. It might be 3 lines of code, it might be 30 lines of code. Just try to figure out a solution your own way.\n\nAnd again, if you're completely stuck and you've made zero progress for more than an hour, post what you have so far and we'll give you a tiny, tiny hint.",

To print your pyramid, you just need to go step by step.\n\nsomething like:\n\n    for each line \n      print_line\n\nThen how do you print a single line ? Well there a bunch of space before, a bunch of \"o\" in the middle and then we go to next line so the code become:\n\n    for each line \n      print_spaces(numbers of spaces)\n      print_stars(numbers of o)\n\nNow can you do print\\_spaces and print stars ? Well we just need to repeat the same stuff the specified number of time, something like:\n\n    line = \"\"\n    repeat for numbers of spaces\n      line = line + \" \"\n    repeat for numbers of o\n      line = line + \"*\"\n    print line\n\nBut to be more concise, we could write as well:\n\n    line = repeat(\" \", number of spaces) + repeat(\"o\", number of o)\n    print line\n\nwhere repeat would repeat the string the number of time we want. That's not so different than\n\n    line = \" \".repeat(number of spaces) + \"o\".repeat(number of o)\n\nor even:\n\n    print \" \".repeat(number of spaces) + \"o\".repeat(number of o)\n\nNow how many number of stars we have per line ? From the solution it's:\n\n    Math.floor((i * 2 - 1 - row) / 2)\n\nTo really get it, we would need to understand what i and row are as well as floor. But you can likely come with you own way to count the spaces.\n\nFrom your pyramid, to me it look like there zero space on the bottom pyramid and 1 the one before, then 2, then 3. So it like the (max line number) - (current line number) - 1 So the whole for me would be\n\n    for I in range(0, max_line - 1)\n      num_spaces = I + 1\n      num_o = max_line - I - 1\n      print (\" \".repeat(num_spaces) + \"o\".repeat(num_o) \n\nor\n\n    for I in range(0, max_line - 1)\n      print (\" \".repeat(I+1) + \"o\".repeat(max_line - I - 1) \n\nAnyway, what I try to explain to you that you go step by step, trying to solve a complex problem by dividing it in smaller problems and solve each sub problem one at a time.\n\nIt the same even for the Math.floor method you would normally have constructed it step by step.\n\nAnd yes maybe repeat was introduced too fast in their example of maybe, the Math.floor was not well introduced. They gone too fast and you are lost now.\n\nBut doesn't mean you could not do it on your own with smaller learning step and couldn't master all that with enough training.",

Because you've put that in quotation marks.\n\nSadly creativity was always or has become almost a meme, because (as the other posts confirm indirectly) it sounds like some kind of superpower for almost anything, from programming and maths (\"multiple way to solve a problem\") till songwriting and visual artwork (doesn't even need any argument for those...does it?).\nBut actually creativity is something so abstract that one could write philosophical essays about it (no irony here). And in my experience most jobs, even the more intellectual ones (or maybe especially those) have the cliché that they give you freedom of how-to-do-this-task, no monotony but possibility to be even creative, and so on.\nMy experience is that sure some people are lucky and get their visions and wishes related to their job satisfied and most things are as great as they expected, but that's unfortunately more exception than a rule...\n\nI studied chemistry for few years and how did I learn for maths, physics, chemistry modules etc.? By f-ing REPEATING various catalogs of \"questions/tasks that can be asked in the exam\". That's frustrating and I'd hope less people would have to work and especially to learn this way (because it's one of the heaviest turn-offs imo).\n\nBefore I drift off into more pessimistic stuff, one thing I can tell you as a (hobby-)musician and occassional painter that aside from let's say 0.1% of the population who have superpowers, top genetics and were raised very effective & without any damages, creativity is a bit like natural mutual attraction (\"love\") - you can't enforce it. Still you want to achieve it, how you should do that?\n\nBy doing certain activities, which you have to find out for yourself, what fits for you somehow, the newer and the more they differ from each other, the better. Just try things out you wanted to f.e.. You will gain experience, expand your conciousness (literally & still in a natural way), the more contrasts you can gather and experience, the better. Nothing is true, everything is permitted!\nAnd by automatically building new associative nodes & connections in your neural system / \"soul\" through this gathering of new experiences, by natural passive (\"background-process\"-)learning you will already make one step after the other on the way to more creativity. Will, patience and time - I know, we all need especially the second one, but it's possible :)\n\nA bit untypical my whole post, but I hope this gives you some inspiration and new thoughts. I wish you success and optimism for your goals and your future.",

Yes clever code works, that's a big part of why it's so good, but is it readable? Toy projects and leetcode solutions are basically things you do once then barely touch again, so using this kind of code is acceptable. However, code in the real world has to be constantly maintained by several developers. The piece of code that you wrote today should still be understandable to you when you read it 6 months from now (and you've forgotten all about it) and understandable by your teammate who has never worked in that part of the code and maybe has never even met you.\n\nSo your plain loop solution would still be good, and some might argue even \"better\" than the clever single liner.",

But it's rarely (i.e. almost never) important to have the \"perfect mathematical solution\" to a given problem, even assuming one exists.\n\nFor this particular problem, I would personally look at the pattern first. How many spaces do you need to print at each row, if the pyramid has a height of 4? Do it manually first in a text editor: 3, 2, 1, 0. Now, what if it has a height of 5? Manually in a text editor: 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.\n\nNow do the same for how many \"o\"s you need to print. That one is a little easier. It always starts at 1 and then it always advances by 2, to count out all the odd numbers until the pyramid is done: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ....\n\nSo in this situation I would say that the \"goold ol' C-style for loop\" is easier to understand in this situation. Luckily JavaScript supports that style of loop:\n\n    // Pretend that height comes from the user.\n    let height = 4;\n    // Starting out the pyramid with an initial \\n so that it looks\n    // nicer inside the JS Console.\n    let pyramid = \"\\n\";\n    let ohs = 1;\n    for (let spaces = height-1; spaces >= 0; spaces--, ohs += 2) { \n        pyramid += \" \".repeat(spaces) + \"o\".repeat(ohs) + \"\\n\";\n    }\n    console.log(pyramid);\n\nSome people won't like that style and will prefer a more \"functional\" or \"mathematically correct\" style. But at the end of the day your job is to solve whatever problem you have, in a way that is easy for you to understand and which is fast enough. The above solution is perhaps less \"elegant\" but it gets the job done and it's usually easier to debug code like that than to debug code which is too much in a functional \"mathematical\" style.",

It gets you through the first door.\n\nNo matter how good you are or how many projects you have done, it won't matter if you don't get past the LeetCode rounds. It is sad and absurd but it is what it is. Of course there are companies who don't ask any LeetCode problems, but I would say those are on the rare side as I've seen so many startups still ask LeetCode to filter out the high quantity of applicants.\n\nSo I suggest you start prepping for LeetCode a little bit every day alongside your projects.

I think this is just one of those things that is true of programming in general, regardless of where you learn it, and being resilient and willing to do your own research goes a very long way. Nobody is going to provide you 100% of everything, and that's true even of college courses, etc.\n\nI've also found that the AI chatbot the site provides is extremely helpful not only in guiding you towards the right answers, but also explaining the underlying concepts. I'll say that with the caveat that the other day, it set me off on completely the wrong path and I spent like three hours trying to write this whole crazy method that could've just been a for loop haha",

        "body": "I have the following \"algorithm\" for reading a programming book:\n\nStep 1. Read through the book \"leisurely\". This is somewhere in between skimming and reading in detail. In this phase, for example, I would make a mental note of technically heavy parts (e.g. code examples) but would not go through them meticulously or line by line.\n\nStep 2. Go through the book a second time and make a listing by chapter of what \"things\" need to be done to really study it. For example, which examples should be tried out. What additional exercises should be done. Questions that I have (which could be answered by writing a program, for example). Other \"what ifs\" that come to mind (e.g. what if I try Y instead of X in this example).\n\nAfter step 2 is done, then basically I have a sort of \"todo list\" of sorts for what I actually need to \"actively do\" to learn that material \"for realsies\".\n\nStep 3. Go through the list that I made in step 2 and actually do those things.\n\nSuffice it to say that \"Step 3\" is what takes the most time and it requires the most concentration. I've found that I can do either step 1 and step 2 in a variety of environments, for example, even on a bus -- but for step 3 I need to be focused, e.g. in a \"library\" type of environment (people around me are quiet and concentrating).\n\nFor step 3 (\"implementations\") I need to use a good development laptop or workstation to actually work on the problems that I assigned myself (sometimes I will draw stuff on paper as well, e.g. diagrams or organizational notes) or that were assigned from the book author. Step 3 is sometimes \"unfinishable\" for me in practice because I tend to write \"too many\" little experiments to myself, or in the course of doing them I realize that it's no longer worthwhile to do some of them. In practice, when I'm doing step 3 I will make a little \"checklist\" to keep progress:\n\n\\[ \\] (123) foo: Implement foo example from chapter\n\n\\[ \\] (146) bar: Implement bar example from chapter\n\n\\[ \\] (146) \\*bar\\_rvalref: // Can bar example be redone using rvalue references?\n\n\\[ \\] (146) \\*\\*cmdline\\_calc: // Create a simple command-line calculator (e.g. calc 1 + 2 \\* 8 should output 17). Output goes to stdout. Also accept \"\\[\" and \"\\]\" as synonyms for \"(\" and \")\" if it is not ambiguous. E.g. x\\[5\\] is unambiguously an array indexing operation, whereas 7 \\* \\[1 + 2\\] is a grouping operation and equivalent to 7 \\* (1 + 2).\n\n\\[ \\] (146) \\*\\*\\*cmdline\\_calc: // Modify the calculator so if given the switch --arm, then the calculator also outputs machine code that would perform the same calculation using ARM instructions (output instruction set: ARM v4T without using Thumb instructions). Run the resulting machine code output via QEMU and verify that the result calculated in the emulated machine is identical to the desktop version's output.\n\n...\n\nIn my notation I write the page number reference in parens, and I use a \"\\*\" mark to mean \"it is a level-1, i.e. fairly easy exercise\", \\*\\* to mean it is a more involved exercise, and \\*\\*\\* or more to mean it is an \"advanced\" exercise.\n\nThe stuff after // is my explanations of what I want to do or experiment on; it can be somewhat vague because it is probably based on the example in the book so if I reread that part of the book, then what I wrote should make more sense.\n\nThese \"checklists\" work fine on paper (in fact I prefer them not to be electronic), but for the actual \"stuff\" that I am doing it is mostly a program and is mostly electronic (i.e. I just create something in a text editor or IDE). If I'm following a book with chapter 1, chapter 2, etc. style then normally I'll name subfolders with the chapter number and the topic, e.g. ch3\\_pointers, ch4\\_memory\\_management, etc.",

I have done that before with hard to reason about code bases with dynamic, interaction-based and hard to understand flows and it was surprisingly useful. It might make less or more sense in your case, depending on the context.\n\nPerhaps there are also static analysis tools for whatever language/application you're dealing with that can visualize modules, module members and relationships between them. I have also written custom tools for that for my code base and it was also quite useful, but it's a bit much. Besides that, I'd say perhaps don't sweat too much about it unless there's a good reason and let it come to you organically, as you work through the issues and features (hopefully, gentle at first).",

One of the keys to programming and software design is learning how to break the big overall goal into smaller goals. Then solve those and get them working individually, then stitch them together. \n\nSo for example if you want a stock analysis and trading platform, start by modeling the price of a stock at a given instance of time (a single bar, whether that's a day, an hour, a 5 minute interval, whatever it might be). Then build an overall history that accumulates those individual pieces, maybe give that the ability to calculate analyses like EMA, stochastics, or whatever. \n\nThen model a portfolio that can track buys, sells, profit/ loss, etc of individual stocks. \n\nThen build something that will fetch historical data from an online source and build up your historical data. Might also need that to analyze the data for cleaning: find holes, potential anomalies, normalize for splits, etc. \n\nI'm not familiar enough with crypto to know the analog, but hopefully that gives you a way to begin. \n\nPython would be fine for this if you're not planning to do real time analysis. If you want something that can analyze data in real time, you're looking at C, C++, Rust, Zig, or something else that's a systems level language.

They allow you as the developer to control the way your class is interacted with. In the field, you'll rarely be writing code on your own. Most of us work on projects with at least 10 other people touching the code that we write, and on code that other people wrote. You won't always have the benefit of knowing exactly what was going through the authors head when interacting with a class. Also... after a few months or years you won't know what was going through your own head.\n\nSo, consider a scenario where a class has a static object in it which is critical to its function. Say.. an in memory data store or cache. Nearly every public function in the class calls this object and it would be really cumbersome to check for initialization in every function call. Plus, that leaves room for error. You or another developer later on might forget to check. But you could define it with a getter that checks initialization and executes lazy initialization if its not done. Now that initialization logic exists in one place, and you never need to worry about checking for initialization when using the object. And you don't have to worry about some other developer down the line writing dangerous code into your class that forgets to check initialization.\n\nSimilar with constructors. You can use the constructor to perform logic that **must** be done before the class gets interacted with. Go grab some service dependencies, initialize some variables, warm up the cache, whatever you need.",

However, one case I am currently using right now of a more complex getter is that I have to retrieve the firmware information of a co-processor that talks to my primary MCU application over a serial connection. I request that information and cache it when the program starts, but if I call my version getter and that value is invalid for whatever reason (firmware update, mainboard resets, etc) I can spin up the serial port and request the info again, then return the new information or an error code. \n\nFrom the application perspective, I am just getting the firmware version and it doesn't really concern itself with how. I don't have to almost ever change that code, and it can be reused in other places so that if I ever change how the firmware version is retrieved, it's in one spot and makes my job much easier. Likewise, if for whatever reason getting that information stops working, I know exactly where to look which saves time with debugging.",

Yes you could, and you often do if you want to be able to return a failure code.  However when you don't need to return a failure code, it's less typing to just initialize in a constructor.\n\nOne area I've found setters as being really nice is lets say you have a variable that should only be a number between 0 and 10, and you have a bug where it's being set to 100007.  How do you figure out why it's being set to 100007?  With a setter you can put a break point (or a conditional break point) in the setter, then trace up the stack to see where and why it's being set to 100007.\n\nAs for getter, unfortunately with java if the variable is public then if it can be got it can be set.

More on that at the end.\n\nPresumably, in a real (not a learning exercise) program, many of your variables have constraints that require validation, eg can a person's age be negative or higher than 200?  Can their name contain unprintable characters or whitespace like tab?   These constraints are put into the setters, and signal an error if the attempt to set them to an invalid value is made.  Getters protect data that the user can see, but should not change.  For example, with the person, you can maybe look at their address when making a map of your customers but this is not an appropriate place and time to be changing the values -- a getter can provide a look without letting you accidentally modify it.  To modify it you must deliberately call the setter rather than just an oops side effect on a free wheeling variable. \n\nBut when the getters and setters do nothing, and they often will,  their only purpose is to keep it consistent.  These 10 values have getters and setters and those 5 do not in class A,  those 18 do not and 11 do in class B, .. C, D, E, ... after a few classes, remembering which variables in which classes have getters and setters is overwhelming.  If you just assume they all have these functions and use them for everything, its that much less burden on the programmer.   They also abstract validation: when using them ALL of your validation looks the same:\n\n    while( !class.setter_for_variable(new_value) )\n    { \n        display bad input message()\n       new_value =   get new input from user ()\n    }",

It might make the code look better, something like:\n\n    switch(command) {\n      case 1 -> generateRandom();\n      case 2 -> generateWithLength();\n      case 3 -> generateWithLetter();\n\nand so on. But it is a matter of taste.\n\nYou could benefit from making a single method for reading a valid number from the input - something like: `getValidInput(int[] numbers)` that would only return one of the numbers in the array, or zero if something else was entered by the user. That would isolate your use of scanner to that method alone, and make the rest of the code easier to write without having to handle exceptions or different invalid inputs.\n\nIt is always a good idea to have a lot of small methods that only do one thing - my own personal rule is that if I have more than two levels of if-statements or loops, I need to make a method to combine them.

You define `dCons` as an array that contains 40 elements, which is perfectly fine.\n\n2b. However, later on, when you *use* `dCons`, your code looks like this:\n\n    dCons[random.nextInt(40)]\n\nHere, you have explicitly hardcoded the length of `dCons`. In the future, if you ever manually edit your code to change what is in `dCons`, you will need to update *two* places in your code — 2a and 2b. That's not good, because it's important that those two places in your code stay in sync.\n\nInstead, it's better to remove the hard-coded length in 2b, and have it *read* the length, via something like `dCons[random.nextInt(dCons.length)]`. This way, if you ever manually edit your code to change what is in `dCons`, you will simply need to update *one* place in your code, and everything else will automatically adjust.",

Your electrical background is actually a huge advantage. You already understand complex systems, troubleshooting, and working with detailed specifications. That kind of logical thinking translates really well to programming.\n\nThe fact that you've already played around with TrueNAS, Linux, and Docker shows you're not starting from zero. Don't downplay that experience, lots of grads don't even know what Docker is when they start.\n\nAt Metana we've had students from all kinds of trades backgrounds make successful transitions. What I've noticed is that people with hands on experience often do better than traditional CS grads because they understand how to build things that actually work in the real world. You don't necessarily need a degree for most programming jobs, especially in Canada where the tech scene is pretty good. Companies care way more about what you can build than your educational background.\n\nThe ADHD thing might actually be an advantage once you find your groove. A lot of great developers I know have adhd, that hyperfocus can be incredibly powerful for debugging and problem-solving.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you want to chat more about specific learning paths or what the job market looks like right now.

It absolutely does not matter which one you choose as long as it isn't completely obscure, or something like COBOL. The fundamental concepts are all the same in every language.\n\n\nI started with Ruby, learned C# through my first job, now work in C#, JavaScript/TypeScript.\n\n\nI'd recommend you start with JavaScript (alongside HTML and CSS) as you can use those 3 to build interactive web pages and get immediate feedback and a sense of achievement, which is big when self-teaching, especially for ADHD folk. Also even if you work in any other language, if you're working on a web page in any capacity, you will almost certainly need JavaScript so you might as well know it, even if you end up not using it as your primary language. \n\n\nFor where to get started, The Odin Project is a great resource to get you on the right track.",

As some have said, a CS degree is probably your best bet if you have the time and money to commit to it. Otherwise there are other options that can still lead to a good paying tech job. I completed a 2 year web dev program at an accredited college(I chose to do it online but I recommend in person if you can) and was able to qualify to apply for tech positions with the GOC. I’d recommend looking into some job postings and deciding if you can see yourself doing some different tech roles just to broaden your chances in the current job market.\n\nI second the Odin Project as a nice start but I’d also recommend looking into other courses that interest you on Udemy(never pay full price for these, they go on sale all the time!) or Coursera before you commit to paying into a degree.",

A typical place to draw this line is at the edge of well defined objects in your domain\n\nLayers help you stick to solving for certain implementation problems related to a subset of the technology. Some common layers are\n- data store \n- data access or orm \n- domain or business logic\n- api\n- presentation \n\nWhat I've found is that the edge seems to be a bit wider in the presentation layer than what you want for the domain layer and to do that you sometimes want to inflate the boundary in the data access layer, but this can introduce problems with the domain layer\n\nA good compromise is to create summary types which you can refer to in the presentation layer without having to load entire objects\n\nHappy to talk through this stuff.

Second, a lot of those people are successful programmers who are good at what they do, so in a sense, they're correct. You can be a good programmer and be bad at leetcode.\n\nI would say, though, that the reverse is far less likely. There are far more good programmers who are bad at leetcode than there are bad programmers who are good at leetcode. For interviewers, this is usually a good trade. Sure, the leetcode arbitrarily filters out some good talent, but it also effectively filters out bad talent. Not all, but most. A person who has gotten good at leetcode is often pretty passionate about programming. \n\nProgramming is a wide field. There are people whose jobs look a lot more like leetcode problems. It's also critical to understand the basic tools you would use for leetcode. You should develop a basic intuition for time complexity. I always think that working on improving at leetcode problems will make you better. To get really good, you need to have a deep understanding of the language and everything happening under the hood. \n\nBut there are really 2 factors here: getting good at solving difficult problems, and getting good at optimizing simpler problems.

So that alone means a 1/32,000,000,000 chance that the bit flip happens in the location that your data is stored.\n\nSo the odds of a bit flip happening during your calculation and landing on the memory location where your data is stored is 259,200,000 x 32,000,000,000.  Which is:\n\n1 / 829,440,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000\n\nOh and keep in mind this increases depending on how high above sea level you are.  Cause science and all.",

You'll normally never it in personal computers, because it's much more expensive; but for certain critical applications, a company or agency may decide to pay extra for it. ECC guards against memory corruption due to spontaneous magnetic flips in the physical storage medium, mostly from background radiation. This is not limited to, but includes cosmic rays, for which reason spontaneous bit flip increases with altitude and is worst in satellites (as u/MediumRay said). And of course, if a bit has spontaneously flipped, that bit could represent a variable in a comparand, or for that matter an operand.\n\nHow real is this problem as opposed to merely theoretical? Well, as I said, it's not enough of a problem to be worth fixing in personal computers, but still a concrete enough problem for there to be a manufacturing sector and a market for ECC RAM. People out there are paying a lot of money for this stuff, and probably for good reason. So in certain applications, it's a possibility real enough to pay money to mitigate.\n\nI don't think choice of language should be expected to have any effect. Ultimately an opcode is an opcode. The way to fix it is to buy ECC, not to program around it.",

There may be a tool that organizes the classes for you that I’m unaware of though.

Build 2-3 full stack projects that solve real world problems. Don’t just build your cookie cutter todo app. \n\nYou should come up with an idea or a problem you’d like to solve in your own life, and then create an app around it. This alone will distinguish you from the masses that have the same generic todo app projects on their portfolios. \n\nYou will stand out as a legitimate developer if you do this. Also, make sure the portfolio website you put your projects on looks great and professional.\n\n2.) Any time you write code - commit it to GitHub. You will want to put your GitHub link in your resume and portfolio website so that employers can go look at your code. Make sure you can explain what your code is doing during an interview.\n\n3.) Apply to 10-20 software development jobs a day. Curate your resume and cover letter to each job description (use GPT to speed up the process).\n\n4.) Network like hell on LinkedIn. Reach out to anyone and everyone who works at a company you’d like to work at. Ask them for 15 minutes of their time for an “informational interview” and at the end, politely ask them to refer you. Or reach out to recruiters directly. Show them your projects. \n\n5.) If you land an interview - research their company and take a few days to build out a prototype app that is relevant to their company. Showcase it during your interview. This will make you stand out like no one else. It shows that you’re ambitious and will go the extra mile. \n\n6.) Be proactive. You can’t fail if you go hard at all the above every single day. The above 5 steps should be your full time job until you land a job. It might take time - but you’ll land something eventually - in fact it took me almost 2 years to land a job after learning how to code and following the steps above after 6 months of coding. So don’t give up.\n\nBonus tip: Never think that a job is below you. If you get an opportunity that sounds shitty but it’s software related, take it - because you will be able to build credibility to add on your resume which will help you land that dream job much easier down line.\n\nFirst dev job I took was a shitty TA gig at a coding bootcamp. Paid $11,000 annually. I did it for a year, leveraged the experience on my resume and landed a $70k gig as a junior developer 8 months later.\n\nEdit: I don’t have a degree in CS.

I'm also in Toronto, also a front-end-biased full-stacker. There's a fair bit of meetups for JavaScript, front-end, web perf. Go to them. Be seen there. Meet folks, talk about stuff, try to learn and show all the cool stuff you're building. Worse comes to worse you meet some cool new people, best case you start getting tips.\n\n\\- integrate your projects with the LLM companies APIs. Considering how popular these tools are in tech right now, you'll have a bit of an edge over people making boring boilerplate apps. If you want to be hired, working with these APIs will look good when you're demoing your work and show you're on the cutting edge.\n\n\\- Don't let doomers discourage you. Tech is a very boom-bust industry. The dot-com bust didn't kill software development, the latest trends won't kill it either. Get good, show your passion and you'll stand out over a sea of apathetic grads who are just in it for the six-figure payday.\n\n\\- Lastly, most importantly: only become a front-ender if you genuinely love it. Programming and software development are one of the best jobs in the world, but after a post-pandemic big tech hiring boom we're seeing massive layoffs and salaries are shrinking. It will still pay well but you need to set expectations and be willing to find a smaller place to skill up. I got my start working in a creative advertising agency, then was able to pivot into software.\n\nSource: BA Psychology+bootcamp grad, worked in the industry for a decade now.",

It's really nice to see someone trying to clarify something about the interaction of the language with the environment it's running in.\n\n`scanf()` is not moving the cursor.  The OS is.  Well, the terminal application is, with the help of the OS (and possibly BIOS).  It turns out that the cursor advances all the time.  Like when you type in the command to compile:\n\n```\n$ _\n$ g_\n$ gc_\n$ gcc_\n```\n\nAfter each character typed, the cursor advances (most of the time).  But terminals are very complex things.  Suffice to say that the terminal--with the help of the OS--manages receiving keystrokes and \"sending them\" to the application.\n\nIOW, the terminal receives the keystrokes.  It does what it usually does; advances it when you type a character, retreats it when you type backspace, etc.  Then, after it does what it needs to (though there are exceptions, like what happens when you press `Ctrl-C` on a Unix-like machine), it tells your C program: \"Hey, someone pressed a character, here it is.\"  Then, you do whatever you're going to do with it.\n\nIt's somewhere from \"a little\" to \"way more\" complicated than that in realities, but that's the general idea.  Just to finish this up, the complexity can come around buffering, which is how many character the terminal and OS will hold before sending them.  If it sent every character, one at a time, that could be inefficient, so sometimes terminals and OSes buffer.  Generally, in terminal applications, hitting `<enter>` will force/suggest the underlying bits (terminal, OS) to send the data to the application.  Also, it's the terminal that decides to move the cursor down (newline), and then return to the left-side on English/Western locales (carriage return).\n\nIf you're curious about how terminals work on Unix-like machines, check out **Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment** by Stevens, often abbreviated \"APUE\".",

        "body": "In a traditional environment with a serial terminal connected to a remote computer, keyboard input to the terminal is sent to the remote computer to be handled as program input, and output from a program is sent from the remote computer to the terminal for display.\n\nMost of the time, the cursor is placed after the last output character sent from the remote computer.  Sometimes other characters change the cursor position, like a carriage return moving the cursor to the beginning of the current output line, a line feed moving the cursor down one line, a backspace moving the cursor backward one character, and other special escape sequences can move the cursor in other ways (such as to a specified row and column).\n\nAlso in most cases the operating system terminal driver echoes characters input on the terminal back out to the terminal.  This may happen automatically in the terminal driver without the remote program having to do anything, but the terminal driver can also be put in a mode where automatic echo is disabled and the program must deliberately echo input characters if it wants to.  A text editor, for example, may set non-echoing mode so that editor commands are not echoed when they are typed, and instead output from the editor program displays the results of performing the command.\n\nThe terminal driver in the operating system usually also handles input in line mode, meaning that an entire line of characters followed by a ENTER is buffered up and made available to the program after ENTER is pressed.  But the terminal driver can also be put into a mode where every keypress from the terminal is immediately available to the program, rather than being held and sent when ENTER is pressed.\n\nIn modern computers the terminal is often a program that emulates the behavior of a serial terminal, because the serial terminal model is so pervasive for managing program input and output.\n\nIn a simple program, output to the terminal is what moves the cursor, so calling scanf() does not cause the cursor to move, and if the terminal driver is in its normal mode of echoing input, it's the echoed output of input characters, or output from the program, that moves the cursor on the terminal",

C is a bit unforgiving, it totally lets you shoot yourself in the foot and C++ lets you do the same, except that your entire leg is gone afterwards.\n\nBeware of any mention, that C++ and C# are just supersets of C. That might have been true very very early on, but both have diverged from C quite a bit, some things just work differently.\n\nFind a resource, that teaches C with a proper focus on how to write secure code, having to debug undefined Behaviour, memory leaks and segfaults is no fun if you just came from python. Personally I like the book \"Effective C\" by Robert C Seacord. Despite the name, (effective LANGUAGE usually means advanced in a lot of programming books) it is written for beginners, but it is well written, up to date and doesn't make stupid errors where the example code won't even compile (surprisingly common).\n\nThen, once you have a grip on the language, implement various algorithms, like the problems on [projecteuler.net](http://projecteuler.net), reading and processing some files, playing with raylib (since you came from gamedev with godot). The best way to learn C is writing programs in C, but they need to be small self contained things that compile cleanly and pass through valgrind cleanly. But most importantly, you need to understand various concepts of C first, otherwise the compiler will be like a girlfriend you forget to feed.\n\nIf you have a sound understanding of computer science, you might read the K&R book, but it is written for seasoned programmers that just don't know C, yet. It is from a time when Programmers already went through college and might had a PhD or a Master at minimum, home computers and self-taught coders weren't really a thing yet. It assumes that you know how computers work, potentially already have programmed in some form of assembly. It's more of a historic document than a valid learning resource. Don't get me wrong on this, it's a great read and you definitely should read it at some point in your learning journey, but it isn't the *best* way to learn C, anymore.",

So unless you stick entirely to Python you'll get to see the C syntax (pun intended).

        "body": "Flags can be used for more then just loops, for example as a condition for an if-statement:\n\n```\nvoid some_function_that_takes_flags(Flags flags) {\n    if (flags & SAY_HELLO) {\n        std::cout >> \"Hello!\";\n    }\n    if (flags & INTRODUCE_SELF) {\n        std::cout >> \"I am an example.\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis function can take multiple flags as parameters thanks to some clever bit manipulation.\n\n\n'Flags' could be a type of 8 bit integer:\n`0b0000 0000`\nWe can make each of these bits repesent a flag of its own:\n```\nFlags SAY_HELLO = 0b0000 0001;\nFlags INTRODUCE_SELF = 0b0000 0010;\n```\n\nNow with some bit manipulation tricks we can test if one of these flags is on:\n```\nFlags flags = 0b0000 0011;\nbool sayHello = flags & SAY_HELLO\n```\n\nThis translates to:\n```\nbool sayHello = 0b0000 0011 & 0b0000 0001;\n```\nThe '&' results in a unison of the 'flags' and 'SAY_HELLO': \n`sayHello = 0b0000 0001`\nSince this is same as 1 as a number, and because C++ sees all numbers above 0 as true when converted boolean, sayHello = true.\n\n\nNow we can have 4 combinations of flags being either on or off:\n```\n0000 0001 & 0000 0011 = 0000 0001\n0000 0010 & 0000 0011 = 0000 0010\n0000 0000 & 0000 0011 = 0000 0000\n0000 0011 & 0000 0011 = 0000 0011.\n```\n\nThe function can be called like this:\n\n```\nsome_function_that_takes_flags(SAY_HELLO | INTRODUCE_SELF);\n```\n\nSince both flags are included, the function says hello and then introduces itself. We could leave either flag out of the call, of course:\n\n```\nsome_function_that_takes_flags(SAY_HELLO);\n```\n\nNow this function call only says hello.\n\n\nThis way of using flags improves code readability compared to having multiple separate booleans as function params. It also enables extending the list of options very easily without having to go fix a thousand different calls to the said function.\n\n\nHope this explains it. I haven't written C++ in a long while, so my syntax might be a bit off.",

An example is std which rather than being on/off sets your c++ standard to 17 or 20 or 23 or whatever else.\n\nSometimes an integer used as multiple flags is still called a flag, though its bitwise treated as up to 64 individual boolean/bit values.\n\nSo while the term OFTEN refers to single bits, it does not HAVE to, and it does not even have to refer to a 2 state toggle, but can represent the state of a multi-state (eg left/right/forward/reverse) entity.   And they can control anything that can make use of a condition, from a switch to a loop and in some languages, even a computation (eg in C++ you can use the false==0, true == 1 in a computation to zero out a term: its valid to say integer = 3\\*x+2\\*y + 42\\*(x>0) ) to conditionally add either 0 or 42.  What is common to all of it is that when you hear the term 'flag' you usually should think 'optional configurable/alternative behavior'.",

If you just go into the gym and start throwing weights around, you might get a bit stronger, but you're likely to do a lot of things wrong, be inefficient with your time, and get injured. A (good) book on weightlifting can teach you principles, routines, and instructions for how to do exercises safely. But of course, if you *only* read and never set foot in the gym, merely reading won't get you stronger. It's when you combine the two—the principles and routines from books, and the practice from going to the gym—that you get good results.\n\nThe same is true with programming. Read good books to learn the principles and techniques, and then build projects to get practice with those principles and techniques. In fact, some of the best tech books include a ton of exercises for you to do so you that get practice while you read.",

My method:\n\nWhen I learn a new language I do stuff like Edabit first, maybe two weeks of 1-3 hours a day, just working thru the difficulties. I move up to leetcode easy. The point is to exercise my very meager skill in the new lang with tiny, manageable problems.\n\nLater once I feel bored, or like I'm wasting time with the ease of the problems, or I want a greater challenge, really any negative dull non-transient feeling, I move onto building a very small program. Usually it solves an imaginary problem, but if I could do something I could conceivably use (still small!) I try to do that. \n\nThis approach avoids Tutorial Hell, where you are stuck in analysis paralysis. Bite off small manageable pieces, increasing somewhat linearly in size but with variation in difficulty.\n\nYou can ask me if you sense utility here and you'd like more guidance about the method.",

Maybe you're writing your own method like FindAll. Maybe the yes/no question isn't a one-liner so you want to split it out.\n\nIn those cases, it's helpful to know about Predicate.",

        "body": "To add to what u/dmazzoni said, `Predicate<T>` is just an alias for `Func<T, bool>`, a function that takes an argument `T` and returns a `bool`.\n\nYou can write it as:\n\n```\nFunc<int, bool> isGreaterThanTen = x => x >= 10;\n```\n\nAnd it will work.\n\nAnother use for these is if you want to swap in a function depending on some logic.\n\n```\nFunc<int, bool> isGreaterThanTen = x => x >= 5;\nFunc<int, bool> isGreaterThanFive = x => x >= 10;\n\nFunc<int, bool> filter = someCondition ? isGreaterThanTen : isGreaterThanFive;\n\nList<int> higherThanTen = numbers.FindAll(filter);\n\nforeach (int number in higherThanTen)\n{\n     Console.WriteLine(number);\n}\n```\n\nAnd these come in handy when dealing with methods that do things to a similar set of arguments, and have some sort of controlling input.\n\nYou can assign class methods to Funcs if the type arguments match. Note that the last type argument of a `Func<>` is the return type. \n\nSo `Func<SomeObject, SomeOutput>` matches a method `SomeOutput MethodName(SomeObject arg)`\n\nSo instead of multiple ifs or switch statements, you can do something like this:\n\n```\nDictionary<string, Func<SomeObject, SomeOutput>> handlers;\n\nvoid Init()\n{\n    handlers.Add(\"A\", HandlerA);\n    handlers.Add(\"B\", HandlerB);\n}\n\nvoid Handle(string value)\n{\n    if(handlers.TryGet(value, out var handler))\n    {\n        var output = handler(input)\n    }\n    throw new ArgumentOrOfRangeException(nameof(value));\n}\n\nprivate SomeOutput HandlerA(SomeObject value)\n{\n    // Do something for for value A...\n}\n\nprivate SomeOutput HandlerB(SomeObject value)\n{\n    // Do something for for value B...\n}\n```",

If you store it in a variable, you only have to change it in one place.\n\nA predicate is just the data type of a lambda expression that takes one parameter and returns type boolean.\n\nIn this particular example it’s unlikely that you’ll ever need to change the predicate for testing if a number is greater than 10, but imagine you’re developing a game with an inventory system that can be filtered in different ways. You may want to use a predicate variable so that you can dynamically switch what method is being used to filter the inventory.",

If you want to learn Web Development for example then I can say the Odin Project is a fantastic free resource. Almost everything I know about web programming I learned from the Odin Project. However, there is one important point you need to know when starting this journey. The motivation you feel right now will disappear, usually around the time when you can't solve some hard problem or can't fix a bug or you are trying for hours and don't get anywhere. Programming, especially once you can actually build cool Apps yourself can be very rewarding until it's not and you question why you even started. Just don't give up when you get to moments like that. Also don't let AI solve your problems. You might think you learned something if AI is doing the work but you actually didn't. If you gonna use AI then use it to ask questions about a concept you don't understand but don't vibe code your way to an app as you won't learn anything this way.",

        "body": "Oh boy. I'm a physicist and I have been programming since 14 and always did all the coding in my research group projects and am now a fulltime software developer since 5 years. Disclaimer: this is just my personal experience.\n\nWhat is really funny is that everyone assumes that physicists suck at coding. I have heard \"you're good for a physicist\" so many times, but I actually take it as a compliment. Most physicists don't care and want to make a throw away program. That's fine but if you want to learn how to make software that lasts longer than a single day, you obviously need to do something very different. I never really learned that systematically, I just kinda wanted to write stuff that was useful later, so I just naively tried to structure things more cleanly. I spent lots of time reading tutorials, reddit, other peoples code and whatnot. I did read \"Clean Code\" a year or so ago, and I thought it was ok but much is learned by trial and error, writing lots of bad code, rewriting it slightly better, changing the scope, trashing it again, and so on. Practice, practice, practice. And build nontrivial things, not just toy programs. If programs get big, you MUST apply some structure. I think you need to feel the pain of being stuck and then digging yourself out of that hole.\n\nSorry for the ramble, your post kinda resonated with me. Let me know what you think",

Soft skills are all about interaction with people and are very useful in the work place. They will help open a lot of doors regardless of industry. People in IT regardless of field have a very bad image with most people because a lot of us lack basics like conversation skills or team building. The old joke of a coder locked in a closet because no one wants to deal with him is what a lot of non technical people think of IT related jobs.\n\nLeadership skills are also very useful regardless of if you want to get into management or not down the line. Every project or team needs someone to lead it, why not you? It also helps with dealing with different levels of management. Something I learned a while ago is leaders don’t just lead those they are responsible for, they also lead their managers on up as well. Of the two this one has been very useful since I started developing it. \n\nAs for how to learn them; soft skills are mostly about interaction with people on a regular basis. Help desk jobs are great for learning them but going to classes about anything you are interested in person is a great start. Just get a conversation started and keep it going. One big skill to learn is active listening. As for leadership I can recommend a couple of books to get you started if you are interested.",

Feeling unsure about what to do next is completely normal, especially when you have multiple options in front of you.\n\nSince you mentioned interest in both full stack development and software development, here's a simple breakdown:\n\n# 1. If you want to become a Full Stack Developer:\n\nStart with web development. It's beginner-friendly, highly in demand, and offers a clear path. You can follow this roadmap:\n\n* HTML → CSS → JavaScript (vanilla)\n* Then move to React (frontend framework)\n* Learn Git/GitHub for version control\n* Then go into backend: Node.js + Express\n* For databases: MongoDB or PostgreSQL\n* Build real-world projects along the way\n\nThis path gives you visible, hands-on progress and prepares you for full stack roles.\n\n# 2. If you're aiming for general Software Development or Big Tech:\n\nThen continue with C++ and go deeper into Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). Companies like Google, Amazon, etc., focus heavily on problem-solving and core CS concepts. Your path could be:\n\n* Strengthen your C++ fundamentals\n* Learn DSA topics: arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.\n* Practice on platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces\n* Study core CS subjects: OS, DBMS, Networks, OOP\n\n# Still confused?\n\nTry both briefly spend a week or two on web dev, and then a week on DSA. See which one excites you more and where you feel more engaged. That’s usually a good signal for what path to follow.\n\nYou're not behind you’re just in the exploring phase, which is totally fine. Stay consistent, build small things, and clarity will come. You've got this!",

That was equivalent to all of Europes working games sector numbers at the time.  1-2% were hired on graduation. \n\nI would suggest that what we see now is bad but it’s more in line with historical trends than what we remember from 5-6 years ago. \n\nIt is probably still not as bad as it was around 2001 where there was practically nothing to apply for let alone competition.

As. you already mentioned, it can fail due to different regions having different requirements.

I typically value the decision making of my leadership on these kind of things.

Your focus should be on adding value rather than making sure you are getting “credit” for every thing you do. HR would tell you that is what your compensation is for and you can document on your self-assessment for your performance review. I would never utter the word “credit” again as this all transpires.\n\nHaving said that, this is a wonderful opportunity and quite flattering for anyone, never mind someone early in his career. \n\nI would suggest writing a lengthy email about your concerns. You can start it with, “As the architect of this process ….. it has come to my attention… and in order to ensure maximum success…. I want to make everyone is aware xxxxxxx” List the important stuff, like why you think this won’t scale and why each instance needs to be customized. But offer fixes to the problems as well. How can this be customized so that it does work for other departments? What work effort would be required? Be specific and as lengthy as you need to be, as you will be saving them time and possible embarrassment. Also, if it doesn’t scale, you could end up being blamed, (“who created this in the first place”)\n\nSend your email to all interested parties and cc: your boss. Again, make sure the email is emotionless, fact-based and solely focused on you trying to help the company and the team to succeed. Of course, this also serves as your documentation that you are the originator.\n\nTry not to assume the worst in people. You created something so good that an upper level manager thought it was good enough to scale to other departments. The higher up managers are, the less they know about what is happening on the ground, so don’t take it personally.",

Trump is the one who passed the bill to make that all happen.\n\nNow onto the BBB, the long and short of it is, it's likely going to tank the value of the dollar. Increased government spending (practically across the board), less taxes, more borrowing.\n\nI genuinely say this as a die-hard fiscal conservative: This is ***not*** about Trump. This is ***not*** about party politics. This is about the value of the dollar, and how it plays a key role in global international politics.\n\nThe USA is going to have a Brexit-level fall off.

But everyday the threat of it all being taken away is too much. I think it’s either I jump ship now on my own terms or they make we walk the plank later.\n\nAnd to those that say that once you have FAANG your life is easy and your resume is set, tell that to the people laid off and still can’t find jobs. I’ve been in contact with folks at my company since they first started layoffs in 2023. I personally know a couple of people who this summer are moving back in with their parents because they can’t land a job. That’s with my FAANG company in the resume. No it’s not Amazon or Meta. I know some with families who were forced to pack up and move across the country. I know some who got laid off after moving. I know some who can’t move their families so they have to fly across states every weekend just to be with them on the weekends. I know some who went from making 300k+ to around 150k - 80k. \n\nI don’t want to cause any alarm. But there are my personal anecdotes. I always try to keep in touch with coworkers, it’s just something I do. Yes, there are some who managed to land jobs at other high paying companies. But I’ve noticed that these people are either really smart or went to top colleges (Stanford, Cornell, MIT, etc). I went to a shitty state school and for the most part I’m severely average. Do I really want to be constantly grinding for the rest of my life? I’ve been interviewing candidates for the last 2 years. The level of talent is insane. These kids who only graduated like 3-4 years after me are such sweats, they can solve these leetcode hards like it’s nothing. I can’t even pick an easy or medium question for them anymore.\n\nSorry for the rant.",

Even people with solid backgrounds like yours are getting ghosted left and right. It's not a reflection of your worth or abilities, the hiring process is just broken in a lot of ways.\n\nSomething I've noticed works better than the traditional apply and pray approach is  that you need stuff people can actually see and touch. Your GPA and internships are great but recruiters want to see what you can build. Even small projects on GitHub that solve real problems can make a huge difference.\n\nAlso, have you considered bootcamps? I know it might seem like a step backward given your background, but sometimes the structured approach and job placement support is what breaks through. At Metana we've had people with CS degrees who just couldn't crack the interview process, and the hands-on training plus career support made all the difference.\n\nThe other thing is, what specific roles are you targeting? Sometimes pivoting within tech (like from pure SWE to product management, technical sales, or developer relations) can open doors that weren't there before.\n\nYour education definitely wasn't wasted even if it feels that way right now. Those problem solving skills transfer to pretty much anything. But I get the frustration, job hunting is soul crushing.\n\nTake a breather if you need to, but don't give up just yet :) The market will turn around.",

What I’ve nearly always encountered is a flexible work schedule such that everything is good as long as I’m available to attend meetings and work my hours within the week or pay period. Often there are core hours like 9-3 or something like that. If I’ve had to be out, I can usually make those hours up at another time in the time period or take PTO for them.",

I was never able to adapt to the timing, and it gradually destroyed my mental and physical health until I left that job about a year and a half later.\n\nI would spend the first half of the day groggy as hell, I could not even remember getting in the car and driving to work most days, and I would desperately write everything everyone said down because I wouldn't be able to reliably remember things people said until after lunchtime when I finally woke up the rest of the way and could function normally.\n\nAs the day went on, I would become progressively more awake, finally becoming a fully functionally human a bit after work ended, just in time to go home and try to force myself to go to sleep a few hours later when I felt the most awake. As you can imagine this was a vicious cycle that never really got any better until I left.\n\nFortunately the beauty of remote work is that you can generally find a workplace that will accommodate you, especially if you don't live on the west coast and can take advantage of the time zone difference.\n\nedit: It's unfortunately very normal for some workplaces to be like that. My experiences with early morning people in management positions is that they tend to be pretty unreasonable and may go out of their way to sabotage you if you don't want to work on their schedule.",

Which basically means that you should see that your manager is consistently messaging you at 7:40, and you should be adjusting your entire life to make sure you get around to that more promptly.\n\nYou have to make a judgement call on whether you think this company / your manager is like that too, and whether or not you care enough to do this sort of people pleasing.\n\nAlso, if it doesn't feel \"painfully obvious\" on whether or not your manager / company is like that, you should just ask. \"Hey, you know those messages you send to me around 7:40? Do I need to get to those more promptly, or is they delay fine?\"\n\nEdit: I think there's a lot of over negativity in this comment section.

The only feedback I ever got was that they were going with more experienced applicants.\n\nEventually got a new job in a non-tech field.\n\nAbsolutely insane out there compared to getting my first tech job in 2022 with no YOE, just a few portfolio projects, from about 100 applications over 3 months.\n\n> I wonder how many of these applicants tried referrals. \n\nLol. I reached out to every single non-coworker connection in the industry I have(about a dozen) - all of whom had spent 2021-2023 offering me interviews at any time. In 2024 when I reached out, none of their companies were hiring devs anymore, or were actively laying them off, or my referrals had been laid off themselves. Why would I send out nearly a thousand applications without thinking to try referrals?",

Let me give you my perspective.  \n  \nI think your questioning isnt only about software engineering itself. It touches how we roll our lives on the big picture.\n\nAs humans, our likes change over time, **and this is completely fine.**\n\nOh gosh, if only you knew how cruel it is to realize for the first time you dont like to do that activity anymore that just a couple of years ago you could do with your hands tied. Did you lose yourself somewhere?\n\nAnswer: no. Actually, you still like to do it, you just dont have that blasting flame anymore, and its ok. You cant lose yourself, because you *are* yourself. But you have to know that yourself is not static, it will change. And so will you. \n\nSo now, you can bang your head against the wall wondering why you are no longer the person you were 10 years ago, or you can recognize that you may have changed, and if that is the case, welcome this change with open arms. After all, this is still you. Why reject it?\n\nBut I understand that everything may still feel blurry to you, as it is often the case when we have ourselves facing such big changes. So maybe you're best off waiting before moving. You know the saying, la nuit porte conseil. In your case, you may need many nuits. You already gave a BIG step: acknowledging that you may be changing. Now, give time to time, to see how this will unfold. Maybe it's just a phase. Maybe not, and you need time for your mind to recognize the change, to stick to it, to decide that you you want to live by it from now on, and to be able to justify itself to you, so that when you ask yourself why you changed, it can reassure you that you did it because it felt better that way.\n\nIn any case, dont rush to find it out. A definitive position will click when you least expect.  \n  \nAnd if its just a phase, well, I think you know how to go on with your life then.\n\nIf its not, remember you will feel 'empty' during some time during the transition, and this is a part of the process. Transitioning can take longer than you expect, but profit from every moment. Do things you wouldnt do in other times, and remember something really cool awaits you. Sooner or later, you will be gifted with new likes and will feel complete once again.",

Saying the time to be too proud to work is over and you're maybe at risk of being homeless. That, in the USA is a fate worse than death, in my opinion.\n\nSo I totally get you want to focus on front end work, but the time to be selective is while you're employed not when you're looking. My advice is get your priorities straight, and in this order; get a job, then get picky when you have the bills covered!\n\nMeanwhile, have you turned to state/city employment agencies? Look, you can't let 'liking' a job be the overarching concern. First you have to care for the necessities of life, like food, rent, utilities, transportation, gas and insurance. Honestly? Liking the job is waaay down the list (unless you're independently wealthy and/or can scurry home to live with family). Otherwise, it's my opinion it's long past time you can be choosy.\n\nGood luck.",

The rest of the world is generally less so, you will need to achieve a high level of fluency before you will have any luck looking for work and even then, there are some cultures (ex. Germany, Turkiye, most of eastern Europe) that would rather hire someone from that culture who speaks English over an outsider who speaks their language. You will never have priority over someone from that culture, unless you offer a particular technical skillset that they can't find. This is xenophobia imo but it is what it is.\n\n2. People tend to be misled by online courses claiming they can become fluent in 3-6 months. You can learn the basics of many languages quickly, but actual fluency can take years, especially if you want to read and write Mandarin. In terms of professional development and career payoff, the ROI relative to effort is very low. You could learn several new tech stacks well in the time it would take you to learn Mandarin.\n\n3. The tech industry works primarily in English. One of my former employers had teams in China and Portugal that I worked closely with and it wasn't uncommon for them to discuss technical problems in English.\n\nI speak several languages to a relatively high degree of fluency and, while it's a great hobby for personal growth, the payoff is really poor for career opportunities. If you want to do it because you just like those cultures, go for it, but I wouldn't expect to get anything from a professional development perspective.",

I made it to the late stages with five different companies, all past the technical round. But was rejected from three. I was able to end the prices with one when I got the offer at my current job \n\nWhat follows is my anecdotal experience. Companies are extremely picky right now. I would feel really strong about my interview performance. I would connect with the hiring managers and the CEO or CTO. I would feel great about my technical round performance. Then I wouldn't get the role. The reasons given, because I would always ask for feedback, were typically that I performed well, but someone was a better fit. Which makes sense. There were probably five hundred or more applicants. But a few of those I would see the same job posted a week or two later, those were frustrating. \n\nMy advice is to keep a pipeline going. You want a few of those initial recruiter interviews a week so that you have a couple of technical and later stage interviews going at all times. The process seems slower than it used to, like a month or longer from application to offer. \n\nAnd give yourself grace. This is really difficult and you are going to get down on yourself. My wife described it like buying a house, you get really attached to an idea of a place where you start imagining yourself only to be out bid. But only one has to work out. \n\nSorry if that was super long. I hope your job hunt goes well.",

Culture, food, easy travel (Schiphol LMAO) and so on are good things. Money, it may sound like a lot to make $200k a year, unless you live in Topeka Kansas the cost of living will make most of it balance out. \n\nThen it's family situation. If you have kids going to college, it's phenomenally expensive. Medical care too.  Funny or strange taxes. And so on. \n\nThe USA gives you more options and has much simpler bureaucracy than most of Europe. If you're young and restless as we say it's not a bad idea to work here for a few years. But long term today is not as clear to consider the USA is better even at more pay. Depending on what you want of course.\n\nI'm retiring in France in 3 years. Not French, and hopefully B2 French by then. I have often regretted not staying in Europe but back then options weren't as plentiful as here. Still aren't. \n\nBottom line.

Compared to the Netherlands, the US is a massive country where each role and each company and each city will lead to a VERY different life. \n\nIf you move to the US you might be working 80 hour weeks with barely enough to pay rent and get laid off after 2 months, OR you might work 40 hour weeks, earn $300k+, have plenty of vacation days, and stay at the same place for 5/10/15+ years. \n\nSo, my advice:\n- Apply around to roles in mid- or large-sized cities (NYC, Seattle, Chicago, etc.)\n- Interview IN PERSON (do not assume anything about a company based purely on what they sell you during an online interview - make sure their success is tangible) and thoroughly research employee reviews \n- Only accept an offer if your gross income will be 2x the household median income or higher FOR THAT SPECIFIC AREA \n- Do not actually move until you have signed an offer and your start date is <2 weeks away \n- Keep an emergency fund of at least $30k \n\nIn general, just be smart about it and you’ll be fine. \n\nEdit: just want to mention that this advice is specially for OP. Someone with less experience or who lives in the US already doesn’t need to have as high of standards. ",

They might only have 2 weeks PTO, might be 100% in the office, might have a terrible company culture, are extremely low paying (less than 104k), etc.\n\nFor others, it's great. They have 4-7 weeks PTO, are hybrid, or even fully remove, with a great company culture that is extremely high paying.\n\nAnd a million flavors in-between. There is no single concept of being a SWE in the US. There is a ton of variety.\n\nMy main advice is to never move before you actually have a job lined up. Don't move to SF with the hopes that the move will land you a good job, because there's a real possibility that it won't. If you want to move to SF, look for jobs in SF, and only move once you find one you like, that meets all your personal criteria.\n\nAs for COL, AI, and google searches aren't good here. Don't rely on a calculator to tell you that you need to earn $X. Living in a big city is inherently different than living in the burbs. Those calculators try to project what it would cost for you to buy a 2-3 BR house in the middle of the city, which is obviously millions. But in reality, nobody living in the city is buying a 2-3 BR house. They're buying a 0-1BR condo. It's an inherent difference in lifestyle. Calculators don't take that into account. They're also not great at taking into account neighborhoods. If you want to live frugally, you can absolutely find neighborhoods that are cheaper. If you want to live extravagently, you can absolutely find neighborhoods for that too. Calculators just average out an entire city, as if there aren't 100 neighborhoods within that city each with their own COL and culture.\n\nCompute the COL difference on your own. When I moved from the Midwest to the East Coast, I actually looked for apartments that were in an area I wanted to live in. That gave me a realistic number of what it would cost for me to move, and what my COL hike would be. Find apartments you would *actually* live in. That's your COL increase.",

Chronic pain issues, like what? Are you injured, is it just pain because you sit at a desk for 10 hours a day? Either way that's a physiotherapist/doctor issue. \n\nDepression would be a therapy thing, I imagine that it's linked to your health too. I'd be pretty sad too if I had to live with chronic pain. \n\nDon't worry about your girlfriend, if she's good for you she won't leave you because you lost your job.. but the caveat is that she might have a chat with you or *consider* leaving you because you're not willing to fix your situation. No woman in the world wants to play mother to their boyfriend (unless they're abused or manipulative). Either way, you're smart and driven enough to work in this industry I'm sure that wouldn't be the reason a good girl would leave you. But your depression and anxiety? it might contribute, not specifically because you have depression or anxiety, but because of what depression and anxiety can do to you and those around you. So you need to really lock in and get those things sorted. How? idk, therapy? but ask someone more qualified than me (probably a therapist lol). \n\nAt the end of the day, no matter what job you pick you still have to pick a flavour of shit to eat. I've worked everything from warehousing, labouring, construction to office based engineering.. all are good and all can be shit. \n\nAt the worst you could probably try a more \"chill\" job that pays less, like part time stocking shelves or something. Or maybe labouring outside (I loved the physical do what you're told-ness part). Just until you figure it out?",

They'd verbally tell you you're underperforming, and they'd work with you to improve your performance.\n\nThe PIP is a last resort. It's not something managers give people right away at the first sign of poor performance. It's something managers give people they already plan to fire. It's a paper trail. That's the sole purpose of a PIP, to serve as a legal paper trail of poor performance so you can't claim the company wrongfully terminated you.\n\nYou should absolutely start applying to other companies.\n\nOne aside though... it sounds like you're blaming all of this on the fact that you're quiet, don't chit-chat, do your work, and leave. Are you sure that's the cause? I'm quiet, I don't chit-chat, I do my work, and I leave, but I've never had issues like this. I've had bad managers before, but it doesn't have anything to do with my introvertedness. Just ask yourself that question. If there was a deeper reason behind this PIP, figuring that out would benefit your career. Ignoring it, blaming your quietness, and carrying whatever trait got you fired with you the rest of your life will make your career very painful.",

        "body": "I had a guy like that on my team. He wanted the whole codebase changed basically and when he didnt get his way he'd go to Jr engineers PR and lightly suggest these nitpicky changes. \n\nI dont mind changing a variable name or a method name or even a small refactor in a file I am touching. Things that wont add a shitload of time to the PR. Like if im already making a change to a file and someone had a nitpick comment I think I can quickly add, ill add it. \n\nBut sometimes in the cases where it is beyond the scope of the PR I think doing what Sidereel said is the way to go. Most jobs reveiw you on your PRs and output. If it doesnt have a task, then they assume you didnt do it. Even if you do it yourself, it's better to create a seperate task because now you have the proof that you worked on something. Like let's say your task involves, creating a new method in Foo class to make Foo multithreaded or some BS like that. Principal Engineer who loves to nitpick, adds \"since you are touching this file, this other irrelevent method (let's call someMethod) just doesnt look good in this file and would be better used in Boo class. Please move it to Boo class\" When you look into it, you realize Foo::someMethod gets called in a few files that could take at least an hour of your time to fix, build, test, etc. You can either change it in the current PR because it's easier than having to create a new branch, rebuild, retest, etc. But the downside is when the current PR gets checked, you wont get credit for that refactor becuase that wasnt part of the task. So your manager will see all the tasks you have completed and he wont give you credit for that refactor. He will view it as the PR took you longer than it should've.   \nBut if you create a seperate task, sure it might not get fixed right away but once you do it, you will get credit for the refactor. Software enginneering is about playing the game. A piece of advice I heard was, it's better to do two tasks and show your manager all the work you did than to do 10 tasks and not say anything about it.  \n\nSome higher level engineers dont care about your career that much they care to get what they want in the codebase. They have the belief that it's on you to defend your career (which it is) and if you are going to be a pushover than so be it. \n\nI learned that mistake a little too late. When the higher level engineer ask for something, I did it with little pushback. I wasnt afraid to say something I just didnt think it was a big deal. But then my PRs had more iterations than they should've and would spend an extra day or two longer due to some of these changes this guy wanted. Guess what was said in my review session? That my PRs take a bit too long and have a bit too much iterations. Guess who told my manager that? The higher level engineer. \n\nI think if it takes too long and is outside of the range of the PR, just politely say \"I gave it a quick look. It seems that this is outside of the scope of the ticket. WE can have a quick chat and if it's really needed I can create a seperate ticket for this.\"",

I've seen plenty of introverted product managers so long as you can still articulate and do the coordination part of the role, not every product manager is the energy spewer.\n\nYou can understand whether you will succeed in product management by the views you take on things as a developer. How much you prioritise the business goals over the technical goals (etc, etc).\n\nDo you feel comfortable taking what the team is telling you and communicating that to leadership (spending time on powerpoint, and project management software to communicate this). Do feel comfortable interpreting and communicating changing demands from the leadership to the team?\n\nI will regularly talk about what I don't know and the path gaining that knowledge. Having said that tools like NotebookLM and equivalent have made it much easier to become a rapid expert on a given subject.\n\nGaps in CVs depend heavily on how you sell it. Selling it as T shaped individual is an amazing way to make yourself look better not worse. I've taken large amounts of time off and live a fairly unorthodox life (nomadic) and if anything it's helped my career rather than hindered it. I'm seen as a little bit crazy and edgy and that helps break preconceptions.\n\nThings like taking up sailing or other activities can be a great way of demonstrating that you have depth. Writing and art are both things that are very shareable and show passion. Being an amazing writer can be a great way of enhancing your (introvert focused) communication.\n\nLong and short though is that I wouldn't lie at all. I would definitely take everything you believe about yourself and spin it to explain why that would make you a good product manager. Every development experience that exposed you to good and bad product management. Every time you stepped in to wear that hat.\n\nI'm expecting there to be a real hybridization of some of these roles anyway over the next few years with the increasing impact of AI, so enhancing your skills on this side is a wise move regardless of whether you become a fulltime product manager.",

That intellectual honesty built more trust than any amount of confident bullshitting ever could. \n\nYour dev background gives you a massive advantage because you actually understand what's possible and what's painful to build, which is surprisingly rare. Own that art/writing gap. It shows you think differently and have a broader perspective on user experience and storytelling, both crucial for PM work. \n\nThe buzzword thing is spot-on; the best PMs translate complex ideas into simple language that engineers, designers, and executives all understand differently. If you want to level up your PM knowledge systematically, Product Alliance has some of the most comprehensive interview prep and frameworks I've seen. Their modules cover everything from product sense to execution and they're particularly strong on teaching you how to structure your thinking without relying on empty jargon. \n\nDon't fake being someone else.

It seemed like it was worthwhile, as I really wanted to expand my horizons and I feel I'm valuable as a leader. The politics were very difficult, sometimes. The work piled up, as I was expected to be an IC sometimes, help other ICs, run a team, and help run a department. Meanwhile, the pay did not scale with the work, and in fact the job opportunities compared to IC opportunities were not as sustainable. This meant less jobs open, and lower salaries at the top end compared with other senior engineering positions. \n\nI feel that you have to find the right situation with a manager who can effectively protect your time and scope, so you aren't doing too much. You also need help, politically, so you're not swimming upstream against people more senior than yourself. Of course, you have to be pretty dedicated to doing a good job, on top of that. It's a lot. \n\nI do believe that there are probably thousands of successful engineering managers/leads, but I also believe that many are burned out or are burning out. Maybe if you feel excited, it's worth trying, but if you keep getting burned out, it's time to retreat back to the IC world. I'm honestly still trying to figure out what I'd do next.

Not everyone on my team has the skills to manage epic level work streams, but everyone is forced to try. Once you can delegate the work streams, the job then becomes about planning what those work streams will be, coordinating the various stakeholders, and inevitably dealing with whatever crisis comes up.\n\nWhen an engineer is under-performing, it's on them to ask for the help they need. With 8 people on the team, that's a lot of individual work to over see, and I imagine it'd be all consuming. Therefore, it's okay to look out for the engineers on your team, make sure they have the work streams they need for a good review, but you need to let them do the work and decide when they need help. I'll never be able to apply my own standards to under-performers, but to some extent doesn't it doesn't matter. If an engineer isn't a net benefit to the project, and I can't help them become one, I just involve management and we deal with it that way. Team lead is not a people management job: it's not command, but the soft power of influence.\n\nAt least on my team, as a lead I try to focus on three things: planning, communication with other teams, and review of our execution. Most of my focus is on long term planning, and the sprint plans are basically up to the engineers. After all, the team lead is in a unique position of owning the outcome of the team, that all parts fit together and contribute to whatever goal management put you on. From that view, the single most important thing you can do is ensuring the project is going in the right direction.\n\nDoing a great job as a team lead, you'll essentially make yourself redundant. Most of the work you are describing, could be by the people on the team with only a little coordination cost.",

Depending on the place you're employed that may not be an option. IE if you're in a faang and they pay you a dump truck full of money every year that may not be an option for you. If you're expected to push through the burn out or get pipped out, you may want to start looking for a job with better wlb and take the pay cut. There's only a special type of person that can go ham literally 100% of the time.\n\n\nBut, if you are already in a position where you can decide to put up some boundaries when needed then you NEED to do it asap. \n\n\nFor now: Since you are already burned out, you have to stop working at the end of the day AND learn how to turn off your work brain when you do. It is a skill and it takes practice. It's like meditation. \n\nWhen you catch yourself doing a work thought you need to intentionally and consciously think about something else. If that means you go do something else or change your physical location then that's what you do. You need to stop thinking about work in order to recover from work.\n\n\nOnce youve already crossed over into being burned out, it may take some time (weeks or months depending on how bad the burnout is) for better boundaries to start making you feel better. But in my experience it does eventually happen. Just remember for the future that you need to be vigilant about the signs that you're working too much. It's something we do to get ahead and it can be good but if you want to be at your best you have to compromise with what is possible. Don't ignore your warning signs. It will take longer to recover the longer you push past them.",

CS grads don't come out ready for senior+ either they have tons of gaps in their knowledge base and experiences.  You have to identify where your knowledge gaps are and go research each gap to fill it.  All the information you need is available online for absolutely free, you can also pay for some relatively cheap books to help.  System design is well written about and a lot of free content you can find to fill that gap. System design isn't even taught in most CS programs so if you're expecting that from a CS degree you'll be left wondering why they graduate students with so little system design knowledge.  Most CS programs focus on theoretical foundations and DSA all of which you can learn for free online.",

A significant part of our job is process/red-tape. At startups, process/red-tape can be straight up non-existant. You're lucky if you end up at a startup that has some halway decent dev processes in place.\n\nBut at a large company, process is key. There are very strict best practices in place. There's very strict change management, very strict approvals, very strict boundaries of responsibility, etc, etc, etc. They're simply too large to let devs just cowboy code some stuff into prod that gets introduced to their millions of users right away. They also have internal and external audits to think about, where they're straight up auditing *the process*. If your processes aren't good, you're going to fail an audit, and failing an external audit can have a significant negative impact on the company and its clients.\n\nAll companies will feel slow compared to startups. Not just big tech. Startups are trying to get their code and product out into the world as fast as humanly possible. It's like Facebook's old mantra (which they've since ditched) \"Move Fast and Break Things\". Who cares if what you released into prod broke something? You'll have a patch up in 10 minutes.\n\nEstablished companies are more focused on keeping things stable, not distrupting their user base, staying in compliance with all the many compliance/regulations/frameworks they need to abide to to make their customers feel warm and fuzzy inside. A short downtime can easily lose 6-7 figures for them, whereas a startup DGAF about downtime. The benefit of releasing code quickly outweights whatever negative would come from prod issues.\n\nOne thing that will be very valuable for *you* from a career-growth perspective is seeing what heavy-process looks like. Look at what this company is doing, how it differs from the startup world, what the pros/cons are, etc. That gives you multiple perspectives to view any given problem from in the future. You can consider stability and process, while also considering quick delivery. There's ***a lot*** of companies in-between the 2 extremes that highly value that kind of perspective.",

I dont regret the money I made but I somewhat regret jumping ship due to mental breakdown.\n\nIM not saying the new job will suck but sometimes there is a thing about staying at a company that treats you well even if the work slows down a bit. It happens in many companies it's on you to decide whether it's worth it or not. \n\nFor 136k base pay vs 150k base pay and the options you are getting, id stay at the job. Im sure it's getting boring but you know the work, you have more job security, the people likely love you. You get 2 fridays off a month (i've done 9/80 and I love it and wish I could go back to it). \n\nI dont like including bonuses as part of pay because they are not guaranteed and it's just used as a way to get you there. So really consider it as you only make an extra 14k. Is 14k worth travelling 4 hours, having to work 5 days a week every week, potentially losing work-life balance (this is a big one), etc. \n\nAt your job I know it'sa bout 22% bonus, that's amazing, you are likely more guaranteed to get that 22% at your current job than your new job because they will take into account the years you have put in good work where the new job wont give you 30% the first year because the first year they likely are hoping you catch up. Theyll give you enough to be happy but I doubt it will be 30% and who knows how much they give you in followin gyears. I was told when I moved companies that Id get 10% raises and 20% bonuses almost every year. In year 1, they decided to not give raises to anybody due to market. Usually companies that give amazing bonuses are the first to give no bonuses on a down year.",

From my experience, 99% of new devs (interns, salaried, contract, whatever) get that same feeling when jumping into an established company with an established codebase. No reasonable person will expect you to \"just get it\" right off the bat. Keep asking questions until it clicks. It's the only way you will learn.\n\nThat said, what I wish I had done much sooner was to just spend time with the software. Poke around. Get a feel for what the user's experience will be. Try to understand what problem it is that your software is trying to solve.\n\nFor me, I jumped into smart agriculture development with zero farm experience. It wasn't until I sat in a combine and just drove around for a day that I understood why x button is there, why menu z is nested in menu y, etc.\n\nFrom there, you can start to understand the hows and whys of the software design. Most frameworks just tackle one area (except maybe for the \"we've got it all\" frameworks like Qt), so understand what frameworks/middleware you're using and, more importantly, why you're using it.\n\nAnother thing you can do it almost any industry is look at other people's PRs. Presuming the title is \"fixed a bug where x would happen when you do y\", make a chain in your head between x and y and the chunk of code that was modified. It's a decent way to start connecting those dots. Plus, informally, it looks very good if you can say \"oh yeah, I saw something about that in Tim's PR\" since it shows you're engaged and taking an active interest.\n\nOn a less technical note, nobody gets mad at the new guy for asking questions because they understand it's all a lot to take in. They have all been exactly where you are right now. What people DO get upset with is a developer who has been onboard for 6 months, a year, 3 years, or whatever and still doesn't know some of the basic things. Ask questions, take organized notes.\n\nOtherwise, if you have any specific questions about the industry you're in, what frameworks you're using, etc, feel free to ask her and we can lend a hand or at least point you in the right direction!",

Pretty much every first time intern will experience the imposter syndrome. The company knows you’re still a student. The company knows that the point of an internship is to learn. You are not dumb, my friend.\n\nMy advice is to find a colleague, maybe someone in your team or someone who’s working on something you’re curious about/interested in, and schedule a 30 minute meeting with them. Ask them about their journey and their role in the company. And then talk to them about yourself and your journey. If you like the conversation, make it a point to speak to them regularly. Congratulations, you just got yourself a mentor.\n\nThe mentor will look out for you. They’ll give you some guidance and hopefully show you the ropes. They can help you parse the code base. And if they don’t have an exact answer, chances are they know someone who does. They’ll help facilitate those other connections. See, something you learn is that people love flattery. And there’s nothing more flattering than a young person latching on to you and seeking you out because you gave them clarity. That’s the power of networking.\n\nBest of luck out there. Deep breaths. You got this!",

It varies by company. But in the end there should be an onboarding of how to build, test, etc.\n\nBefore any of that, your first day will likely be signing up for benefits (insurances), payroll, etc. This shoudl be the absolute first thing you do so you get your money in the bank and not through a check mailed to you.\n\nGet your W-4 completed (takes like 5 minutes tops). Im not a financial adviser in any way but if you get RSUs, i'd suggest having them take a certain amount extra per check to account for the RSUs when you start to get them. I got burned by this the fist time I got RSUs. Because tehy are considered bonus they are taxed differently so I ended up owing a good amount to the IRS my first year. Ideally I try to have them take 100 per check to account for that.\n\nSign up for any 401k accounts too. Your future self will thank you later. Put as much as you think is fair, experts suggest 12-15% a year.\n\nAs for the job. Your first week is usually onboarding and then you get small tasks and build up confidence in the code. Ask your manager when he expects you to start getting bigger tasks. If he/she says in 3 months, try to get ahead of everything. If they say that the first week they only expect you to run tests and build, try to get that doen within the first few days and then by thursday tell them you are done and if you can at least look at the first task to get an idea of where to start.\n\nAsk questions, dont be afraid to reach out to people. it's scary at first but passive devs are the ones that get booted. If you start doing it before your manager has to say it, your manager will thank you. Managers have so much on their plate so they love devs who they dont ahve to say anything to, they just trust the dev will always be ahead of the pack. So if your manager is hoping to get you a task after 3 months, try to be ready at the 2nd month. Better to have him tell you to slow down then having to tell you to hurry up.\n\n  \nEdit: also just to add. To emphasive the dont be a passive dev, report what you do. You have to play a game to a certain level. I once had a seniro dev tell me that it is better to do 2 tasks and report it during stand up and create dialogue about it (take ove rthe screen and show results for example, ask questions about being stuck, etc) than it is to do 10 tasks and just make simple 1 comment about progress that doesnt create discussion. Being stuck on the same task that should've taken a few days, but you are just stuck for weeks and dont say anything in stand up is a huge turnoff. \n\nAlso find a mentor or senior friend you can do work with at a certain point. Someone who will hype you up to the manager and you can work along side with. At a certain point if you can be the guy who gets name-called during stand up, that's a plus. Even in meetings wher eyou are not there. Im talking about when someone has a report and they say \"OP helped me get past this issue\" or \"OP made an interesting observation\" at a certain point someone is going to say \"wow OP is making good contributions\" and someone might be like \"who is this OP everybody is talking about\".",

The key is being upfront about what you know and what you're eager to learn, rather than trying to oversell your experience.\n\nYou're not really overqualified for mid-level positions - you're differently qualified, which can work in your favor if you frame it right. Focus on the problem-solving aspects, the full ownership you've taken of projects, and your ability to work independently, but also emphasize your excitement about learning team dynamics and industry standards. Many companies actually love hiring PhD holders because you bring analytical thinking and persistence that's hard to teach. The trick is convincing them in interviews that you can adapt to their environment and that your unconventional path is an asset, not a liability.

I joined the industry more than a decade ago, and things have already changed substantially. Even if we assume AI takes the first rung of coding jobs, the difficult part of software was never writing code, it's figuring out what we need the code to do, navigating various corporate processes, and knowing that the code we write will work as we intend it. What I see happening, is that in 5-10 years, programmers will be super-efficient, and our job will look more like a tech or team lead that serves as the owner for the code and interfaces with management and stakeholder.\n\nAnyway, software isn't going anywhere, it's going to continue changing, but no matter what, we're going to have more software in 20 years than we do today, and someone is going to have to build it, or at least be the person responsible for it.\n\nJob security in software doesn't come down to the coding skills, it comes down to all the non-coding skills you have. Are you experienced enough to learn new concepts? Can you lead a team? How well do you do working on ambiguous problems? Do you have a track record of producing results in difficult environments? How well do you work with others? These are the driving questions that determine employ-ability. You'll learn how to pass software coding assessments in school, but after that, employ ability boils down to the ability to contribute to companies bottom line. That's never going to change!",

If you have a PhD in Physics, you don't want to apply for jobs that are going to emphasize things you cannot bring to the table. So you don't want to apply for jobs where they're going to be looking for you to be a shallow generalist or a specialist in something you don't do.\n\nThis is the trap people fall into - they see 500 jobs that they could technically do and apply to all of them.\n\nInstead, you want to focus on applying to the jobs where not only can someone with your background be successful, but really where almost only people with your type of background can be successful. \n\nGenerally speaking, that is going to be companies working on solving things that aren't fully solved. Some people will call this R&D or research or innovation, but at its core you want to look for things that are not just standard, off-the-shelf solutions.\n\nWhat you want to avoid is generic \"entry level data scientist for Fortune 500 company training ML models\".\n\nNow, what can you do to enhance your resume:\n\n1. Make sure you cram Python hard. C++, C#, Java are all good too, and there might be some niche industries where other languages are relevant, but if you're blindly going to pick one, it needs to be Python, and you want to be able to show up as a very strong Python coder. \n\n2. Make sure you cram SQL. It's not as critical as it once was, but you still need to make sure you are fairly competent with SQL: select, group by, inner/left/full/right joins, partition by/window functions, nested queries, and CTEs.\n\n3. Assuming you're looking into AI/ML: make sure you learn about/brush up on as many of the basics of ML: regression, classification, clustering, A/B testing, NLP. \n\n4. If you want to go for maximum marketability and you have the time/ability to do so: either a) dive into some of the \"under the hood\" LLM stuff, or b) learn how to build LLM-powered applications. There's no easier path to getting a high paying job right now than being able to contribute to LLM stuff. And realistically, it's a new enough field that there should be plenty of room for someone with a Physics PhD to find an area within it where you can get yourself up to speed and be dangerous.",

Positions such as senoir data science frequently have hiring managers or recruiters who only look for experience in industry in the exact right platforms and tools and dont consider anything in terms of applicable skill.\n\nSomeone with a PhD isn't normally going to go straight to a Senior role unless their research experience is directly relevant to a specific industry.\n\nIf I were you, I wouldn't be looking for Senior roles - I would be looking for entry level roles in highly competitive industries. Like, a Senior Data Scientist at some middle tier tech company is probably making less money than an entry level data scientist at a hedge fund, top tier tech company, cutting edge startup with lots of money, etc.\n\nSo again, don't think \"well, I'm smart enough to be able to do something as well as a more senior data scientist who *doesnt'* have a PhD\", because not only is that not right (experience in industry matters), but also hiring managers won't agree with you.\n\nInstead, I would look for jobs where you can say \"typical entry-level data scientist with a BS in CS could not handle this\", and those are the jobs you want to apply for. I think startups would also be a good place for someone like you vs. mega dino tech companies (and I say this as someone who works in a mega dino tech company).\n\n>Also, to be sure, what does llm powered application mean ? Does that mean how to work with and guide and direct llms to build and put together coding scripts and libraries with which to build apps ?\n\nThat means a piece of software that uses API calls to an LLM provider (OpenAI, Claude, whatever) to do stuff. You're not actually making contributions to the underlying LLM model, you're making a piece of software that uses an existing model. There is a spectrum too - there's stuff like RAG systems where you're not retraining the model per se, but you're adapting the model for your own application with your own data.",

You've thought through this and made some points. But you've also answered your own question.\n\nYou've found your niche. That's good. But it's during a tech recession (the \"wrong time\") which is something outside your control.\n\nYou can't exactly force yourself into an industry that is an employer's market right now. I'm sorry to say it but nobody is coming to save you with a life-changing piece of advice or a lucrative job offer out of the blue just because you've found your blockers. Over-intellectualizing it will make you feel worse about it without any actionable outcomes. But I also don't think your situation is as hopeless as you make yourself believe.\n\nIt's not a struggle unique to you, and people have successfully navigated themselves out of it by being patient. Read some posts from people who had to job-hunt during the dot-com crash or the 2008 financial crisis. Most of the competent ones made it out OK, but it took them a while to get there. It's not your fault, but it's also in your best interest to continue applying without any expectation for the next while throughout the recession cycle (which may take years, I understand).",

I thought I had some advantage because of my 1 year intern + part time experience in a big corp while being a student, but it figures that most of these ppl hiring for junior positions dont really care about internships you did as a student. I've applied for 600+ jobs this past 5 months and got 4 interviews - half of them is not paid positions - which they kind of made fun of me trying to validate my internship experiences. Most of the time i thought ot myself 'its fine, maybe i can show off some of the passion projects I've been developing to the companies and maybe they'd hire me' but the field I worked on for these 3+ years by myself via passion projects didnt even made me get an interview on that specific field. It is a tiring, exhausting process but i still apply with hope in my heart to see if i can land a job which might get me out of these paradoxes in 2-3 years. Sad part is, that i've given up on the field i raised myself in. It is really tough man, sometimes i wish i would've been a little bit older so that i could've graduated before pandemic.\nGood luck to both of us, hope you wont get exhausted as much as i did.",

Tell them that what they are offering is below your current comp and doesn’t align with the role you are looking for and invite them to reach out if they find the role you applied for becomes available. \n\nSpeaking to the process, I think 9/10 companies that interview you for a role and bait and switch like they have aren’t good companies to work for. What they should have done is clarified the job you were interviewing for before the first round and certainly by the second round. Clarifying the job you were interviewing for at the offer stage is scammy. There are situations where that could make a lot of sense for everyone but this doesn’t sound like that. I think the kind of company that does this is also the kind of company that says “we would like to give you a raise and we for sure will but we have to wait until next year”",

It may be that you've really impressed them, and they want you - but that they're stuck with a limited number of approved headcount and just can't do it. Or something like that. The key thing in my mind is to focus on salary, not level. If they pay you like a senior/staff/whatever, then fuck it. Take the money. Title aint shit without the money.\n\nI had a similar situation: I was hoping for staff engineer, but got a senior offer. I was up front from the beginning about my interest in the staff position: I think it's important to lay the groundwork early - if you go through everything at one level and suddenly ask for the higher, that won't go over well. Then later, at the offer stage when we talked about senior, I was clear \"Hey I started looking at these because of the salary band of this higher level - can we meet in the middle somewhere?\"\n\nThere are obviously no guarantees, but that's how I played it.

Fingers crossed I get more info on Monday.
