Those at the senior level, like many of us here, will not have any issue finding work - networking alone being a game changer. Then there is the issue of soft skills versus technical skills.  The longer you have been in the workforce, the more likely you are to have honed the soft skills needed for interviews.  There are many relatively new DE's that are technically proficient but, due to a host of reasons (don't get me started), do not have the skills to interview well.\n\n I've also decided to ignore my impulse to see everything as LLM-generated.  I've personally written a few work proposals where I've been accused of such (no silly graphics or bullet points btw), and those that use LLMs are the first to assume everything written now is the same.  I also have family where English isn't their primary language, so it can often be used for translation, and the user is left with terrible formatting.",

I did this a while back with the snowflake query log so I could understand our costs better. Try to get to a point where writing the SQL to answer your questions flows naturally and quickly. The follow-up questions are especially important because that's where the complexity will come out.\n\nYou'll need to back this up with good theory which can come from a few places\n\nFor textbooks I really like T-SQL fundementals by Itzik Ben-Gan. It's focused on SQL Server, but it covers a lot of generic SQL, and it has a really good explanation of the core concepts. Things like three-value predicate logic make a lot more sense with his explanations. I generally recommend people at least read the first chapter. I think you can find a free PDF somewhere but I just bought it on amazon (almost exactly 10 years ago!)\n\nWebsites like Leetcode CAN be good because of the ability to compare your answers to others, but it's important not to blindly trust that someone else's approach is better. If you see faster solutions, look up the techniques they are using and try to understand if it's actually an improvement or just or just a hack for that specific dataset.\n\nFor performance, Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann provides a lot of the theoretical foundation you'll need to understand how to think about queries, you'll need to supplement this with resources specific to the database you are working in.  \n\n\nFor snowflake I found some articles on [https://articles.analytics.today/](https://articles.analytics.today/) helpful.

I‚Äôve been around the block and have worked with quite a few job roles in my time. \n\nData engineering is one of the most lucrative fields in IT. Data engineers are really really well paid. On the stress spectrum, it‚Äôs also on the lower end. It‚Äôs also one where a lot of self-teaching is still a valid pathway forward.\n\nThere are other IT roles where the entire company is down and you‚Äôre stuck working days straight to fix it. Or security professionals, when the company is under attack 24 hours a day and everyone is looking at them to fix it and then blaming them for what happened.\n\nIn your case, I would say much of the stress is coming from layoffs, and a management that does not really understand AI and what it‚Äôs used for. Bad leadership looks at AI as a way to reduce headcount. Good leadership looks at it as a productivity tool. It should be helping to get more work done and a more streamlined, quality product.\n\nAlso, AI should not be replacing the templating and standards. That‚Äôs up to the lead to come up with and enforce.\n\nI do think AI is giving a lot of people some existential crisis issues. However, I think using it is going to be required for almost all roles. Personally, I treat just like any other tool, like a spreadsheet, or a calculator, or a web search. Not using it means I am gimping myself, so why would I fight it and try and use the old way? \n\nThe AI can‚Äôt think for itself. That‚Äôs where humans come in and will never be replaced. Someone still still needs to understand everything at the higher level, figure out what needs to be done, and glue it all together.\n\nIf it was me, I‚Äôd take a step back and take some breaths. Or take a few days off and don‚Äôt think about work. Seems like burnout and a perspective check is needed here.\n\nFinally, you mentioned you want to quit, but have you asked yourself, what are you going to replace the job with?",

I've found with Claude, it can help with some of the more manual steps and freeing time up for other things.\n\nAnyway - stay positive.

Unfortunately we're currently living through a period of FAFO, where it's normal to tear down status quo, including gov't regulations for novelty because going viral is where the money is. The same thing happened with the blockchain craze, and the people who understood the tech were right to point out that all you need was immutable dbs to solve most of the use cases that were used to hype the trending tech. \n\nI feel the same as you do, but companies will need to learn the hard way, because the world of VCs have convinced companies large and small that the only way to be worth more or to enhance productivity  is to jump to the next novel tech that is going viral - This works great for start ups attempting to pump up their valuations, but not so great for companies that are larger with processes and governance in place. This sort of behavior continues to degrade products, and Google is a great example of product degradation. Even Klarna restarted it's hiring because their jump in to AI that is still premature hurt their business operations. \n\nYou're just early in the game to realize this, but the fact is the hype will keep at it until AI matures and is productionized properly, or the next trending tech starts attracting investor capital. It's all a game, but that does not mean that the pleasure you gained from building data pipelines no longer gives you satisfaction. You just need to find other corps that are mindful of assessing premature tech before jumping head first into the latest and greatest - there is a reason companies like Apple and Costco maintained their lead this long.",

It simplifies a lot of the tediousness of using DBT with Airflow (v2.9). It is easy to generate your DBT assets and those can be linked with your other dagster assets.\n\nThe main difference is the paradigm. Dagster does not have jobs/tasks at the forefront. Jobs are a process to group functional assets together i.e. you have 1 ingestion process and 3 DBT models to generate your analytics table and you can ran all of them at once, on schedule.   \n\n\nDagster uses data assets at the forefront, which are what the name suggests, your data as an asset. You do not think of the process of creating the data as you think of the final data product. \n\nI ike the lineage feature, which allows you to see how all your assets are interconnected. You can define a job with a schedule for any cut of your lineage graph.\n\nDagster is also more pythonic than Airflow. You use python's best practices when writing your processes.\n\nTesting is much simpler with the integrated 'dagster dev' command which quickly spins up a local instance for you to test your pipelines. \n\nCan write a lot more about the difference but I am at work now :-D.\n\nTo conclude, both are good tools (haven't tried Airflow v3+) but for different needs. Dagster is better for companies where data lineage is vital, whereas Airflow is better for automation of tasks.   \nData pipelines are good in both (however, in dagster it gets tedious to integrate a random pipeline with the rest of your asset lineage)",

I am not a big graphdb person so I don't know, but have built semantic models the other way and had mixed results with AI.\n\nIn the end though the challenge for me was more about semantics and synonyms than anything else.  In a business people say the same thing 10 different ways and it's often hard for the LLM to interpret what they mean, especially in the context of your business.  I found we needed synonyms not only for tables and columns but for values as well and sometimes the context that was relevant to the answer was who asked the question.

If they are any good then they should be more curious than envious/jealous, but you never know what colleagues you might end up working with.\n\nOne thing this does show however, is that domain knowledge is very important. When you are working with data you can't do it in a vacuum, you have to work with domain experts to understand how it relates to the real world.",

I don't think winning the competition alone is going to help you without a strong portfolio of other projects, but it would make for good essay/statement of interest material to describe why you're looking for a career pivot.\n\nIn my experience, unless they've already made the job description with an existing candidate in mind, colleges and universities are good places to start. They aren't super fixated on production-level experience, usually have some super passionate people, and chill workloads. You could start by looking for jobs at local colleges or something like HigherEd Jobs. \n\nBest of luck!",

And there‚Äôs no particular reason to expect any record to overlap with any other.\n\nEven if there is a subset of your data which really does fit this description, you can still allow for it in Postgres with the use of the jsonb column type which others have mentioned.\n\nBut from what you‚Äôve described, your data probably is very similar and predictable from one record to the next. All the personnel are presumably going to have names and IDs and other common properties. In this context, you are giving up a lot by using a document store, such as the ability to reliably query the data, to enforce rules that maintain quality and integrity, and to optimise for certain use cases. These things will likely cause you pain down the track that is much worse than what you think you‚Äôre avoiding by not having to worry about schema evolution.",

We had a complaint come from the end users that a certain report was taking too long - a report that was built by the BI developers ages ago to satisfy the requirements when data was minimal. The query for this report was hitting our base tables in the raw layer with multiple joins and full table scans and union alls etc.. it was a mess. When we pointed the report to use our facts, performance improved significantly. The benefit here of course is performance. There are other benefits of using an actual modelled solution in the gold layer - control over all lookups - including, and this is crucial, those lookups that have no documentation and are just part of the hard-coded logic of your company's analysts in their scripts. putting most of your business requirements/KPIs in one model also helps everyone read and understand the tables which should reduce quality issues. Data modelers are not just technically adept - they should understand the business as well, a rare breed and are still needed.",

Many folks on this sub will tell you that DE isn't an entry-level position, so you must have done something right to get your foot in the door.\n\nRegarding your question, it's smart to focus on the fundamentals. It‚Äôs easy to get lost in the sea of specific \"data engineering\" tools, but they all build on a few core IT concepts. My advice would be to focus on these areas for the next six months.\n\n1. The first thing I'd focus on is the programming basics. Since you're using Python, I would go deep on that. Don't just learn syntax, but really try to grasp the fundamentals so you can solve problems with it. Do a few mini-projects in pure Python to make the concepts stick. This will be your foundation for everything else.\n\n2. Next, you need to become very comfortable with SQL. It‚Äôs the language of data, and you'll be using it constantly. Understand what it is, get the basic syntax down, and then really practice with it. Microsoft has some great sample datasets like AdventureWorks that are perfect for learning things like joins and aggregations.\n\n3. While you're learning those, the third crucial piece is Git. It doesn't matter if your company uses GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket; the principles are the same. You absolutely need to understand the basic workflow of making a branch, committing your changes, and merging them. It's how all modern tech teams collaborate. As a bonus, look into what a simple CI/CD pipeline does, maybe with something like GitHub Actions.\n\n4. Finally, try to get a basic understanding of one cloud provider. It doesn‚Äôt matter which one‚ÄîAWS, Azure, or GCP. I'd probably stick with AWS since it‚Äôs the most common right now. You don't need to be an expert, but learn the core concepts. Studying for one of the associate-level certifications is a great way to get a structured overview.\n\nIf you can get a good handle on these things by your sixth month, you'll have the solid IT foundation you need for this role. Only then would I start worrying about the more advanced, specific DE concepts. Everything will make much more sense once you have these basics down.",

Separately, you can research whatever systems your team is using and break down by categories:\n\n1. SQL: Learn how to write SQL queries (use documentation for whatever language you're using and look up videos for that specific langauge).\n2. Database structures: Whether you're using on premise servers or cloud services, look up documentation for those platforms and look at some videos to get an overview of how they store and process data.\n3. Pipelines and job scheduling: Learn about which service(s) are used to create data pipelines and schedule jobs and how they work.\n4. Version control: Learn about the codebase you're working in, what coding standards they have (rules for writing sql queries, DDL, DML, dags, etc....) and how to use github and your IDE (probably VScode).\n\nI would start by learning what's most relevant to your day to day work and then learn more about each area as you go. You will also need to understand what the modeling and data in your pipelines represent. Being able to explain data to the business is equally important to technical knowledge of how to store and manage data.",

I would not have been able to write that code in Rust myself. I'm a very experienced software engineer, but I had written maybe 10 lines of Rust in my life. But with Claude's help its really very nice.\n\nThe key to getting good quality code out of Claude is not that different from getting good code out of people:\n- unit tests\n- automated linting\n- manually specify function type signatures where it matters\n- have Claude run the tests and the linter after every change, and then have it fix all the problems it finds.\n- actually read the resulting code, make sure it makes sense, and make Claude refactor where it gets messy.\n\nIn the end it worked great, and the code was very readable. \nThis was very exciting because using a conventional JSON parser in the conventional way was just not going to work at all.\n\nBut it was a little slow. I told Claude to optimize for performance. It came up with about 10 recommendations. I told it to implement the top 6 that I thought would make a big difference. It implemented those optimizations, made all the tests pass, and the resulting program was an order of magnitude faster.\n\nIt could easily have taken me a month to do all this by hand.",

I've seen people called a Sr DE with 2 years of experience as a DE, Ive seen someone called a Lead DE because they moved from a Lead DBA role to their first DE role. I know a person in consulting who is just a DE and has been a DE or SWE for 15 years. He is far better at coding that I am, and makes more money, but doesn't have the same level of title as others with far less skills. \n\nMyself, I spent my first year writing code, building pipelines, fixing bugs and closing tickets. Then everything changed and I am now running teams of implementation partners to build out enterprise projects. Nowadays, the only coding I do is to review PRs. I draw up architecture, work cross functionally with other teams to solution things, and tell my teams what all needs to be done with some guidance on how to do it. Someone else at a different company would need to work 10 years before being trusted to do what I do now. My job title will change to Sr DE next year per my manager. And I'll have 2 years of DE experience at that point, and a year of that is barely technical. \n\nFor a standard 3rd year DE, if one even exists, I would start to expect a little more autonomy. Learn to make decisions. Start figuring out and proposing architecture. Start mentoring younger DEs and try to lead some small projects if you aren't already. By this point, you shouldn't need to be told what to do on a project, you should be able to identify what needs to be done, and work to implement it. A big thing is that you should probably at least start working with other teams on cross functional projects. Begin thinking about business value of various projects. \n\nI learned, albeit slowly, that maintaining collaborative relationships with other teams is vastly more valuable than transactional relationships. They are more complicated to manage, but it is the only approach I've seen work to actually get things done.

Not everything fits neatly into them. Example, you need to move data from on-prem to cloud, data needs encryption at rest and in transit, how is DBT and Airflow helping? You can maybe orchestrate some in Airflow but actually nope, on-prem is behind firewall with local connectivity and limited egress only, no inbound connection for security and it cannot be exposed to a cloud based Airflow instance due to security team demands.

It's relatively simple to see how you can start pushing around pixels on a screen, and there's some nice libraries that add quality of life / neat features like liquid simulation. It's also completely free AFAIK.\n\nTouchdesigner ( [https://derivative.ca/](https://derivative.ca/) ) has a bit of a steeper learning curve, and is typically used to abstract all the manual code stuff from Processing into a node-based editor. It comes installed with Python so you can control everything manually in code if you want, but you'll quickly find a lot of shortcuts that you can do with the nodes that are a lot more performant than doing it with your own code. \n\nThere's a free version with the main limitation being you your resolution is capped below HD, but in practice that's not a big deal for any given projector / LED wall.  With this I've begrudgingly found Youtube tutorials extremely helpful-  just search for some cool videos with cool thumbnails and it generally takes about 10 minutes of the designer stepping through through their network for you to have it running locally.\n\n  \ngood luck & have fun!! eager to see what other people are getting up to in this thread.",

There was an implementation Arrow2 which I found more ergonomic than Arrow-RS initially, which is now forked into Polars-Arrow and backs the Polars project in Rust. However, that merged work into Arrow-RS, and I hear the team invested time learning from the earlier mistakes.\n\nIn both cases, without going too far down the rabbit hole - both implementations use a Rust concept dynamic dispatch, which makes typing in the IDE disappear, and Rust type downcasting to be required, which personally, I find awkward to use. This also blocks some automatic compiler optimisations that can automatically inline more aggressively for a faster build. The result is once you get up to a top level library like Polars, there are many layers of objects between the object you are working with and the actual data backing it. \n\nOnce you are in Python, I found this really doesn't matter - it's like water into wine.\n\nHowever, in **Arrow-RS** (for numerical data) Rust looks like:\n\n1. **Raw allocation** (heap bytes)\n2. `Arc<Bytes>` (ref-counted ownership of allocation)\n3. `Buffer` (view over the bytes)\n4. `ArrayData` (ties buffers, length, datatype, nulls)\n5. `PrimitiveArray<T>` (typed wrapper, implements `Array`)\n6. `ArrayRef = Arc<dyn Array>` (trait object used in generic contexts)\n\nSo, you constantly need to downcast from ArrayRef just to get typed data, even though you built all the layers.\n\nIn **Minarrow**, you also have layers, but they are, in my opinion, more straightforward:\n\n1. **Vec64 / Buffer** \\- Plays like a normal Rust vector. You can use it like one\n2. **Typed Buffers**: IntegerArray, FloatArray, etc.\n3. **NumericArray:** Enum, with accessors, e.g., 'myarr.i64()'\n4. **Array**: Enum, with accessors e.g., 'myarr.num().i64()'\n\nThe result is they are composable - you opt-up to the level of abstraction you want and need, rather than being locked behind an opaque object. In Rust, this is particularly helpful, as when building libraries and functions, it means their signatures can be compatible with more use cases, but I'm digressing here.\n\nThe point is that it was enough that I went and rebuilt my own implementation, as I need it for other projects and didn't like wrestling with the system as the underlying data foundation. \n\nRegardless, Arrow is brilliant and it's incredible what the team has achieved.",

Dagster is asset-native; its primary abstraction is the data asset itself (a table, a model). You define the asset, and Dagster figures out the tasks needed to create it. Airflow is task-native; its primary abstraction is the task (a unit of work). You define the task, and can now declare what assets it produces. This makes Dagster's worldview intrinsically data-centric, while Airflow's is operationally-centric with data-awareness added on.\n2. In Dagster, lineage is automatic. When you define an asset that depends on another, the lineage is instantly captured in a unified graph. In Airflow, you must manually declare lineage by specifying inlets and outlets for each task or using the @asset decorator. This requires extra effort and is prone to being overlooked or misconfigured. 3. Dagster's integration understands your dbt project natively. It automatically ingest your dbt manifest and displays every model, source, and test as a first-class asset in its graph with no extra code. Airflow's integration orchestrates dbt runs. It excels at running the dbt run command as a task within a workflow, but the deep, model-level visibility and lineage is not inherent and requires more setup to achieve. \n\nAirflow will try to somehow catch up to Dagster by narrowing this gap, not just copying the exact way of doing things!",

I'd say this is an opportunity to become more confident in cloud related stuff.  There is a lot of overlap between services so if you understand broadly speaking how cloud works, why cloud would be used, and the popular services you can at the very least feel comfortable in conversations if pressed by a recruiter who usually knows nothing about cloud apart from the words in front of them.\n\nAWS has a free cert which you can take and add to your CV. \n\n>Feeling stuck but unsure how much of this is my own doing/how much control I have over it.\n\nAs always. job hunting is three parts: technical competency, confidence, and likeability.  You can control all three and it just boils to what happens on the day.\n\nLeverage your experience as much as possible because that is by far your greatest strength.  When you have no skills in something, always focus on your passion and motivation to learn the subject you want to progress in (in this case, cloud and modern stack).  Work how your current skills fit into your objectives.  Be honest - \"I'm experienced in some things and will use that as a foundation to work on things I'm not experienced in\" sounds much better than \"I know everything\" and be found out as a lying piece of shit.",

Well, what if this is a new cost element that's being carved out of an existing cost element?  If you ignore this fab_cost you're ignoring some of your cost - and your totals will no longer be accurate.\n\nSo, *guessing* about schema evolution is just sloppy work for most production systems.  The right answer most of the time is to define a data contract between systems - and validate it.",

Depending on the setup this can be done using OPC-UA for most SCADA systems.  I've seen in Pharma before that most manufacturing has a gateway so you can pull off the gateway instead which aggregates several PLCs/machines to pull from a common point.  Most of that data is pushed to a pub/sub like Kafka or some other MQ. The schema for each step in most manufacturing processes is based on how the cards are programmed on the PLC. Since message queuing systems can handle schema evolution, you can usually combine this with a schema registry so you can see the steps and versions.  Now getting it into a structure built for OLAP is not the easiest.  There might be controls engineers that already have a common data model for reporting on just the OT.  This is needed to understand signals, etc.  They might also have a digital twin which represents a virtual system so you can begin modeling yourself. There are decent articles discussing OT/IT convergence but there is no silver bullet ( https://iot-analytics.com/it-ot-convergence-27-themes-define-future-of-industrial-integration/). If the schema isn't defined anywhere, there are tools like Apache Flink that can use schema inference, however you are still going to need to figure out the model so you know what step stage relates to what schema and how keys (columns) are related to each other.  It takes some work but again there is an automation and controls engineer that has to have that somewhere.",

It‚Äôs like the opposite of sales lol.\n\nThe software is often just a means to get the manufacturing equipment to work. The engineers in OT are more operational focused and have a different set of responsibilities. They are also very busy most of the time and want to get things working and keep them working. There is typically no laboratory setup where they can isolate data and services out for stuff like analytics.\n\nAlso, manufacturing is usually a low margin business, so there‚Äôs not a lot of spare change there for new initiatives which take time to show value.\n\nGood news is, overall I have been seeing lots of push over the past 5 years for more integration of OT with IT, as the link you provided shows. I think this started in security as OT has been a vulnerable gateway into IT, since it‚Äôs not been hardened from a security standpoint. Example, there‚Äôs a ton of pressure to not touch anything for simple stuff like firewall or patches when the greater risk is perceived as bringing a production line down.\n\nHopefully some of the success stories start getting more visibility over time and we can learn from examples of where value is created from integrating OT data where everyone can access it and use it to improve the company overall.\n\nOne tip is see if there are any relationships built in your group with the OT group. Usually I‚Äôve found this less of a technology issue but more of a perception and priorities issue.",

Kstreams btw was based on samza, if your interested in the academics. The one thing that does distinguish it, is that it doesn't require a cluster, i.e. it's completely self contained. Which is cool, but it's not with out it's pay offs.\n\n\nSelf hosting the clustered stream processors is complex, but there is a lot of very good managed version out there, which drastically reduce the complexity. If you just want to test locally and get some exposure, flink has a in process cluster that autostart etc is very straightforward. Pretty much just f5 from your IDE.\n\n\nEdit: I use the java version of flink, but their python looks good based on the docs. However, I went down the same rabbit hole as you some time ago, and the reality is alot of these tools are java native, so python is a second class citizen.¬†",

We also took part in **MWC Barcelona in both 2023 and 2024,** and while it is a massive event, it offered solid technical content around AI, IoT and digital transformation with live demos and case studies.\n\nFor developer-focused tracks, **Berlin Buzzwords** is a good choice if you‚Äôre into data engineering and search technologies, and the **Data Innovation Summit in Stockholm** usually brings very practical case studies. Since you mentioned **apidays in London**, that one is definitely worth checking out too because it covers APIs and AI with a good balance of technical content and ecosystem discussions.",

Data Engineers aren't using SQLite in much (possibly a simple PoC or a metadata store but as the person you replied somewhat rudely to has said, DuckDB is usually a better option and most people in the field who do even a marginal amount of continuous professional development would prefer DuckDB over SQLite). Sys architecture might use it for demonstration/PoC but more likely will make a data architecture diagram and have DBAs build in a sandboxed RDBMS engine of choice to allow concurrent users of the PoC.",

For some like Salesforce it's easy as they publish their model and your CRM team get to add custom fields. You can then pull a source entity such as Customer or Case into your data platform. Other tools like Siebel will have 5,000 tables of which 100 will contain domain data, each of those tables will have 100 of columns so the task here is the identify which tables and columns are relevant - depending on how the system is configured. The final example is Success Factors, here they expose data through reports and APIs. The internal schema is their IP and not shared, but you can find out from the API spec or report engine what you can extract. \n\nMy last 2 projects has kept data for ingestion close to the source with an initial seed load and then the delta loads.  After that we current have a raw data vault which is essentially facts and type 2 history tables. Then we have the business consumption layer which applies any business logic that allows the BI team to create their dashboard. \n\nIf I had asked you to do this then I would not want a generic schema for source but details of what I can get from the source system as raw maintaining their schema. Then its the best way to manage a staging environment that manages the history. \n\nIf you have a number of the source schema ready then it's best to clarify what your manager's expectations are. \n\nWhat is your environment ?",

For auth, traefik provides middleware that you can configure to check credentials with another service (Oauth2proxy is a popular one) or basic auth if you‚Äôre retro\n\nIf you need to control traffic within a k8s cluster (traefik is mainly used as a ingress controller for out of cluster load balancing) you probably want a service mesh like [istio](https://istio.io/). They can be kind of a pain to configure and administer, but it gives you pretty powerful control over network traffic",

This is a mix of type 2, where each new version gets a new id, and type 1, so your fact table might have a ‚ÄúUserId‚Äù which is the id of the user to a single type 2 record, and a ‚ÄúCurrent User Id‚Äù - which may be the user id from the source system where IsCurrent = True in your dimension table.\n\nI recommend only using type 2 on columns you definitely want new records when it changes, but sometimes you get asked for a column in hindsight. You can either risk it, make a new record on a wider range, or all, columns, or keep the audit table of all changes just in case you need to rebuild it.",

And there is no correlation with gender, former education, grades, IQ, nerdiness or all the other factors that people like to count. The only thing I have seen that they all have in common is curiosity, willingness to fail (not fail a course, but like falling of a bicycle, or missing a dance-step and getting up and try again), and a bit of a stubbornness, in that they *want* to fix the problem they currently have!\n\nThose I seen fail are mostly those who give up waaay too soon, or those who doesn't care about making something by themselves, but just want a finished result, so they can get on with other things.

One of the best languages to learn pointers.  C-lang by 95.  \nHtml, while not a language a couple years later with css \nJava and Javascript.  Some xml later and c++.  Little later, obj-c, this was all prior to 2011 when I grew to hate it all.\n\nGuitar. Started in the summer of 88.  Piano not long after that.  Drums in the early 2000s.  It's still my favorite instrument.  Can do a bass but never had the finger strength.  Spent many years off and on teaching music.\n\n1st time at college in fall 96 started algebra 1 and 2, then moved up to trigonometry and geometry.  Never got to Calc summer of 98 and beyond was bad for many years.  Still absolutely adore physics and cosmology. On regret is never picking up chemistry\n\nLinguistics major now focusing on teaching english as a 2nd language or foreign language. Started Spanish in 2004 in Atlanta while working tree service \n\nPicked up Chinese in the fall and spring semester last year\n\nThe summer project was revamped for the entire 2018 cryengine for kingdom come deliverance.  Ripped out all inverse kinetics animation bullshit.  Reverse engineered the entire crisis 2 physics systems with ragdolls, recoil, and hut reactions.  Warhorse had ripped out a good 97 to 98% of the system. That is all xml and lua tagged into a full c++ engine.  Near total overhaul.  Nothing like the original game.\n\nI also enjoy modding other games on the nexus.  Full overhauls for several games now and a couple more deleted. \n\nSome of my hardest programming challenges I have solved in my brain whole I sleep.  Can literally see the code roll past, and when I get up in the morning shit gets to work pretty quick.\n\nAfter a while, you start to think in other languages\n\nI have had this happen with music, programming, and Chinese \n\nIt is awesome \n\nStill can't get hired in the gaming industry.  Tried for more than 20 years.  I ran a mud for 15 years.  Rewrote the entire thing.  Went from 90kb to 8mb to 6mb depending on what year it was. Had hard-core.  Skill based with 20 classes in by 2000. ended with a full random equipment generator and 1000+ skills spells and abilities and a full in game quest and quest reward system by 2003.  Oh, and a planet and elemental system.  And a complete random event system by 2005\n\nBut ya know to this day, because I don't have a degree \n  I don't have any experience getting into the industry .  I pretty much have a doctorate in game design.  Always the same e.   Don't call us we will call you\n\nYes, it rewires your brain, and it is glorious \n\nAnd so many people will never understand that",

Language, art, music, and cultural identity never really interested me bc it felt very fluid and ever morphing with very grey lines. So coding was always likely a very natural path for me. \n\nBut I would say ive had a different outcome in life. Instead of coding/programming as a job it'd been more of a passive hobby for me. Ive gotten exceptionally good at understanding underlying factors and influences that have shaped modern cultures, music, language etc. To the point that writing and expressing my thoughts is likely one of my strongest traits. \n\nBut I think learning how to program ironically really helped with it. Objective oriented programming really helped shape my understanding of repeated actions creating ever growing outcome (loops). Helped me start to compartmentalize and break things down into smaller parts instead of things as a single large thing (objects). Recognizing how two things that are alike can be uniquely different but share a lot of common traits and abilities (inheritance). And lastly the biggest impact, \" if then\" statements. Oh my god it reshaped basic logic for me and how I view people's actions/decisions/fallacies. It made me infinitely more forgiving and compassionate to strangers and their mistakes. I was able to categorize and recognize thousands of what was just instinctive gut feelings into actual logic and language for me. It gave me a weird algorithmic way to categorize the world for me and ground me in a more \"human\" way. It helps me massively predict the outcomes of actions/consequences and think ahead in a way I hadn't considered before.",

Basically, when you ask a question, you should be at a point where you know the information you are looking for, but also know that you can't find it yourself.\n\n\nSo, for example, asking \"how do I commit a change\" is not a good question, because it's vague, would take hours to answer fully and strongly suggests you have not done even basic research.\n\n\nAsking \"What is the URL of the GitHub server\" is a great question - I can answer it instantly, and there is no way you could have found it out yourself (errr - unless it's in the new starter guided in which case you shouldn't have asked it, obviously!).\n\n\nSo, when asking a question (or raising a bug, or anything really) always start with \"What I did\", \"What I expected to happen\" and \"What actually happened\" - change those questions to ones that make sense for the question you are asking, but generally they are a good format for asking for help.\n\n\nPeople want to help - they just don't want to do your job for you.",

        "body": "You can't make programming more exciting because the act of typing text into your computer is inherently tedious and not particularly engaging. So is reading introductory material that's nonspecific, verbose, and has no immediate connection to something you actually care about. What you can do is make the process more interactive, provide faster feedback, and tailor it to your attention span.\n\nInstead of thinking about \"all the cool stuff\", pick one item from the list. Just one, ideally the most exciting one. Then try to make that, and only that. It will probably be way too big and difficult, which is why you need experience building smaller things first. But you don't need these smaller things to be completely unrelated to your project, which is however what you'll get by following standard tutorials.\n\nNo one dreams of making \"hello world\", but even something incredibly complex can be turned into something simple by removing almost all of the details first. That way, what's left will be directly related to the eventual end result and you can see, in your mind, the next steps that will get you closer to the \"real thing\".\n\nEven if you never get there, the process is inherently motivating. You may find that you know exactly what to do, but not how exactly it could be done. That's good, because now you're intrinsically motivated to learn. You need to find out and understand what you don't in order to get further, and you'll automatically know what to ignore (because it doesn't help you go in this direction).\n\nIf you need specific examples, feel free to elaborate on your project ideas. But don't try to follow popular guidance if it isn't working. Most teachers, and the learning resources they create, are bad and won't work for a large proportion of students. There's no universal solution and no replacement for intrinsic motivation. If learning isn't fun on a regular basis, you'll struggle and not everyone can just \"power through\" until it \"gets fun\". That's not a failure, just a mismatch in strategy.\n\nThe good news is that the beginning is by far the most difficult part of learning programming. Once you've attained some level of mastery, motivation comes much easier since being good at something is inherently rewarding.",

With a human language, if you know it well, then you can really express ANY IDEA AT ALL with finesse and comprehensibility. But with programming languages it's not really that way at all. Although formally programming languages that are \"Turing complete\" can be used to express any program, in actual practice, some tasks/types of programs are definitely way easier in some languages than others. \n\nProgramming languages are tools, more like a hammer and a saw. You need to know how to use both of those, based on what task you are going to do. Also there are many types of hammer, many times of saw, just like there are many flavors of some programming languages that resemble each other. When you're first learning, you should learn to use an easy-to-use one, a safe one, etc. Later on, you can learn to use more powerful tools, more specialized tools.\n\nIt is the same in programming, except the tools change frequently and depend a lot on in what domain you are working.\n\nIn Web development for example you're likely to use a lot of JavaScript. In other domains JS is making headway with Node.js but to me it's still not used as much. The other languages you mentioned (PHP, SQL) are that way as well. Most people don't consider HTML a programming language because you can't write a loop, there's no real control flow, etc. It is possible to \"modularize\" HTML though, so there's that. Nowadays though it seems like most people prefer to generate HTML rather than to code it by hand.\n\nAlso SQL is a very specialized language used to query a database. For example, what would \"hello world\" look like in SQL? Can you make a command-line app in SQL? Maybe it's technically possible, but I would not want to maintain such code if you gave it to me. I would much rather maintain the Python version of such a tool.",

Calling another machine code program is as simple as asking the CPU to jump to the address of that program. Of course you need to know that address, but that's what the operating system helps with.\n\nBut the programs (or the compilers that compiled them) still has to agree on a \"calling convention\", like how are arguments transferred to functions. They can for instance be stored in specific registers in the CPU, and then the return value is expected to be in a certain register. Or maybe a single register stores a pointer to the list of arguments, and then the function itself has to extract them from that memory location.\n\nLook into \"calling conventions\" if you want to learn more, and maybe take a look at [https://godbolt.org/](https://godbolt.org/) and analyze how a C program gets converted to machine code - but be warned, it isn't simple :)",

Most languages can read and write any file format, these days (that was less true 50 years ago.)\n\n\nIf a running program written in one language invokes a function written in another language, the caller has to set up the stack frame in the way that's expected by the function being called.

Whatever underlying mechanism C uses to open a file, Python has that feature too.\n\nYes, it's possible to have a language that doesn't have any features to open a file which means you're stuck unless you want to figure how to do it which might require rewriting parts of the compiler (or interpreter) for the language.\n\nSomeone pointed out that Python can make foreign function calls to C. Python's weakness is that it's interpreted. Compared to languages like C, this makes it slow. You would think this would make Python and unlikely choice for doing math (which is computationally intensive), but because Python has this foreign function call specifically to C, then you can implement these numerical calculations in C, but let it be called like a standard Python library.\n\nBut it's because Python has that feature built in. It doesn't have (as far as I know) a foreign function interface to, say, Erlang or Java.\n\nIn general, languages don't have the capability to talk to each other directly.\n\nSomeone pointed out that there is the front end (the browser side) and a back end (the server side), and that this is a way that two languages communicate. This is done indirectly, at least, if you're talking about a web browser.\n\nA front end is going to send a HTTP request which is a protocol to send information to a server. The server responds with that protocol. This means whatever language that front end is written in (Javascript is most common) has to eventually send an HTTP request. The back end needs to decode that request and then run some code in whatever language (there are numerous backend languages) then translate that to a response back to the client end.\n\nTwo languages interact through HTTP, a protocol both sides understand. It's a little like someone who speaks Mandarin talking to someone who speaks Hindi by both speaking in English.\n\nOne reason this happens is the front and back end are on separate machines with separate memory, so this requires some connection, namely, the Internet, and some way to communicate across this connection (HTTP which runs on top of TCP/IP).\n\nWith Python calling a C function through a foreign language interface, then you're running code in the same memory space together. Again, it's a bit uncommon.\n\nYou could have two languages communicate via a socket, which can be done via the same file system or via the Internet. You could invent a protocol to do this, but it wouldn't involve one language making a direct call in the other language, unless that was built into the language itself.\n\nBeginners often think languages talking to one another is cool and that it happens all the time, but it's not the way most people think.",

Its being able to reason about things. Break things down into manageable components. Id your entire idea is a simple manageable thing theres not much to break down.\n\n1. Set up linux on your pc/laptop.\n2. Set up neovim\n3. Add plugins to neovim to allow for things like LSP integration, autocomplete, formatting etc.\n4. Create a tcp server and tcp client in c++. You should be able to establish a connection between the two, enter data in the client, send the data to the server, read the data on the server, write it to standard output,send data back to the client, have the client read it the data and display it.\n\nJust 1 and 2 will improve you leaps and bounds.\n\n\nThis will genuinely improve you more than you will ever know.

Our ability to break things down into the smallest possible parts, research each part, and come up with some solution, probably a terrible one, and then have the drive/ambition/desire to research/experiment how to improve that code you just wrote, before you ultimately realise you will always need to improve the code. And thats the fun. The best SWEs ive met, dont have 1000 functioning apps that have generated billions of pounds. They've just gone extremely deep into onr specific thing. For me its network, hence why I suggest a tcp server/client. I also think its the best project because thats what I honestly have found separates more advanced devs; the ability to understand things at a fundamental level. When you're coding, you're essentially just reading and writing data. But how is that data read/written? The internet is such a massive change to the course of humanity, yet most devs dont know what a packet is. What a protocol really is.

        "body": "OOP is basically mandatory to write good Java and honestly can help you greatly.\n\n\nThe example I like to give is you have to start thinking of your program as different pieces that work together to accomplish a goal. As a piece gets too complex to keep track of, you want to look at good ways to break down what it does. Java sometimes goes too far with this in my opinion but it's a sensible premise to start from.\n\n\nIt's fairly similar to how function design should be done. A function should do ideally one thing very well that takes a relatively small number of lines of code (though it might end up doing a couple of things honestly). But in OOP, we want to consider what those functions are usually working with and put all the similar functions into a class.\n\n\nFor example, classic ATM design. You could build a deposit(account_no, amount) and withdraw(account_no, amount) function and just tie your UI into them. But note that there are a few complicated bits these functions will need to share. Both will need to access and update the database table for your bank account for example. Both primarily work on your account.\n\n\nSo instead of functions, we can build one Account class which takes an account_no as a parameter to the constructor (ie an Account object is representing a specific class in the database) and has methods deposit(amount) and withdraw(amount). Since the Account object knows it's account_no already, there's no need to pass it in again.¬†\n\n\nLikewise, imagine we'll have our database with multiple tables that we will need to access. They all share common tasks though like running a Select or an Update query. As we build out our application, we don't want to keep all this logic in every other object we make. So the Database itself can become an object which knows how to talk to the database. Then the Account can build one or be given one to work with.\n\n\nThe ultimate goal is that every object knows everything it needs to know to operate and other things have to tell it as little as possible. The Database object doesn't need to know how bank accounts work, and the Account object doesn't need to know how the database work. They just need to know how to use what's called the interface: the way we intend for the object to be used by other objects (these are declared public in Java). This is the principle of cohesive class design - all the similar things are in one class and one class only.\n\n\nThe nice part of this is if you swap how the database works, say from MySQL to Oracle, then you just have to redesign your Database object. Your Account object doesnt change at all. This is the idea of loose coupling - your objects rely on the public interface declared, not the internal workings of it.\n\n\nThe best way is just to practice. Build object oriented applications and try to keep them cohesive and loosely coupled. You'll get better with practice.",

So, some people may seem as they are progressing faster and all that but usually its just a pay-off for earlier work they have put in. Whether it was conscious or not.\n\nI have also struggled with comparing too much against others and not focusing on how much I have actually improved compared to the past me. Looking at other people for inspiration is always good, but can also be tricky mentally since you can feel worse about your skill etc.",

That makes the mapping (or function, in the mathematical sense) from inputs to outputs much easier to formally describe and specify. It also makes it much easier to test.\n\nFor another, when a component has state, then its behavior depends on the order of operations that are performed on it. If you want to prove that a component will always behave a certain way, then you have to prove it for all possible orderings of operations. This tends to give you a combinatorial explosion of possibilities. It's not impossible to prove these sorts of properties, but it's something that you don't have to worry about if the component is stateless.\n\nUsually, an application *needs* to have state, in order to do what you want it to do. But by confining the state to the smallest possible \"region\" of the program, you make the both the stateful parts and the stateless parts easier to reason about, compared to how it would be if mutable state was woven throughout the program.\n\nJust as one specific example of this, programs that make heavy use of mutable global variables tend to be much harder to understand and maintain than those that pass parameters and return values around wherever they're needed.",

If it's possible to just substitute values into a computation to get an answer, it's very easy (in theory) to see where something is wrong. Once you introduce the idea that time matters, e.g. a value can be different at different points in time depending on what point a machine (of some description) is at in the computation, it starts to get much harder to debug things. Now imagine a large program/system with millions of bits of state, changing frequently. If the code doesn't produce the desired behaviour for some combination of those states, you have a bug, and it can be very hard to track down.\n2. Following on from the above, in the context of OOP vs Functional paradigms, OOP is (most agree) about associating behaviour with data. Grouping state with the code that changes it, usually modelled after some real-world thing (but not necessarily). In this way it encourages statefulness and mutation of state. It attempts to balance this with encapsulation (usually enforced at compile time), so that only certain code can access certain state. But that code is called by other code, so the positive effect of this can be limited. Contrasted with functional, where we try to write as much of the program without depending on state, meaning functions become \"pure\" (no reliance on state, no side effects, etc.). We need side effects and state changes, it's what we sell to customers, but we can push them to the very edges of the program, and wall off code that handles the messy stuff, hopefully making the rest easier to reason about and less prone to bugs. Just like OOP there is a spectrum. You can dip your toes in, or go full on.\n\nEdit, just seen you added 3. Think I basically covered it though so I'll leave it there for now. Also, interestingly, some languages are now turning off statefulness by default and having you opt into it, e.g. Rust with mut to enable assignment (distinct from initialising the value)",

But that doesn't hold for the text editor - when you load a text to edit, you don't set the state of the entire application, only the \"data-model\" that it manipulates. All the rules, all the behaviour of the program would be the same as if any other text had been loaded, and thus not directly affecting the state. The state would be like if part of the text was selected, or a dialog window was opened, or a context-menu was active.\n\nStatefulness isn't necessarily considered bad - but the more states you have, the higher complexity you are dealing with, and the higher the risk for unexpected behaviour. If you have 32 variables that can all impact the operation of the application in different ways, you have 4 billion variations, and you can't possibly test every single one of them. So the less statefulness the better.\n\nOOP can encourage statefulness because it encourages objects to be able to manipulate themselves, and store their data, i.e. their state internally. An object \"remembers\" what happened to it the last time you called some method, and behaves differently the next time, depending on previous method-calls. Pure functions do not alter their behaviour depending on state - they always behave the exact same.\n\nStatelessness is preferred because that means that the application always behaves the exact same, and always in a predictable way, thus errors can't suddenly happen when a previous un-encountered state occurs. If new errors are found, they happen because of specific input, and it can be replicated and fixed. Whereas when errors happen in stateful applications, you might not be able to replicate the exact circumstances that caused the error.\n\nAt least that is what we hope and wish for - but of course states can't be completely eliminated, and errors and bugs still show up from time to time in any kind of application.",

State is the definition of an object in the OOP sense.\n\n1 and 3:  Stateless operations are trivially parallelizable and for practical purposes obviate the memory bus part of the architecture to focus on control flow and data transformation.\n\nLet us back up a little:  Fundamentally every program is a transformation of data.  At all scales, this is what a program is.  From the macro to the function level, a program / routine / subroutine/ function, has input, performs a transformation, and provides output.  The \"provides transformation and provides output\" is the key part.  This is true even in places where it's somewhat unexpected:  Gluing APIs together is largely taking the data from one API, performing a transformation, and then outputting it to a second API.\n\nThis is the underlying premise for microservices, for instance.  They perform a single small transformation on data and output it for the next consumer.\n\nNow, let's consider a matrix consisting of all stateful branches.  This is a little opaque to think about at first, so I'll give a concrete example:  In NetHack you can mix potions, or pour potions on items, drink them, etc, and essentially do any X to any item and any potion that you can do with *any other item*.  If you have a matrix where all items are represented as rows, and the behavior of an item interacting with another item is defined by a function entry in that matrix, then you can see that the number of interactions and state transformations of the data grows exponentially with each item (for n-items it's n\\^2 possible state transformations).\n\nIt is possible to show that all stateful operations in a program can be represented this way, and so the complexity of a program grows exponentially as the number of possible distinct state-branches it can take on a given stateful object grows.\n\nSome programs, and some styles of programming (especially game programming) typically lend themselves to managing and processing large amounts of state.  With a resulting large amount of bugs.  It is difficult and takes a lot of engineering work to parallelize that in a consistent and meaningful way, and there are multiple approaches to doing so (the most ubiquitous in my experience has literally been writing your own IPC layer... jfc I hate game devs).\n\nThe graphics pipeline can nominally be viewed as a (mostly) stateless series of programs.  Ignoring some advanced counterexamples, vertex and pixel shaders inherently take input, provide output, and never operate on state at all.  But this isn't quite completely stateless, because the graphics card / driver has a set of states that you have to set for those programs to operate the intended way.  It has *minimal* state, but is not entirely stateless.\n\nThat minimal state affecting control and inputs though minimizes the difficulty in parallelizing shader operations, and once configured globally the programs are trivially parallelizable.\n\nSo, statefulness is \"bad\" from a philosophy of programming perspective where an increase in state and the number of transformations on that state increases the complexity of a program quadratically and decreases the composability and functional-ness of the program.  OOP is by definition state and operations.\n\nBUT, the truth is that some programs require state, and/or are easier to reason about statefully.  And where the rubber meets the road, you do what you need to do to get the data tranformed correctly and within acceptable external tolerances.\n\nEd: I forgot to address the side-effects problem.  State implies functions have side effects to transform persistent state.  That's the entire point of functions on persistent state.  Side-effects can sometimes be very hard to see or understand, making it harder to reason about complex programs (duh) and breaking data/transformation locality.",

        "body": "That doesn't make much sense, because there's no single cognitive ability that would allow one to program successfully without being able to understand enough to create your own solutions (however poor they may be at first).\n\nIf you're talking about actual deficiencies, like those in working memory (e.g., if one has ADHD it is often impaired) then that's a very real challenge, but not one you couldn't work around. I know excellent programmers who are technically learning-disabled, they just take more time and are slower but they can still somehow do if after they gained enough practice.\n\nI think it would be worth investigating what forms of representation for information you prefer in other contexts. Usually, a combination of material works better than any specific one, but there are large individual differences. If you're using code as a reference, that is entirely different than using code to understand a concept. In fact, there are (at least) four different types of resources that people may use while programming and they all serve different purposes:\n\n1. Introductory material/tutorials: Separates information into buckets, reducing cognitive load (pre-selection and focus of attention)\n2. \"How to do X\" guides and other instructions: Complete \"recipes\" for how to do something you don't know how to do exactly, like algorithms that can be mixed and matched, or adapted to your actual needs\n3. References: No explanation, just to remember things that aren't in your memory (syntax, functions, conditions, ...)\n4. In-depth guides and explanations: Used to form connections and help you understand related details, to gradually expand your knowledge graph\n\nSome common issues I've seen are people focusing extensively on one specific type of resource, picking the wrong type for a given situation, trying to understand every detail instead of finding other resources to compare, or trying to do everything at once instead of just one individual step.\n\nThe second big issue might be the complete lack of visualization. Humans are inherently visual creatures and our visual system is the most bandwidth-heavy of all, it's really fast and (within certain limits) excellent at relaying information to your brain that would be more difficult to get in the ol' noggin by any other means. You can draw stuff on paper, in apps like EcaliDraw, or use oldschool graphics programs like Paint. Diagrams like MermaidJS also work but are usually too much effort for everyday tasks. \n\nFor some people, explaining ideas in language may be helpful. This takes more time and doesn't work unless you know roughly what you want to do, but it can be a great aid in clarifying your ideas. Even if you later delete the text, you can try explaining what you are doing and what you want to do as if someone was reading it later. Or find a real person/rubber duck and talk out loud instead.\n\nFinally, there is a difference between \"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" learning. Many regular people seem to prefer the latter, where you start with a high-level idea go down further as needed. This has the benefit of reducing the cognitive load as you get to ignore all the low-level details, but this simplification can make true understanding much more difficult than necessary. It is commonly seen in math where the lecturer knows all the details and sometimes \"forgets\" to mention them or just glances over important topics, leaving students utterly confused. The reverse is also possible, and of course you can try to attack each problem from both angles. I suspect autistic people have an easier time with bottom-up approaches as the details are what allows them to really understand, while it may be overkill for someone else (but this is purely an anecdotal observation). You need to find your own preferred style and see what exactly makes it easiest for you to understand the actual problem, before you encode it into an executable program specification.\n\nPersonally, I found that \"low IQ\" or working memory deficiencies etc. may manifest in that one can't as easily (or rapidly) step through each part of a given problem in their mind, or might make more errors while doing so. But that still doesn't prevent you from doing it on paper or using any other medium, and you might find that someone who seems \"stupid\" is actually quite adept at visualizing graphically in their head instead, or they're great at teaching the material to others and thereby learn it themselves, etc.\n\nI would assume that people with severe cognitive disabilities who are \"brainess\", as you put it, have neither the capacity nor motivation to ask for programming help on Reddit. So my best guess would be a mismatch in approach or missing skillsets, not a lack of general problem-solving ability. Abstract problem solving is more difficult than doing it in context; you could try reframing the problem so it represents specific instances.",

Your'e asking a good question. \nThe answers vary - rarely do you see a program or series of interconnected code that has been written by \na single individual - if it was, then you learn their structure and approach and it's almost like a distinctive fingerprint. \n\nMore common, there have been a large number of people maintaining or enhancing the code and they \nall have different styles, even if there are strict standards from the company.  Then, the code is difficult to \nunderstand unless they have commented well - here is an example: \n\na1++;       // increment counter\n\nvs. \n\nmax_error_count++;  // Keep track of maximum errors detected during this transaction; \n\nvs. \n\nfoobar++; \n\n\na1 is a poor example, but foobar++; is worse.  No comments, no intuitive name. \nmax_error_count at least gives you some information and the comment helps. \n\nI've been called back to a company after 20+ years to work on code that is still running, and it's instantly recognizable \nto me what i wrote and what others have written - but it's all understandable because of documentation and comments. \n\nGood luck on your journey.",

        "body": "Fair warning, this is going to be very long.\n\n\nI prefer the Black Box Method to writing code. I think a lot of developers do this without really thinking about it. No matter what the program is, you should be able to break it down into some smaller steps, some important operations that need to happen for the program to work. The Black Box Method basically just involves creating placeholder functions for the more complicated operations, then coming back later to define the details of those functions. You start with the big picture, make sure it's behaving like you want, then work your way down to the finer details.\n\n\nFor example, let's say you need to build a program that can read a bunch of names from an input file and update some data files using the information from that file. It's something I've had to do at my job quite a few times now. Immediately, what are the two big things we know it needs to do?\n\n1. Read the input file\n2. Update the relevant data files\n\nSo you write whatever boilerplate you need to get going, then in your main() function, or wherever your program begins, you simply write two lines (I'm gonna be using Pythonic pseudocode from here on out):\n\n\n    def main():\n        parse_input_file()\n        update_data_files()\n\n\nAnd the key is that you don't have to define them just yet. I normally just have these placeholders display a message like \"Parsing input file...\" and \"Updating data files...\" to make things easy to debug. You can do a sanity check here and run your new program to make sure the messages are displaying in the correct order. This would be especially important to do if this is being integrated into a larger system. Make sure your program is actually running.\n\nAnyway, now you can start breaking down these functions individually. Let's focus on the input parsing. This is where we should start asking questions like, \"how do we know which file to read?\", \"what is the format of this input file?\", \"how should we store the data that we read?\". Immediately, we have some information to figure out and some decisions to make.\n\nFor the first question, let's assume that we want to prompt the user for the filename (as opposed to passing it in as a parameter to the program, like using argv in Python). For the second, let's assume that the input file is a plain text file that stores each data entry on a new line, and each line contains a username, first name, last name, and email address, delimited by commas. This type of information should be provided to you by your professor/manager/client/lead developer/someone else. The third question is more of a personal preference, and this is where your knowledge of data structures becomes important. You should base it on what's efficient and easy to maintain, but there are often many correct approaches, so do whatever makes the most sense to you. Let's keep things simple and store the data in an array of tuples for now.\n\nSo, thinking about this logically, in order to parse the input file, we need to:\n\n1. Prompt the user for a file (what should we do if it doesn't exist?)\n2. Read each line of that file, and for each line:\na. Split the line using a comma as the delimeter\nb. Clean up the data (if necessary) and build a tuple with it\nc. Append that tuple to the array\n\nYour program might look something like this now:\n\n\n    def parse_input_file():\n        parsed_data = []\n        input_file = prompt_input_file()\n        if exists(input_file)\n            for line in input_file.readlines():\n                data_tuple = build_tuple_from_line(line)\n                if data_tuple:  # make sure data exists\n                    parsed_data.append(data_tuple)\n        return parsed_data\n\n\nAnd now that we've decided to give this function a return value, we can go back and update the main function:\n\n\n    def main():\n        parsed_data = parse_input_file()\n        if parsed_data:  # make sure data exists\n            update_data_files(parsed_data)\n\n\nNote that we also defined two new placeholder functions. One of them is build_tuple_from_line() which takes as input the text from the line and outputs a tuple representing that data. If it fails to parse for whatever reason, we can return an empty tuple, and nothing will be added to the array. The other is prompt_input_file() which takes no inputs and outputs an object with a readlines() member. (There is also the exists() function, but I am assuming that one is imported.) Hopefully you have an idea now of how this might continue. You can start breaking down each function from here.\n\n\nNo matter what you're doing, you can always break it down into smaller steps. Focus on the core features and start with the parts you understand best. Leave the more complicated parts as abstract functions until you're ready to get into the weeds. You might find along the way that you took an inefficient approach, but it's almost always better just to get something that works to begin with, then you can always go back and optimize later. Like I know the approach I just laid out is very inefficient with memory. If you know that will be a concern, then this would be the perfect time to make adjustments before things get too complicated.\n\n\nThat got way longer than I anticipated, but hopefully it's somewhat helpful. I'm not an expert by any means, but I've seen some decent success as a programmer, and this is the approach that works best for me. Best of luck in your journey! Hope you become a kickass developer someday!",

        "body": "At the beginning I often struggled with translating e.g. homework tasks into code. I then read a beginner programming book which has used C#. The programming language isn't important as the first two chapters were the most relevant for me. The first chapter talked about why you want to learn to program, what possible fields of work are there.\n\nThe second one was about algorithmic thinking. In general most programming language  \nare built on 3 concepts:\n\n\\- Sequence (A sequence of actions that are executed in order of their appearance)\n\n\\- Branching (Actions are executed based on certain conditions)\n\n\\- Repetition (repeating an action until a condition is met. loops and recursion are different  \nforms of repetition)\n\nMost lectures only present you the synthax of e.g. an if-statement or of a loop in a certain language. But they don't tell you when to use these parts of the language. In the book they were talking about looking for keywords in the text or the requirements.\n\nFor example: If you see the word \"if\" in a text then it is a strong indicator for branching  \nas \"if\" implies there are at least two options to handle. \"As long as\" might be an indicator for a loop. If there are many separate actions mentioned one after each other it is a strong indicator for a sequence of actions that you have to perform to reach a certain goal. For each of the actions you could write one single program instruction or a function to group multiple connected instructions in one place.\n\nIn the book they give examples like opening a door where you execute an algorithm to achieve your goal. The sequence can't be changed as you can't enter the room without opening the door. In programming you have to think about which steps have to be performed first in order for your code to solve a problem.\n\npressDoorHandle()\n\nopenDoor()\n\nenterRoom()\n\ncloseDoor()\n\nOf course this is easy when you get university homework as most of the time they try to tell you as accurate as possible what you should do. If talking to a client you actually have to find out what the requirements even are.\n\nOf course this is programming on a micro-level as we are dealing with the specific steps but you can apply this also on higher levels of abstractions when you describe how a user e.g. interacts with a system like a website when he e.g. creates an account, deletes a post.\n\nWhen programming I often use pen and paper or I write comments (pseudo-code) like this:\n\n\\# For each pdf-document do:\n\n\\# Open pdf-document\n\n\\# Extract values with a regular expressions\n\n\\# write them into table\n\n\\# close document\n\nAfter writing the pseudo-code I add the real code below the comments. This way I can focus on solving the problem without having to delve into the specifics of the programming language that I use (this is something you can google easily).\n\nThere are more tips about thinking techniques for problem solving but I have to go do groceries now:)). Feel free to ask any questions. Good luck!\n\n  \nEDIT: Book recommendation: Thinking like a programmer by Spraul it's a book on problem solving techniques. It uses C++ but this isn't important. Use any language you want. It's more about understanding the concepts rather than the language.",

Pick a simple project to work on, it doesn't have to be a million dollar idea, it could just be a copy of something else, and then problem solve through each individual issue. Force yourself to think about how you would approach starting out, difficulties, do google searches, try things, maybe ask an AI as a last resort but with a very specific prompt that details what you have tried. When you eventually solve issues, it will feel much more rewarding like you solved a puzzle. This is what drives me personally, and when one is solved I keep building until the next issue, rinse repeat.

There are several ways you could go.\n\nFRONT END DEVELOPER: Be a master of HTML, XML, JSON. Magician of CSS and commander of Javascript. And you must know working well with Photoshop or a similar program (like GIMP which is free).\n\nDATABASE DEVELOPER: Master of SQL. You must be able to effortlessly write 3rd Normalization form (at least) queries in your sleep. You must be able to optimize SQL queries for fun. You should know database administration to a degree.\n\nBACK-END DEVELOPER (ANY LEVEL): You must know what is Object Oriented Programming. You must know and use at least 3 Design Patterns (but be sure to read the book).\n\nBACK-END DEVELOPER LOOSE CANNON: Know PHP but know it real good. Last time I used PHP was in 2004, before I get my first professional development work. I was designing small websites. After that it evolved a lot. There is one framework called Laravel which from what I hear is very Popular. Be sure you know how to build web apps with it. This does not save you from learning HTML and basic Javascript with some CSS. And SQL is a must. Loose cannon level means working for you as a freelancer or working for a start-up. Nothing wrong with it. They give you great freedom of technological choice which lots of people love. Yes, PHP is not widely used nowadays but it's still used a lot. You could learn Perl instead, which is a super-strong language and I've built my career with it, but I won't recommend it. If you want to easily be able to get a job - learn Python. Python evolved a lot. I first learnt it and used it professionally in 2007 but in 2025 Python is a whole constellation of itself and I adore it. If you go the Python way - learn Django.\n\nBACK-END DEVELOPER CORPORATE DOG: You must be a master of either: C#, Java or Python. You must feel fluent in at least one of the popular cloud platforms: Azure, GCP or AWS. You must be able to write CI/CD pipelines. I have no experience in C#, so don't ask and last time used Java many years ago. For Python - Django and NumPy are a must here. You should be into AI/LLM and Machine Learning here.\n\nCoding editors: Yes, learn how to use VSCode, but also learn vim or neovim (or emacs).\n\nSide project: Learn how to make presentations in Power Point or a similar app.\n\nSo geographically speaking - last years what they loved in North America seems spreading into Europe as well and vice versa. But choose a path you want to go and choose technologies accordingly.\n\nLast word and probably the most important: Winning a technical job interview nowadays is way harder. Make account on Leetcode or Hackerrank and start doing the exercises there. Which means - LEARN DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS! These websites will help.\n\nGood luck!",

Learning takes time, so you must also learn to become process-oriented by finding ways to make that time rewarding as opposed to being goal-oriented and only caring about the final outcome, because the latter gives you very little in terms of experience which is what you should be taking out of your learning journey. Yes, researching how to build everything from scratch takes a very long time in the beginning, but as you gain experience, the need to do that will diminish, you will gain intuition, and over time you will build a strong knowledge foundation that will serve you much better in the long run than the brittle thing that you will build if you keep approaching learning with your current mindset. You don't need to go any deeper than the public instruction set native to your computer as below that one can hardly call it programming, but in the beginning you should really aim at forming a strong notion of how things really work all the way down there.\n\n> My question is: How do you usually learn about the tools, libraries, or techniques that already exist, so you don‚Äôt waste time building everything from scratch? Is there a strategy or habit for this, or is it just experience over time?\n\nI don't. In personal projects I just learn everything from scratch, and enjoy the whole process, because the point is to learn, not to finish the project, and the time spent learning isn't really wasted time. As a beginner to some technology there's also a very high chance that my first approach to solving the problem will likely be a mess so it won't be of much use, so that's never my goal. Lastly it's also very likely that, in the research process required to actually learn how things work, I will come across existing projects that already do it right, but instead of cheating my way by just taking advantage of the existing solution I go down the rabbit hole and try to wrap my head around the rationale of that solution, and don't consider the problem solved until I successfully tackle it myself.\n\nMy advice to you is to stop coming up with excuses to avoid learning when that's exactly what you should be doing. High-level development might feel rewarding to you because it gives you the impression that you are accomplishing a lot with very little, but in the end you are also only gaining a superficial experience, and without a solid foundation it's very easy for abstractions to create unexpected complex problems that you lack the intuition to solve on your own, so don't cheat your way out of the learning process. With large language machine learning models you have free access to teachers that can easily break down complex concepts for you and never get tired of answering your requests to explain things from different perspectives, which is a commodity that I didn't get to enjoy during most of my career, so definitely take advantage of that, not to write your code ant cheat your way out of problems, but to truly help you wrap your head around the solutions.",

        "body": "Not really an answer to your question, and I dunno if this will help you, but I use a mental trick when I'm coding recursion (e.g. when traveling trees or linked lists or deeply nested markup language structures).\n\nI imagine that there are a bunch of people standing around, each of whom manages a single node in the nested structure. When the recursive method is called, each person has a list of information they are handed (the argument list), knowledge of the specific node's properties (its attributes, its list of children, maybe a link to its parent, whatever is there), and tasks to perform. That person knows NOTHING about the rest of the list, the other nodes, etc.\n\nThen I just imagine the person doing the task needed and then handing off information to the next node.\n\nSilly example: I have a tree structure with a node that has a name and links to its own children. Some unknown person needs a big long list of only the names that start with A or B appended to a list.\n\nSo, as the person responsible for a single node, when it's my turn, I get the A&B name list that's already been started by whoever is above me and the node's properties in the argument list (or in my own object's properties if the recursive function is baked into the object and my own method was called). I check my own node's name and if it starts with A or B, I stick it on the list. Then, I \"hand off\" the list to each of my node's children so they can do the same (i.e. I call the method for the kids the same way my parent called it for me).\n\nObviously this example is simple, but when I get something more complicated like aggregating values, interacting with both parent and children, using shared resources, reversing results, etc., this method helps me isolate my thinking to a single node.\n\nHint: first build your code as if your node has a parent and at least two kids. Then re-run it in your head as if you're the top-level node and make sure you have what you need to hand off to the first kids. Then re-run it in your head as if you don't have any kids to make sure you return properly.",

It sounds like you have memorized solutions, and all of a sudden you see that it is no longer about memorizing a specific solution, but understanding what lies beneath, so you can write your own solution.\n\nIf you draw the structure of a linked list, draw what happens when you insert a node, remove a node, add a node to the beginning vs the end, etc. writing pseudocode for what happens should be fairly straightforward. And translating that pseudocode to actual programming language is even simpler.\n\nBut if you try to remember the solution in a specific programming language without having done the work prior, like you don't really understand the *what* and the *why*, but focus entirely on the *how* \\- they you'll have a very hard time. \n\nLook beyond programming languages, and try to learn what a linked list actually is, how operations are defined, and why they are that way.

A really good chef might show how they make something, but then you ask, how do you know this, how do you know that? How did you cut that chicken? They want to get to the point when they make something, not teach you all the basics of cooking.\n\nSimilarly, you want real-world code. That's difficult code. People aren't writing bubble sort by itself, something so self-contained and short that it can be explained. Also, when you ask an expert to explain something, unless they have experience teaching, they will skip over many detail that they assume you already know (but you may not). They may use a bunch of terminology that have no idea what they mean.\n\nThis is the problem with one-way communication. How much should an expert assume you know. At some point, if they have to tell you why a nested loop words, then they are spending more time teaching you the basics of programming, and not talking about the project the build.\n\nThey have videos of people coding, but then you watch them click this, type that, etc. They barely say anything so you get nothing from watching even though many beginners want  to see a real coder code until they realize it's like watching a real chess player play chess. It can be incredibly difficult for a master chess player say why they make certain moves. They can tell you why some moves are dumb and they see things you don't, but unless you start to play and get in those situations, watching an expert doesn't help.\n\nTo be fair, chess is a super extreme example, but at least you get the sense that even if you study for a year, you still couldn't figure out why a top chess player makes the move they do.\n\nIn effect you're saying\n\n> I want real-world code, but something super simple that I can understand, then explain all the detail and the thinking behind it as if I were five years old.\n\nMost experts explaining their code wouldn't do it at that level, but even if they could, they'd invariably leave something out that you would want explained.

Production code is often heavily abstracted and what you'd need to read to understand it isn't usually all on the screen at once. You're calling different services, using dependency injection, and other stuff that isn't easy to understand if you're trying to take it in all at once. \n\nMy recommendation would be to learn the basics of Python or JS, whichever you want, and then find a tutorial where you code along with the instructor while they build an actual project. If you go to Udemy, Academind has courses that follow that pattern. Their React course is particularly good and there are a few sections of that course where Max (the instructor) walks you through projects like that, and then challenges you later to try it on your own. It's a long course but it's worth the time (assuming you want to learn React.) They also have courses for Node and Python. \n\nGood luck to you.",

There are a couple ways, one of which is to loop over each character in a word and to push the current character into an array from the front.\n\nYou could also just simply concatenate the letters with the current letter being added at the front of the reversed string.\n\nLast, you need to compare the original and reversed strings.\n\nWhat definitely is important as well is to *sanitize* the case, e.g. make everything uppercase or lowercase.",

Luckily you have some test-cases already for palindromes and non-palindromes, so you can test your procedure and probably fix many bugs already.\n\nIf you want to get really \"serious\" about testing, then you can even take a break and write a separate program (not required, of course), that generates long palindromes and long non palindromes, and can use that as input to \"stress test\" your final procedure. For such a problem this is probably overkill, but for building an \"industrial strength\" library or program where there are strict performance requirements this kind of thing is often done.\n\nIn any case don't forget to test edge cases, for example is the empty string a palindrome? Maybe it's not defined anywhere, but as a programmer you have to handle that possibility appropriately, either by defining a safe default (e.g. \"\" IS or IS NOT a palindrome by arbitrary fiat) or else return an error, saying you need at least one character to determine palindromeness/palindromitivity.",

Most beginner programming problems are like this, I mean really everything is like this.\n\nSo like, the way you would check if ‚Äúracecar‚Äù is a palindrome (it is) would basically be to look at the first letter and see if it matches the last letter.  And then see if the 2nd letter matches the 2nd to last letter (and of course when I say ‚Äúletter‚Äù‚Ä¶ I guess I should be saying character, if it should be able to handle anything that is technically a palindrome I guess), and then check the 3rd letter matches the 3rd to last letter and so on.\n\nIf EVERY comparison returns true, then the result is true (it is a palindrome).  If the you ever get a false at any point, you immediately return false, because that proves it isn‚Äôt a palindrome.\n\nYou could of course have to handle all the little details, and make sure invalid things never happen.  So like you have to set up the loops correctly to not get any out of bounds error on the string you‚Äôre working with.  And also you could notice things like how you only have to check half of the word, because you‚Äôre checking the first half against the back half.  So setting a loop to go through the entire word would needlessly double check everything.  But you have to make sure not to mess up and only check just under half the word, so you should do half the word plus one character (just to be safe).\n\nEtc.  But yea the part you need to practice the most is the first part.  Figuring out how to actually solve the problem (forgetting about programming completely.  Like literally just figure out how to determine if a word is a palindrome by yourself, or whatever the problem is), this is generally the hardest part.  And then figuring out how to translate this solution into code (this is generally the easiest part).  And then you have to deal with making sure you‚Äôve handled all the edge cases and whatnot correctly (probably 2nd hardest part).",

All programs operate on information that exists in some form of storage, which the program instructions manipulate (read, write, modify, compare, ...) to implement solutions to the problem you're trying to solve.\n\nTherefore, understanding the data means you will understand the problem. That's a requirement to implement any solution. The actual programming work is almost irrelevant in the sense that you might as well do it on paper, or on a blackboard/whiteboard, etc. Only the implementation is language-dependent, but the problem itself isn't usually - unless it's an artificial problem introduced by limitations of the system, programming environment, libraries, tools, etc.\n\nUsing your palindrome example: What is the actual problem? Well, what is the data? Presumably, you're given a string of text. You assume it has some known encoding, probably ASCII (or Unicode), so that there is a specific number for each letter/code point. There's also the notion of a position because the words ABC and CBA are not identical. A position is just another number that represents where in the word the letter (represented by the first number) actually should appear.\n\nOK, so what is a palindrome? Well, it's a word (sequence of numbers + position) that just so happens to not change if you swap two letters that have the same \"distance\" from the beginning and end. But if positions are numbers and distances are required, can't you just use the absolute position for each letter (from *both* sides) and check that it's the same, for every letter? Sure, that is probably one solution - though it may not be what you need, or too difficult to do in a given programming language. Another approach is to just swap the entire word, and check that both versions are the same. This is simpler to understand but arguably less efficient.\n\nYou may have special cases, where the word has an odd number of letters. What now? Well, one basic way is to add conditionals, like \"if it's odd, do this. If even, do that\". Often it pays to think harder and realize, in this case, that it makes no difference - the same algorithm \"just works\" and so you need not complicate your solution. If the problem is too difficult, remove special cases. In code, you can write `assert` or similar or even just a `TODO` comment, then revisit that part later.\n\nA solution is different from its implementation in code. If you can't solve the problem that's an entirely different issue than not being able to implement the solution (\"write the code\"), or writing complicated/slow/insecure/incorrect code, for that matter. How do you solve problems? By transforming data, one step at a time.",

If nothing comes to your mind right now, then hopefully the 3-6 months you just spent on Exercism+codecrafters gave you lots of ideas. But either way, try to do something without guidance.\n\nAfter all that, try to maybe contribute your own bugfixes or features on a GitHub repo that you love.

I'm not sure I agree with the way though.\n\nIn the good old days, you would learn programming on a calculator, first in a basic-like or forth-like language. Then possibly switched to Saturn or 68K assembly. When getting on a computer you had all the skills needed to start C or Pascal and x86 assembly on DOS, and you knew the computer rather well.\n\nToday there are layers and layers of abstraction, but it's still possible to learn from the basics. And yes, I do think the basics are still C and assembly, and not Python.\n\nEveryone is afraid of C because everyone started with a language that provided everything and forgives everything. It's understandable. Start with dangerous low level stuff. Then when you have a good mental model, move away from it.",

Learning one lanuage and transitioning to another is all about language specific rules, syntax, methods etc but the mental model remains the same. Its something i realised not too long ago (only started learning to code in jan so still fresh), early on i was trying to remember everything and then relised i need to remember less and understand more. Unfortunately the concept of thinking like a programmer and real problem solving skills doesnt get effectively communicated in courses. \n\nI think the issue of learning syntax 'too early' stems from general impatience and not understanding what programming entails. People want to see themseleves code, probably dont want to spend the first few lessons building those mental models even though it is a crucial aspect.\n\nAs i was reading the article, i realised this is equally applicable in learning a new codebase or framework. Read through and focus on the logic, the data flow, the why behind the what. Then when you understand why it is the way it is, go back and read the syntax, the specific methods used.\n\nInteresting read, thanks.",

These are **not** books teaching you how to program. These are books for people who can already program, teaching you that specific language. *The Rust Programming Language* is a book like this. \n\nYou want to find something like ‚ÄúLearning to Program with Python‚Äù, ‚ÄúBeginning Programming with JavaScript‚Äù. To my knowledge nobody has written a book like that that uses Rust. \n\nAnd I can understand why. Rust has a lot of difficult concept which are unique to it, meaning that if you want to teach generalizable programming skills to a new programmer, it‚Äôs a poor choice. Rust is also a language designed for building low level systems, which will generally require programmers to have fairly advanced general computer knowledge, and while you *can* use Rust for anything, it‚Äôs bread and butter isn‚Äôt short scripting tasks like you‚Äôd usually try to teach somebody first learning to program. \n\nAll this isn‚Äôt to say you should give up. Rust is a great programming language, and I have a lot of love for it. But I will say you are probably making things harder for you than they need to be by starting with it as your first language, mostly because of the lack of educational material for you. I would strongly recommend trying to learn something which has more accessible introduction material, and then come back to Rust after a few months. You‚Äôll find it‚Äôs much much easier. \n\nI would maybe recommend trying C. You don‚Äôt seem shy about a challenge, and it has a ton of material aimed at new beginners, and also when you return to programming in Rust you‚Äôll have a completely new appreciation for why Rust is weird in the way it is, being as those are mostly ways to avoid pitfalls you can fall into while coding in C and C++.\n\nEdit: reading some of the other replies and I‚Äôll also say the people who recommend you start with Rust over C originally either don‚Äôt know there are no good beginning programming with Rust material or are people who forget how difficult learning to code is from scratch.",

And algorithms are a math concept.\n\nMost likely what people mean when they say you \"don't need DSA\" is, you don't necessarily need a complete understanding of advanced DSA theory and a mastery of LeetCode bullshit to be a reasonably effective programmer. Now obviously the more you advance in your career, the more important that's going to be, some of the theoretical stuff starts to become practical. And \"prestigious\" tech companies may be on the cutting edge of some of the work where that knowledge is useful, especially with the amount of data they deal with. But you can have a fulfilling career in programming without ever knowing what Ukkonen's algorithm is.",

And outside help is perfectly valid. \n\nFor most devs, DSA stuff is really just for interviews a way to weed out people that don't know how to code and expose some other traits like how you handle problems. \n\nFor prestigious companies, it's the same, only more competitive so you need to practice to give better answers than your competitors. It's not really that they are going to get hired and start working in that. \n\nThe knowledge that devs need is really things like architecture and design patterns.

Do they know anything about TCP/IP or DNS? Can they use Git/GitHub? Do they really appreciate what TypeScript gives us versus plain JavaScript? Do they have any sense of what React is actually doing under the hood that would let them debug an application. \n\nConsidering the time commitment you say you are willing to dedicate I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable to recommend you use some of that time to read something like **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective** by Randal Bryant, there is a pdf of it as the top result from Google. \n\nThe hallmark of a self taught person on any subject is that they never learned the ‚Äúboring parts‚Äù. Musicians who don‚Äôt know their keys and scales, programmers who don‚Äôt know what a subnet mask is or their algorithms and data structures. \n\nAlso, you probably aren‚Äôt going to be able to just be a ‚Äúfront end developer‚Äù without a degree. If you work at a place that is happy to just have you work on React code and know nothing of the backend or operations or anything else, I would be surprised. I think you should expect to have to have at least superficial full stack knowledge. You should be able to set up a simple monolithic CRUD backend that can make simple SQL requests to a database using one of the following:\n- Express (JavaScript)\n- Django or Flask (Python)\n- Spring (Java)\n- ASP.NET (C#)\nWithout credentials you‚Äôll have to work much harder at developing a portfolio and this is going to be easier if your sites can have at least some backend functionality. \n\nThis might all sound like a lot to do in one year, and that‚Äôs because it is. People do not usually go from zero to employed in a year, certainly not these days. Consider a two to three year time line at the minimum imo. \n\nEnsure that after you watch these YouTube videos you are then actually coding. If you aren‚Äôt able to go beyond what they are showing you in the video you aren‚Äôt really learning to code, it just feels like it. This is ‚Äútutorial hell‚Äù, and it‚Äôs what actually doing assignments in school is designed to get you through. Consider asking an AI to generate you a school assignments to practice based on what you‚Äôve covered. \n\nGet comfortable with this website: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ \nThese are the closest thing to official documentation for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and gaining comfort in reading these will give you an important edge over other people.

Pattern matching *alone* makes me miss it when I use other languages. Interestingly, it's the most \"admired\" but only the 6th most \"desired\" language.\n\nAs nice as it is, it suffers from limited practicality - I rarely use it outside of toy projects at home, because practical software engineering leverages ecosystems and the Rust ecosystem is still immature. It can interop well enough, but in my experience doing interop with C/C++ and JavaScript (via WebAssembly) maintaining the interop boundary is more painful than just ditching the language entirely for the project.\n\nPython is an \"easy\" language to learn - you cover the important programming fundamentals of control flow and abstraction without having to muck around with compiler toolchains, type systems, static guards, etc..., which is awesome. Those are all important things to learn but pretty overwhelming up front.\n\nJS has two pretty massive advantages that make it popular in application development, both which come with its ties to web technology: (1) it works on *every single dang device*, and the installation process for web apps is \"click link, load page\" which is delightfully low-friction for devs and users, and (2) it comes with HTML+CSS, which are *incredible* tools for writing UIs.",

Websites make up a huge portion of what people do with computers so that alone gives it a major place. Asides for that you can use JavaScript as a server side language, and because of its role in frontend web dev people have increasingly used it to make the backend of websites also so they can do it all in one language. \n\n**Python** is the most commonly used language while dealing with AI, so it‚Äôs so surprised to me that with the AI boom of the last few years it‚Äôs being treated like that. It‚Äôs also an attractive language to new programmers because of its simple and clean syntax, and it‚Äôs long been used by data analysts for its ecosystem of data tools. \n\n**Rust** is well loved by its fans (myself included) because it has a lot of unique features which are really elegant once you learn to use them. If you‚Äôve never used a language which treats errors as values using Rust‚Äôs Result type feels like a whole new way of thinking about effects in programming. Pattern matching on Enums feels so much more elegant than using a switch statement. For me at least it contains so many tools you can use to ensure that ‚Äúinvalid states are unrepresentable‚Äù at the type level, which feels so powerful and means that when you code actually compiles it does exactly what you want far more often than in other languages. It‚Äôs also just very cool to see a program you write in Rust run 50-100x faster than the same program in Python. \n\nWriting Rust can be painful, and it‚Äôs often very slow going, because actually getting it to compile is difficult. Rust is the perfect language for places where you need to be really confident in the correctness of your code and also have very high performance, but not if building things with any speed is the priority. \n\nBut if you already know Java/Kotlin those are both great languages, no reason not to just keep working on those since you already have a head start. Go is also another very popular language these days.",

Programming consists of problem-solving (this step) and encoding the solution in code (the next one), among other things.\n\nCopying code does not teach you [problem solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving). It doesn't even teach you the encoding step, though it may help to refresh your memory. Therefore you will not be able to learn how to solve problems, which is at the heart of programming.

That isn‚Äôt information you would display necessarily *unless there was a specific reason to*\n\nBut there‚Äôs also stuff in code that displays every time you run it. Rain, sleet, snow, or shine, *this part of the code always displays and I can see it*.\n\nFocus on coding stuff you can see. That is where the dopamine release is. Then, once you get that, you get into the weeds.\n\nI coded on webpages using log statements until I was blue in the face. Then I realize if you try to write a lot using it, it looks crazy. And that‚Äôs *exactly how I found and learned about HTML*\n\nI‚Äôm not that good at coding at all, but wanted to share, because I vividly remember my first experience with JavaScript.\n\nWhat are you using to code?",

How are you supposed to know how to interact with the DOM in the way you want to without looking at the proper documentation? You don‚Äôt just know that stuff magically. If you want to learn web development your best friend is going to be https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ \n\nI personally would stay away from the bloated frameworks like React. Learn to do web development through vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML. Once you start getting to the point that you think to yourself, ‚Äúsurely there is a better way to do this‚Äù, you can start looking into things like Sass, HTML templating, etc. \n\nPersonally, my stack is JS (Fastify), Squirrelly, Scss, MongoDB, and Redis running on linode servers. If you want to learn web development I recommend going down this route. Start to add things on a need to have basis and don‚Äôt blindly follow things because it‚Äôs the latest trend. Get the fundamentals down first and then explore. It‚Äôs a process to learn these things and I am sure you are in no rush to push out a ‚Äúproduct‚Äù. Best of luck and don‚Äôt give up. Just because it doesn‚Äôt click immediately doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt possible. Learning to program is a long process and as someone who‚Äôs been working in industry for 4 years now with a non-CS degree, this is the path that helped me become a solid developer.",

To discuss them we abstract, we remove some of the details, and focus only on what we deem necessary. For instance we could talk about electrons moving between different atoms, or we could ignore the atoms, and abstract even higher and talk about electricity flowing.\n\nIn a computer we have the software that controls the hardware, decides how the electricity flows, but it is impossible to grasp all the details - most computers have billions of transistors that can turn on and off, so we ignore the details and talk about the CPU storing numbers in memory, and performing mathematical operations on those numbers. Our abstractions steadily climb higher and higher, moving further and further from the \"world just as it is\" with it's particles and whatnot.\n\nIn programming we talk machine code, binary patterns, on the lowest level, but again we ignore the details and use higher level languages, where creating a variable hides everything that really goes on. And so on and so forth. \n\nHigher means easier to talk about, because we ignore or hide the details.",

It involves registers (fast pieces of memory living on the CPU), memory, ways to move the data from memory to registers, and to use two registers to do some math or comparison operation (or other operations). \n\nYou're limited to the actual resources. But you can hide that from the user so they think they have an unlimited number of variables. Behind the scenes, the implementation moves the data between registers and memory giving you the illusion of unlimited variables.\n\nHigher levels of abstraction let you think far away from the actual implementation, usually in a mathematical sort of way, and hide the grungy details.

But you guys have no formal school system so you only know how to count but no writing and no ***higher math***.  \n\nSo one day you discovered that it seems like each T-Rex has about 32 teeth.  He realized this because you have been keeping them in holes near the camp ground with each hole teeth from one T-Rex.  And since you do not write and do not add, every time you go out to trade with other tribes you simply dig up one whole put everything in your dino purse and go.  You know it is enough but not how many.  But now you know ***through repeating the same thing over and over*** that it is about 32 teeth.  \n\nSo a hole is 32 teeth and you reasoned a dino purse from a hole is 32 teeth, so you decided to count purses in the future and stop worrying about the teeth and the holes.  \n\nThat is abstraction:  teeth -> purses.",

Knowing C suggests you potentially have a better understanding than many applicants on the underlying structure of programming languages, and that you're familiar with multiple languages that are quite different. Additionally, it shows you're able to pick the correct tool for the job, rather than just forcing a less-good language in.\n\nI'd be far more interested in hiring someone who knew JS/TS/C and a little bit of Rust/Golang, than the millions of people with JS/Python/PHP.\n\nAdditionally, for older languages, where there are less people using them, critical infrastructure still relies on them, with a smaller pool of applicants.

If you want to schedule an event at a future time, using UTC can result in the wrong local time, when timezone rules change (and that happens frequently around the world):\n\n[https://www.creativedeletion.com/2015/03/19/persisting\\_future\\_datetimes.html](https://www.creativedeletion.com/2015/03/19/persisting_future_datetimes.html)\n\nBut even outside of that, a universal \"prefer UTC\" rule doesn't work for every case. It sounds like for your particular app, you care most about the day in which something happened, according to the person who did an action on that day. The fact that an event happened at 8am for one user but was simultaneous with an event that happened at 9pm the previous day for a different user is NOT important to your app.\n\nThere's no single best answer. For your case, I think storing the local date in one column, local start time in another column, local end time in a third column, and timezone offset in a fourth might be one easy solution.\n\nThat would make finding all events on a particular day trivial. The only tricky thing might be if someone traveled across time zones in one day, but it would still handle that just fine. Everything would still be stored relative to the local day.",

Then, whenever you do a lookup or a calculation, you need to do so using the timezone rules of whenever the event was scheduled.",

There's so many frameworks available out there, it's difficult to decide,¬† but here's my 2 cents:\n\n\n- no-no: Qt framework, Xamarin, Ionic, React Native.

It's in its early stages,¬† and rough around the edges, but I see huge potential.¬†\n\n\n- best option: Flutter. For so many reasons, let me know if you want to know more.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, they all work in the same way: your code transpiles to cpp and h, and these are compiled vis cmake. Hence,¬† you may as well create your own.¬†\n\n\nWorth mentioning: mobile development is not just \"the app\", but the release train as well:\n\n\n- github workflows\n- fastlane\n- google play, apple dev portal and store connect\n- certificates and permissions (see in app purchases, keypass auth, etc etc)\n\n\nLet me know if I can help you further.¬†\n\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention something very important,¬† that will help you succeed as an engineer,¬† and not just a developer: architecture. Learn as much as possible about that. Most principles con be transferred to backend development,¬† and even lower level programming.¬†\n\n\nRead other people's code.

Write them as json files on disk and load them back.\n* Learn browser JS bare bones. Just a html file with script section.

(Doing that would require also updating every existing pointer to point to a different location, which would be super complicated.) The behavior shown in this example will be the same regardless of whether ASLR is on or off.\n\nThe answer is really simple: **the variables have different addresses because they're different variables**, even though they have the same name. They are defined in different scopes and their lifetimes don't overlap.\n\nYour code is exactly the same as if you had defined `a` and `b` in the \"if\" branch, and `c` and `d` in the \"else\" branch. In that case it wouldn't be surprising at all that `a` and `c` have different addresses.\n\nMore precisely, the variables are *allowed* to have different addresses. The C language compiler and the C language standard make no promises about the actual addresses that are used for different variables. (If you never use the `&` operator to look at a variable's address, it might never have an address at all -- it might be stored entirely in registers.) The actual results you get can depend on things like your compiler's optimization settings.\n\nIf you change your example to take the address of the *same* variable on both sides of a fork, you'll see that the memory addresses are identical: https://godbolt.org/z/xPvWanz1d\n\nBut even though the virtual addresses are the same, the fork causes them to point to different physical mappings. So changes in the parent won't affect the child, or vice versa. (It's slightly more tricky to make an example that demonstrates this, because it requires synchronizing the two processes so that one process tries to read memory *after* the other one writes it.)",

You are a beginner so its good to get experience with different tools or programing languages(obviously in the future you can specialize). Its good you have these interests and you should stick with them since that makes learning fun.\n\n1. Seeing as you like Python and want a good structured course, I would say start [CS50p on EDx](https://www.edx.org/learn/python/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-programming-with-python). It is free, asynchronous, and you get to practice Python by solving problem sets at your own pace. The class is run by Harvard(no need to apply) with a great professor and its basically the online version of the actual class. Its beginner friendly and I highly recommend this if you want to learn more about Python. I did this course before going to college and felt it aligned well with what I learned in my Python class(make sense since CS50 is also a college level class).\n\n2. Harvard has other course under \"CS50\" like one for AI, web dev, cyber security, etc that you can do after you get more familiar with coding. These are also free and you can check them out here: [https://www.edx.org/bio/david-j-malan](https://www.edx.org/bio/david-j-malan)\n\n3. You also say your like web dev so I definitely suggest checking out [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)(also free). This one more self learning you need to read about each topic on your own, but the content is curated(I am doing this and like the resources they provide so far). As for content the course goes over HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and in the advanced course more web dev tools like node.js or ruby(there are 2 advanced courses, choose a path you like).\n\n4. You can stick with the FreeCodeCamp¬†course as well, that is a good course and you should keep doing it. As you said \"like it better as there is more involvement and actual coding\" this is great that you get to do more hands on stuff.\n\n5. W3 schools is alright, you are definitely right to think the problem is you are just reading but are not applying any of the things you learn. As many people have said you learn by doing aka projects even if they are small or simple. The important part is you thought about what to type out and learned something during the process.",

To explain, CS50p will cover these topics week by week for 10 weeks aka 10 online lectures:\n\n1. functions,\n2. variables,\n3. conditionals,\n4. loops,\n5. exceptions cases,\n6. using libraries,\n7. unit tests file I/O,\n8. regular expression,\n9. Object-Oriented Programming & classes,\n10. recursion.\n\nThis is more about applying little programming technique week by week. Each week has a few problems to solve using and expanding on the skills you learned up to that point. These of course are not full projects, but still very good practice to learn skills in a controlled and friendly environment. They test problem solving skills as well which never hurts.\n\n# The Odin Project:\n\nThis has excellent projects and to clarify The Odin Project is for front end and back end. It has an introduction course teaching HTML, CSS, and Java Script. Then you can choose to learn ruby or node.js or both and these advanced course are at least 5-8x longer than the introduction course so plenty to learn.\n\nThe structure is:\n\n* You basically read a few curated lessons and external resources\n* Make a project which is a website such as:\n   * Basic HTML page\n   * Landing page with styling\n   * Making web page games or interactive pages after learning Java Script\n   * Even more advanced pages after learning more tools\n* This cycle of reading and making projects repeats itself. They have a discord to help you if you get stuck, but the course is pretty detailed/clear. Essentially there are many chances to make projects and if you feel comfortable you can make your own outside of the course.\n\nThis is heavily project based as you are given a general goal when you reach a project assignment. Other than that you just make your own website following the general theme or requirements. This is also self graded but with web dev its pretty easy to see how well you did by viewing your website based on content, design, and functionality. You also get to learn about version control through Git and Git Hub. This is great since now you projects will be on a repository that you can make public or private as you wish. Furthermore you can actually see your website live and deploy it. For the beginner course they just make these websites hosted on Git Hub, but in the advanced course they show others ways of hosting and using more advanced tools.\n\nIf you have more questions feel free to ask!",

I‚Äôm a big fan of ‚Äúsquash and merge‚Äù which just merges all the commits on a branch into one commit before merging that single commit. Then I‚Äôm free to just commit whatever with a message like ‚Äúalmost working!‚Äù because those commits will never end up in production branches anyway.\n\nThe point is that you‚Äôre free to commit whenever you feel like it. It‚Äôs better to commit too often than not enough because you will find it much easier to debug small, clear commits than ones containing thousands of lines or dozens of files.",

Popular choices are plain \"Visual Studio\" (not Code). I.e. VS Community or VS Professional.\n\nSee the page about tools, the C and C++ section: [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/tools/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/tools/)\n\nIf you don't want to use Visual Studio you can also try Qt Creator or Code::Blocks instead.

Unions don't prevent things like offshoring and very likely change the calculus toward offshoring as it becomes more of a pita to deal with the union. They won't protect against automation.  You can put baricades to people being fired but I've seen the real life consequences of that where you have people that do nothing and still cant be fired for ages which is not conducive to having high performing, efficient teams. Pay? There is a reason that other than guaranteeing minimum pay, continuing insurance on injury etc, sports unions have nothing to do with negotiating pay. The whole point of unions is that everyone gets paid \"fairly\" which usually means the same for given seniority. The groups where unions have made a significant difference in pay like nurses for instance, had extreme leverage (a lack of even remedially qualified replacements, and the requirement that duties are performed onsite). Unions just arent a great fit for tech jobs, especially with the increased ease of offshoring.",

        "body": "Economist here. Lots of misconception about things like full employment and your nubers are wrong.\n\nUnemployment rate which is people who are actively looing for work and do not have any work  is the sum of three different kinds of unemployment: frictional, structural and cyclical. These can each be defined as follows:\n\n* Frictional - labor market entry unemployment. This is essentially people like new grads, career break people, voluntary job quitters re-entering the workforce.\n* Structural - People who lost jobs due to structura changes specific sectors i.e. AI wiping out whole job  categories is a form of structural unemployment.\n* Cyclical - Unemployment due to movemetns in the business cycles (recessions/expansions) this is the one part of unemployment rate that can be negative.\n\nNatural Rate of Unemployment a.k.a. non-cyclical unemployment a.k.a. full employment level of unemployment a.k.a Non-Accelerating Inflation level of Unemployment rate is when you have zero cyclical unemployment. That is Natural Rate = Structural + Frictional Unemployment.  The government estimates this number its been trending down over time:\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NROU](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NROU)\n\nThis number has been tredning downwards since the 1970s nd right now its around 4.3 percent. This suggests we are rigth at full employment and any higher we are going to have a positive cyclical unemployment rate.\n\nFrom 2021 through 2023 we essentially had unemployment rate lower than the NAIRU meaning we had negative cyclical unemployment rate. That number has been gradually climbing towards the NAIRU through 2024 and if it keep growing we will have positive cylical unemployment (meaning unemployment because the economy isn't doing well).\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)\n\nNow why is this Sub-reddit going to feel  worse.\n\n1. Its clear something is happening with frictional unemployment rate. New College grades are having a harder time finding a job compared to anytime other than a out right recession. Some of it might be AI effecting entry level jobs etc. AI might make it harder to screen legitimate candidates. It might mean less entry level demand etc.  This is not the same thing as cylical unemployment because the assumption is that this is some kind of shift in full employment rate that is unlikely to go away if the economy is doing well.\n2. There is some degree of structural unemployment in tech. Tech overhired inthe pandemic. Take google: [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/number-of-employees](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/number-of-employees) They increased head count by 60 percent after the pandemic. They have now laid off about 10000 workers, but they still ahve 50 percent more workers than they did in 2019. Job posting rate on indeed indicates other companies did the same. Notice there were over 2 times more listings in the end of 2021 as there was before pandemic. Now in 2025 its about 60 percent of the pre-pandemic level.\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE)\n\n3. For young workers the job market feels worse, because people who graduated in 2024 or 2025, missed what was probably the best job market for all workers in decades, especially for tech. The last time the job market was this good for workers was probably in the 1990s. This means the people graduating now unfortunately are entering a world where the job market is getting worse and watched the people that graduate 1 to 2 years ahead of them enter the best job markets ever.\n\nAnyway I do think we are entering a recession. But the problem with recessions is that we don't officially know we are in a recession until after we are alrady in one. It tkaes at least 6 months of negative GDP growth for the NBER to decide if we are in  a recession. That means given the current environment the earliest NBER would declare recession is the beginning of April of 2026. \n\nJust for all you Gen Z kids, an economy exiting an actual recession doesn't mean the job market will get better. The 2008 recession ended by end of 2009, the unemployment kept rising for another year and took 6 years for the job market to get to the pre-recession levels. Meaning if you graduated college in 2009, you didn't see a job market better than before the recession until 2016. I can't predict if the next recession will be as severe as 2008 (hopefully not), but buckle up kids.",

        "body": "> It's also pretty easy to create a practical coding test in gitpod, and then do point-based scoring. But most managers never thought of that, nor attempted to do so. They take the easy way out. I had an interview just like this a month ago, it was interesting.\n\nI'm too late to the party, but here are my few comments. I am tipsy.\n\nI have been an occasional hiring manager/tech interviewer for last 15 years in companies of various sizes. From nough startups to couple of billions in current account. Disclaimer - I mostly mostly work in highly regulated backend area (gambling/fintech) as a senior/staff/principal.\n\n* In organisation of any size hiring manager has way less input into how we evaluate candidates than you would think. From the company perspective your CV requires at least a screening meeting (internal), chat with HR (yes, candidate looks promising!) and time slots from at least 2 seniors for at least 2 different meetings + EM meeting (position fit) + executive meeting (culture/ambitions fit).\n\n* * We cannot spend time on every single candidate. You really are asked to stand out to proceed, cost of hiring you approaches $100k in time commitment from everyone involved + another $100k for your onboarding. I must apologise, but that is what our in-house recruiters are responsible for.\n\n* Good companies do domain specific take home assignment with known gotchas (e.g. rounding issues, how to handle various dimensions depending on domain, performance considerations, ability to join two tables to start with, not even talking about various consistency scenarios). Yes, it sounds like unpaid work, but it is a fantastic filter between those that have a clue and those that copy paste from stack overflow. We are about to invest 12 months in you getting up to speed, we ask for 4-8 hours of you showing off your skills.\n\n* * These assignments usually are crafted with great care by rather highly paid engineers in the org. There can only be so many of them prepared, check glassdoor, it usually will spell out what you need to succeed.\n\n* LC is a good screener for 99% of candidates that couldn't code their way out of looking up data from users table. Anyone who displays awareness of constraints, different naming nomenclatures, jeez (here comes the dragons) - time zones ... or even utf8mb4 v utf8mb3... automatically a plus.\n\n* Always remember that we WANT TO HIRE YOU! Seriously! We wouldn't be hiring otherwise! What seems to be a field of obstacles is not meant to discourage you, but to make sure you get a face time with your peers whose opinion will really count. Please accept that if my week is 40 hours and every day i have 2 hours blocked for hiring (with 15 minutes before each meeting to research candidate background, 15 minutes afterwards to summarize my notes and provide feedback all while actually moving business forward...) Executive or EM discussion fail can very easily be overriden if 2 actual team members says \"5 stars, he/she/they will fit GREAT\".\n\n* Candidates should and will be treated equally. Ignoring cases where candidate had a nervous breakdown during interview (has happened, more than once. it's not a showstopper, it's a stop-the-interview and reschedule to start from tabula rasa. One of the few things big tech gets right is to dismiss outlier incidents), we do need to show that we care about results, not about gender, race, etc. And we are pretty objective about it. Except positive bias.\n\n---\n\nAs for your specific comment that most managers are bad. I used to think the same until I became an engineering manager. There's so fucking much politics and shoulder playing between teams and horse trading to just move ahead with the project that is our job to shield you from.\n\nYes, you think your ticket with specification and acceptance criteria is done and easy and you can just proceed. 50% of the time that feature is actually under a chopping axe because someone else in the company wants to take eventual credit for it / is unable to formulate where their API points are expected to be / knows that you are doing null work that will be discarded because corporate strategy has separate team working on replacement. Sucks, but not due to you and not due to your EM.",

I conducted over a dozen last month.\n\nFor the record, our interviews include some discussion with the candidate on their experience, a leetcode type question, and some system design. The leetcode question is not meant to be difficult, and we use something that is classified as easy or homegrown stuff that is similarly quite easy. One question we often use, for example, has a very trivial n^2 solution (literally try every pair of values and make sure the index of j is after i).\n\nWhen I am conducting interviews everything matters. It's not just a black and white do you solve the question and I check off the box. Here's a list of some things that I am looking at to make a decision that aren't just \n\n* How quickly do you start solving and how quickly do you solve it? Does it look like you've seen the question before? Does it look like someone else or AI is solving the question for you?\n* How well can you articulate what your solution is and how it works? Do you articulate what your approach to the question is before you write code or after?\n* If you run into problems, what do you do for debugging? Are you reading the error logs? Are you printing things to see?\n* If you are struggling with the question, do you ask questions? What kind of questions do you ask? How long does it take for you to ask a question when you're stuck?\n* Our question has one common pitfall (which is honestly quite obvious). Do you fall for this? If you do, when I explain what is happening, can you pick up on where you fell into that pitfall? Do I have to explain it very explicitly or can you pick it up?\n* Can you even code? Do you run into basic syntax problems? Do you know what help to ask me for on the syntax issues? Does it look like you barely even know how to code?\n* Are you cognizant of the time we have and what our expectations are?\n* I specifically ask the candidate two follow up questions every time the answer is solved: what is the runtime complexity and is your solution optimal. This helps me figure out what kind of more formal education the person has (because all of us remember studying big O notation, right?). This also helps me figure out if they're capable of scrutinizing their own code. It also helps me see how they tackle a problem that may not have an obvious answer (or even one at all).\n\nDon't conduct an interview with a question that doesn't have a purpose. In fact, don't do things that don't have at least half a dozen purposes. Everything I do has a purpose and helps me evaluate it. I have absolutely no problem letting you sit in silence for 10 minutes as you mumble to yourself about your solution, it will help me see how you think. Heck, if you want to sit there in silence and write no code and ask zero questions it will show me how collaborative you want to be (and I explicitly mention they're welcome to ask me questions, even to ask for help). I very intentionally do not use difficult questions because I very intentionally want to measure other things. I could care less if you remember how to invert a binary tree or the difference between Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms or any of that mumbo jumbo that, as you point out, will never be useful on the job. I do care if you can reason your way through something new and present a working solution, even if it means asking someone for help.",

You don't want to come off as misleading to the company, and maybe they'll be OK with a tech lead instead of a manager if you ask.\n\nIf the company's really gonna be a stickler about a manager as a reference, your tech lead probably won't fly. Yes tech leads are the people SWE's work closest with, but they're not people managers at the end of the day. If they call them, they're going to ask a lot of manager-oriented questions... probably including directly asking \"Were you X's direct manager?\" In which case your tech lead would need to both be comfortable lying for you, and good at lying.\n\nDefinitely don't ask someone for a reference that you don't know for a fact would give you a positive reference. So 1's not an option.\n\nI'd personally do 3. And I have done 3 several times in the past.\n\nThe fact I don't keep in touch and grab beers with my ex-managers doesn't mean our professional relationship disintegrates. We both still worked together, we both still have memories of each other, and we're both still professional connections.\n\nPut another way, if your ex-manager reached out *to you*, wouldn't you be happy to give them a reference? Why would they feel any differently?\n\nMy last job search I used a manager from 2 companies ago that I hadn't spoken a word to in 3 years. He was thrilled to give me a reference. We had a great working relationship. We don't keep in touch because we have different jobs now, our own families, our own friends... but our professional connection is still there.\n\nThe job search before that I reached out to a manager I haven't spoken to in 2 years. Same deal. Don't be afraid of reaching out to old connections, just like you'd hope all your ex-connections would feel comfortable reaching out to you.",

Never ever wait to start interviewing.\n\nIn some companies you might be able to survive a PIP but from what I've seen it's like a lottery. I know someone wins the lottery but I've never actually seen anyone win it - and I've never seen anyone survive a PIP in the industry. The PIP is the company being nice and giving you a heads up that you're fired. Take the hint.\n\nSecond, absolutely don't discuss the PIP in future interviews. I don't care what you say but don't say that. It would be better to say you got into a fist fight over text editors rather than you got let go because of a PIP.

If the manager is experience, he would know that it's hard to get someone like Mike, so there's no point in replacing you if you are already doing a good enough job.",

I wouldn't progress a candidate forward that did this. I'd prod them during the interview to hopefully get them speaking in case they were just nervous... but if that doesn't work, and the whole interview goes by without them explaining their thought process, running through examples, verifying their work, etc.... I'm not passing that person. \"Correct\" answer or not.\n\nI've passed plenty of people that did really good on communicating during the solving process, but didn't quite get the right solution, or got the naive solution. It's the solving process I'm paying attention to the most.\n\nThe knowledge section doesn't really jump out as suspicious to me... that sounds about right. When I'm not in interviewing shape, I usually can't just rattle off SOLID despite using its concepts daily. But when I'm interviewing, you can bet your ass I can rattle off a textbook definition of SOLID, because I prepare.\n\nDuring the knowledge section do you have a script you need to stick to? Couldn't you dig into asking for some examples, or to explain why they think that's the right answer, or explain alternatives? Ideally you want ways to gauge understanding beyond reading off a textbook answer, because memorizing SOLID is trivial. Understanding it is what you're looking for.\n\nThe raw dogging is suspicious.... but without being there, and without being able to ask them deeper questions myself, I couldn't say if they're cheating one way or the other.",

This could be tough and depends on your luck, the area, and if they are willing to take a risk. I did this route and was paid pennies lmao. But it gave me talking points during interviews and helped me embellish my resume. This is definitely better than putting some random job to prevent resume gap.\n\nOverall, I don't know how recent your grad graduated but for like the first 6 months or so, my suggestion is to keep on practicing for interviews and try to be the first few applicants and apply asap to new grad roles, tdp roles, and other rotational programs and hope that ATS doesn't screen his resume out. Then, all he has to do is not fuck up the interviews which is basically leetcode and behavioral like I did and he's in.\n\nIf that doesn't work out, then I think you really have to consider either masters or find other job like I did.\n\nHope this helps",

It‚Äôs very front loaded stock vest so first year or two will absolutely beat equivalent of google/meta/whatever, but it may cliff fast later on if you don‚Äôt perform well. So do well on performance reviews or try to get promo is your best bet to keep refreshers high.\n\nCompany: We are founded by ex google engineers and we are a tech first company meaning we pride ourselves in extremely innovative algorithms, scalable infra, SOTA ML (we publish a lot in top ml research conferences for a company our size). We are fundamentally different from other companies of similar or bigger size (e.g. etsy, ebay, etc) which do not care as much about their tech.\n\nLeadership: can‚Äôt comment on details. We are founded by ex googlers, but cofounder left the company recent years. Now VPs and C Suite (CEO is ex Google shopping VP) is all ex google burecrates who are more wallstreet persona supposedly. Not sure if its a good or bad thing but certainly still trying to expand/grow. We are more of a visual search and recommendation system for inspiration expanding into e-commerce and etc but new initiatives are being explored (or is it just wallstreet milking us? We never know)\n\n\nBut like others said: we are very hard to get an offer from (i feel like we are more picku than google sometimes). We mostly only hire ex faangs or equivalent. Even ex faangs get denied without interviews all the time. So try to get into the loop first and dont set expectations too high",

If you're not content with something, it gives everyone else an excuse to not be happy with it. Learn to be proud of your achievements.\n\nIf this doesn't vibe with you, my biggest advice is just leave big tech. There are many types of organizations that are much suited for your personality and you just need to find the right fit. If you can't find something that fits you, then you'd have to change yourself to fit it. The latter has always been a challenge in my 20 year career as well.",

This is a very valuable experience. Part of being experienced is having an intuition about what wouldn't work, or what would come back and bite you in future. Now you know what'd happen if you let the codebase deteriorate. It's very likely that other developers are not happy with the codebase either so I'd suggest getting other people onboard with a refactoring effort starting with creating a decent test suite to give you confidence to refactor. As much as I hate the hype, AI is amazing when comes to disecting/explaining the code and writing tests. And if you manage to do this, you'd have a HUGE success story.\n\nI'm yet to met someone who's happy with their codebase tbh.",

Usually, it's these:\n\n* Infrastructure/Networking\n* Application Orchestration\n* Observability\n* Internal Tools\n\nTo start, pick one to go deep into, and develop a passable understanding of the rest. You will accumulate a deeper understanding of everything over time, and gain an instinct for what you should understand (principles) and what you can discard (bitrotting technical details). Work with your manager to get projects in the specific pillar you want to gain expertise in if possible. If that's not possible, pick something else for now and come back to it.\n\nWhen you're working on stuff, take notes on things that you learn that could be helpful in the future. Do personal retros on particular projects/tasks that you struggled with and try to internalize the knowledge that you gained. This takes a lot of effort, and some of it may come after hours. That's why DevOps/SRE tends to get paid more though, so...swings and roundabouts.\n\nTotal honesty here: people will tell you that you don't need to be a hardcore techie to be successful, but if we define \"hardcore techie\" as \"someone who is really into understanding why systems behave the way that they do and is not content with just a surface-level understanding\", then not being one is absolutely career limiting in DevOps/SRE. Because of how fast the tech moves in the infrastructure space (while simultaneously breaking in ways that require an understanding of the underlying primitives - like Linux Networking), hunger and curiosity is a requirement. If I had to add another thing, it would be a deep appreciation for rigorous and disciplined engineering.\n\nAll that is to say - the amount of stuff to learn should bring you joy, not stress. If all it does is stress you out, it might be best to find a regular SWE job.",

Yeah, probably. But honestly, from what you've described, this seems like a systematic communication issue between the team. How large are the sprints? How large are the features that you're working on? Do they encourage you to talk to other teammates to get advice? Do they encourage you to find optimal solutions before implementing them? Or do they just want you to shit out a feature as quickly as possible before the Sprint ends? \n\nI went through something similar because I don't have a degree and every few months the imposter syndrome would hit me hard.

Even in my worst moments on the job, a feature would take 2 months max before management or a senior could clearly see that I was struggling and would step in to help, or pivot me to something else. This is another sign that this might be management and not you.

I don't think it's in your best interest to sit around and tell you that you're doing fine and that you're not struggling when you clearly are, so I won't. Chances are, you're part of the problem too. \n\n\\> I have been working in the same feature for at least 10 months now.\n\nThis is not good, if I'm being honest. Even in the worst places I've worked I've seldom actually seen a single feature take that long to finish without reasonable blockers. If the issue is genuinely \"I don't know how to do this\" then you and management both have issues. \n\nNo one typically just lets a feature story just creep for 10 months without bringing it up to either backlog it or give it to someone more capable. Not saying it never happens, it's just incredibly rare that it would go for so long without anyone checking. Especially if you work somewhere remotely credible or a start-up. \n\n\\> The last thing that happened that pushed me to the edge is that the manager asked a Senior to help me out with this feature and he just started asking a bunch of questions of the technical decisions I made and was ultimately confused and suggested we change a lot of stuff to make things right, basically saying that the last 9 months of work was poorly done by me.\n\nThis speaks to me that people are tired with your work and that you are not prioritizing your learning and improvement at all. You're telling me that you didn't update anyone on your work for 9 straight months? You didn't communicate with a single person on your team to get feedback on a PR or something? This sounds really unbelievable and I really doubt this story as being true. Whatever though, assuming it is true; I understand people are going to tell you that it's management's job or your senior's job or someone else's job to teach you and make sure that you're doing well but it's really a two way street. You also need to communicate to them properly, especially as an engineer with four years of experience. You're far beyond the point of being some baby junior who doesn't know how to get the job done, or at least you should be. \n\nIt's part of your job to make sure you're improving and actually getting better. If you're constantly bumbling into the same problems, constantly asking the same question, and constantly not able to get work finished, then you might have a motivation issue.",

So does your team actually need to produce a replacement? You say you're doing code reviews but how is that possible without requirements and a development plan?\n2. you say the team is oversized yet still drowning? Unless they're all completely useless that doesn't make much sense.\n\nThose inconsistencies aside, it seems clear why the lead position was open. Either the previous lead was incompetent and built the wrong team for the task, or they were setup for failure and that happened. Or they left on their own after either creating or being put in a failing situation. The cause doesn't really matter here, the vacancy is just a strong hint that this team is dysfunctional. \n\n I would start by having a 1:1 with your immediate boss (senior lead? director?) and be totally upfront about the issues. DO NOT SUGAR COAT ANYTHING. Tell them that you don't believe this is the right team for this project and need to rebuild.  Say \"The staffing on the team is not appropriate for the project.\" or something like that.\n\nIf your boss doesn't agree, then you have another data point on where the incompetence is that caused this mess. Schedule a 1:1 with your skip and repeat.\n\nThe key here is to be direct and back it all up with as much evidence as you can. I assume that you have had 1:1s with your new reports so you have some direct knowledge. Pull all their commits and review them. See if they're that bad or just complacent under the previous lead.\n\nGet your lead or your skip on board and then have HR start the separation process for all the dead weight engineers on your team. If you rebuild an effective and more efficient team and actually ship this project then you'll in a great position. If it goes south, then I don't think that just sitting around hoping for it to get better would have worked either.",

Never tell your boss or company that you're applying elsewhere. Any prospective employer will ask for permission before contacting your current employer, so really they should have no way of knowing unless you're publicly posting about it. Schedule interviews on WFH or PTO days, say you have an appointment, call in sick, etc.\n3. Again, no reason to try to hide your current employment. Just have an answer prepared for when they inevitably ask why you're leaving your current position. Never bad-mouth your current employer, that doesn't look good on you. Be honest or just say it was time for a change, you wanted a fresh challenge, exploring different fields, etc.\n4. Again for interviews just do whatever is necessary. It's 100% worth it to take a day off work or call in sick or make up some bs excuse. And if you've made it to the final stage, you know they're seriously interested in you and will accommodate for your schedule for interview dates/times.\n\nDo not tell your current job ANYTHING until you have a signed the new offer letter.

This was back in 2009 during the recession. The job wasn't really an SWE position either, was some kind of weird support gig that was supposed to lead to one.\n\nSecond layoff was June 2018, after several hops and it was the first startup I ever worked for. Landed my next job exactly a month after being laid off, like to the day. Got back into SWE full time in 2012 so at this point I had about 6 years of experience. The full interview process took about 2 weeks.\n\nThird layoff was in February 2023 and also only took about a month. VP told a bunch of us about a colleague of his that was hiring, I recognized the name as a recruiter I connected with at a conference about five years earlier. Pinged the recruiter on LinkedIn and got in the mix quickly. This one took about 1.5 to 2 weeks.\n\nFourth layoff was October 2024, and it took about a month to land my current gig. Went to a local user group meeting I hadn't been to in a couple years, which was having its first meeting in the offices of the place I now work for, also their last meeting of the year. One of their staff engineers was present and ended up sitting next to me. Struck up a brief conversation with him, we connected via LinkedIn, and I sent him my resume the following Monday. Took about two weeks from submitting my resume to getting the offer.",

If you want to expand the system you likely are doing it in Java.  Not every company has a microservice architecture where you can choose to simply write a new feature in Go.\n\nOn the other hand a lot of what would formerly be written in Java if the project is greenfield Go is becoming very popular.  I've worked at two places now that concurrently supported services written in either Java or Go.  The benefits of Go are pretty obvious since you don't need to allocate a giant arena for the JVM so cloud costs can usually get reduced using it.  So its become more attractive in that sphere.  If your company runs on bare metal that benefit doesn't really hold true.\n\nSo basically I'd say if you're looking to get a job in the near term Java is still the safer bet but I only see Go's usage increasing as time goes on.  Luckily Go is a fairly tiny language (which honestly gets people in trouble because they become expert beginners in it very quickly) so its pretty quick to learn.  You just need to learn some of the idioms of the language.  Though I typically don't really hammer people on the language during interviews anyways.  I can pretty quickly get a Java dev up to speed on how to write proper Go.",

If the tasks are sufficiently different from the job req, you might be able to collect unemployment if you leave the job, but I am neither a lawyer or expert in these laws.\n\nIf you want to bring this up to your manager in a professional way, you should acknowledge the assignments, assure him that you intend to perform your assigned duties to the best of your ability, but then directly tell him you are dissatisfied with this type of work and it does not match the expectations you had when taking the job.

        "body": "I'll echo the others - bait and switch happens all the time. It's happened to me a couple of times and I've unfortunately had to do that with some employees. \n\nA backgrounder on what maybe going on. I am sure given they were onboarding you in that position that the intent was to keep you there. A couple things could have happened. I don't have all the details on your particular situation but generically it can be:  (1) they really need someone to do the hardware/software integration and you're the new guy so you get to do it or (2) your performance may not be what they were looking for and they're trying you in this role because it's easier & a lot less expensive to reassign vs terminating. \n\nYeah, the second one stings and is a shitty move for the person affected. But it happens and that's often the rationale. I hired someone for a front end UI development job - had stellar references, had really good work in his portfolio, passed our coding exam - and their code quality in the first 90 days was really, really bad. Like do over with the help of a senior developer bad. IDK where we messed up in catching this but after a particularly disastrous demo with my co-founder and our sales team, we had to figure something out. He was a good guy and tried hard and asked for help. We didn't want to just fire this guy 90 days later. So we gave him very small features and a lot of customer support and operations which we needed (and were about to open a role for). \n\nThe big difference here is that I and my VP of Engineering had a call and explained why were making the role change. He was disappointed but okay with it. I think the big one here is your manager didn't have the stones to tell you why. I bet if he did, you still might be pissed or wanting to leave but at least you'd know. \n\nAlso, politically, this manager may have been told to fill that software integrator immediately by higher ups. Maybe sales is pissy because the integration isn't done or it doesn't work or whatever. He may not have had a choice. This is pretty common and may be a reason why he didn't want to tell you. Or he's a jerk or a coward.  \n\nHere's what you may want to consider: \n\n1. Have a conversation with your manager. Be friendly and open. Do not go in there loaded for bear about the job switch and presenting any kind of threat that you're going to leave. You don't have leverage. The manager could call your bluff and you're out a job. Just ask them \"hey, curious why the job role change? Is there a problem?\" And if you can hold your nose and do it, you can say something like \"I get it I'm helping out and I'd really like to get back to my other work. Can you give me an ETA or some idea of when that will happen?\".  Do not mention the other job openings, etc, etc - you're going to set yourself up for a fight that now your manager is going to feel like they have to win. \n\n2. If you don't like the answer, vote with your feet. Start looking for a new job immediately. Do a good job at your current role, keep quiet, and get out. I think you've already seen enough signs that this isn't a good company or manager to work for. These things tend not to get better. \n\n3. If your manager gives you a legit reason like \"upper management needs this role filed and you were the new guy/best choice\" or \"we need someone to cover this for 6 months\" then again you'll need to evaluate. You \\*might\\* get to back to your own role but I'll tell you that if you're filling a gap, people aren't going to want to move you. \n\nGood luck and happy to DM if you any questions.",

Right now it's pretty solid and largely untouched by the recent tech layoffs. It's hard to say where they will be 10 years from now but I think focusing on automation in general rather than any one specific technology or tool is a pretty safe bet. Obviously you have to start with just one tool, but try to grow from there. I got started with a no name consulting company that did nothing but RPA and at the time was strictly BluePrism. Lousy pay and a ton of travel (yes, that is a bad thing), but I got a lot of very high quality experience very quickly. With 7 years experience, I'm a lead dev at an oil and gas megacorp you have heard of. So it has paid off in the long run (so far at least). Incidentally, we will be hiring a few more senior RPA developers in the near future, but obviously someone starting just now won't make the cut.",

If you're confident that it's not medication worthy (it really doesn't sound that bad imo from what you've described) then I'd say try finding a hobby that really engages you that can help you take your mind off of work and reset when you're out of it. There's a reason so many senior+ engineers have hobbies like brewing, woodworking, carving, hunting, etc. that have nothing to do with computers. It helps reset the mind and relax a bit from the constant work state.",

You should use the STAR method as a framework without being too robotic of formulaic. It‚Äôs still a conversation. Also, it‚Äôs okay to shorten examples based on time; make sure to acknowledge the clock and be respectful of people‚Äôs time. For the question above you can do something like, ‚ÄúWhen I have a disagreement with someone I do [X]. I approach it this way because [X]. An example of me having a disagreement with someone is [X]. The outcome of [X] was [X] which I felt [X] way about because of [X].‚Äù Another approach maybe ‚ÄúI had a disagreement with [X] about [X] when working on this project. My approach to resolving it was [X] because [X]. The outcome was [X] which I felt [X] way about. I would do [X] differently in the future because of [X]‚Äù \n\nObviously I‚Äôm being very general here. Find a format/style that fits you and your regular speaking cadence; but yes, even if brief, you should mention examples of when you came into this scenario they‚Äôre asking about. If they ask about a scenario you‚Äôve never experienced you can say something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôve actually not experienced [X] but here‚Äôs what I would do based on a similar [X] experience I had.‚Äù Show you‚Äôre flexible, adaptable and have learned from previous experiences. Good luck OP!",

So if I'm asked \"How do you handle disagreement between yourself and another senior engineer?\" I would first state that I believe I'm a smart person and I believe I work with other smart people so I like to have a thoughtful 1-on-1 conversation and find the most optimal solution.

For those examples you listed like \"What do you do when you have a disagreement\" - you can absolutely start with your general approach and then back it up with a concrete example. That's actually stronger than just giving a theoretical answer because it shows you've actually dealt with these situations before.\n\nThe key is reading what the interviewer really wants to know. Questions that start with \"Tell me about a time\" or \"Describe a situation\" are screaming for STAR format. But questions about your general approach or methods can be answered by explaining your process first, then illustrating it with a real example if you have one. The goal is to prove you're not just talking theory - you've actually navigated these challenges successfully. Since you're prepping so thoroughly, you might want to check out [interviews.chat](http://interviews.chat) to practice handling these different question types and get real-time feedback on when to use STAR versus other approaches.

Three months of Spring Boot isn't going to cut it when you're competing against people with years of backend experience, so you need to show depth through personal projects and contributions to open source backend projects.\n\nThe interview rejections are happening because you can't speak confidently about backend concepts, architecture decisions, and real-world problem-solving in that domain. You need to get comfortable discussing database design, API architecture, caching strategies, and system scalability - topics that only come from hands-on experience. Consider targeting companies that value T-shaped developers or smaller startups where you can wear multiple hats, as they're more likely to let you grow into backend work. When you do land interviews, you'll need to navigate questions about your limited backend experience tactfully while highlighting your learning ability and the projects you've built - [AI interview prep](http://interviews.chat) can help you practice articulating your transition story and handling those tricky questions about experience gaps - I'm on the team that built it specifically to help people ace challenging interview scenarios like yours.",

Spent about 1 month reading, understanding, and *documenting* as much as I could. What‚Äôs the path of a regular request? What is each backend responsible for? I also drew a massive map in LucidCharts (whatever, pick your favorite drawing site) with arrows and boxes for the different backends and whatnot. I wrote 12 pages of documentation that is likely still being referenced today. \n\n2. Make sure to make absolutely clear how cooked you are. Right now, you are learning how to navigate and understand a large, unknown codebase. Inform your manager that whatever change they‚Äôre requesting will take over a month (or however much time) because you need to orient yourself and nobody can help you. It also helps to bring up that you are only here for a few months and want to help make sure that other engineers are able to make fixes after you‚Äôre gone. \n\n3. Try to figure out how to make changes, test, and receive feedback on those changes without bricking the system. For example, make custom endpoints/functions/whatever in the relevant backend that only you know of and use those to test logic before pasting it into the actual production code. It may even be good to inform your manager and seniors what error handling/logging currently looks like, and see if you can improve it. If making whatever fix is made impossibly difficult before this, let your manager/seniors know you need to be able to properly debug or you can‚Äôt make the fix. \n\n\nThis may seem sucky, but it was honestly an excellent learning experience for me. Although frankly, your situation seems worse than mine haha. \n\nYou have to be bluntly honest about how screwed you are for whatever deadline they‚Äôre trying to push for that fix. You‚Äôre an intern lol. Making fixes in an unknown, undocumented nightmare with shit logging and shit error handling would take anybody a lot of time.

What make me confused in my lead told me that there is no use for making charts or diagrams because it will be outdated anyway.\n\n\\- But I do think there is a sliver lining after this is I do learn a lot of stuff that SHOULD NOT BE DONE from this abomination of a codebase. When I first received this a raised some questions about it too like how things are not supposed to be returned but here we are.\n\nI hate their smug pikachu face when I tell them that ts gonna take me more time to understand and fix. I hated it more when I received a comment like \"You don't know how to debug?\"\n\nThank you once again.",

Spend a day or two writing a simple page with header, nav, main, section and footer tags. Test it with browser dev tools and add ARIA if you want. Then mess with CSS box model and Flexbox - build a nav bar or a card, play with padding, margin, justify-content, align-items. Throw in a couple media queries to see it adapt on mobile. Finally write tiny JS scripts: practice let/const, arrow functions, map/filter and build a responsive profile card that can toggle extra info on click.\n\nNext week dive deeper in JavaScript. Drop code snippets in console to watch scope and closure - make a counter function that holds private state. Then write a basic Promise example, chain .then/.catch, and convert it to async/await with a small Fetch demo from a public API. Finish by building a mini DOM project - make a todo list or quiz app where you dynamically create elements and wire up click or input listeners.\n\nI mapped this into an 8-week plan for you if you want the full thing: https://doable.diy/plan/472xh88yv3AikgXNaFkGPr",

In one response you admit to not knowing what job you want in the field so what does a cyber security job look like to you?\n\nGeneral advice is go for a computer science or IT degree. Computer science is theoretical and is the foundation of how software systems are built. That knowledge helps in a lot of ways. \n\nIT is generally learning about software and how it‚Äôs used in businesses. Depending on the university you may have more or less hands on/practice. You skip computer science theory for business courses and technology courses that teach you the software/hardware that businesses need to run their operations. \n\nCyber security is an umbrella term that addresses many areas of technology security. There‚Äôs also information security, which has a technology component but extends to more than tech. \n\nCertifications are generally vendor based and show that you understand a specific implementation of technology. They can be useful but you just have to get ones that matter to the domain you‚Äôre trying to enter. \n\nTruthfully though, cyber security is entry level for people with experience in the fields in which they attempt to secure. It‚Äôs hard for someone who hasn‚Äôt had practice in using a technology to understand some of its weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Not saying it‚Äôs impossible, but that it‚Äôs unlikely.",

That target isn't going to get bigger for looking at other internal opportunities that are presumably a step up in role or a better fit for your skills and interests unless they're completely unhinged in which case, you should consider that a win.  \nThe target on everyone's back is value vs budget. Value and performance are not 1:1 but related so keep your performance up and it won't matter. Now, if this becomes an ongoing pattern where you're jumping at every opening on every other team and being rejected or opting out, then you might make enough noise to affect your perceived value, so don't do that.",

        "body": "I hate to break this to you too: the stress of applying for external jobs is going to be WAY higher than navigating the social situation with your manager. \n\nThe key is to not set expectations about anything unless it benefits you. Telling your manager the you're not going to apply for any other internal roles doesn't benefit you and sets an expectation that you might have to break for something that actually does benefit you. This case seems fine to pivot, just avoid pigeon-holing future-you with unnecessary restrictions to fulfil expectations set by present-you when there's no gain.",
